30|$|All roots were dried on <b>absorbent</b> <b>filter</b> {{paper and}} then {{spread over a}} rectangular, transparent, plastic sheet so that no two {{segments}} touched. A scanner was used to scan the roots on the plastic sheet at a resolution of 300  dpi, and root images were recorded in TIFF format. Root length, area, and diameter were measured using CIAS 2.0 image analysis software (CID, Inc., WA, USA). Before roots were scanned, the scanner and software were calibrated with CIAS image standards for length and area. Root diameter classes were set at 0.1 -mm intervals. After scanning, the leaves, shoots, and roots were oven-dried at 70  °C for 48  h before being weighed. Root length and root biomass were obtained for individual seedlings. The specific root length and specific root area were obtained by dividing the root length and root area by the root biomass, respectively. The specific leaf area was obtained by dividing leaf area by leaf biomass.|$|E
40|$|Centrally stimulated {{sweat rate}} {{produced}} by graded exercise until exhaustion {{was compared to}} the local sweat rate induced by pilocarpine, often used as a sweating index for healthy individuals. Nine young male volunteers (22 ± 4 years) were studied in temperate environment in two situations: at rest and during progressive exercise with 25 W increases every 2 min until exhaustion, on a cycle ergometer. In both situations, sweating was induced on the right forearm with 5 ml 0. 5 % pilocarpine hydrochloride applied by iontophoresis (1. 5 mA, 5 min), with left forearm used as control. Local sweat rate was measured for 15 min at rest. During exercise, whole-body sweat rate was calculated from the body weight variation. Local sweat rate was measured from the time when heart rate reached 150 bpm until exhaustion and was collected using <b>absorbent</b> <b>filter</b> paper. Pharmacologically induced local sweat rate at rest (0. 4 ± 0. 2 mg cm- 2 min- 1) and mean exercise-induced whole-body sweat rate (0. 4 ± 0. 1 mg cm- 2 min- 1) were the same (P > 0. 05) but were about five times smaller than local exercise-induced sweat rate (control = 2. 1 ± 1. 4; pilocarpine = 2. 7 ± 1. 2 mg cm- 2 min- 1), indicating different sudorific mechanisms. Both exercise-induced whole-body sweat rate (P < 0. 05) and local sweat rate (P < 0. 05) on control forearm correlated positively with pilocarpine-induced local sweat rate at rest. Assuming that exercise-induced sweating {{was a result of}} integrated physiological mechanisms, we suggest that local and whole-body sweat rate measured during graded exercise could be a better sweating index than pilocarpine...|$|E
30|$|Optical {{nanostructures}} that emit {{visible light}} when excited by ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) photons have been extensively studied for applications that include bioimaging [1, 2], solar energy [3, 4], and optical gas sensors [5, 6]. Research {{on one of}} these nanomaterials, cerium oxide (ceria) nanoparticles, has shown that its material properties are extremely well suited for a lot of applications; ceria can be employed as the optical active agent in UV <b>absorbents</b> and <b>filters</b> [7], gas sensors [8], and bioimaging media [9]. Visible emission from either UV excitation (down-conversion) or IR excitation (up-conversion) can be obtained from ceria nanoparticles. However, both up- and down-conversion processes involve different physiochemical properties in ceria and optimization of each optical process via various nanoparticle synthesis and post-growth procedures tends to quench the efficiency of the other process.|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{applying}} passive diffusive samplers {{for research on}} air quality is simple, easy enough and requires no electricity. The operating principle of almost all passive samplers is based on chemical reactions taking place on <b>absorbent</b> (impregnated <b>filter</b> or grid). The pollutant absorption mechanism is based on passive diffusion through the gas diffusion layer to absorbent. The diffusion process {{can be explained by}} first Fick’s law described as a free movement of gases from the ambient air to a passive sampler. This movement depends on pollutant gradient. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the influence of an impregnating solution on the efficiency of diffusive samplers. The object of the study covers the triethanolamine (TEA) aqueous solutions of 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 50 %. The results obtained showed that 30 % and 50 % aqueous solution gave 68 % and 89 % relative error making the true meaning of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer testimony. Data on the passive samplers impregnated with TEA aqueous solutions having concentrations of 5 %, 10 % and 20 % are within definite 25 % uncertainty established by the European Union Directives.

40|$|Protection {{from the}} {{potentially}} damaging effects of shock loading {{is a common}} design requirement for diverse mechanical structures ranging from shock accelerometers to spacecraft. High-damping viscoelastic materials are employed {{in the design of}} geometrically complex impact absorbent components. Since shock transients have a broadband frequency spectrum, it is imperative to properly model frequency dependence of material parameters. The Anelastic Displacement Fields (ADF) method is employed to develop new axisymmetric and plane stress finite elements that are capable of modeling frequency dependent material behavior of linear viscoelastic materials. The new finite elements are used to model and analyze behavior of viscoelastic structures subjected to shock loads. The development of such ADF-based finite element models offers an attractive analytical tool to aid in the design of shock <b>absorbent</b> mechanical <b>filters.</b> This work will also show {{that it is possible to}} determine material properties’ frequency dependence by iteratively fitting ADF model predictions to experimental results. A series of experiments designed to validate the axisymmetric and plane stress finite element models are performed. These experiments involve the propagation of longitudinal waves through elastic and viscoelastic rods, and behavior of elastomeric mechanical filters subjected to shock. Comparison of model predictions to theory and experiments confirm that ADF-based finite element models are capable of capturing phenomena such as geometric dispersion and viscoelastic attenuation of longitudinal waves in rods as well as modeling the behavior of mechanical filters subjected to shock. ii...|$|R
40|$|In today’s society, it {{has become}} {{necessary}} to not only identify a terrorist participating in an attack, but determine what explosive was used and what {{the locations of the}} terrorist were prior to the attack. Such knowledge helps law officials determine if there are other credible threats, and link terrorists to each other and thereby identify potential terrorist cells. Much of forensic science depends on Locard’s Exchange Principle, which states that when two objects contact each other there is a transfer of material between them. It is therefore expected that when terrorists handle explosives, explosive materials will be transferred first to their hands, and then to other surfaces their hands touch. If the amount of explosive in these prints can be quantified, {{it may be possible to}} determine where a terrorist has been, and the order of events leading up to an attack. This study therefore aimed to quantify the amount of energetic salt residue found in consecutive prints of ammonium nitrate and potassium chlorate on three different surfaces (filter paper, polypropylene, and polyurethane). By collecting and extracting consecutive prints from surfaces, it was possible to quantify the amount of trace explosive material in each print using ion chromatography (IC). The trends in material deposited in consecutive prints were then compared to each other to determine the reproducibility of prints between people and on different surfaces. Results indicate both materials typically leave first prints in the amount of several hundred micrograms. Further, while most trials produced decreasing curves, occasional higher amounts were found in later prints. This indicates that occasionally aggregates of particles form and are deposited during printing. While reproducibility indicates that the roughness of the surface did not significantly affect the rate at which material was deposited, the sorption properties of the energetic salts and the surfaces may play a role in the amount of material deposited. This was determined because the highest amounts of the hygroscopic ammonium nitrate were found on the liquid <b>absorbent</b> <b>filter</b> paper surfaces, while the highest amounts of the ionic powder potassium chlorate were found on the electrostatically chargeable polypropylene surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this series}} of studies has been to examine palatal, buccal and labial minor salivary gland {{secretions}} in relation to age and gender and other factors and conditions that could have effects on the saliva. Further aims were to analyze minor salivary gland secretions in relation to feelings of oral dryness and dental plaque pH. The studies {{are based on the}} Periotron method, which measures minor fluid volumes collected in <b>absorbent</b> <b>filter</b> papers. The concentrations of proteins in the saliva samples, recovered from the filter papers, were also examined using ELISA techniques. The accuracy and variability of the Periotron measurements were evaluated (Paper I). Mucosal gland secretion rates were analyzed in relation to age and gender, common diseases and medications (Papers I and V), during oestrogen treatment (Paper II) and hyposalivation due to Sjögren’s syndrome or head and neck radiation (Paper III). The secretion rates were also related to denture wearing (Papers I and V), pregnancy (Paper V) and tobacco use (Papers I and V). The salivary concentration of IgA was examined in relation to various factors in Paper V, while albumin and lactoferrin were examined together with IgA in relation to hyposalivation (Paper III). Acidogenic microorganisms and pH in dental plaque after a sugar challenge were determined in hyposalivation subjects and matched controls (Paper IV). The results showed high accuracy for the Periotron measurements but large inter- and intra-individual variations in minor gland secretions. The secretion rate per mucosal surface area was highest at buccal sites and lowest at palatal sites. In the palatal mucosa, the secretion rate was higher at medial sites than at lateral sites. Age was not correlated to the minor gland secretion rates but was positively correlated to the IgA concentration. Women displayed lower minor gland flow rates and lower buccal saliva IgA concentrations than men. The buccal mucosal secretion rate was reduced during the use of diuretics and anti-hypertensive medication, while elderly women had an increased labial salivary secretion rate during oestrogen treatment. Subjective feelings of oral dryness were reduced with increased labial salivary flow. Individuals with removable dentures had a significantly higher secretion rate in palatal glands compared with those without dentures. Lower secretion rates and higher protein concentrations were seen in minor gland saliva during hyposalivation and this applied especially to irradiated subjects. Compared with their respective matched controls, irradiated patients had a more acidic plaque after a sugar challenge than the Sjögren’s syndrome patients. A low buccal gland secretion rate was correlated to increased plaque acidity in hyposalivation subjects. The number of acidogenic microorganisms had a more important effect on this acidity in the healthy controls. The present studies also showed that buccal gland secretion rates and IgA concentrations were positively correlated to whole saliva secretion rates and IgA...|$|E
50|$|Waffle-iron {{filters are}} used in {{industrial}} microwave processes. The many industrial applications of microwave energy include drying of food products and industrial films, heating, such as in polyurethane foam production, melting, rendering, sterilising, and vulcanisation. In high-volume production the process is continuous necessitating openings to the microwave chamber where the product can be fed in and exit. Steps {{need to be taken}} to prevent unsafe levels of microwave radiation escaping from these apertures which are often large to accommodate the product. It is usual to line the product feed ducts with microwave absorbent material for this purpose. However, the absorbed microwaves have a heating effect and this can be severe enough to damage the <b>absorbent</b> material. Waffle-iron <b>filters</b> are a useful alternative because the product can be passed between the filter's teeth. An ideal filter will reflect all the unwanted radiation rather than absorbing it so will not suffer from overheating. This {{is an example of a}} filter being used in a choke application. In some processes both techniques are used simultaneously. The waffle-iron is placed nearest the microwave chamber to first reduce the energy to a level which will not cause the absorbent lining to overheat. The absorbent lining then removes the small residue.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} simple, portable, relatively inexpensive apparatus for accurately and efficiently collecting, separating, testing, and even storing between about 1 - 20 ml, preferably about 1 - 10 ml, of blood or other bodily fluid in situ. The apparatus includes a collection chamber bounded on its sides by {{an opening in}} a sheet of material, preferably clear plastic, abutting a filter card. The filter card is made of fibrous material, preferably less than about a millimeter thick, having an average pore size of less than about 3 microns. Preferably, the fibers are glass and the fibrous material has an average pore size of about 1 micron. The fibrous material is treated with a carbohydrate/protein mixture which contains between about 1 - 40 percent wt/vol carbohydrate and about 0. 1 - 15 percent wt/vol nonspecific protein, preferably between about 10 - 20 percent carbohydrate and about 5 - 8 percent protein. A preferred carbohydrate/protein mixture comprises about 10 percent mannitol and about 6 percent albumin. The blood or other fluid moves through the filter card by capillary action aided by an absorbent matrix with a high Klemm factor which abuts the <b>filter</b> card. The <b>absorbent</b> matrix and/or <b>filter</b> card can be treated with {{a wide spectrum of}} test reagents. The speed, cleanliness, and efficiency of the separation process can be altered by: (a) changing the absolute concentration of the carbohydrate/protein mixture; (b) applying positive or negative pressure {{to one side of the}} filter; and/or (c) varying the relative density and pore size of the <b>filter</b> card and <b>absorbent</b> matrix...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{cerium oxide}} {{nanoparticles}} (CeO 2 NPs) have been intensively studied owing to their wide applications and unique properties in UV <b>absorbents</b> and <b>filters,</b> gas sensors, catalytic wet oxidation, catalysts in {{the fuel cell}} technology, engine exhaust catalysts, photocatalytic oxidation of water, NO removal, electrolyzers, solid electrolytes and so on (Goharshadi et al. 2011). It {{has been reported that}} the ability of CeO 2 NPs to express so many unique properties was mostly due to their ability to reversibly oxygenate and deoxygenate without disrupting the fluorite lattice-structure (Bumajdad et al. 2009). As rare metal, CeO 2 NP chemical configuration with 4 f orbitals buried inside the atom and shielded from the atom’s environment by the 4 d and 5 p electrons has also been seen as the main core of the expression of unique properties which is impossible with transition and main group metals (Hu et al. 2006; Bouzigues et al. 2011). According to Xu and Qu (2014), cerium atom can easily and drastically adjust its electronic configuration to best fit its immediate environment. Cerium oxide nanoparticles have also shown biological applications as they have been used as enzymes (e.g. superoxide oxidase, catalase, oxidase, etc.) and also as antioxidant or radical scavengers (Asati et al. 2009; Mandoli et al. 2010; Karakoti et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013). This unique nanoparticle has also been used to treat diseases such as oxidative stress-related diseases (e.g. neurodegenerative disorders), diabetes, retinal diseases, chronic inflammation and cancer (Maritim et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2006; Mariani et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2006; Federico et al. 2007; Hussain et al. 2012). Being a mature engineered nanoparticle with such unique properties and industrial applications, CeO 2 NPs health and environmental concerns have mostly been overlooked. Recently, CeO 2 NPs have been incriminated of being toxic to rats (Srinivas et al. 2011), freshwater alga (Taylor et al. 2015), human lung cells (Mittal and Pandey 2014), zebrafish (Arnold et al. 2013), and bacteria (Pelletier et al. 2010). Considering the above and through their lifecycles, CeO 2 NPs represent a major concern as they are likely to enter natural water bodies channeled via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (Aruoja et al. 2009). It is well-known that biological WWTPs consist of a series of biochemical processes, such as nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorus anaerobic release and aerobic or anoxic uptake engineered for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus as well as other pollutants. The performance of these processes {{is directly related to the}} activities of some key microorganisms present in the activated sludge. However, it is unknown how nCeO 2 NPs affect essential activities of these key microorganisms in activated sludge. Since activated sludge is the most widely used wastewater treatment option, the present study aimed at assessing the effect of nCeO 2 NPs to activated sludge microorganisms.|$|R
40|$|Since their {{discovery}} in the 1930 s, polymeric foams {{have been widely}} used in the industry for a variety of applications such as acoustical and thermal insulation, <b>filters,</b> <b>absorbents</b> etc. The reason for this ascending trend can be attributed to factors such as cost, ease of processing and a high strength to weight ratio compared to non-foamed polymers. The purpose of this project was to develop an “indestructible” material made of polycarbonate (PC) for industrial applications. Due to the high price of polycarbonate, two foaming methods were investigated {{to reduce the amount of}} material used. Samples were foamed physically in supercritical CO 2 or chemically with 5 -phenyl- 1 H-tetrazole. After thermal characterization of the foams in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we saw that none of the foaming methods had an influence on the glass transition of polycarbonate. Micrographs taken in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that foams obtained in physical and chemical foaming had different structures. Indeed, samples foamed in supercritical CO 2 exhibited a microcellular opened-cell structure with a high cell density and a homogeneous cell distribution. On the other hand, samples foamed with 5 -phenyl- 1 H-tetrazole had a macrocellular closed-cell structure with a much smaller cell density and a random cell distribution. Compression testing showed that polycarbonate foamed physically had a compression modulus a lot greater. Then, XLPE mesh 35 or 50 and wollastonite were added to the polymeric matrices to enhance the foaming process and the mechanical properties. DSC experiments showed that the addition of fillers changed the thermal properties of polycarbonate for both foaming methods by inducing a shift in glass transition. SEM revealed that fillers lowered the average cell diameter and increased the cell density. This phenomenon increased the compression modulus for polycarbonate foamed in supercritical CO 2. However, mechanical properties decreased for samples foamed with 5 -phenyl- 1 H-tetrazole due to their relative brittleness and the propagation of microcracks...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{urbanisation}} and {{the subsequent}} extensive use of the urban water system can lead to degradation of its surface water quality. In the Netherlands, urban water bodies often suffer from the manifestations of eutrophication due to (historically) high nutrient loadings. This research focused on the enhancement of surface water quality of semi-confined urban water bodies with a case study on a floating treatment system. Urban water bodies often function as amenities of the urban area. Their ornamental and ecological value depends {{on the state of}} their aquatic ecosystem. Excessive nutrient loading, leading to the collapse of the system’s biodiversity, turns a water body into a turbid state without submerged macrophytes. Restoration of the clear water state through reduction of nutrient loadings alone is hindered by hysteresis caused by the ecosystem relations and could be supplemented with an approach focused on increasing the system’s nutrient carrying capacity or an internal approach directly targeting the manifestations of eutrophication. The Bright Water Company floating helophyte filter actively drains a filter bed with bog plants growing in it. The influent of this biofilter is provided by free inflow of surrounding surface water. Its water treatment ability depends predominantly on filtration and adsorption by specific nutrient absorbents. Additionally, its inner reservoir serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Insights on the functioning and applicability of the biofilter were gained through in situ measurements. Two biofilter were applied in the Floresvijver in Groningen and measurements were conducted on influent, effluent and surface water. Visual observations and laboratory analyses of the water samples showed effective filtration and daphnia flourishing in the inner reservoir of the biofilter. Accumulation of the residual solids as a sludge layer on top of the filter bed and formation of biogas inside the filter material proved to reduce the hydraulic capacity significantly. Nutrient removal efficiency could not be determined with the monthly measurements of the water board but for optimal functioning of the phosphorous <b>absorbent</b> the current <b>filter</b> bed design should be adjusted while effluent samples indicated leaching of absorbent components. Application of the biofilter can contribute to the enhancement of urban surface water quality by increasing the nutrient carrying capacity of a water body. Especially in urban areas with various diffusive nutrient sources and physical constrains, the application of the biofilter can be efficient. Additionally, the biofilter functions as a habitat for zooplankton which are an important ecosystem element for the prevention of algae blooms. Furthermore, the effluent of the biofilter can provide a local increase in transparency and improve conditions for macrophyte development. The number of biofilters applied in a water body determine the significance of these contributions relative to the existing conditions.
