40|$|Ca-poor <b>amphibolites</b> are {{characterized}} by unusual mineral assemblages, {{and they can be}} related to different tectonic settings. In this work we describe the <b>amphibolites</b> that outcrop in the Arinteiro massif. In this massif, a great variety of litologies occurs among which <b>amphibolites,</b> garnet-bearing fine-grained <b>amphibolites,</b> Ca-poor <b>amphibolites</b> and calc-silicate rocks are the most abundant. In {{the first part of the}} paper we describe the different associations found both in the Ca-poor <b>amphibolites</b> and in the calc-silicate rocks ofthe Arinteiro massif. The mineral chemistry ofthe Ca-poor <b>amphibolites</b> shows a progressive impoverishment in calcium of the different associations. Previous works assigned the origin of this massif to hidrothermal alteration of an ophiolite. However, its structural position over the ophiolitic units, the probable linkage to shear zones and the calcium impoverishment, all point to a different origin for this massif, probably related to fluid circulation in shear zones, as it is proposed in the second part of this pape...|$|R

The Pb data from one outcrop of the central tholeiitic <b>amphibolites</b> lies on a 2. 7 Ga isochron with a low model. The other <b>amphibolites</b> (W komatiitic, E komatiitic, and E tholeiitic) do not define isochrons, but suggest that they were derived from sources with distinct histories of U/Pb. There is some suggestion that the E komatiitic <b>amphibolites</b> may have been contaminated by fluids carrying Pb from a long-term, high U/Pb source, such as the old granitic crust {{on the west side of}} the schist belt.

Lagkor Tso <b>amphibolites</b> show greater arc affinity, whereas those from Dong Tso <b>amphibolites</b> are more MORB-like. These characteristics are similar to basalts from continental back-arc basin settings. Hornblendes from the <b>amphibolites</b> dated by the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar single-grain laser fusion technique show similar metamorphic ages ∼ 170 – 177 Ma, which is interpreted to represent the timing of the main metamorphic event experienced in this region.

In addition to being relict, banding has also been produced by shear deformation, metamorphic/metasomatic segregation and, possibly, by lit-par-lit injection of plagiogranitic material. Non-banded <b>amphibolites</b> also occur as retrograde prod-ucts of noritic granulites forming the lopolithic Chilas complex. The chemistry of 37 rocks has been compared with those of known tectonic environments. The <b>amphibolites</b> have chemical characteristics similar to volcanic rocks found in island arcs and most of the analyses apparently support affinity with the calc-alkaline series.

40|$|On retrouve localement des <b>amphibolites</b> {{fortement}} foliées dans le mélange ophiolitique sous les massifs ophiolitiques de la Zone de Suture du Yarlung Zangbo (ZSYZ). Ces blocs représentent la partie supérieure d’une semelle métamorphique démembrée. La géochimie des <b>amphibolites</b> (La/Yb = 0. 65 - 0. 97, Ta/Th = 0. 33 - 0. 65) est similaire à celle des roches mafiques provenant de l’ophiolite, suggérant une origine dans le même bassin d’arrière-arc. Le métamorphisme de haut grade (P= 14 kbars, T= 800 °C) subit par les <b>amphibolites</b> suggère un enfouissement pendant la naissance d’une subduction. Les âges voisins des <b>amphibolites</b> et de la croûte ophiolitique (121 - 130 vs 120 ± 10 et 126 Ma, respectivement) suggèrent que la naissance de la subduction s’est déroulée dans le bassin arrière-arc Néo-Téthysien. Un tel événement n’avait pas encore été rapporté. La présence de dikes et le métasomatisme tardif responsable de la cristallisation de préhnite pourraient indiquer la subduction d’un centre magmatique. La composition en isotopes stables du fluide responsable confirmerait une telle hypothèse. Blocks {{of highly}} foliated <b>amphibolites</b> are locally {{found within the}} serpentinite matrix mélange underlying the Yarlung Zangbo ophiolites near Bainang and Buma, Xigaze area, Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone (YZSZ), Tibet. The mélange {{is thought to be}} the result of the tectonic dismemberment of the base of the ophiolitic napes during its obduction over the Indian passive margin, circa 50 Ma. Prior to dismemberment, <b>amphibolites</b> were probably parts of a coherent dynamothermal sole, as observed at the base of many ophiolites. Sampled <b>amphibolites</b> can be subdivided in three groups: garnet, banded and common <b>amphibolites.</b> Medium-grained garnet <b>amphibolites</b> contain the assemblage A) Hb+CPX+Gt+Pl±Rt and B) Gt+Hb+Pl (corona assemblage). Fine to medium-grained banded <b>amphibolites</b> contain the assemblage C) Hb+CPX+Pl+Ep±Sp+Qtz+Ap. Fine-grained common <b>amphibolites</b> contain facies D) Hb+Pl±Ep+Ap+Sp. In all assemblages, plagioclase is pseudomorphosed by an albite-prehnite simplectite. Retrograde cataclastic veins contain the assemblage E) Ab+Pr±Ch+Ep. The geochemistry of the garnet, banded and common <b>amphibolites</b> is very similar to the geochemistry of other mafic blocks in the mélange and of mafic igneous rocks within the ophiolitic massifs. When compared to MORBs, light depletion of LREE (La/Yb = 0. 65 - 0. 97) and mild HFSE depletion (Ta/Th = 0. 33 - 0. 65) would suggest a mixing between the IAT and MORB sources, as seen in back-arc basins and nascent intra-oceanic arcs. The <b>amphibolites</b> were buried at the inception of a subduction within the back-arc to peak metamorphism conditions of 11 - 14 kbars and ~ 800 °C. Ar/Ar analysis of amphiboles revealed a metamorphic age of 121 - 130 Ma, which is synchronous with ages obtained from the overlying ophiolites. Overlapping in ophiolite-sole age relationship reveals inception of the subduction near or at the spreading center from which originated the ophiolite. Subduction of a buoyant body could explain heterogeneous coronitization of pyrope-rich (up to 35 %) garnet by Al-Tschermakites (Al 2 O 3 up to 21 wt %) at high-pressures. After exhumation, <b>amphibolites</b> were injected by very fine-grained diabasic dykes and were subject to percolation of a prehnite-precipitating fluid. Oxygen stable isotopes suggest that a magmatic fluid is responsible for prehnite precipitation. The magmatic and metamorphic history of the dynamothermal sole and field relationships with adjacent units seem to indicate that most of Neo-Tethys oceanic domain was subducted along this new Late Cretaceous subduction zone...|$|R

They are intruded by pink to gray granites as well as ruby and green mica-garnet -tourmaline and beryl - bearing zoned pegmatites. Based on major element geochem., the schists are grouped into two categories viz., group- 1, the quartz- garnet- -biotite-muscovite schists which are characterized by low SiO 2 and alkalies, enriched in Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2, MgO and CaO, group- 2, the garnet- kyanite- staurolite- mica schist which are characterized by their higher SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 content and lesser amts. of Fe 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2 and CaO. The second group of schists compare well with the pelitic schists of Holcuarasipur schist belt. Garnetiferous <b>amphibolites</b> contain higher Fe 2 O 3 than those of non-garnetiferous <b>amphibolites.</b> <b>Amphibolites</b> are low- K tholeiites and sub-alkalic in nature and indicate a tectonic setting intermediate between oceanic and island- arc setting, characteristic of back - arc or marginal basins.

The earliest folds F1, apart from being tight and appressed occur in intrafolial positions and also constitute the rootless folds.

S1 schistosity is defined by hornblende and chlorite, and this mineralogical association suggests that the deformation occurred under upper greenschist to lower <b>amphibolite</b> facies conditions. The subsequent F2 resulted in refolding of S1 and transposition of S1 subparallel to the F2 axial trace. The most prominent planar structures are the discrete mylonitic foliation S2 attributed the regional NE-SW trending Bhavani shear.

Steeply dipping pre-emplacement fabrics record high-temperature (900 - 1100 degreesC) shearing and exhumation of the mantle peridotites apparently formed during localized NE-SW rifting in a pull-apart basin setting (c. 400 - 390 Ma). Associated oceanic rocks (Landewednack <b>amphibolites)</b> preserve a pre-emplacement prograde brown amphibole-bearing metamorphic assemblage and steeply dipping fabric thought to have formed as the newly formed oceanic crust was juxtaposed with newly exhumed hot mantle peridotite during NE-SW rifting.

25|$|The {{area around}} Tanganga geologically forms {{part of the}} Santa Marta Supergroup with main rock types {{metamorphic}} rocks as phyllites and <b>amphibolites.</b> The phyllites are overlain by the Ciénaga Marble. The greenish phyllites are rich in phyllosilicates, amphiboles and large crystals of pyrite, while the <b>amphibolites</b> contain quartzite veins showing stockwork patterns surrounded by muscovite. The contact of the two metamorphic facies is located within Taganga.|$|R
