5|$|G. Washington Coffee Refining Company was {{purchased}} by <b>American</b> <b>Home</b> Products in 1943, and George Washington retired. The purchase of the company, which was mostly held by the family, was in exchange for 29,860 shares (approx. $1.7 million) of <b>American</b> <b>Home</b> Products stock, {{at a time when}} <b>American</b> <b>Home</b> Products was in a period of intense buying, purchasing 34 companies in eight years. Clarence Mark, general manager of G. Washington, succeeded Washington in running the merged unit.|$|E

The makers of Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker <b>American</b> <b>Home</b> Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} secretary for the <b>American</b> <b>Home</b> Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer, with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.|$|E
5|$|The Joseph Priestley House was the <b>American</b> <b>home</b> of 18th-century British theologian, Dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher (and {{discoverer}} of oxygen), educator, {{and political}} theorist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) from 1798 until his death.

The house reopened in October 2009, still owned by the PHMC but operated by the Friends of Joseph Priestley House (FJPH).|$|E
