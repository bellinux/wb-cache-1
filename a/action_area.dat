30|$|Another {{approach}} is adopted for processing facial <b>action</b> <b>areas.</b> Although these approaches are not {{more popular than}} those based on local descriptors, this method category {{is also important to}} consider. Methods based on facial <b>action</b> <b>areas</b> use a series of facial landmarks, as discussed in [8] and [15] and use the active appearance model (AAM) [16] and the constrained local model (CLM) [15, 17] to encode shape and texture information, respectively. These approaches do not have the semantic gap problem, because they focus solely on the detection of mid-level facial <b>action</b> <b>areas,</b> which contain sufficient semantic cues. However, it is difficult to accurately detect landmarks (or defined action units) when facial expression varies, because these defined landmarks cannot completely address the many varied and complex expressions.|$|R
