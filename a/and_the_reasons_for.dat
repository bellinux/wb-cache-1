Dugard's essay examines censorship in South Africa within the country's legal framework. Also included in the book is the Director of Publications's communiqué stating its reasons for banning the book, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> lifting the ban three months later by the Publications Appeal Board.|$|E
5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> colonial {{behaviour}} {{are assumed}} to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.|$|E

5|$|Like most film {{adaptations of}} Dick's works, {{many aspects of}} his story were changed in their {{transition}} to film, such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Northern Virginia. The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film's action scenes. The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton's, {{and that of the}} three pre-cogs. In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased. Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively. The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts. Anderton's future murder <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog's mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film's ending also differs from the short story's. In Dick's story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings {{about the end of the}} organization. Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a punch card machine to interpret the precogs' visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.|$|E

25|$|If the use {{of these}} methods is impossible, or if their use did not reduce the {{concentration}} of harmful substances to a safe value, workers must use respirators. These respirators must be sufficiently effective, and they should correspond to known or expected conditions at the workplace. However, it is the least effective method of protection; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the decrease of their efficiency often are: non-usage of the respirators in the contaminated atmosphere; leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and face; and delayed replacement of gas cartridges.|$|E

25|$|During the Yayoi Era (400 B.C.E. – 300 C.E.), a {{great number}} of {{technological}} innovations occurred. Unlike the earlier nomadic Jomon people, the Yayoi emphasized having large community settlements and the cultivation of rice. Along with these, they learned how to cast bronze and iron in order to create various metal objects such as weapons, mirrors, and several tools. Among the bronze objects, dotaku, one of the most distinctive objects of the era, were created. In recent years, dotaku have been studied by researchers in order to decipher their origins, how they were created, their various purposes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the images on the main body.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{first met}} Democratic presidential {{candidate}} John Kerry {{in the spring}} of 2004, and was one of several names considered for the role of keynote speaker at the party's convention that summer. Obama was told in early July 2004 that he was chosen to deliver the address, and he largely wrote the speech himself, with later edits from the Kerry presidential campaign. Delivered on the second night of the DNC in just under 20minutes, the address included both a biographical sketch of Obama, his own vision of America, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> his support of Kerry for the presidency. Unlike almost all prior and all subsequent convention keynote addresses, it was not televised by the commercial broadcast networks, and was only seen by a combined PBS, cable news and C-SPAN television audience of about nine million. Since its delivery, several academics have studied the speech, both for the various narratives it describes as well as its implications for racial reconciliation.|$|E
