5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in hospice facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
5|$|The German Army entered Vilnius on 24 June 1941, as part {{of their}} {{invasion}} of Russia in World War II. After their arrival, Gens was put in charge of the Jewish hospital. The occupying authorities ordered the creation of the Judenrat, or Jewish Council, with community-selected members. In early September 1941, the Germans murdered most of the Judenrat, which left the Jewish community leaderless before and during the relocation of the Jews into two ghettos in Vilnius. During this period, the hospital sheltered several prominent Jews from Vilnius. When the ghettos were formed, the Jewish hospital was included {{within the confines of the}} larger ghetto, an unusual arrangement for a Nazi-period ghetto. Most ghettos were organized to exclude any Jewish hospitals, forcing the inhabitants to either do without <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> set up a makeshift one.|$|E

25|$|Continuous {{integrated}} triage is {{an approach}} to triage in mass casualty situations which is both efficient and sensitive to psychosocial and disaster behavioral health issues that affect {{the number of patients}} seeking care (surge), the manner in which <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> healthcare facility deals with that surge (surge capacity) and the overarching medical needs of the event.|$|E

25|$|An {{emergency}} department (ED), {{also known as}} an accident & {{emergency department}} (A), emergency room (ER), emergency ward (EW) or casualty department, is a medical treatment facility specializing in emergency medicine, the acute care of patients who present without prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an ambulance.

25|$|A nursing {{course is}} a 50/50 split of {{learning}} in university (lectures and examinations) and in practice (supervised patient care within <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> community setting). Nursing courses usually take three years and are 4,600 hours in length, which is split 50%/50% between theory and clinical placements as set out as a requirement of the NMC. Graduate courses are provided and are two years in length. Graduate courses often require prior learning and relevant healthcare experience; this {{can be referred to}} as APEL (Accreditation of Prior and Experiential Learning).|$|E
25|$|The patrimonial {{dependency}} (dependencia patrimonial) of <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> (<b>or</b> {{other health}} care facility) is the individual or other juridical entity that owns, at least, the building occupied by the facility. Hospitals that are under the dependency of Spanish Social Security belong primarily to the General Treasury of Social Security, {{although there is a}} special group within Social Security for the Mutuals of Accidents and Occupational Diseases (Mutuas de Accidentes de Trabajo y Enfermedades Profesionales, MATEP). There are also a few cases where patrimony is shared by two or more public entities on a consortium basis.|$|E
25|$|The {{high rates}} of {{mortality}} were not all due to combat. As was common before antibiotics were developed, disease caused more deaths than war wounds. Bad food and poor sanitation contributed to disease among troops and civilians. Among the Brazilians, two-thirds of the dead died either in <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> on the march. At {{the beginning of the}} conflict, most Brazilian soldiers came from the north and northeast regions; the change from a hot to a colder climate, combined with restricted food rations, may have weakened their resistance. Entire battalions of Brazilians were recorded as dying after drinking water from rivers. Therefore, some historians believe cholera, transmitted in the water, was a leading cause of death during the war.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all of the}} TNF inhibitors, {{infliximab}} is {{an expensive}} medication, costing about US$900 for a 100mg dose, and within the United States is covered by almost every medical insurance plan (though caps on many plans {{make it possible to}} be covered for only a subset of treatments {{in the course of a}} year). Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> office setting. For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric inpatients {{are people}} {{admitted}} to <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> clinic to receive psychiatric care. Some are admitted involuntarily, perhaps {{committed to a}} secure hospital, or in some jurisdictions to a facility within the prison system. In many countries including the USA and Canada, the criteria for involuntary admission vary with local jurisdiction. They may be as broad as having a mental health condition, or as narrow as being an immediate danger to themselves and/or others. Bed availability is often the real determinant of admission decisions to hard pressed public facilities. European Human Rights legislation restricts detention to medically certified cases of mental disorder, and adds a right to timely judicial review of detention.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 and 2010, {{much more}} {{substantive}} {{changes were made}} to the law, {{one of the most important}} of which was to begin an open enrollment period for those receiving subsidized health insurance and anyone buying insurance, including those paying full price, as an individual. Prior to that 2010 change, under the Massachusetts law, residents buying healthcare insurance individually could do so at any time, evenâ€”theoreticallyâ€”as being admitted to <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> entering an emergency room. This led to a gaming of the system and research by the state said this gaming added 1%-2% to premium costs, which were continuing to rise for other reasons as well. Given the continuing overall rise in premiums post Massachusetts 2006 healthcare insurance reform, the major goal of the 2012 amendment was to introduce price controls on health care itself; it is not directly related to healthcare insurance as are the earlier legislative actions.|$|E

25|$|The ritual book on {{pastoral}} {{care of the}} sick provides three rites: anointing outside Mass, anointing within Mass, and anointing in <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> institution. The rite of anointing outside Mass begins with a greeting by the priest, followed by sprinkling of all present with holy water, if deemed desirable, and a short instruction. There follows a penitential act, as {{at the beginning of}} Mass. If the sick person wishes to receive the sacrament of penance, it is preferable that the priest make himself available for this during a previous visit; but if the sick person must confess during the celebration of the sacrament of anointing, this confession replaces the penitential rite A passage of Scripture is read, and the priest may give a brief explanation of the reading, a short litany is said, and the priest lays his hands on the head of the sick person and then says a prayer of thanksgiving over the already blessed oil or, if necessary, blesses the oil himself.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{hospitals}} on {{the island}} of Maui. The first, Maui Memorial Medical Center, is the only acute care hospital in Maui County. It is centrally located in the town of Wailuku approximately 4 miles from Kahului Airport. The second, Kula Hospital, is a critical access hospital located on the southern half {{on the island}} in the rural town of Kula. Kula Hospital, along with Lanai Community Hospital (which is located in Maui County but on the neighboring island of Lanai), are affiliates of Maui Memorial Medical Center. All three hospitals are open 24/7 for emergency access. Although not technically <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> emergency room, Hana Health Clinic (or Hana Medical Center), located in the remote town of Hana on the southeastern side of the island, works in cooperation with American Medical Response and Maui Memorial Medical Center to stabilize and transport patients with emergent medical conditions. It too is open 24/7 for urgent care and emergency access.|$|E
25|$|Pertinent up-to-date, {{confidential}} {{patient information}} {{is converted to}} a written text document by a medical transcriptionist (MT). This text may be printed {{and placed in the}} patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>or</b> who work at home as telecommuting employees for the hospital; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.|$|E
