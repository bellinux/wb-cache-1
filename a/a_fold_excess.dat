40|$|Graduation date: 1964 As {{part of a}} {{continuing}} study of sulfur containing non-aqueous solvents, the present investigation was undertaken {{in an effort to}} obtain {{a better understanding of the}} solvent sulfuryl chloride. The primary object of the investigation involved a study of the rate of radiochlorine exchange between sulfuryl and thionyl chloride in mixtures of the two, the radioisotopic tracer chlorine- 36 being used. The principal motivation for such experiments rested in the hope of being able to find some evidence relative to the possible significance of an ionic dissociation process for sulfuryl chloride. The system was of particular interest in presenting analogies to at least two related types of systems previously studied, namely the thionyl chloride-thionyl bromide system (where rapid radiosulfur exchange was observed) and the thionyl chloride-sulfur monochloride system (where negligible radiochlorine exchange occurred). The system was further of interest in the light of the previous observation of a rapid chlorine exchange between sulfuryl chloride and the solute pyridinium chloride (in chloroform solution). Another point of some pertinence related to the fact that earlier research had shown that, between these two substances, little if any radiosulfur exchange occurred, and the suggestion had been made that a rapid radiochlorine exchange might result if the two substances interacted in an acid-base type of ionization equilibrium, thionyl chloride acting as a basic, chloride ion donor. It was found in this work that radiochlorine exchange between thionyl chloride and sulfuryl chloride was, at best, very slow, with an exchange half time, t 1 / 2, of at least 35 days or more. The rate of the exchange did not appear to vary greatly, at least in apparent order of magnitude, over the concentration range from <b>a</b> five <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> of sulfuryl chloride to <b>a</b> two <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> of thionyl chloride, the value of the order of magnitude at 25 °C being 10 ⁻¹ g-atoms 1 ⁻¹day⁻¹. The obtaining of precise rate data was, however, hampered both by the extreme slowness of the reaction and by the considerable difficulty in a clean cut reactant separation at the end of each experiment, a factor which resulted in a large and rather irreproducible apparent zero time exchange. A single experiment was done investigating the radiochloride exchange between sulfuryl chloride and the initially labeled solute tetramethylammonium chloride.

40|$|Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit konnte ein multivalenter Rezeptor auf Basis von Guanidiniocarbonylpyrrolen zur Komplexierung von biologisch relevanten (poly) - anionischen Substraten wie Citrat, Malat und Tatrat dargestellt werden. Der Rezeptor bindet Citrat selbst in Gegenwart eines 1000 fachen Überschusses an NaCl und einem 10 fachen Überschuss an Bis-tris Puffer mit einer hohen Bindungskonstante von KAss = 86000 M- 1 in Wasser. Wenn man Rezeptoren auf Metall- und Boronsäurebasis nicht berücksichtigt, handelt es sich nach meinem Wissen um den besten Citrat-Rezeptor, der in der Literatur bisher publiziert ist. Außerdem zeigt der Rezeptor mit einem Faktor von {{mindestens}} 8 eine hohe Selektivität für Citrat gegenüber anderen biologisch relevanten Dicarboxylaten wie Malat und Tatrat. Mithilfe von Bindungsstudien und Molecular Modeling Rechnungen konnte hergeleitet werden, welchen Einfluss die verschiedenen nicht-kovalenten Wechselwirkungen auf die Bindungskonstante haben. Dabei konnte gezeigt werden, dass Flexibilität, Hydroxy-Funktionen, pi-Stacking und Symmetrie bei den Substraten Einfluss auf die Bindungskonstanten zeigen, wobei vor allem die unpolaren Wechselwirkungen und die zusätzliche Hydroxy-Funktionen einen hohen Anteil an der Bindung zu haben scheinen. Neben der selektiven Erkennung von Citrat durch den Rezeptor konnte zusätzlich ein Sensorsystem mit Carboxyfluorescein auf Basis eines indicator displacement assays entwickelt werden, mit dem die Anwesenheit von Citrat im Gegensatz zu anderen Carboxylaten mit dem bloßen Auge (naked eye) erkannt werden kann. Neben den Polycarboxylaten zeigt der Rezeptor außerdem noch hohe Bindungskonstanten für polyanionische Zucker. So konnten z. B. für Glucophosphate mit UV-Spektroskopie Bindungskonstanten von KAss = ca. 20000 M- 1 in dem sehr polaren Lösemittelgemisch 10 % DMSO/Wasser (pH = 4, Acetat-Puffer) gefunden werden.

Furthermore receptor shows a high selectivity with a factor of at least 8 for citrate against other biologically relevant dicarboxylates like malate or tartrate. With the aid of binding studies and molecular modeling calculations could be determined, which influence the different non covalent interactions have on the binding constant. It was demonstrated in this way, that flexibility, hydroxyfunctions,pi-stacking and symmetry of the substrates have a major influence on the binding constant. Especially unpolar interactions and interactions with the hydroxy group seem to play a major role in the binding mode. In addition to the selective recognition of citrate with the receptor a sensor system with carboxyfluoresceine based on an indicator displacement assay (ida) could be developed. With this ida it was possible to detect citrate in contrast to other biologically relevant substrates with the naked eye. Furthermore the receptor showed high binding constants for anionic sugars.

40|$|The terminally bound nitrido ligand of manganese(V) {{porphyrin}} complexes {{serves as}} a good bridging species in electron transfer processes. Thus, the nitrogen atom of a porphyrinatomanganese nitrido complex was reversibly transferred to porphyrinatomanganese(II), in a formal three-electron redox process. Evidence is presented that supports an inner-sphere mechanism for this process. The coordinating solvent, tetrahydrofuran, decreased the rate constant for this reaction by three orders of magnitude compared to that observed in the noncoordinating solvent, toluene. The number of redox equivalents exchanged in nitrogen atom transfer processes can be varied from three to two by choosing the appropriate reductant such as a porphyrinatomanganese(III) chloride complex. Evidence is presented to support a mechanism for the reaction between porphyrinatomanganese nitride and porphyrinatomanganese chloride which involves prior dissociation of the chloride ion before {{the formation of a}} [mu]-nitrido species.

We recently reported an association between functional polymorphisms in FAS (- 1377 G [...] >A) and FASL (- 844 T [...] >C) and risk of oesophageal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of these polymorphisms to risk of developing lung cancer. METHODS: Genotypes of 1000 lung cancer patients and 1270 controls were analysed by PCR based restriction fragment length polymorphism. Associations with risk of lung cancer were estimated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared with non-carriers, there was <b>a</b> 1. 6 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> risk of developing lung cancer for carriers of the FAS - 1377 AA genotype (odds ratio (OR) 1. 59, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 21 to 2. 10; p = 0. 001), and 1. 8 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> risk (OR 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 26 to 2. 52; p = 0. 001) for carriers of FASL - 844 CC.

Gene-environment interaction of FAS or FASL polymorphism and smoking associated with increased risk of lung cancer was also found. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with our initial findings in oesophageal cancer and further support the hypothesis that the FAS and FASL triggered apoptosis pathway plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|New results confirm earlier {{findings}} {{on the importance of}} tiemannite acumulation on speciation and inter-tissue relationships. It is hardly surprising that, as opposed to what was concluded earlier, major inter-regional differences in Hg accumulation can be demonstrated when comparing several populations of harbour porpoise on an age corrected basis. Important inter-species differences, probably depending on prey choice, are found, even after correction for "relative age". Regional differences are more important than the inter-species variability, at least within both classically described sub-orders of cetaceans. Based on actual estimates of MeHg exposure and tissue concentrations of Hg and MeHg in harbour porpoise from the Southern North Sea, Hg detoxification through precipitation of tiemannite is evaluated to neutralise on average 12 % of the overall MeHg intake at age 7. Based on the idea of <b>a</b> 3 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> in toxicity of mercury over selenium and a 5 to 15 molar concentration excess of selenium over Hg in fish, Hg seems to play the major part in the mutual detoxification. The formation of tiemannite was previously described as resulting from a two-step accumulation mechanism appearing at a threshold level of Hg 100 g/g fw in liver. The reaching of an equimolar Hg to Se ratio can, however, be fully explained by the gradual increase of tiemannite levels in liver only. The new view is that molar Hg to Se hepatic ratios go towards equimolarity along with the slow nature of the tiemannite detoxification process, with tiemannite gradually taking the upper hand over MeHg, IHg 2 + and a surplus of "free" selenium with the increase of the total Hg load.

Positron Imaging Tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows quantification and visualization of biochemical processes by monitoring the distribution of molecules labelled with positron imaging isotopes. We aimed to develop a methodology for noninvasive PET imaging of Kupffer cell status in liver. Methods: Our strategy was to target CD 206 receptor that selectively takes up mannosylated albumin. Thus mannosylated albumin (mHSA) was synthesized and coupled to radionuclide- 18 F. Thereafter the pharmacological properties of this radiotracer were explored in a range of pre-clinical models including cells and wistar-rats. Whole-body PET images were acquired 30 / 60 minutes after injection of 5 - 15 MBq of radiotracer-[18 F]B-mHSA. Results: Hepatic uptake at 30 and 60 min was high whereas accumulation in the kidney was even higher, due to metabolism in liver and renal clearance. Blocking studies with <b>a</b> 20 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> of unlabeled tracer revealed saturable tracer uptake. In immune-related organs such as the bone-marrow, spleen, and liver radio-tracer uptake was highest at 30 minutes post injection and decreased thereafter. Ex-vivo biodistribution indicated lowest tracer uptake in non-target organs. Tracer uptake reaches a plateau in 45 min for RAW cells and in 60 min for murine Kupffer cells. Conclusions: [18 F]B-mHSA is readily labelled, is stable in plasma and displays binding affinity for the CD 206 receptors. This method allows quantitative and non-invasive imaging of liver function by using expression of the Kupffer cell specific CD 206 receptor with special interest in liver toxicity and the early events leading to liver fibrosis...|$|R

40|$|Overfeeding puppymilk replacers in German Sheperd puppies and the {{possible}} development of skeletal diseases. The nursing period is a critical period in puppies and should not always considered without any problems. Sometimes is it not possible for puppies to receive natural mother milk, {{which is supposed to}} be the golden standard and is of high quality and constant in composition. As a result, breeders must decide to raise their puppies on puppy milk replacers, which contain a different amount of nutrients including calcium. Several other researchers have published that a high calcium content in food can cause skeleton disturbances and enostosis, especially in young growing large breed dogs. The aim of this research is to analyse 10 different puppy milk replacers and get an overview, by interviewing German Shepherd breeders, of the quantity they give to their puppies them during the nursing period. With this data we figure out how much calories, nutrients and minerals such as calcium, phosphor and vitamin D puppies take up when feeding these powders. This research was carried out among 57 German Shepherd breeders and the results show that during the first 3 weeks of life puppies can take in 3. 5 as much calcium and up to 4 times as much phosphorus if fed on energy basis in comparison with Adkins research of the natural composition of bitch milk. But with the actually amount of given puppymilk replacers, the puppies calcium excess can be much more. In some casus breeders fed much more puppymilk replaces than necessary, if fed in a high amount, pups have the possibility of <b>a</b> 7. 8 <b>fold</b> calcium <b>excess</b> on day 1.

As well the owner plays an important role in giving too much of a puppy milk replacer in combination with bitch milk and dry food. So precaution must be taken if used for a longer period, because young dogs have an inefficient calcium regulation which allows them to take up the high calcium content.

Pharmacological properties of [18 F]FB 18 mHSA were investigated by ex vivo biodistribution and blocking studies at 30, 60 min (n= 5). A 60 min dynamic PET imaging studies with arterial blood sampling were performed in rats after injection of ~ 15 MBq of [18 F]FB 18 mHSA (n= 5). Results [18 F]FB 18 mHSA was stable rat plasma in vitro, but showed significant metabolism in vivo (16 % parent at 60 min). Radioactivity in blood decreased from the first time-point (10 sec) onward. Ex vivo biodistribution showed hepatic uptake was high (SUV 11. 4 ± 2. 4 (mean±SD) at 30 min; SUV 8. 9 ± 3. 3 at 60 min), as was accumulation in the kidney (SUV 24 ± 7), due to metabolism in liver and rapid clearance of radioactivity from the blood pool via renal-urinary route.

40|$|Dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) is the {{terminal}} enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of norepinephrine. The enzyme is a monooxygenase and functions to insert a hydroxyl {{group on the}} beta carbon of dopamine to yield norepinephrine. Physical and chemical methods were employed to examine structural features of the enzyme, and the contributions of various amino acids to the catalytic activity were investigated with chemical modifying agents. No free sulfhydryl residues were detected upon titration of DBH with 2 -chloromercuri- 4 -nitrophenol. Reaction with iodoacetamide caused a time dependent loss in activity. The activity change was correlated {{to the loss of}} approximately three histidine residues. Methionine reaction was also observed. Reaction of DBH with diethylpyrocarbonate or diazonium tetrazole resulted in the inactivation of the enzyme within fifteen minutes. Modification with either reagent was slightly pH dependent over a range of pH 4. 5 to 8. 0. Analysis of the diethylpyrocarbonate reacted DBH indicated a loss of one to two histidines per DBH monomer. No tyrosine or lysine modification was observed with this reagent. Inactivation of DBH with diazonium tetrazole resulted in the extensive modification of tyrosine and lysine residues. The activity loss observed with diazonium tetrazole appeared due to general denaturation of the enzyme. Incubation of DBH with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, methyl acetimidate or dansyl chloride was carried out to investigate the involvement of lysine residues in enzyme catalysis. Dansyl chloride caused a time dependent loss of activity, completely inactivating the enzyme at <b>a</b> 500 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> of reagent over DBH monomers. The other reagents had little effect on DBH activity. DBH was found to bind the fluorescent dyes anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and fluorescein. The binding of ANS had no effect on the catalytic competence of DBH, while the binding of fluorescein caused the inactivation of the enzyme. The reaction of DBH with low excesses of fluorescamine resulted in the production of fluorescently labeled active enzyme. No significant difference spectra were observed upon incubation of labeled enzyme with substrates or effector compounds...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of a recombinant alpha-amylase from Bacillus halmapalus alpha-amylase (BHA) {{has been investigated}} using circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This alpha-amylase is homologous to other Bacillus alpha-amylases where previous crystallographic studies have identified the existence of 3 calcium binding sites in the structure. Denaturation of BHA is irreversible with a Tm of approximately 89 C, and DSC thermograms can be described using a one-step irreversible model. A 5 C increase in T(sub m) {{in the presence of}} 10 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> CaCl 2 was observed. However, a concomitant increase in the tendency to aggregate was also observed. The presence of 30 - 40 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> calcium chelator (EDTA or EGTA) results in a large destabilization of BHA corresponding to about 40 C lower T(sub m), as determined by both CD and DSC. Ten <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> EGTA reveals complex DSC thermograms corresponding to both reversible and irreversible transitions, which possibly originate from different populations of BHA:calcium complexes. The observations in the present study have, in combination with structural information of homologous alpha-amylases, provided the basis for the proposal of a simple denaturation mechanism of BHA. The proposed mechanism describes the irreversible thermal denaturation of different BHA:calcium complexes and the calcium binding equilibrium involved. Furthermore, the model accounts for a temperature induced reversible structural change associated with calcium binding...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{expression}} and purification Xenopus histones were essentially expressed, purified and refolded as described previously (Andrews et al., 2008; Luger et al., 1997). Point mutations for spin labeling and crosslinking sites were introduced using quick-change PCR (Stratagene). Spin labeling of histones {{was carried out}} as in (Bowman et al., 2010). Briefly, refolded tetramers containing H 3 Q 125 C and H 4 R 45 C mutations were reduced with 10 mM dithiotheitol (DTT) in refolding buffer (2 M NaCl, 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7. 5, 1 mM EDTA) before being isolated from misfolded aggregates on a 10 / 300 Superdex S 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), which additionally served to remove reducing agent before labeling with <b>a</b> 10 <b>fold</b> molar <b>excess</b> of S-(2, 2, 5, 5 -tetramethyl- 2, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-pyrrol- 3 -yl) methyl methanesulfonothioate (MTSL).

40|$|Section 1 reports {{studies of}} the structure, bonding, {{isomerism}} and acetylene cyclotrimerization in the tris(alkyne) metal complexes [W(C 2 R 2) 3 (CO) ]. Extended Hückel calculations show that the acetylenes are good π-acceptors and that carbons which are proximal to the axial CO ligand have a greater build up of negative charge. X-ray crystallographic studies of [W(PhC≡CPh) 3 (CO) ] (4) and [W(PhC≡CPh) 3 (NCMe) ] (8) indicate that the W-C alkyne bonding is stronger in (8) due to increased π-back donation to the acetylenes. The compound [W(PhC≡CMe) 3 (CO) ] (5) {{has the potential for}} rotational isomerism. 1 H and 13 C NMR studies indicate the mixture with 3, 2 or 1 phenyl groups in the proximal position in the ratio 35 : 55 : 10. This is in general accord with our electronic prediction. Cyclotrimers of PhC≡CPh and PhC≡CMe have been identified by X-ray crystallography from either oxidative reactions of (4) or in the thermal synthesis of (5). This is the first report of such trimerizations in the tungsten system. Section 2 describes optimization of the oxidation of diphenylacetylene. by the catalyst system Co(OAc) 2 / NaBr/Mn(OAc) 2 in the ratio 1 : 1 : 0. 02. Using 95 % AcOH / H 2 O at 70 °C, <b>a</b> five <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> of substrate gave 84 % benzil within 7 hours. The rate of oxidation and the selectivity towards the dicarbonyl or cleavage products are strongly affected by the cobalt and manganese catalysts, sodium bromide, solvent and the concentration used. Oxidation of a variety of internal and terminal alkynes has also been investigated. Of key interest is that oxidation of 4 -octyne gave EtCOC≡CPr in 93 % yield. Thus the C≡C triple bond is unmodified by the oxidation which converts one α-CH 2 group to a CO keto functionality. The excellent yield and remarkable selectivity of this reaction may render it useful in synthetic applications. Two different mechanistic pathways are implied by our results on tolane and other substrates, one is thought to be REDOX based and the other to involve hydrogen atom abstraction...|$|R
40|$|Retinoblastoma is {{the most}} common eye cancer in children. Numerous {{families}} have been described displaying reduced penetrance and expressivity. An extensive molecular characterization of seven families led us to identify the two main mechanisms underlying these phenomena: i) mosaicism of amorphic mutations; and ii) parent-of-origin-effect of hypomorphic mutations. Somatic mosaicism for RB 1 splicing mutations (c. 1960 + 5 G>C and c. 2106 + 2 T>C) leading to a complete loss of function was demonstrated by high-depth NGS in two families. In both cases, the healthy carrier parent (one with retinoma) showed a mutation frequency lower than that expected for a heterozygous individual, indicating a 56 - 60 % mosaicism level. Parent-of-origin-effect is a mechanism by which the phenotypic impact of an allele depends on the parental origin. An imprinting mechanism justifying <b>a</b> ~ 3 <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> of the RB 1 maternal canonical transcript has been previously described. As a consequence, hypomorphic mutations, if maternally inherited, may retain sufficient suppressor activity to prevent tumor onset. In five low-penetrant families we identified paternally inherited hypomorphic mutations in the affected members, namely a deletion resulting in the loss of 37 aminoacids at the N-terminus (c. 608 - 16 _ 608 del), an exonic substitution with a “leaky” splicing effect (c. 1331 A>G), a partially deleterious substitution (p. Arg 661 Trp) and a truncating C-terminal mutation (c. 2663 + 2 T>C). The identification of these mechanisms changes the genetic/prenatal counseling and the clinical management of families, raising to a 50 % the recurrence risk for unaffected carriers, offspring of RB 1 -mutated mothers, and imposing the need for second tumor surveillance in unaffected carriers at risk of developing adult-onset cancer such as osteosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma...|$|R

40|$|The wide {{distribution}} of the uridine nucleotide-activated P 2 Y 2, P 2 Y 4 and P 2 Y 6 receptors suggests a role for UTP as an important extracellular signalling molecule. However, direct evidence for UTP release and extracellular accumulation has been addressed only recently {{due to the lack}} of a sensitive assay for UTP mass. In the present study, we describe a method that is based on the uridinylation of [14 C]-glucose- 1 P by the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase which allows quantification of UTP in the sub-nanomolar concentration range. The UTP-dependent conversion of [14 C]-glucose- 1 P to [14 C]-UDP-glucose was made irreversible by including the pyrophosphate scavenger inorganic pyrophosphatase in the reaction medium and [14 C]-glucose- 1 P and [14 C]-UDP-glucose were separated and quantified by HPLC. Formation of [14 C]-UDP-glucose was linearly observed between 1 and 300 [*]nM UTP. The reaction was highly specific for UTP and was unaffected by <b>a</b> 1000 <b>fold</b> molar <b>excess</b> of ATP over UTP. Release of UTP was measured with a variety of cells including platelets and leukocytes, primary airway epithelial cells, rat astrocytes and several cell lines.

Extracellular UTP and ATP increased 10 fold in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Detection of UTP in nanomolar concentrations in the medium bathing resting cultures suggests that constitutive release of UTP may provide a mechanism of regulation of the basal activity of uridine nucleotide sensitive receptors...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the thyroid hormones on target cells are {{mediated}} through nuclear T 3 receptors. In the peripheral nervous system, nuclear T 3 receptors were previously detected with the monoclonal antibody 2 B 3 mAb in all the primary sensory neurons throughout neuronal life and in peripheral glia at the perinatal period only (Eur. J. Neurosci. 5, 319, 1993). To determine whether these nuclear T 3 receptors correspond to functional ones able to bind T 3, cryostat sections and in vitro cell cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) or sciatic nerve were incubated with 0. 1 nM [125 I]-labeled T 3, either alone to visualize the total T 3 -binding sites or added with <b>a</b> 10 (3) <b>fold</b> <b>excess</b> of unlabeled T 3 to estimate the {{part due to the}} non-specific T 3 -binding. After glutaraldehyde fixation, radioautography showed that the specific T 3 -binding sites were largely prevalent. The T 3 -binding capacity of peripheral glia in DRG and sciatic nerve was restricted to the perinatal period in vivo and to Schwann cells cultured in vitro. In all the primary sensory neurons, specific T 3 -binding sites were disclosed in foetal as well as adult rats. The detection of the T 3 -binding sites in the nucleus indicated that the nuclear T 3 receptors are functional. Moreover the concomitant presence of both T 3 -binding sites and T 3 receptors alpha isoforms in the perikaryon of DRG neurons infers that: 1) [125 I]-labeled T 3 can be retained on the T 3 -binding 'E' domain of nascent alpha 1 isoform molecules newly-synthesized on the perikaryal ribosomes; 2) the alpha isoforms translocated to the nucleus are modified by posttranslational changes and finally recognized by 2 B 3 mAb as nuclear T 3 receptor. In conclusion, the radioautographic visualization of the T 3 -binding sites in peripheral neurons and glia confirms that the nuclear T 3 receptors are functional and contributes to clarify the discordant intracellular localization provided by the immunocytochemical detection of nuclear T 3 receptors and T 3 receptor alpha isoforms...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} by the Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM, project no. 08 RDTMFRC 650) of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, Ireland. Complexes of α-lactalbumin and oleic acid have previously been shown to be cytotoxic to cancer cells. In this study oleic acid is replaced by the more soluble sodium oleate and complexes of α-lactalbumin and sodium oleate are formed. Dynamic light scattering results showed that there was a small linear increase in the particle size of α-lactalbumin when it was titrated with sodium oleate. The fluorescence spectra of α-lactalbumin showed a linear increase in the emission maximum when sodium oleate was added up to a molar ratio of 8 – 11 oleate molecules per α-lactalbumin. Differential scanning calorimetry results show that the thermal unfolding of α-lactalbumin is altered by the presence of the sodium oleate. There is a decrease in size of the endothermic peak of apo α-lactalbumin when sodium oleate is added. The temperature at which unfolding occurred decreased for both apo and holo α-lactalbumin. FTIR measurements showed no significant effect of sodium oleate in the amide I region of the α-lactalbumin spectrum indicating the presence of oleate has little or no effect on the secondary structure of α-lactalbumin. The interactions between α-lactalbumin and sodium oleate/oleic acid are pH dependent, turbidity and dynamic light scattering measurements showed that the association between the two was optimal between pH 6. 0 and 8. 0.
