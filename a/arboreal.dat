5|$|The <b>arboreal</b> {{hypothesis}} was popular in Heilmann's day, even {{prior to his}} research, {{as it had been}} advanced by Marsh. It fell out of favor following Ostrom's research in the 1960s and 1970s, which suggested that the ancestors of birds were fast–running bipedal animals, lending credence to the cursorial model. The focus shifted back to the <b>arboreal</b> model when several Chinese non–avian theropods from the Early Cretaceous were found in the early 2000s. These new finds, represented chiefly by Epidendrosaurus and Microraptor, have been described as possessing features that indicate an <b>arboreal</b> lifestyle; Microraptor even has flight feathers on its legs, which suggest it was a glider. While the <b>arboreal</b> hypothesis is still popular in modern times, there are several proponents of the cursorial model and no consensus has been established. Adherence to the <b>arboreal</b> model is shared both by paleontologists who accept the dinosaurian ancestry of birds, and by the minority who still believe birds to have evolved from a non-dinosaurian group of reptiles. Although the <b>arboreal</b> model was somewhat popular before Heilmann's research, his writings helped to advance and popularize it and the idea continues to have a hold.|$|E
5|$|A few insects use gliding flight, {{without the}} use of thrust. It is found in some species of <b>arboreal</b> ants, known as gliding ants.|$|E
5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) <b>arboreal</b> quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast <b>arboreal</b> quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the <b>arboreal</b> (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|Ants and {{termites}} may {{compete with}} each other for nesting space. In particular, ants that prey on termites usually {{have a negative impact on}} <b>arboreal</b> nesting species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Arboreal</b> carton nests of {{mangrove}} swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change {{is caused by}} bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their faeces as a carton building material. <b>Arboreal</b> termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Azhdarchoidea mostly {{contained}} terrestrial pterosaurs. Tapejarids are {{an exception}} in being considered <b>arboreal</b> omnivores, feeding heavily on vegetation, but possibly also on small insects and vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Old World flycatchers are a {{large group}} of small {{passerine}} birds native to the Old World. They are mainly small <b>arboreal</b> insectivores. The appearance of these birds is highly varied, but they mostly have weak songs and harsh calls.|$|E
5|$|The New World warblers are a {{group of}} small often {{colorful}} passerine birds restricted to the New World. Most are <b>arboreal,</b> but some are more terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores.|$|E

5|$|The Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata), {{also known}} as prehensile-tailed skink, monkey-tailed skink, giant skink, zebra skink, and monkey skink, is an <b>arboreal</b> species of skink endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago. It is the largest known extant species of skink.|$|E
5|$|The {{family has}} adapted {{to most of}} the {{habitats}} available on the planet. These species may be <b>arboreal,</b> terrestrial, or semi-terrestrial. Various species also inhabit savannas, grasslands, deserts, temperate woodlands and forests, mangrove forests, and even the barren sands and gravels of atolls.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally <b>arboreal.</b> The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an <b>arboreal</b> lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an <b>arboreal</b> or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.|$|E
5|$|The wood warblers are a {{group of}} small often {{colorful}} passerine birds restricted to the New World. Most are <b>arboreal,</b> but some like the ovenbird and the two waterthrushes, are more terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores.|$|E

5|$|All {{specimens}} {{from the}} NKMNP were caught {{above the ground}} in vegetation, suggesting that the species is <b>arboreal</b> like {{the other members of}} its genus. The chigger Eutrombicula batatas has been found on O.sydandersoni. Nothing else is known about ecology, behavior, diet, reproduction, or conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} <b>arboreal</b> land snails. Further {{information}} concerning the habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails have generally been collected while they were crawling on trees or shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E
5|$|<b>Arboreal</b> animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many <b>arboreal</b> species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some <b>arboreal</b> animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to <b>arboreal</b> species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on current}} fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species {{seem to have}} led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are <b>arboreal</b> (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been <b>arboreal</b> as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved {{on the ground is}} key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E
5|$|Being highly <b>arboreal</b> and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary forest with large fruiting trees, where they {{spend most of their}} time in the upper canopy. By {{spending}} the majority of their time in the crown of tall forest trees, they are relatively safe from predators such as the fossa.|$|E
5|$|Ground-dwelling frogs {{generally}} {{lack the}} adaptations of aquatic and <b>arboreal</b> frogs. Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs such as Couch's spadefoot (Scaphiopus couchii) have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a keratinised tubercle {{often referred to}} as a spade, that helps them to burrow.|$|E
5|$|Like other catarrhine primates, Saadanius was {{probably}} a tree-dweller (<b>arboreal).</b> During the time it would have lived, the Red Sea had not yet formed, and new {{plant and animal species}} would have been arriving from nearby Eurasia as it converged with the Afro-Arabian landmass.|$|E
5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} <b>arboreal,</b> {{with only the}} ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are highly specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E
5|$|Many frogs have webbed {{feet and}} the degree of webbing is {{directly}} proportional to the amount of time the species spends in the water. The completely aquatic African dwarf frog (Hymenochirus sp.) has fully webbed toes, whereas those of White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea), an <b>arboreal</b> species, are only a quarter or half webbed.|$|E
5|$|Nests may be {{protected}} from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture. Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an <b>arboreal</b> species that lives in plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside. Camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|Oecomys sydandersoni is an <b>arboreal</b> {{species of}} rodent in the genus Oecomys. It lives in forest patches {{in a small}} area in eastern Bolivia. It is a {{medium-sized}} species, weighing about , with mostly grayish and brownish fur and short and broad hindfeet with well-developed pads.|$|E
5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving <b>arboreal</b> mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are diurnal and <b>arboreal</b> quadrupeds, often {{observed}} leaping {{through the}} upper canopy of the seasonal tropical rainforests in eastern Madagascar. They {{are also the}} most frugivorous of the Malagasy lemurs, {{and they are very}} sensitive to habitat disturbance. Ruffed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups and have a complex and flexible social structure, described as fission-fusion. They are highly vocal, and have loud, raucous calls.|$|E
5|$|Some species build complex nests called polycalic nests; this {{habitat is}} called polycalism. Polycalic species of {{termites}} form multiple nests, or calies, connected by subterranean chambers. The termite genera Apicotermes and Trinervitermes {{are known to}} have polycalic species. Polycalic nests appear to be less frequent in mound-building species although polycalic <b>arboreal</b> nests have been observed in a few species of Nasutitermes.|$|E
