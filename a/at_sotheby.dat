The artist later supported a state bill in California that did become law, the California Resale Royalty Act of 1976. Rauschenberg took up his fight for artist resale royalties after the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his art collection in a 1973 auction, including Rauschenberg's 1958 painting Thaw that he had originally sold to Scull for $900 but brought $85,000 at an auction <b>at</b> <b>Sotheby</b> Parke Bernet in New York.|$|E

5000|$|In 1891 West Dean {{became the}} home of newly married William (Willie) Dodge James and Evelyn Forbes the {{daughter}} of Sir Charles Forbes, a Scottish aristocrat. [...] William James had inherited great wealth from his father, American born Liverpool based merchant Daniel James. He bought West Dean from Frederick Bowers, a merchant who had owned the property {{since the death of}} its previous owner, Caroline Mary (Peachey) Vernon Harcourt (1785-1871). She had inherited the estate when her brother, Henry John Peachey, 3rd Baron Selsey died in 1838. Caroline was the wife of Rev. Leveson Venables Vernon Harcourt, son of Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, Archbishop of York. [...] In her will she had bequeathed West Dean to a distant relative, Ulick de Burgh, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde, who immediately sold it to Frederick Bowers. [...] Clanricarde also disposed of several other properties left to him by Caroline plus the extensive library housed at West Dean, the sale of which took nine days <b>at</b> <b>Sotheby,</b> Wilkinson and Hodge and included a copy of John Gower's rare Confessio Amantis that sold for £670.|$|E

5000|$|Once {{again in}} Paris he was {{received}} maître in 1720 and was appointed an orfèvre du Roi. Much of his output was to royal commissions, including {{a number of}} presentation swords given {{to the likes of}} Marshal Foch and Alain Porée, Captain of the Corsairs. His most spectacular surviving piece, a surtout de table on a hunting theme, with dogs and horns and putti, was begun in the years 1729-31 for the tax-farmer Samuel-Jacques Bernard but remained unsold at the time of Germain's death, when it was sold in 1757 to the duke of Aveiro, who took it to Portugal; it is conserved in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon. Germain's covered tureens were spectacular; the world's record auction price for a single piece of silver was achieved by a silver tureen by him, stamped for 1733, which was sold <b>at</b> <b>Sotheby</b> New York in November 1996 for US$10,287,500. He made a pair of tureens for Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, to designs by Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier in 1735 that Henry Hawley has said [...] "represents the apogee of the French rococo" [...] (Hawley 1997).|$|E
