5|$|American crows are the {{new world}} {{counterpart}} to the carrion crow and the hooded crow. Although the <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> and the hooded crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls are different. The <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> {{to be considered a}} nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> provides by eating insect pests.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> was {{recorded}} in Bermuda from 1876 onwards.|$|E
5|$|<b>American</b> <b>crows</b> are common, widespread, and {{susceptible}} to the West Nile virus, making them useful as a bioindicator to track the virus's spread. Direct transmission of the virus from <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> to humans is unheard of and unlikely.|$|R
40|$|A {{dipstick}} immunochromatographic assay {{used for}} West Nile virus (WNV) detection in mosquitoes was investigated for application to testing of fecal, saliva, and tissue samples from dead <b>American</b> <b>Crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Results suggest that VecTest {{may be an}} efficient method for WNV detection in field-collected, dead <b>American</b> <b>Crows,</b> although confirmation of results and further investigation are warranted...|$|R
5|$|<b>American</b> <b>crows</b> are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families {{of up to}} 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> do not reach breeding age {{for at least two}} years. Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years.|$|R
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos) {{is a large}} {{passerine}} {{bird species}} of the family Corvidae. It is a common bird found throughout much of North America.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> is omnivorous. It {{will feed}} on {{invertebrates}} of all types, carrion, scraps of human food, seeds, eggs and nestlings, stranded {{fish on the}} shore and various grains. American crows are active hunters and will prey on mice, frogs, and other small animals. In winter and autumn, the diet of American crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns. Occasionally, they will visit bird feeders. The <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> {{is one of only}} a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and using tools to obtain food.|$|E
5|$|The {{average life}} span of the <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> in the wild is 7–8 years. Captive birds {{are known to have}} lived up to 30 years.|$|E
40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) {{outbreaks}} in North America {{have been}} characterized by substantial die-offs of <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos). In contrast, a low incidence of bird deaths has been observed during WNV epidemic activity in Europe. To examine the susceptibility of the western European counterpart of <b>American</b> <b>crows,</b> we inoculated carrion crows (Corvus corone) with WNV strains isolated in Greece (Gr- 10), Italy (FIN and Ita 09), and Hungary (578 / 10) and with the highly virulent North American genotype strain (NY 99). We also inoculated <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> with a selection of these strains to examine the strains' virulence in a highly susceptible bird species. Infection with all strains, except WNV FIN, resulted in high rates of death and high-level viremia in both bird species and virus dissemination to several organs. These results suggest that carrion crows are highly susceptible to WNV and may potentially be useful as part of dead bird surveillance for early warning of WNV activity in Europe. 26197093 PMC 451773...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To better {{understand}} the potential environmental health risk presented by West Nile virus (WNV) -contaminated feces, we quantified the amount of WNV present in the feces of experimentally infected <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and fish crows (Corvus ossifragus). Peak fecal titers ranged from 103. 5 to 108. 8 plaque-forming units (PFU) /g for 10 <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> and from 102. 3 to 106. 4 PFU/g for 10 fish crows. The presence of infectious WNV in bird feces indicates a potential for direct transmission of WNV. Thus, handlers of sick or dead birds should take appropriate precautions to avoid exposure to fecal material...|$|R
50|$|Eggs and chicks are {{vulnerable}} to chipmunks, raccoons, blue jays, <b>American</b> <b>crows,</b> black rat snakes, brown-headed cowbirds, common grackles, southern flying squirrels, gray squirrels, least weasels, white-footed mice, domestic cats, great horned owls, and sharp-shinned hawks. Adults are primarily taken by hawks and owls.|$|R
5|$|The northwestern crow (C. caurinus) is {{very closely}} related to the <b>American</b> <b>crow.</b> Its {{ancestors}} became separated by Ice Age glaciation west of the Rocky Mountains. It is endemic to Pacific temperate rain forests where it all but replaces the <b>American</b> <b>crow.</b> Only in the Seattle region do they co-occur to any extent. In form the two species are much alike. There is a marked difference in voice.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> is all black, with {{iridescent}} feathers. It {{looks much}} like other all-black corvids. They {{can be distinguished}} from the common raven (C. corax) because American crows are smaller and from the fish crow (C. ossifragus) because American crows do not hunch and fluff their throat feathers when they call.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> now extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean in Canada, on the French islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, south through the United States, and into {{northern}} Mexico. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated range expansions of the <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> as well as range expansions of many other species of birds. Virtually all types of country from wilderness, farmland, parks, open woodland to towns and major cities are inhabited; it is absent only from Pacific temperate rain forests and tundra habitat where it is replaced by the raven. This crow is a permanent resident {{in most of the}} USA, but most Canadian birds migrate some distances southward in winter. Outside of the nesting season these birds often gather in large (thousands or even millions) communal roosts at night.|$|E
5|$|The most usual call is a loud, short, {{and rapid}} caaw-caaw-caaw. Usually, the birds thrust their heads {{up and down}} as they utter this call. <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> can also produce a wide variety of sounds and {{sometimes}} mimic noises made by other animals, including other birds.|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} the VecTest WNV antigen assay with standard methods of West Nile virus (WNV) detection in swabs from <b>American</b> <b>Crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and House Sparrows (Passer domesticus). The VecTest detected WNV {{more frequently than}} the plaque assay and was comparable to a TaqMan reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction...|$|R
50|$|Known predators of {{eggs and}} goslings include coyotes, Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus), {{northern}} raccoons (Procyon lotor), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), large gulls (Larus species), common ravens (Corvus corax), <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos), carrion crows (in Europe, Corvus corone) and both brown (Ursus arctos) and American black bears (Ursus americanus).|$|R
5|$|American crows are {{protected}} internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} to drive away or eliminate these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, {{as well as its}} vast range, are the reasons why the <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E
5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the <b>American</b> <b>crow</b> population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as <b>American</b> <b>crow),</b> ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
25|$|Since crows and magpies {{have benefited}} and even {{increased}} in numbers due to human development, {{it was suggested}} that this might cause increased rates of nest predation of smaller bird species, leading to declines. Several studies have shown this concern to be unfounded. One study examined <b>American</b> <b>crows,</b> which had increased in numbers, were a suspect in nest predation of threatened marbled murrelets. However, Steller's jays, which are successful independently of human development, are more efficient in plundering small birds' nests than <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> and common ravens. Therefore, the human relationship with crows and ravens did not significantly increase nest predation, compared to other factors such as habitat destruction. Similarly a study examining the decline of British songbirds found no link between Eurasian magpie numbers and population changes of 23 songbird species.|$|R
40|$|Avian scavengers, such as <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos), have {{potential}} to translocate infectious agents (prions) of {{transmissible spongiform encephalopathy}} (TSE) diseases including chronic wasting disease, scrapie, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. We inoculated mice with fecal extracts obtained from 20 <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> that were force-fed material infected with RML-strain scrapie prions. These mice all evinced severe neurological dysfunction 196 – 231 d postinoculation (x̅ = 198; 95 % CI: 210 – 216) and tested positive for prion disease. Our results suggest {{a large proportion of}} crows that consume prion-positive tissue are capable of passing infectious prions in their feces (p = 1. 0; 95 % CI: 0. 8 – 1. 0). Therefore, this common, migratory North American scavenger could {{play a role in the}} geographic spread of TSE diseases...|$|R

25|$|New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) are {{notable for}} their highly {{developed}} tool fabrication. They make angling tools of twigs and leaves trimmed into hooks, {{then use the}} hooks to pull insect larvae from tree holes. Tools are engineered according to task and apparently also to learned preference. Recent studies revealed abilities to solve complicated problems, which suggests high level of innovation of a complex nature. Other corvids that have been observed using tools include the <b>American</b> <b>crow,</b> blue jay and green jay. Diversity in tool design among corvids suggests cultural variation. Again, great apes are the only other animals known to use tools in such a fashion.|$|E
25|$|When Swainson's hawks {{arrive at}} their nesting sites in March or April, they may {{return to their}} {{original}} nests as these hawks are noted to be monogamous. Research indicates {{that they have a}} high degree of mate and territorial fidelity. This is unusual in a long-distance migrant. Seven to fifteen days after the birds arrive, the males begin constructing nests on the ground, ledges or in a trees. The nest consists of twigs and grasses and can take up to two weeks to complete. New nests may be constructed, old nests refurbished, or abandoned nests of other species — namely corvids (e.g. common raven, black-billed magpie, and <b>American</b> <b>crow)</b> — are refurbished.|$|E
40|$|We {{document}} {{effects of}} West Nile virus (WNV) on <b>American</b> <b>Crows.</b> More than {{two thirds of}} our crows died of WNV infection, peaking when the proportion of infected mosquitoes at roosts was greatest. WNV antibody prevalence in crows was low. Local ecologic effects can be dramatic as WNV inhabits new areas. The introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) to North America {{in the summer of}} 1999 prompted concern about effects of WNV disease in wildlife. Though the disease has spread rapidly since its introduction, little documentation is available describing the effect of WNV on free-ranging wildlife species. We monitored the emergence and prevalence of WNV infection in <b>American</b> <b>Crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in Illinois during {{the spring and summer of}} 2002; relative to other states, Illinois had the largest number of human West Nile meningoencephalitis cases in 2002 (1) ...|$|R
50|$|In Auburn, New York, 25,000 to 50,000 <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> (C. brachyrhynchos) {{have taken}} to {{roosting}} in the small city's large trees during winter since around 1993. In 2003, a controversial, organized crow hunt proved ineffective at reducing their numbers and the problem (concerns for {{public health and the}} sheer noise of so many crows) continues.|$|R
50|$|Common predators of {{blue-winged teal}} include humans, snakes, {{snapping}} turtles (Chlycha serpentina), dogs, cats, muskellunge, <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhnchos), magpies (Pica spp.), ground squirrels, coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes fulva), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata), American minks (Mustela vison), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), spotted skunks (Spilogale putorius), and American badgers (Taxidea taxus).|$|R
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and <b>American</b> <b>crow,</b> all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E

40|$|Mechanisms for {{the spread}} of {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathy diseases, including chronic wasting disease (CWD) in North American cervids, are incompletely understood, but primary routes include horizontal and environmental transmission. Birds {{have been identified as}} potential vectors for a number of diseases, where they ingest or are exposed to infected material and later shed the disease agent in new areas after flying substantial distances. We recently identified <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus brachyrhynchos) as having the potential to translocate infectious prions in their feces. Our results suggest that this common, migratory North American scavenger is capable of translocating infectious prions to disease-free areas, potentially seeding CWD infection where no other initial source of pathogen establishment is forthcoming. Here we speculate on the role avian scavengers, like <b>American</b> <b>crows,</b> might play in the spatial dissemination of CWD. We also consider the role mammalian scavengers may play in dispersing prions...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{emergence}} of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America {{has been associated}} with high mortality in the native avifauna and has raised concerns about the long-term impact of WNV on bird populations. Here, we present results from a longitudinal analysis of annual counts of six bird species, using North American Breeding Bird Survey data from ten states (1994 to 2010). We fit overdispersed Poisson models to annual counts. Counts from successive years were linked by an autoregressive process that depended on WNV transmission intensity (annual West Nile neuroinvasive disease reports) and was adjusted by El Niño Southern Oscillation events. These models were fit using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Results: Model fit was mostly excellent, especially for <b>American</b> <b>Crows,</b> for which our models explained between 26 % and 81 % of the observed variance. The impact of WNV on bird populations was quantitatively evaluated by contrasting hypothetical count trajectories (omission of WNV) with observed counts. Populations of <b>American</b> <b>crows</b> were most consistently affected with a substantial cumulative impact in six of ten states. The largest negative impact, almost 60 %, was found in Illinois. A regionally substantial decline was also seen for American Robins and House Sparrows, while the other species appeared unaffected. Conclusions: Our results confirm findings from previous studies that single out <b>American</b> <b>Crows</b> as the species most vulnerable to WNV infection. We discuss strengths and limitations of this and other methods for quantifying the impact of WNV on bird populations...|$|R
