40|$|Does more {{bargaining}} power of managers inside a firm lead to larger <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital?</b> To tackle this question, we use unique and proprietary panel data on planned and realized capital allocations inside {{a very large}} conglomerate. The firm operates worldwide, is headquartered in Europe and has 5 divisions and 22 business units. We measure {{bargaining power}} {{by looking at the}} three complementary measures of power: (i) tenure of the division CEOs, (ii) whether they have the local nationality and (iii) whether they have an engineering degree (the firm has a very strong and very long engineering tradition). We find that (ex ante) planned <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> are not distorted by bargaining power. Then we study how unexpected cash windfalls at the headquarter level are distributed inside the firm. The cash windfalls result from the sale of equity holdings in other firms and are exogenous to the divisions and business units. We find that managers with more bargaining power get a larger part of the cash windfalls for their own business units. Our results suggest that bargaining power does not matter in formalized allocation processes but rather {{when it comes to the}} ad hoc distribution of unexpected cash windfalls. We show that our power variables do not proxy for ability. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> solvency <b>capital</b> in multi-line financial businesses. Although {{this paper is}} uniformly applicable to financial enterprises of all types, the terminology in the paper is mainly that of insurance. The TailVaR risk measure is extended in a natural way to allocating <b>capital</b> to each <b>of</b> the business units. This method <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> allocates <b>capital</b> {{in a way that}} is invariant over the method of decomposing the enterprise into business units. Analytic results are derived in the case of multivariate Normal risks. The key result of this paper is that the TailVaR-based proportional <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> total required <b>capital</b> is identical to that based on mean-variance considerations analogous to the CAPM in the case of the multivariate Normal distribution. The allocation methodology results are then applied to a real bancassurance portfolio of 10 lines of business to illustrate the various concepts discussed in the paper.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} neoclassical growth model with natural capital by {{introducing}} two new concepts: <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>capital</b> and materialization. We consider that anthropogenic environmental impact is {{correlated with the}} throughput of the economy (materialisation). Materialisation is the material throughput per unit of economic activity. We capture {{the effect of the}} reduction of this throughput dematerialisation in the elasticities of materialisation and aggregate environmental impact. In our framework the fraction <b>of</b> natural <b>capital</b> devoted to production does not provide direct environmental services nor does it contribute to ecosystem functioning namely affecting the carrying capacity <b>of</b> natural <b>capital.</b> We analyse an optimal sustainable growth path, in the context of exogenous technological change.

The interest rate adjusts in response to tax/inflation changes so as to maintain the aggregate demand for capital at this initial level. The model is employed to deduce the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> real <b>capital</b> under various tax regimes at different inflation rates. ...|$|R
