5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E

40|$|We made {{a turning}} {{trial of a}} twin-engine, twin-propeller, and twin-rudder ship “KAKUYO MARU”, that has {{equipped}} {{the two sets of}} main engines and rudders, and a comparison was made between two engines and one engine as well as between two rudders and one rudder about the factors of turning. The trial results are stated below. 1) Comparing to the operation of two engines, the ratio of steady turning diameter (D/L), the speed reduction rate (RATE), and the time for turning (TIME) were large when the position of engine and the turning direction was the same. And, these decreased when rudder <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> large. Also, the drift <b>angle</b> (<b>ANGLE)</b> <b>was</b> small and increased when rudder <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> large. 2) In comparison with using two engines, D/L and TIME when using one engine and turning to the opposite direction of engine position were small and increased when rudder <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> large. Also, the RATE and <b>ANGLE</b> <b>were</b> large and decreased when rudder <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> large. 3) When using one engine, D/L and TIME of turning by one rudder were 1. 1 to 1. 6 times larger than these of turning by two rudders at both turning directions and decreased when rudder <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> large.

5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special {{case in which the}} crossing <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> zero for all three given circles.

5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is the angle at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> determined by the result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The bipedal gait and {{consequential}} {{freedom of}} the upper limb in human beings has made {{the movements of the}} shoulder joint a subject of extensive investigations. The scapular angles provide the base and leverage to various muscles and have been correlated with the different movements of the shoulder joint. Methods: In the present study, different angles of scapula namely superior, inferior, lateral, medial, acromial and coracoid <b>angles</b> <b>were</b> measured in the North Indian population. The study was conducted on 100 scapulas (R:L = 50 : 50) obtained from Department of Anatomy, Government Medical College, Amritsar. For measuring the angles, centimetre scales and protractor were used. Results: The mean value of superior <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> observed to be 100. 830 (R= 100. 320 : L= 101. 340); inferior <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> 63. 620 (R= 68. 10 : L= 59. 140); lateral <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> 61. 720 (R= 65. 90 : L= 57. 540); medial <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> 147. 640 (R= 151. 320 : L= 143. 960); acromial <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> 106. 470 (R= 107. 680 : L= 105. 260) and coracoid <b>angle</b> <b>was</b> 83. 30 (R= 84. 240 : L= 82. 020). Conclusions: It was observed that all <b>angles</b> <b>were</b> higher in the right sided bones except superior angle. Also a wide range was seen in all the angles. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Keywords: acromial; coracoid; inferior; medial; superior. ______________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

5|$|The red α, β, and γ {{forms are}} {{produced}} from solutions of black selenium by varying the evaporation {{rate of the}} solvent (usually CS2). They all have relatively low, monoclinic crystal symmetries and contain nearly identical puckered Se8 rings with different arrangements, as in sulfur. The packing is most dense in the α form.

5|$|The {{reference}} point (analogous to {{the origin of}} a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E

25|$|A {{converse}} of a theorem is {{a statement}} formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and {{what is to be}} proved. For example, the isosceles triangle theorem states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two <b>angles</b> <b>are</b> equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two <b>angles</b> <b>are</b> equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right <b>angles</b> <b>are</b> equal <b>angles</b> <b>is</b> the statement that two equal <b>angles</b> must <b>be</b> right <b>angles,</b> and this <b>is</b> clearly not always the case.|$|R
5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive Coaster, Oblivion, opened at Alton Towers. Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a true vertical drop as the drop <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop and a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact <b>angle</b> <b>is</b> formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
