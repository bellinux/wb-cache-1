5|$|In autumn 1898 Bishop von Anzer had Father Franz Bartels {{appointed}} as pastor in Qingdao. Bishop von Anzer also commissioned Bartels with planning and constructing the Catholic mission. Bartels initially {{stayed in a}} house that was part of a Taoist temple. Adjacent to his house he had a provisional chapel built which served as a place of worship/service for the European inhabitants of Qingdao until 1902 when a mission hall with a chapel was built. Major Kopka von Lossow, commander of the Third Sea Battalion which was stationed in Qingdao, ordered about <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> his men to attend services every Sunday.|$|E
5|$|Rogers' {{expedition}} suffered further setbacks. An unidentified disease killed almost <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> his expedition members, {{while leaving}} the long-term residents nearly untouched. Two {{of the three}} navy vessels, having no orders to remain, left for New York. Ships sent to Havana to conciliate the Spanish governor there never arrived, their crew revolting and becoming pirates mid-voyage. Finally, the third naval vessel left in mid-September, its commander promising to return in three weeks—a promise {{he had no intention}} of keeping. Work on rebuilding the island's fortifications proceeded slowly, with the locals showing a disinclination to work.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist is Rush Sykes, an 18-year-old Mitra {{boy from}} a {{peaceful}} island. His 14-year-old sister, Irina, is kidnapped {{at the start}} of the game, and finding her is Rush's impetus for leaving the island. He meets and joins David Nassau, the 19-year-old Mitra ruler of the city-state of Athlum, and his four generals: the 41-year-old Mitra Emma Honeywell, the 24-year-old Yama Blocter, the 55-year-old Qsiti Pagus and the 200-year-old Sovani Torgal. These characters can be joined by more than <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> other characters, many of whom are found through quests, while others can be hired at guilds. Every character has their own name and skillset, though the main characters have special additional skills. The main villain is the Conqueror, a Mitra who during the course of the game attacks many city-states of the world with his army. He is assisted in regard, first in secret and then openly, by Wilfred Hermeien, an adult Mitra who is both the leader of the city-state of Nagapur with the ruling council of all of the city-states and Wagram, a powerful Mitra sorcerer.|$|E
5000|$|The Latin {{edition of}} the Assize of Weights and Measures, one of the {{statutes}} of uncertain date from around the year 1300, describes <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> (red) herring (<b>a</b> long <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> 120 fish), beeswax, sugar, pepper, cumin, and alum ("13½ stone, each stone containing 8 pounds" [...] or 108 Tower lbs.), coarse and woven linen, hemp canvas (<b>a</b> long <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> 120 ells), and iron or horseshoes and shillings (<b>a</b> short <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> 100 pieces). Later versions used the Troy or avoirdupois pounds in their reckonings instead and included <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> fresh herrings (<b>a</b> short <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> 100 fish), cinnamon, nutmegs (13½ st. of 8 lbs.), and garlic ("15 ropes of 15 heads" [...] or 225 heads).|$|R

5|$|While in Trujillo, Cortés {{received}} messengers from Papayeca, a large native town some seven leagues away, and Champagua (now {{known as}} Chapagua), another nearby town. Both of these settlements were inhabited by Nahuas. Cortés recorded {{the names of}} two Nahua rulers as Pizacura and Mazatl. Pizacura resisted Cortes' overtures and refused to swear fealty; Cortés sent Spanish cavalry and infantry, accompanied by {{a great number of}} Indian auxiliaries. They launched a night attack upon Pizacura's village in the Agalta valley, and captured the Nahua leader with <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> his people. The majority were enslaved, while Pizacura was held as a prisoner with two other nobles, and a young man whom Cortés suspected of being the true leader of his people. Pizacura claimed that his resistance was instigated by Mazatl, who opposed peace with the Spanish invaders. Cortés captured Mazatl and asked him to order his subjects to return to their abandoned villages. Mazatl refused, so Cortés hanged him in Trujillo.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} of Henry's focus on his planned campaign against Nicaea to attack Thessalonica. At the head of Latin mercenaries, he captured the constable of the Kingdom of Thessalonica and baron of Domokos, the Lombard Amé Buffa, and <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> his companions. He {{is alleged to have}} been excessively cruel to his prisoners, killing or whipping many of them, while Buffa, his confessor, and three other nobles were crucified. Michael's army proceeded to capture several fortresses and kill the Latin garrisons, including priests. Enraged, Henry sped to Thessalonica's aid, covering the distance from Constantinople in only twelve days. Michael in the meantime had allied himself with the Bulgarian ruler Strez, but they were defeated by Henry. It is possible that during this campaign, Henry was assisted by his vassals from Achaea, thereby explaining the reference in the Pope's correspondence of Achaean barons fighting against Michael, rather than assuming an Epirote expedition to the Peloponnese. The Latin Emperor wrested lands from both allies, but was forced to cut short his campaign and return to Constantinople, which was being threatened by the Bulgarian emperor Boril. Henry left Thessalonica in the charge of his brother Eustace and of Berthold of Katzenelnbogen, who then defeated another invasion by Strez, supported with troops from his brother Boril. Disquieted by the Bulgarian attacks on Thessalonica, Michael switched sides and joined the Latins in defeating the Bulgarians at Pelagonia. It is commonly assumed that during these conflicts, Michael terminated his vassalage to the Latin Empire; historian Philip Van Tricht however points out that there are no sources for this, and that this vassalage may have survived until 1217, when Michael's brother Theodore captured Latin Emperor Peter II of Courtenay near Dyrrhachium.|$|E
