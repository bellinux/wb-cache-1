25|$|The most {{noticeable}} trait {{of the early}} entremets was the focus on vivid colors. Later on, the entremets would take the shape of various types of illusion foods, such as peacocks or swans that were skinned, cooked, seasoned and then redressed in their original plumage (or filled with the meat of tastier fowl) or even scenes depicting contemporary human activities, such as a knight {{in the form of}} a grilled capon equipped with a paper helmet and lance, sitting on the back of <b>a</b> <b>roast</b> piglet. Elaborate models of castles made from edible material was a popular theme. At a feast in 1343 dedicated to Pope Clement VI, one of the Avignon popes, one of the entremets was a castle with walls made from roast birds, populated with cooked and redressed deer, wild boar, goat, hare and rabbit.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} was probably commissioned by Graham to commemorate a naval battle he had fought recently. While commanding a 24-gun sixth rate, {{he had been}} one of three British ships to attack a squadron of three powerful French privateers and their prizes. The British were successful in their engagement, capturing all of the prizes, and {{all but one of the}} privateers. Lauded for his achievements, Graham was given another, larger, ship to command. The painting is probably set aboard this new command, the 60-gun , and shows Graham relaxing in the great cabin before a meal, smoking a pipe. With him are the ship's chaplain and clerk, who sing and listen to music played by a black servant. A steward brings <b>a</b> <b>roast</b> duck to the table. Two dogs are also present in the scene, one joins in the singing, the other wears a wig and reads a sheet of music.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, food {{preparation}} was overseen by a qualified chef, who also trained prisoners. The diet consisted of quality food, but [...] "without trimmings". Breakfast was porridge, {{with a third}} of a pint of milk, a hot drink (tea, unless the prisoner bought coffee or cocoa), and either Vegemite, honey, or margarine, depending on the week. Lunch and dinner had more variation. Both meals consisted of a meat dish – corned beef, sausages, or mince pie – as well as mashed potato and cabbage, although there was occasionally <b>a</b> <b>roast</b> dinner. Meat, vegetables and bread were still a prominent part of the diet in 1991.|$|E

50|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> pan {{will depend}} upon the type of meat being roasted, or the recipe being followed. Generally, meat that is high in fat content, such as duck, has no need of being covered during <b>roasting.</b> <b>A</b> lean cut of meat, however, will benefit from being covered during <b>a</b> long <b>roasting</b> time, to retain juices and soften the meat (for example, in using <b>a</b> tajine for <b>roasting</b> meat).|$|R

Around the same time, Sally Williams reviewed the restaurant for the Western Mail, who also praised the soufflé. She called the atmosphere [...] "comfortable" [...] and stated {{that it had a}} home-like quality to it. In 2013, the restaurant was ranked as the second best in Wales, behind The Walnut Tree in Abergavenny, in the Sunday Times list of the 100 best restaurants in the UK.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Specialty Sandwich [...] line {{was one of the}} first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing to spend more on a higher quality product. Included in the new line was the Original Chicken Sandwich, a ham and cheese sandwich, <b>a</b> <b>roast</b> beef sandwich, a new fish sandwich called the Long Fish Sandwich, and a new burger called the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. The ham and cheese sandwich replaced an earlier version ham and cheese sandwich called the Yumbo that was served hot and was the size of a hamburger. In 1981 the chain tested a veal parmigiana sandwich in limited areas of the United States and took it national in 1982. It was also sold in New England as part of limited time offering (LTO) in 1988.|$|E

Their relationship is examined by their community of friends, and Angelou and Make eventually separate. Angelou accepts a job in Liberia, and she and Guy travel to Accra, where he has been accepted to attend college. Guy is seriously injured in an automobile accident, so she begins working at the University of Ghana and remains there while he recuperates.

500|$|Tricon {{was renamed}} Yum! Brands in May 2002. In that year, the chain {{had to contend}} with Burger King's launch of the Chicken Whopper, as well as fried chicken offerings from the Domino's and Papa John's pizza chains. Within three months, the Chicken Whopper became Burger King's most {{successful}} launch of all time, with sales of 50 million. In September 2002, KFC sales were down 10 percent against the previous year. From 2002 to 2005, KFC experienced three years of weak sales, when underinvestment in product development left the brand looking [...] "tired and poorly positioned", according to Restaurant Research, an independent consultancy. <b>A</b> <b>roast</b> chicken product line introduced in 2004 proved unsuccessful, and the worldwide avian flu scare of 2005 temporarily decreased sales by as much as 40 percent.

It proved {{to be one of the}} chain's most successful product launches to date, with over 100 million in sales.

500|$|Borscht's westward {{expansion}} {{was less}} successful; Germans used to scoff at the soup {{along with other}} East European fare. What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors, as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats, to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France. One of the first French chefs to do so was , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819. In his take on borscht, the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant [...] dish {{with an air of}} eastern exoticism. Apart from vegetables and beet sour, his recipe calls for <b>a</b> <b>roast</b> chicken, a fried chicken, a duck, a piece of veal, an oxtail, a marrow bone, one pound of bacon, and six large sausages, and suggests serving with beef quenelles, deviled eggs and croûtons. , 's apprentice, who was mostly fascinated by the soup's vivid ruby-red color, simplified his master's recipe, while also securing the place of [...] ("borscht soup") in French cuisine. [...] and , both of whom had been employed at Polish aristocratic courts, presented borscht to the French public as a Polish soup; their cookbook, , published in 1856, contains a borscht recipe under the descriptive name, [...] ("Polish-style beet-juice soup"), which had been changed to [...] by the third edition in 1868. In 1867, beetroot borscht was served, along with herrings, sturgeon, coulibiac, Pozharsky cutlets and vinaigrette salad, at a Russian-themed dinner at the International Exposition in Paris, strengthening its international association with Russian culture.|$|E
500|$|After Cassie's parents {{leave for}} a Halloween party and later that night, The Evil Thing {{is brought to}} life by Max's thoughts, and captures him, Priscilla and a Papa John's Pizza {{delivery}} man. It is up to Cassie and Sean (Cody Linley), a popular boy who Cassie likes, to save them. At first, they try to defeat The Evil Thing on their own, but fail. Cassie then asks {{the owner of the}} shop, where she bought the book, for help. Cassie discovers that the store owner travels around the world each Halloween, searching for a person who loves to scare people the most and tricks them into reading the book aloud, releasing The Evil Thing, possibly in order to teach them a lesson. He leaves them with the riddle [...] "two heads are better than one; that's the way to get the bloody job done" [...] before his shop disappears. After he disappears, Sean solves the riddle. Together, they formulate that if they get blood from <b>a</b> <b>roast</b> that Cassie's mother made and throw it onto The Evil Thing, it will be forced to suck up the blood. In doing so, it will devour itself. [...] While they plan their attack, The Evil Thing's babies hatch and tries to eat the victims. Luckily, Sean and Cassie make it in time. By using Sean's CD of monster sound effects, they are able to lure the monster to the CD player; however, when the monster nudges it, the music turns into hip hop, thus ruining their plan. While fumbling, Sean and Cassie accidentally drop the blood near Max, who must conquer his fears. When Cassie encourages him, Max tosses the blood onto The Evil Thing, causing its heads to begin attacking each other. The monster eats itself, eventually exploding in a shower of yellow blood, killing itself and its offspring.|$|E
