Bennett advised against toning down The Interviews graphic Jong-un death scene, in the hope that it would [...] "start some real thinking in South Korea <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>in</b> the North once the DVD leaks into the North". Bennett expressed his view that [...] "the only resolution I can see to the North Korean nuclear and other threats is for the North Korean government to eventually go away", which he felt would be likeliest to occur following an assassination of Kim. Lynton replied that a senior figure in the United States Department of State agreed. Bennett responded that the office of Robert R.

500|$|In {{order to}} refute the charge, the conspirators from Belgrade, who {{because of their}} youth did not face the death penalty, focused during the trial on putting blame on {{themselves}} and deflecting it from official Serbia and modified their court testimony from their prior depositions accordingly. Princip stated under cross examination: [...] "I am a Yugoslav nationalist <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> unification of all South Slavs in whatever form of state and that it be free of Austria." [...] Princip was then asked how he intended to realize his goal and responded: [...] "By means of terror." [...] Cabrinović, though, testified that the political views that motivated him to kill Franz Ferdinand were views held in the circles he traveled in within Serbia. The court {{did not believe the}} defendants' stories claiming to hold official Serbia blameless. The verdict ran: [...] "The court regards it as proved by the evidence that both the Narodna Odbrana and military circles in the Kingdom of Serbia in charge of the espionage service, collaborated in the outrage." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a July 2005 {{statement}} on his website, Vikernes explained {{that although he}} [...] "occasionally used the term 'nazism' to describe [...] ideological foundation", he no longer describes himself as such: [...] "The reason I have been drawn to and occasionally have expressed support for 'nazism' is mainly {{because many of the}} Norwegian (and German) 'nazis' embraced our Pagan religion as our blood-religion and they rejected Judeo-Christianity as Jewish heresy". He identifies three things which distinguish him from the [...] "Nazis": [...] "unlike them I am not socialistic (not even on a national level), I am not materialistic <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> (the ancient Scandinavian!) democracy".

2500|$|Following his {{dismissal}} at Milan, Capello took a {{short break}} from coaching. He told a reporter that he [...] "sat on a beach and thought about football". He also enjoyed a spell as a colour commentator for Italian television, participating in coverage of the 1999 Copa América. In May 1999, he moved to Roma, the club he had first joined as a player 30 years prior. His arrival was hailed by Roma president Franco Sensi, who said, [...] "Capello is a winner <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> him." [...] Capello was joined by Franco Baldini, who became the club's sporting director. Capello built his side around Marco Delvecchio, sometimes leaving Vincenzo Montella on the bench. Believing his squad lacked a world-class striker, Capello made a move to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the deal was wrecked following a serious injury. His first season saw Roma finish sixth, made particularly disappointing as cross-city rivals Lazio won the title, and they were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Leeds United.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Vampiria magazine, Vikernes {{was asked about}} Odinism playing {{a major role in}} his life, to which he responded: [...] "I am not religious in any way, but I have a Pagan ideology and Pagan values. I believe in blood, soil and honour; family, homeland and hamingja; strength, traditions and courage. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> a Europe waking up." [...] As of 2011, Vikernes embraces a [...] "modern scientific worldview resting on a foundation made up of the Pagan values and ideals: loyalty, wisdom, courage, love, discipline, honesty, intelligence, beauty, responsibility, health and strength". He draws a direct connection between both race and intelligence and intelligence and religion, denouncing theism as [...] "mental enslavement" [...] fit only for [...] "inferior races". Vikernes goes on to say [...] "If it is supposed to serve a purpose Paganism needs to be an ideology, not a religion". Though Vikernes states that mainstream theists hold onto [...] "Stone Age misconceptions", he argues that religious myths should be turned to in areas where science has not yet achieved a complete understanding of the natural world — such as the origin of life and where we go after death, if anywhere at all.|$|E
