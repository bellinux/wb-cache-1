40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} key operating variables affecting N 2 O emission from oil shale-fired circulating fluidized bed (CFB). These operating variables include bed temperature, excess air factor, particle size, secondary <b>air</b> <b>ratio,</b> Ca/S <b>ratio,</b> <b>circulation</b> rate and bed material height. Using an oil shale-fired CFB pilot setup {{composed of a}} quartz tube and heated by an electric heater, the experiments of N 2 O emission were carried out with oil shale test samples obtained from Huadian, China. Grey relational method was used to treat the experimental data. Calculation results indicate that bed temperature is a variable most closely related to changes in N 2 O emission; the effects of secondary <b>air</b> <b>ratio</b> and <b>circulation</b> rate are negligible. The operating variables sequenced in order of decreasing effect are bed temperature, excess air factor, Ca/S ratio, particle size, bed material height, secondary <b>air</b> <b>ratio,</b> <b>circulation</b> rate. The experimental results and grey relational analysis can provide reference data for design of oil shale-fired CFB furnaces...|$|R

40|$|The Dragon capsule is a {{reusable}} vehicle {{being developed}} by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) that will provide commercial cargo transportation to the International Space Station (ISS). Dragon {{is designed to be}} a habitable module while it is berthed to ISS. As such, the Dragon Environmental Control System (ECS) consists of pressure control and pressure equalization, air sampling, fire detection, illumination, and an <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> system. The <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> system prevents pockets of stagnant air in Dragon that can be hazardous to the ISS crew. In addition, through the inter-module duct, the <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> system provides fresh air from ISS into Dragon. To utilize the maximum volume of Dragon for cargo packaging, the Dragon ECS <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> system is designed around cargo rack optimization. At the same time, the <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> system is designed to meet the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) inter-module and intra-module ventilation requirements and acoustic requirements. A flight like configuration of the Dragon capsule including the <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> system was recently assembled for testing to assess the design for inter-module and intra-module ventilation and acoustics. The testing included the Dragon capsule, and flight configuration in the pressure section with cargo racks, lockers, all of the <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> components, and acoustic treatment. The <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> test was also used to verify the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of the Dragon capsule. The CFD model included the same Dragon internal geometry that was assembled for the test. This paper will describe the Dragon <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> system design which has been verified by testing the system and with CFD analysis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>circulation</b> {{systems that}} allow {{controlled}} exchange with outside air {{are an important}} part of The New Cultivation growing (Het Nieuwe Telen in Dutch). Control over the amount of dehumidification and the air distribution in the crop provides growers the confidence needed to realize energy savings through intensifying screen use, reduced minimum pipe temperatures acceptance of a higher humidity in the greenhouse. In this project 10 horticultural companies that have invested in such installations were monitored and their energy consumption was compared to that of a carefully chosen reference. The <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> systems are found to provide a 10 to 20 % potential of saving on heating energy. This potential, however, is not always (immediately) realized. Some companies show a clear learning curve. First, confidence in the system has to be gained before the actual source of the energy savings, which is the increased application of screens and more humid growing conditions, can be fully exploited. There are also companies that intensified their production system together with the purchase of the new <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> systems. The Intensification in these cases meant an increased application of artificial illumination and/or a lower humidity. At these companies, the <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> and dehumidification system will not lead to energy savings. The diversity of companies that were present in this project provides a good picture of the potential of various <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> and dehumidification systems, as well as the developments that tend to increase the energy consumption of horticulture...|$|R
