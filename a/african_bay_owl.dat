50|$|The Congo bay owl, {{also known}} as the Itombwe owl or <b>African</b> <b>bay</b> <b>owl,</b> (Pholidus prigoginei) (sometimes placed in the genus Tyto with the barn and grass owls) is a species of owl in the family Tytonidae. It is {{restricted}} to a small area in the Albertine Rift in east central Africa.|$|E
50|$|Most {{classification}} schemes recognize {{three species}} in this genus: the oriental <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> (Phodilus badius), the Sri Lanka <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> (Phodilus assimilis) and the Congo <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> (Phodilus prigoginei).|$|R
50|$|The oriental <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> (Phodilus badius) {{is a type}} of <b>bay</b> <b>owl,</b> usually {{classified}} with barn owls. It {{is completely}} nocturnal, and can be found throughout Southeast Asia. It has several subspecies. It has a heart-shaped face with earlike extensions. The Congo <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> (Phodilus prigoginei) was formerly classified as a subspecies of Oriental <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> due to insufficient knowledge, but it has turned out that it might not even belong to the same genus. The Sri Lanka <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> was also considered a subspecies.|$|R
50|$|The Sri Lanka <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> (Phodilus assimilis) is {{a species}} of <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> in the family Tytonidae. It is endemic to the island of Sri Lanka and Western Ghats in Kerala, South Western India. It is {{sometimes}} considered a subspecies of the Oriental <b>bay</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Congo <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> {{has been}} treated as a race of the Oriental <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> Pholidus badius, but this seems very unlikely, and, in fact, the two species {{do not appear to}} be closely related. Even so its {{inclusion}} in Phodilus is rather dubious, and genetic research is required; it does show some similarities to the Oriental <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> in its plumage colour and pattern, but its facial disc is heart shaped, like that of the Common Barn Owl Tyto alba, and the similarity with the oriental <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> may be due to convergence and some authorities place the Congo <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> in Tyto.|$|R

50|$|The Congo <b>bay</b> <b>owls</b> {{biology is}} almost {{completely}} unknown {{and the same}} goes for its population size and even its geographic range and conservation effort cannot start until this is remedied. It is threatened by the clearing of its habitat for small-scale agriculture as well as by logging, mining, wild fires and forest clearance. The Itombwe Forest has recently been proposed as a community reserve, but its boundaries still require defining.|$|R
50|$|Henri Schouteden {{convinced}} him in 1946 {{to take an}} interest in birds and to collect specimens in the east of the Belgian Congo. This new interest led to him publishing 94 papers on ornithology and he collected nearly 20,000 specimens. He described several new species including Albertine owlet (Glaucidium albertinum), Schouteden's swift (Schoutedenapus schoutedeni), Kabobo apalis (Apalis kaboboensis) and the Itombwe flycatcher (Muscicapa itombwensis) and about 30 new subspecies. Congo <b>bay</b> <b>owl</b> (Pholidus prigoginei), Prigogine's nightjar (Caprimulgus prigoginei) and Prigogine's greenbul (Chlorocichla prigoginei) have been named after him.|$|R

Thattekad Bird Sanctuary located 13 km from Kothamangalam town is the first bird sanctuary in Kerala. Salim Ali, one of the best known ornithologists described this sanctuary as the richest bird habitat on peninsular India. Several rare birds like the Ceylon frogmouth, Bourdillon’s long eared Indian nightjar, peninsular <b>bay</b> <b>owl,</b> crimson-throated barbet and Malabar hornbill are found here. Common animals include leopards, sloth bears, elephants and porcupines.|$|R

50|$|The genus Tyto {{includes}} all barn owls (family Tytonidae) {{except for the}} <b>bay</b> <b>owls</b> (subfamily Phodilinae, genus Phodilus) - that is, the true barn owls, the grass owls and the masked owls collectively making up the subfamily Tytoninae. They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. Tyto owls have a divided, heart-shaped facial disc, and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. Tyto owls tend to be larger than Bay-owls. The name tyto (τυτώ) is onomatopeic Greek for owl.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, British couple Alan Davies and Ruth Miller {{traveled}} around the world, seeing 4341 species. In 2015, Oregon birder Noah Strycker launched a worldwide big year {{with the goal of}} seeing at least 5,000 species—roughly half of the world's species—as he {{traveled around}} the globe. On September 16, in India, he broke the existing record of 4,341 species, set in 2008 by Alan Davies and Ruth Miller, when he saw a Sri Lanka frogmouth for his 4,342nd species of the year. He finished the year with 6,042 bird species, his last species seen being an Oriental <b>Bay</b> <b>Owl</b> in Assam, India. Strycker's record faced an immediate challenge in 2016 when Dutch birder Arjan Dwarshuis launched an effort to break it as well as raise money for the Birdlife Preventing Extinctions Programme. On November 4, 2016, Dwarshuis saw a tody motmot in Panama, breaking Strycker's previous record total. He finished the year with 6833 seen bird species and this is the new World big year record.|$|R

50|$|Western {{burrowing}} owls (Athene cunicularia) {{were listed}} as a species of special concern (a pre-listing category under the Endangered Species Act) by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early '90s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year. In 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service nominated the western burrowing owl as a Federal Category 2 candidate for listing as endangered or threatened, but loss of habitat continues due to development of the flat, grassy lands used by the owl. A 1992-93 survey reported no breeding burrowing owls in Napa, Marin, and San Francisco counties, {{and only a few}} in San Mateo and Sonoma. The Santa Clara County population is declining and restricted to a few breeding locations, leaving only Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano counties as the remnant breeding range. Despite organized protests at Kiper Homes' Blue Ridge property in Antioch, California by Friends of East <b>Bay</b> <b>Owls,</b> one-way doors were installed in the birds' burrows so that the owl families could not return to their nests in early 2010. In addition, in 2008, Mountain View, California evicted a pair of burrowing owls so that it could sell a parcel of land to Google to build a hotel at Shoreline Boulevard and Charleston Road. Eviction of the owls is controversial because the birds regularly reuse burrows for years, and there is no requirement that suitable new habitat be found for the owls.|$|R
