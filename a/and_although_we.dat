500|$|A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was {{released}} by Apple Corps that year, followed by a concert film in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: [...] "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation... The money we raised was secondary, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>we</b> had some money problems... they still got plenty... {{even though it was}} a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended." [...] The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.|$|E
500|$|After a poor race in Canada, {{where he}} stalled {{on the grid}} before the {{formation}} lap before receiving a ten-second stop-go penalty as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race started, Coulthard said that Ferrari could still {{be caught in the}} season's nine remaining races: [...] "We have to look towards Magny-Cours and put this (Montreal) race behind us. The championship is not over yet <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>we</b> cannot change what happened in Canada, we can try to close the gap." [...] Former World Champion and President of the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) Jackie Stewart backed Coulthard to clinch the title after Häkkinen's continuing run of poor results. Michael Schumacher came into the race confident that his car would perform well at the circuit. Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore played down his team's chances saying, [...] "We need a miracle to finish on the podium." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lancashire were {{promoted}} back to {{the first}} division of the county championship in 2005, winning the second division title in the process. They stayed up in the National League, progressed to the finals' day of the Twenty20 Cup and were knocked out in the semi-final of the C Trophy. Despite winning the second division title, there were concerns that the squad may have been getting too old and that there were limited opportunities for the younger players. Of Lancashire's performance over the season, Watkinson said [...] "I was not happy about our batting <b>and,</b> <b>although</b> <b>we</b> have achieved what we set out to do– get promoted– our performance left a lot to be desired". Lancashire are one of three teams, along with Middlesex and Surrey, never to have finished bottom in the County Championship. On their return to the first division in the 2006 season, Lancashire finished second in the Championship. They also finished as runners-up in the NatWest Trohpy.|$|E

2500|$|Showtime's {{announcement}} {{that it would}} not renew Stargate SG-1 after Season 5 coincided with Michael Shanks's decision to leave the show over concerns of being underutilized. The Sci Fi Channel picked up the show and substituted a new character, played by Corin Nemec. Casting agents had met Nemec in the courtyard of MGM's Santa Monica offices by chance and had offered him the role of Jonas Quinn. Addressing rumors that it had forced Shanks's departure, Sci Fi said in February 2002 that the network had [...] "absolutely never requested that any cast changes be made... <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>we</b> regret the loss of Michael Shanks, we think that Corin Nemec will be a great new presence in the cast." [...] Nemec's early appearances, beginning with the penultimate episode of Season 5 [...] "Meridian", failed to win over some of the show's fans. Nemec was willing to continue playing the character after Season 6 or in a feature film or a spin-off series. However, the producers reached an agreement with Shanks to return full-time in Season 7, leaving Nemec with a recurring role. Don S. Davis left Stargate SG-1 after Season 7 for health reasons, but appeared in a recurring capacity until his death on June 29, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} {{religious}} freedom, Luciani {{wrote about the}} council's declaration, [...] "Dignitatis humanae". In his writings, {{he said that there}} is only one true religion that must be followed and no other, affirming that Jesus Christ is the Truth, and that the truth will set one truly free. Though, he said that those that will not accept the one true Catholic Faith, for whatever reason, are indeed free to profess their own religion for various reasons. He makes a clear understanding of true and false liberty. He says that true freedom comes from God, that God makes man free. However, he does continue in repeating the teaching that error does not come from God, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>we</b> are capable or err and sin, and that one who rejects truth cannot be forced to believe it, it is not a God given right to do error. He continues to say that religious freedom must be freely exercised by the individual. He writes that the choice of religion must be a free choice or else one's faith is not real or because they really believe. So he makes clear that for the purposes of keeping peace and order in a diverse society and accepting the free will of man, the freedom of an individual to profess their religion, within certain bounds, is indeed necessary.|$|E
2500|$|I am sure every Englishman {{who has a}} {{heart in}} his breast {{and a feeling of}} justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes that this country could have been able to draw the sword {{successfully}} in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which {{it was not possible to}} accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>we</b> all know how admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture—not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.|$|E
