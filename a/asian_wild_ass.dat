5|$|Extant wild equines have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains zebra {{lives in}} lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the Mountain zebra inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Grévy's zebra {{is found in}} thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild ass inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two <b>Asian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only {{the range of the}} plains and Grévy's zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of feral horses and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.|$|E

40|$|Tooth wear {{signatures}} allow inference on {{the dietary}} traits of herbivorous ungulates. Comparing dietary regimes of taxonomically closely related populations further allows inference on habitat structure and food availability. The mesowear method of tooth wear evaluation {{has opened up}} a pathway to reconstruct subtle differences in dietary behavior and resource partitioning based on skeletal material as {{the only source of}} information. Eighty cheek dentitions of <b>Asian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> (Equus hemionus) from the Southern Gobi (Mongolia) and 61 dentitions of African free ranging donkeys (Equus asinus) from the Emirate Sharjah (United Arab Emirates) were investigated for their mesowear signatures. It is tested if sexes and age classes of individuals are different in their mesowear signatures. Cluster analyses and principal components analyses are applied in order to test hypotheses using 27 ungulate species with known diets as a reference. The <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> from the Gobi are found to classify as typical grazers within this spectrum and have a more abrasion-dominated signature then the donkey population from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The diet available to the latter population is thus considered to be more heterogeneous. This indicates that the donkey habitat in the UAE is a more diverse mosaic of feeding resources compared to the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> habitat of the Mongolian desert. In both populations there are more intraspecific differences in the diet between sexes then there are interspecific differences between the two African zebra species E. burchelii and E. grevyi. The dietary signal is further interpreted as to reflect the social structure of the animals as associated with specific environmental conditions. Between the two sexes of <b>Asian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> and UAE donkeys, one would expect a more pronounced segregation in the diet when male territories are small and poor in resources at the same time. This condition would best characterise the habitat inhabited by the UAE donkey population. The data suggest that the male territories of this population are comparatively small and thus provide highly abrasive forage only...|$|R
50|$|Breeding is seasonal, and the {{gestation}} period of onagers is 11 months {{and the birth}} lasts {{a little more than}} 10 minutes. Mating and births occur from April to September, and there is an accumulation from June to July. The mating season in India is in the rainy season. The foal can stand and starts to suck milk within 15 to 20 minutes after the latest one and a half hours. Females with young tend to form groups of up to five females. During the rearing foals and dam remain closely, other animals, also own older juveniles are displaced by the dam. Occasionally, stallions in territorial wild populations expel the young to mate with the mare again. <b>Wild</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> reach an age of 14 years, however in captivity, they can live up to 26 years.|$|R
50|$|Based {{on ancient}} drawings, the Atlas <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> had stripes on its legs {{as well as}} a {{shoulder}} cross. Of the living subspecies of African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has only leg stripes, and the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> only the shoulder stripe.

40|$|Genetic {{data from}} extant donkeys (Equus asinus) have {{revealed}} two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, suggestive of two separate domestication events in northeast Africa about 5000 years ago. Without distinct phylogeographic structure in domestic donkey haplogroups and with little {{information on the}} genetic makeup of the ancestral African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> however, it {{has been difficult to}} identify wild ancestors and geographical origins for the domestic mitochondrial clades. Our analysis of ancient archaeological and historic museum samples provides the first genetic information on the historic Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus africanus), Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus somaliensis) and ancient donkey. The results demonstrate that the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was an ancestor of the first donkey haplogroup. In contrast, the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has considerable mitochondrial divergence from the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and domestic donkeys. These findings resolve the long-standing issue {{of the role of the}} Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the domestication of the donkey, but raise new questions regarding the second ancestor for the donkey. Our results illustrate the complexity of animal domestication, and have conservation implications for critically endangered Nubian and Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass...</b>|$|R

50|$|It is a {{regionally}} important reserve {{created in}} 1975 by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature as a breeding center for endangered or locally extinct wildlife. The 22 km2 reserve is a thriving protected environment {{for some of}} the most threatened species of animals in the Middle East. Some of the species include Arabian oryx, Somali ostriches, Persian onagers (an <b>Asian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> from Iran) and gazelles.|$|E
50|$|The Indian wild ass, as {{with most}} other <b>Asian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> subspecies, is quite {{different}} from the African wild ass species. The coat is usually sandy, but varies from reddish grey, fawn, to pale chestnut. The animal possesses an erect, dark mane which runs from the back of the head and along the neck. The mane is then followed by a dark brown stripe running along the back, to the root of the tail.|$|E
50|$|The Atlas <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus atlanticus), {{also known}} as Algerian <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> is a purported extinct {{subspecies}} of the African <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> that was once found across North Africa {{and parts of the}} Sahara.

50|$|A the {{previous}} census in 2009, estimated 4,038 Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> However, {{the population was}} still growing. In December 2014, the population was estimated at 4,451 individuals. It has increased from a jump of 454.

In the years 1973 & 1976, Rann of Kutch and adjoining districts were taken up as the area for conservation for this sub-species also known as Khur. From 1976, the forest department began conducting the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> census. Water holes were increased in the area, the forest department has also started a project for having fodder plots though the forest department is yet to get desired success. In 1998, the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population was estimated at 2,940, by the year 2004 it has increased to an estimated 3,863.

5000|$|The social {{behavior}} of the <b>Asian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> can be very different, depending on different habitats, ranges and even threats by predators and humans. In Mongolia and Central Asia (Equus hemionus hemionus and Equus hemionus kulan), a stove onager stallion can adopt harem-type social groups with several mares and foals in large home areas in the southwest and territory-based social groups {{in the south and}} southeast. Also, annual large hikes occur 4,5 km2 to 40 km2, where hiking in summer are more limited than in the winter. Partially, onagers also form large group associations of up from 450 to 1,200 individuals, but this usually only takes place on locations with food or water sources. Since dissolving these major units within one day again, {{there seems to be no}} overarching hierarchy next to the ranking of the individual herds. There are also [...] "bachelor groups" [...] that young male onagers frequently make during the winter. Such a lifestyle is also seen in the wild horse, the plains zebras (Equus quagga) and mountain zebras (Equus zebra). However, occasional formation of temporary territories can be defended in an aggressive way.|$|E
