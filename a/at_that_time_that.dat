5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Pronovost {{appeared}} in 70 {{games for the}} Maple Leafs in 1967–68 and recorded 20 points, but he was held to only 34 games the following season. He missed {{the majority of the}} season to injury, and it was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Maple Leafs president Conn Stafford Smythe suggested Pronovost should be installed as a player-coach of one of Toronto's minor league affiliates. He was offered a position with the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League (CHL), and though initially reluctant to go, the Oilers organization was able to convince Pronovost and his wife to move to the Oklahoma city. He played and coached for much of the year in Tulsa, but was briefly recalled back to Toronto part way through the 1969–70 NHL season. He recorded one assist in seven games with Toronto, the last of his NHL career.|$|E

5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told an interviewer <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E

In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of Armstrong Circle Theatre. Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. He made his feature film debut in 1964 in Taggart, a western based on a novel by Louis L'Amour.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E

5|$|Upon being classified, the {{disturbance}} had a broad circulation that {{was difficult to}} locate, with moderate convection in its eastern periphery. The thunderstorms organized further, and MFR upgraded {{the disturbance}} to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on February19. Three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S, and at 0600UTC that day, MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced scatterometer indicated winds of over 65km/h (40mph); as a result, the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna. By that time, the circulation had become better organized with increased rainbands, and with an anticyclone aloft, the storm developed well-defined outflow. The structure of Haruna continued to become more symmetrical with a large radius of maximum winds, developing a ragged eye early on February20. Based on the improved appearance, MFR upgraded Haruna to a severe tropical storm at 0000UTC that day. About 12hours later, the agency upgraded Haruna further to tropical cyclone status, with 10minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). That day, an approaching trough weakened the ridge to the south, causing the cyclone to slow and move erratically. While Haruna was approaching the southwestern coast of Madagascar, it developed a 120km (75mi) wide eye, and the eyewall passed over Europa Island. Initially, MFR estimated that the storm would intensify to intense tropical cyclone status, and the agency assessed that Haruna reached 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph) on February20. The next day, JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). In contrast, MFR estimated <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the cyclone had peaked when the eyewall thunderstorms warmed, followed by the eye becoming less organized and the winds decreasing.|$|E
