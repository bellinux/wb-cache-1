5|$|The first {{suggestions}} for a stadium at Ullevaal were launched {{by members of}} Lyn in 1917, but not until 1924 was a committee appointed {{to look into the}} matter. Lyn had also considered building their stadium at Holmenkollåsen, Hoff, Tåsen, Frogner, Berg and Marienlyst. The club made an agreement with the tram operator Akersbanerne to purchase land they had acquired as part of the construction of the Sognsvann Line. It was decided that a limited company was to be established, with a share capital of NOK100,000. Aker Municipality agreed to purchase 30% and partially pay via access roads and utilities. <b>All</b> <b>sports</b> clubs in Aker were given the right to purchase up to 10% of the shares, while the rest was to be bought by Lyn. Any costs exceeding the capital was to be paid for through loans and donations. At the same time, Lyn acquired land to build a training field which they would own themselves and was estimated to cost NOK20,000. Both plans were passed by the club annual meeting on 23 May 1924.|$|E
