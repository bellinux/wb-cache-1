500|$|Brown {{herself has}} confessed {{that she was}} unhappy with the storyline as she felt playing illness was not {{productive}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>age.</b> Discussing Dot's reluctance to reveal her illness to anyone, Brown said [...] " [...] ironic because I've played her as a hypochondriac, longing for attention, for 20 years. Now something's wrong, she doesn't want anyone to know." ...|$|E
500|$|Gillan had {{substantial}} {{input into}} Amy's costume, {{as well as}} her hair and make-up. In the first episode, Holman stated that Amy's identity was not clear and she wore her own clothes later on. Gillan thought that Amy had inner confidence to wear clothes that showed [...] "a bit of skin from time to time". She tried on many things, {{but when it came to}} short skirts she [...] "just thought it was right" [...] and showed that Amy was [...] "comfortable and confident about her look". She believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>age.</b> Executive producer Piers Wenger also noted that Amy's 1970s flying jacket, which she wears [...] "quite a lot", reflected Gillan was a [...] "born adventurer" [...] and Amy developed a love for travel and adventure.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), as Abraham {{was sitting in}} the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre {{in the heat of the}} day, he looked up and saw God in the form of three men. [...] He ran, bowed to the ground, and welcomed them. Abraham offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, and they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, ran to select a choice calf for a servant-boy to prepare, set curds and milk and the calf before them, and waited on them under the tree as they ate. One of the visitors told Abraham that he would return the next year, and Sarah would have a son, but Sarah laughed to herself at the prospect, with Abraham so old. God then questioned Abraham why Sarah had laughed at bearing a child <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> noting that nothing was too wondrous for God. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

In the sixth series, Amy wears more jeans and longer trousers; Gillan stated, [...] "she's getting a little bit more tomboyish as she becomes more of an action girl".
