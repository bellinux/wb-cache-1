5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{described}} as an 18-month struggle with {{the board of the}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Gabreski resigned on February 26, 1981. He charged that the creation of an executive director's position, and its appointee, obstructed his efforts to improve service, replace equipment, and change its executive staff. However, a severe heat wave in the summer of 1980 that overwhelmed the commuter line's air conditioning systems was apparently the final straw that forced his resignation.|$|E
25|$|When I {{was left}} alone with the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliain, we entered more deeply and more confidentially into the business. They agreed Fox's conduct had been very ill-judged, and very distressing: that to {{separate}} from him would be highly disagreeable, yet that to remain with him <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> professed, was giving their tacit approbation to the sentiments he had avowed in the House of Commons, on the Parliamentary Reform, which sentiments were in direct contradiction to theirs.|$|E

However, {{after her}} mother's death, she got emotionally {{involved}} with fellow violinist Bartholomew. The pressure for her to win the contest a third time and her unrequited love for Bartholomew, resulted in a fire accident, burning her left arm, effectively disabling her from playing the violin. She spent {{the next four years}} in hospital. Afterwards, she became a music teacher. She later was chosen to be Reiji's teacher. She still has affections for Bartholomew <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did to her.|$|E

Discovering that Madame Masque is {{displaying}} symptoms of demonic possession, Doom has Tony trap her in the Iron Man Armor then proceeds to exorcise the demon from her. Doom disappears before Tony regains consciousness. Doom appears once again and interrupts Tony's breakfast date with Amara. Doom is trying to prove to Tony that he has changed {{and is trying to}} correct the mistakes he has made, explaining that he has arrived to check up on Tony and see if he is suffering from any side-effects from being in the presence of an exorcism.

25|$|In {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} 2011 IAAF Diamond League at Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, Powell won the 100m {{with a time of}} 9.95 seconds. Powell next ran at the IAAF Diamond League in Rome against Usain Bolt on 26 May. Powell had a superb start and mid but he faded towards the end, only to allow the world record holder to surpass him in the final 10–12m of the race. Bolt won in 9.91s and Powell came second in 9.93s. He said that he had lost focus, but is {{confident}} about beating Usain <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done that day. Powell next competed in the IAAF World Challenge in Rabat, Morocco, in a low key meet. There, after running the first 20m, he pulled up and finished last in 36.13s, citing a precaution against a serious hamstring injury. Reports said that it was nothing serious and he would be ready for the Jamaican Trials later in the month. At the Jamaican Trials 23–24 July, Powell looked impressive as he qualified through the rounds. He posted a season best of 9.90s in his semi-final, despite easing off in the final 15m. Later, after overcoming a bad start, Powell won the final to be titled National Champion for the fifth time in his career. He won in a time of 10.08s into a 1.8m/s headwind. Yohan Blake and Steve Mullings were second and third respectively with 0.01s separating them.|$|E
25|$|Doom {{returns to}} Latveria where he saves Tony Stark / Iron Man by incapacitating {{a group of}} Latveria rebels with a sonic attack, and vows {{that he is a}} new man. He reveals to Tony that he is a new man and that he had relinquished his {{dictatorship}} over Latveria to give the land back to its people. As a sign of trust, he entrusts Tony with one of the Wands of Watoomb to help him defeat Madame Masque. When more rebels arrive, Doom teleports Stark to the Bronx Zoo. The two later travel to Chicago in order to confront Madam Masque. Discovering Madame Masque to be possessed, Doom has Tony trap her in his Iron Man armor and exorcises the demon from her. Doom disappears before the unconscious Tony regains consciousness. Doom appears once again and interrupts Tony's breakfast date with Amara, continuously trying to prove to Tony that he has changed and is trying to correct the mistakes he has made, explaining that he has arrived to check up on Tony and see if he is suffering from any side-effects from being in the presence of an exorcism. Tony still refuses to trust him <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done and Doom leaves once again. Following Stark's comatose state at the hands of Captain Marvel, Doom takes up the mantle of Iron Man, coming into conflict with Mephisto disguised as The Maker, the evil Ultimate Universe version of Reed Richards, joining the Avengers, and later conceiving a child with Dr. Amara Perera.|$|E

25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger is named <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the}} ability to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E
500|$|Historian Toby Thacker {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{attack on the}} Pilckem Ridge was {{considered}} a great success by Haig and has been similarly viewed by historians". He continues: [...] "in Haig's eyes the Welsh Division had redeemed its reputation <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had perceived as its poor showing at Mametz Wood". Haig went on to write that the division had [...] "achieved {{the highest level of}} soldierly achievement". Historian Steven John wrote that the division [...] "regained the honour which it had unjustly lost after their supposed tardiness in the capture of Mametz".|$|E
500|$|TV Fanatic Dan Forcella {{felt that}} [...] "Public Relations" [...] was a fantastic episode, and asserted: [...] "All in {{all it was}} a great start to the fourth season of Mad Men."

The Wall Street Journal {{journalist}} Cheryl Berman opined that the episode had a [...] "little bit of everything we love about Mad Men." [...] William Bradley wrote in The Huffington Post that the series got off to [...] "a cracking start" [...] with [...] "Public Relations". Similarly, Scott D.

500|$|Monteux {{believed}} {{that most of}} the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as [...] "knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down". With the composer's agreement Monteux presented a concert performance in Paris in April 1914. Saint-Saëns, who was present, declared Stravinsky mad and left in a rage, but he was almost alone in his dislike. At the end Stravinsky was carried shoulder-high from the theatre <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> described as [...] "the most beautiful performance that I have had of the Sacre du printemps". That performance was part of a series of [...] "Concerts Monteux", presented between February and April 1914, in which Monteux conducted the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées {{in a wide range of}} symphonic and concertante works, including the concert premiere of the orchestral version of Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales. His last notable engagement before the outbreak of war was as conductor of the premiere of Stravinsky's opera The Nightingale at the Palais Garnier.|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} {{performance by}} the Mercedes cars sparked controversy in the paddock. Daniel Ricciardo issued apologies to the Australian fans <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> felt was a [...] "boring" [...] race. Red Bull quarreled with their engine manufacturer Renault and lamented the dominance of their rivals, calling for the FIA {{to step in and}} apply rule changes to level the field, fearing that the public would lose interest in the sport if nothing happened. Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously, telling his rivals to [...] "get your fucking head down and work to sort it out", but later {{made it clear that he}} [...] "didn't mean the f-word in relation to him" [...] regarding the comments by Christian Horner. Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season, saying during the post-race press conference: [...] "I hope we can have a good fight. That would be awesome." [...] This statement caused amusement from Sebastian Vettel, who replied: [...] "Be honest. Do you really hope so? Seriously? You finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it's going to be closer? So you hope you slow down? Is that what you're saying?" ...|$|E
500|$|<b>After</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{felt was}} a period of bad episodes {{culminating}} with [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine praised [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as a [...] "palate cleanser, reminding us that this show is meant to be, above all else, fun". He described the episode as an [...] "expected pleasure, disarming in a way [...] hasn't been since Season One, back before these people became jaded by [...] "Others" [...] and consumed with tedious busy work while the show's producers figured out what frequently disappointing direction to push them in next." [...] Dignan did however acknowledge that others might not have found the episode as enjoyable as he did. Erin Martell of TV Squad wasn't sure what to think of the episode, believing that it was [...] "entertaining" [...] but produced nothing new for viewers. She did note that the characters are now in place to take action for following episodes, and hoped that the episode's [...] "slow-moving events" [...] were [...] "building up to some serious resolution". Rather than dismiss the episode for lacking a mythology-related storyline, Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a joyous and poignant hour of television", and said that it [...] "could very well be a cleverly crafted allegory for the history of The Dharma Initiative on The Island." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, it was {{announced}} that Austin, Texas would host the return of the United States Grand Prix, the first since Indianapolis in 2007. Known as the Circuit of the Americas, the venue will be a brand-new, purpose-built permanent circuit designed by event promoter Tavo Hellmund and 1993 Grand Prix Motorcycle World Champion Kevin Schwantz with the assistance of German architect and circuit designer Hermann Tilke. In November 2011, Bernie Ecclestone expressed [...] "minor" [...] doubt over the race going ahead <b>after</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> described as [...] "disagreements inside the [...] company" [...] and gave the circuit owners and race organisers a deadline of 7 December – coinciding with the meeting of the FIA World Motorsports Council and the release of the final 2012 calendar – to sort out their differences or else risk losing the event entirely. The final calendar included the race, with Ecclestone confirming that a new arrangement had been made, and that the event organisers had paid their circuit sanctioning fees for 2012. The race was originally scheduled to be held in June, but was moved back to become the penultimate event of the season in response to concerns over the heat of the Texas summer and its effects on teams, drivers and spectators, and the failure of race organisers to meet a key deadline for the race sanctioning fees.|$|E
