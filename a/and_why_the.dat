5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on how <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> disease develops, {{as well as providing}} ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Sheindlin has {{authored}} seven books. In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published {{her first}} book, “Don’t Pee On My Leg and Tell Me It’s Raining,” {{in which she}} offers her insight into how <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. “Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever,” her second book, was published in January 1999. A New York Times best seller, the book challenges women {{to be the best}} they can be.|$|E
5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, the {{exponential}} function {{can be characterized}} in many ways. The following characterizations (definitions) are most common. This article discusses why each characterization makes sense, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> characterizations are independent of and equivalent to each other. As a special case of these considerations, we will see that the three most common definitions given for the mathematical constant e are also equivalent to each other.|$|E

Yet, the Central Bank had the power to issue directives to the Financial Regulator if it thought it was conducting its business in a way that was contrary to overall Central Bank policy aims. None were issued.|$|E

25|$|The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge {{conspiracy}} theory {{is the argument}} that U.S. Government officials had advance knowledge of Japan's December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Ever since the Japanese attack there has been debate as to how <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> United States had been caught off guard, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans for an attack. In September 1944, John T. Flynn, a co-founder of the non-interventionist America First Committee, launched Pearl Harbor revisionism when he published a forty-six page booklet entitled The Truth about Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|The Zachman Framework is an {{enterprise}} ontology {{and is a}} fundamental structure for Enterprise Architecture which provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining {{an enterprise}}. The ontology is a two dimensional classification schema that reflects the intersection between two historical classifications. The first are primitive interrogatives: What, How, When, Who, Where, <b>and</b> <b>Why.</b> <b>The</b> second {{is derived from the}} philosophical concept of reification, the transformation of an abstract idea into an instantiation. The Zachman Framework reification transformations are: Identification, Definition, Representation, Specification, Configuration and Instantiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the anomaly is disputed. A widely {{accepted}} view, but not the official view, states that the road was set out by two surveyors, one moving north and the other moving south, each of whom set out {{the road to the}} right of their survey line. Another widely held belief is that the change of course was designed to protect a large tree which formerly stood at the site where the kink is. However, why during the development of a milling area a single tree would be protected, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> road would not return to its original line after passing the tree are both unexplained by this theory.|$|E

25|$|As the social, political, and {{cultural}} influences change a society, most historians revise and update their explanation of historical events. The old consensus, based upon limited evidence, might {{no longer be}} considered historically valid in explaining the particulars — of cause and effect, of motivation and self-interest — that tell How? <b>and</b> <b>Why?</b> <b>the</b> past occurred as it occurred; therefore, the historical revisionism of the factual record is revised to concord with the contemporary understanding of history. As such, in 1986, the historian John Hope Franklin described four stages in the historiography of the African experience {{of life in the}} U.S., which were based upon different models of historical consensus.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{a genetic}} linkage test became {{available}} which appears promising. This {{is not a}} test which confirms if a dog has, or {{does not have the}} disease; nor will it definitively predict the disease, as even if a dog is a JDC carrier this does not guarantee its offspring will suffer the disease. It only links certain strains of DNA as carriers of JDC. This is significant in that these strains can now largely be deselected for in the breeding process, as has been successful with GM1 Storage Disease (see above). The test is not yet complete for every bloodline, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> identified strains are implicated is still unknown, and so in essence the cause of the condition remains a mystery to be solved.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Merkerson {{became the}} host of the show Find Our Missing which {{highlights}} the search for missing people of color. It is designed to put names and faces to people of color who have disappeared without a trace. Each episode {{tells the story of the}} missing person or persons, beginning with the day they vanished and the frantic searches by loved ones and investigators to find them. Find Our Missing provides insight into these victims’ lives–their hopes and dreams, what makes them tick, and how they have touched those around them—from the people who know them best. The episodes chronicle the investigations into their disappearances, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> search for them so far has only turned up dead ends.|$|E
