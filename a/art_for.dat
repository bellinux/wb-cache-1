Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers {{for the first few}} years of Amazing, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover <b>art</b> <b>for</b> a science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} of StarCraft have been popular enough to inspire {{the creation of}} several collectable statues and toys. The first series of statues was released by ToyCom in 2003, consisting of a firebat with markings similar to some original StarCraft concept <b>art</b> <b>for</b> the firebat, a hydralisk and one of Tassadar with a ceremonial sword, which is also seen in concept <b>art</b> <b>for</b> the original game. A series of toys were also made available in 1998, featuring two variations of the marine, another hydralisk and a Protoss zealot.

5|$|The great {{majority}} of the art in and around the Houses of Parliament is of British origin, due to a policy of acquiring British <b>art</b> <b>for</b> the building.

5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} <b>art</b> <b>for</b> cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated Evolution was {{released}} in March 2003 on Townsend's independent label, HevyDevy Records.

When he joined Equity he used Jonathan Pryce as his stage name because Equity will only have one actor with any particular name on its books. While at RADA Pryce worked as a door-to-door salesman of velvet paintings. Pryce {{was part of a}} 'new wave' of actors to emerge from the Academy. Others included Bruce Payne, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Kenneth Branagh and Fiona Shaw.|$|E
5|$|At the {{national}} competition, Schools compete based on size and {{are divided into}} three divisions (I, II, and III).

5|$|Born in New York City, {{he spent}} much of his early {{childhood}} in Bogotá, Colombia before moving back to the United States at the age of 12. In his youth, Williamson developed an interest in comic strips, particularly Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon. He took art classes at Burne Hogarth's Cartoonists and Illustrators School, there befriending future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel, who introduced him to the work of illustrators who had influenced adventure strips. Before long, he was working professionally in the comics industry. His most notable works include his science-fiction/heroic fantasy <b>art</b> <b>for</b> EC Comics in the 1950s, on titles including Weird Science and Weird Fantasy.|$|E

5|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{referenced}} in Theme Hospitals introduction scene twice: {{a doctor}} is briefly seen playing a console version, and the Horned Reaper makes a cameo appearance as a patient. Early concept <b>art</b> <b>for</b> Black & White used Dungeon Keepers Horned Reaper to represent creatures.

5|$|Eytel {{returned}} to Germany to study <b>art</b> <b>for</b> 18 months (1897–1898) at the Royal Art School Stuttgart and then re-immigrated to the United States.

Eytel often walked on his travels, covering 400 miles in the Colorado Desert on foot.
