40|$|Abstract Background Previously {{described}} {{methods to}} separate dissolved U(IV) from dissolved U(VI) under acidic anoxic conditions prior to laboratory analysis were ineffective with materials currently available commercially. Three strong <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> were examined for their efficiency in separating, recovering, and preserving both redox states during separation. Results Under oxic conditions, recovery of U(VI) from three <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> (Bio-Rad AG® 1 x 8 Poly-Prep® prefilled columns, Bio-Rad AG® 1 x 8 powder, and Dowex® 1 x 8 powder) ranged from 72 % to 100 % {{depending on the}} dosed mass, eluent volume, and resin selected. Dowex® 1 x 8 resin was the only resin found to provide 100 % recovery of U(VI) with fewer than 5 bed volumes of eluent. Under anoxic conditions, all three resins oxidized U(IV) in aqueous solutions with relatively low U(IV) concentrations (- 6 M). Resin-induced oxidation was observed visually using a leuco dye, safranin-o. Oxidants associated with the resin were irreversibly reduced {{by the addition of}} Ti(III). After anoxic resin pre-treatment, a series of U(IV) /U(VI) mixtures at micro-molar levels were prepared and separated using the Dowex® 1 x 8 resin with 100 % recovery of both U(IV) and U(VI) with no resin-induced changes in oxidation state. Conclusions Currently available <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> with apparently identical physical properties were found to have significantly different recoveries for hexavalent uranium at micro-molar concentrations. A novel qualitative technique was developed to visually assess oxidative capacities of <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> under acidic anoxic conditions. A protocol was developed for pre-treatment and use of currently available <b>anion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>resins</b> to achieve quantitative separation of U(IV) and U(VI) in aqueous solutions with low U(IV) concentrations.
