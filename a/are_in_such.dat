500|$|Saint-Saëns was {{the first}} major French {{composer}} to write piano concertos. His First, in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second, in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works. The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza. The scherzo second movement and presto finale <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work [...] "begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach". The Third Piano Concerto, in E (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines. The Fourth, in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos. According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns [...] "the Beethoven of France" [...] (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor. The work is known as the [...] "Egyptian" [...] concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor, and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing.|$|E

2500|$|In wine tasting, {{there is}} a big {{distinction}} made between what is considered a flaw and a fault. Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics. These include excessive sulfur dioxide, volatile acidity, Brettanomyces or [...] "Brett aromas" [...] and diacetyl or buttery aromas. The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and recognition threshold of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as volatile acidity and Brettanomyces can be considered a fault when they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include acetaldehyde (except when purposely induced in wines like Sherry and Rancio), ethyl acetate and cork taint.|$|E
2500|$|On December 22, 2011, Army {{officials}} {{released the}} report mandated by Congress in December 2010.

The double-checks revealed that records regarding 64,230 (about one-quarter) of the cemetery's 259,978 burial sites contained [...] "discrepancies" [...] that required additional investigation. Arlington National Cemetery officials said in the report that they believed these problems were minor, such as typos in names or dates of death, and that another six months would be needed before these discrepancies could be resolved. Army officials said this did {{not necessarily mean that}} remains are buried in the wrong graves, but could not rule it out. The report also found that many burial and management records from the American Civil War period are missing, many headstones <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> disrepair that they cannot be read, and that significant changes in burial procedures over the years have made it difficult to maintain records and keep track of burials.|$|E
