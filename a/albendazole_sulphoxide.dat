40|$|Ultrastructural {{investigations}} in Fasciola hepatica after the therapy with <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> with Rattus norvegicus and with sheep In {{the course of}} this study several tests were out into whether, and in what concentrations, <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> is suitable for use in therapy against F. hepatica. It was also determined whether the use of an enhancer results in an improvement of efficacy and allows the reduction of the active substance. The study also investigated the effects of <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> on the morphology of the parasite. Parasite tissue was analysed using both transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy in order to determine whether morphological changes occurred under exposure to the active substance. In the animal experimental part of the study, it was found that <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> has a fasciolide effect whether administered orally, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to rats in a dosage of 30 mg per kg bodyweight. In combination with the enhancer, the quantity of active substance in the aforementioned forms of administration can be reduced to 20 mg per kg bodyweight. For pour- on treatment of the infected rats, a dose of 130 mg per kg bodyweight was found to be necessary if <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> was applied by itself. In combination with enhancer the <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> dose for pour- on treatment could be reduced to 90 mg per kg bodyweight. The studies showed that the enhancer itself had no fasziolide effect. It allowed a reduction of the quantity of the active substance required and stoped the secretion of eggs faster. The effective quantity of the active compound in the oral application in sheep was found to be 20 mg <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> per kg bodyweight. The pour- on dosage determined as being necessary in sheep was 20 mg to be 200 mg <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> per kg bodyweight in combination with the enhancer. For the electron microscope examinations, rats were treated with 20 mg and 40 mg <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> per Kg bodyweight. Treatment was given both in the form of <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> alone and in combination with the enhancer. The worms were examined after 24 and 48 hours. Both scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that the higher the dose, the more substantial the damage caused to the worm. It was also found that the damage to the parasite increased the longer it was exposed to the active substance. With use of the enhancer, the damage to F. hepatica was greater and more marked than under treatment with <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> alone. Examination under the scanning electron microscope revealed that the treatment evidently causes marked damage {{to the surface of the}} worm. In all the worms exposed to treatment, swelling of the tegument could be seen, causing the hooks located on top to appear sunken in. Additionally, an accumulation of small blisters and cytoplasmatic debris was observed on the tegument. Under higher dosages and with additional application of the enhancer, furrows occurred in the tegument, with loss of hooks from the worm`s surface. The examinations revealed no differences in reaction between the ventral and the dorsal tegument. However, the damage to the rear end of the worm was more marked than to the front end. With the aid of the TEM images, it was possible to examine the damage caused by <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> alone and in combination with the enhancer to the tegument, intestine and ovary. In all the tissue examined, treatment with the active substance was found to cause damage in the form of extensive vacuole formation. The most severe damage in all the tissue examined was observed in the area of the basal lamina in the form of merging vacuoles. Use of the enhancer intensified the damage, with additionally fissuring. Mitochondrial changes in morphology such as swelling and bursting occured. In some cases, the basal lamina broke away from the surrounding tissue, creating large cavities in the worm tissue in some cases being completely lysed...|$|E

40|$|Trophozoites of the {{protozoan}} parasite Giardia duodenalis {{were exposed}} to various albendazole concentrations for 4 h, washed, fixed and incubated with antibodies raised against albendazole and its two major metabolites <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> and albendazole sulphone. Tubulin antibodies were also used. A peroxidase- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect the primary antibody with transmission electron microscopy or confocal laser scanning microscopy, respectively. Albendazole, a benzimidazole compound, was detected in the mid-dorsal region of trophozoites, <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> in the posterior-dorsal region and albendazole sulphone in clusters above the median bodies. Tubulin was recognised in the ventral disk. This is the first indication that G. duodenalis may be capable of metabolising albendazole and the potential path of the metabolised drug traced within the trophozoite. Fluorescence measurements revealed that <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> binding decreased and albendazole sulphone binding increased with exposure of the trophozoites to increasing albendazole concentration.

Title of diploma thesis: Identification and {{quantification}} of anthelmintics {{and their}} metabolites in tapeworms by LC/MS Biotransformation of anthelmintics, {{as well as}} the activity of biotransformation enzymes, represents areas that are not yet so much explored at the tapeworms. However especially biotransformation enzymes can to a certain extent protect organism of the parasite against effects of anthelmintics (and xenobiotics in general). The ability of the parasite to metabolize administered anthelmintic drug to an inactive metabolite can represent a convenient defence mechanism that may contribute to the formation of resistance. The aim of my thesis was to evaluate the metabolism of selected anthelmintics (<b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide,</b> flubendazole, mebendazole) in Hymenolepis diminuta. Results of metabolism show that the rat tapeworm is unable to oxidize or reduce <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide.</b> Tapeworm is able to reduce mebendazole and flubendazole.

Quinine and chloroquine were the most potent drugs tested (EC 50 values of 8 x 10 (- 9) - 6 x 10 (- 8) mol/L and 5 - 7 x 10 (- 9) mol/L, respectively). Thiabendazole, mebendazole, albendazole sulphone and <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> reached maximum growth inhibitions of 13 - 36 % at the highest concentration tested (1 x 10 (- 4) mol/L). Albendazole (EC 50 range: not achieved- 2 x 10 (- 6) mol/L) and omeprazole (EC 50 range: 2 - 4 x 10 (- 5) mol/L) were the most effective benzimidazoles. The activity of albendazole was pH dependent, as was that of chloroquine, and variable. Albendazole has its primary mode of action on trophozoites, suggesting that the drug may target parasite tubulin polymerization. Omeprazole, although also primarily effective against trophozoites, had additional activity against schizonts and ring forms, suggesting a distinct or additional parasitic target. Given the variable activity of albendazole and its rapid metabolism in vivo into compounds with even less antimalarial activity, it appears unlikely that this benzimidazole will be useful in the treatment of malaria. The rapid activity and different stage-specific profile of the more soluble benzimidazole omeprazole warrants further investigation...|$|E

Blood and faecal {{samples were collected}} from 1 to 120 h post-treatment. The plasma and faecal samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The parent molecule and its sulphoxide and sulphone (FBZSO 2) metabolites did not reach detectable concentrations in any plasma samples following FBZ administration. ABZ was also not detected in any plasma samples, but its sulphoxide and sulphone metabolites were detected, demonstrating that ABZ was completely metabolised by first-pass mechanisms in donkeys. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of FBZSO (0. 49 ??g/mL) and FBZSO 2 (0. 60 ??g/mL) were detected at (tmax) 5. 67 and 8. 00 h, respectively, following administration of FBZSO.

The subjects (34 males and eight females, aged 18 – 52 years and weighing 46 – 66. 5 kg) were randomly allocated to one of the three drug groups. Fourteen were given just DEC (6 mg/kg), another 14 were given just albendazole (400 mg) and the remaining 14 were given both DEC (6 mg/kg) and albendazole (400 mg). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic study were collected at speci� ed intervals before and after drug administration. Plasma concentrations of DEC and albendazole/albendazole sulphoxide were estimated using gas chromatography and HPLC, respectively. The safety and tolerability of the treatments were evaluated through clinical and laboratory assessments. Both the DEC and albendazole were well tolerated when given alone or in combination, no adverse events being observed. In all three treatment groups, the drugs were rapidly absorbed from the gastro–intestinal tract although there was marked inter-individual variation. The pharmacokinetics of DEC, albendazole and <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> were similar, whether each drug was given alone or in combination. These results indicate that there is no adverse pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reason why DEC and albendazole should not be co-administered to control lymphatic � filariasis...|$|E
40|$|A randomized, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{trial was}} conducted, {{to determine whether}} the co-administration of ivermectin with albendazole is safe and more effective against Onchocerca volvulus than ivermectin alone, and whether a significant pharmacokinetic interaction occurs. Forty-two male onchocerciasis patients received ivermectin (200 mug/kg) alone, albendazole (400 mg) alone or the combination. Safety was determined from the results of detailed clinical and laboratory examinations before treatment, during hospitalization and on day 30. Microfilaricidal efficacy was estimated from the reductions in skin counts between day 0 (pretreatment) and day 30. To determine efficacy against the adult worms, two independent observers examined histology slides prepared from nodules excised on day 180; changes in the skin counts of skin microfilariae between days 30 and 365 provided additional indicators of the level of adulticidal activity. Pharmacokinetic parameters for ivermectin and <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> were defined over 72 h post-treatment. The co-administration of ivermectin with albendazole did not produce more severe adverse effects than ivermectin alone. Both nodule examiners found that the combination was not macrofilaricidal and that it was not clearly superior to ivermectin alone in the effects on reproductive activity; this was supported by the similar efficacy of the two regimens in the suppression of skin microfilariae. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Although the co-administration of ivermectin with albendazole appears safe, it offers no advantage over ivermectin alone in the control of onchocerciasis. The combination does not require an alteration in the dosage of either component...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} infectious diseases with high morbidity rates particularly in young children and in pregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) is an effective way to reduce morbidity of malaria in pregnancy and to reduce neonatal morbidity. Sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) is the recommended drug for IPTp in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of increasing resistance against SP there is a need to develop alternative drugs to replace SP for IPTp. Among the most promising candidate drugs in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. Besides their antimalarial activity, these antimalarial drugs show significant antibacterial activity when given as IPTp. This antibacterial activity may offer several additional public health benefits when used as IPTp in pregnant women. These drugs may– besides protecting from malaria in pregnancy - treat and prevent often undetected sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). In this thesis, three studies are presented focusing on infectious diseases highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. In the first study, the activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in vitro in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy. Results of this study demonstrated that SP was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All tested Gram-positive bacteria, except Enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. Additionally, azithromycin was active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro activity against all other tested pathogens. These data indicate that the use of azithromycin may be associated with most collateral benefit in curing and preventing concomitant bacterial infections. In the second study the impact of routine IPTp with mefloquine (MQ) and SP on Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) was evaluated. GBS is an important cause of early neonatal infections leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. In this nested randomized controlled clinical trial GBS colonization rates in pregnant women were assessed. The overall prevalence of recto-vaginal GBS colonization was comparable to published findings in industrialized countries. Demographic characteristics showed significant association between GBS colonization and literacy. No difference of maternal GBS colonization was observed between SP- and MQ-IPTp regimes. This finding indicates that SP-IPTp was not superior to MQ-IPTp in preventing GBS colonization in pregnant women in Gabon. In another analysis of the above described IPTp study, the prevalence of human herpes virus 8 (HHV- 8) infections was assessed in Gabon. HHV- 8 infection is associated with Karposi-sarcoma, Castleman disease and other malignant conditions and is known to be highly prevalent in Central Africa. In this sero-epidemiological study it was shown that 39 % of pregnant women were seropositive for HHV- 8 infections. Among 35 % of seropositive women, real time PCR showed one pregnant women with detectable viraemia in peripheral blood. In analysis of cord blood samples of sero-positive women, no vertical transmission of HHV- 8 was observed. Finally, a pharmacokinetic analysis of albendazole for the treatment of extra-hepatic echinococcosis is presented. Echinococcosis is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and medical treatment is one option in resource limited settings. Here the ability of albendazole and its active metabolite <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> to penetrate into Echinococcus granulosus cysts of patients with non-liver cysts was investigated. Analysis of two patients with lung and soft tissue cysts demonstrated a satisfactory penetration of <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> into Echinococcus cysts. These data underline the usefulness of albendazole therapy in extra-hepatic cystic echinococcosis...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> (ABZSO), administered to Wistar rats during pregnancy on embryonic, foetal and placental parameters. A colpocytological control was performed daily and detection of spermatozoa in the vaginal smear was considered as day 0 of pregnancy. For the preimplantational study, ABZSO (10 mg/kg) was orally administered at day 2 of pregnancy; at day 4 the embryos were collected. For the postimplantational study, ABZSO (10 mg/kg) was orally administered by gavages at day 2, 6 or 10 of pregnancy (G 2, G 6 and G 10 Groups respectively); the control group was administered the same volume of carboxymethylcellulose vehicle used to prepare the drug suspension. Fetuses were obtained from pregnant rats sacrificed on day 20 of gestation. Maternal body weight gains were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA test. Embryonic and foetal variables were analized on a per litter basis by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Skeletal anomalies were analyzed using an X 2 test. The significance level accepted was established at P 0. 05). The number of fetuses and the foetal vesicles weight were lower in the G 10 group (P< 0. 05). This group showed {{the highest percentage of}} resorptions (P< 0. 05) and fetuses morphologically abnormal. An {{increase in the number of}} bones affected in fetuses of G 6 and G 10 groups was observed. The most common malformations were at vertebral, costal and head level. Weights and placental diameters were lower in the G 10 group (P< 0. 05). We conclude that ABZSO at the dose used in this study affects the cleavage rate in preimplantational embry...|$|E
40|$|Background. Postoperative {{recurrence}} {{of the liver}} hydatid disease befalls approximately 10 − 30 % of patients. Preoperative or postoperative therapy with albendazole in single therapeutic protocol (800 mg/d, within 28 days) indicated the need to evaluate the hydatid cyst liquid protoscoleces viability. Morphological changes of protoscoleces following the treatment with drugs are not well known. Aim. To estimate the viability of protoscoleces after preoperative or postoperative albendazole therapy, and their ability for cystic metamorphosis. Methods. A prospective, randomized clinical trial included 30 patients with liver hydatid disease, treated with albendazole and surgically (I group), and 30 patients {{in the control group}} treated only surgically (II group). The concentration of albendazole and its active metabolite <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> in the cysts contents were determined using HPLC. Estimation of protoscoleces viability was based on the established micromorphologic criteria, and compared between the patients treated with albendazole, and the patients treated only surgically. Biological assessment of the viability was performed on protoscoleces with uncertain signs of the disturbed viability (unchanged structure, evaginated, without movements) using intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of protoscoleces prepared suspension to AO type of rats. Results. The concentration of albendazole in cysts' contents ranged from 0 to 64. 9 μg/ml, and of its active metabolite from 0. 5 to 40. 8 μg/ml. The presence of fully viabile protoscoleces in the albendazol treated patients was significantly lower than in the control group. A significant difference was noticed in the presence of disintegrated protoscoleces without movements in the albendazol treated group, compared to the control group. Biological assessment of the viability showed incapability of these protoscoleces for cystic metamorphoses. Conclusion. Low viability of parasites due to medicamentous therapy is very useful and important to surgeons, because the fertility of cysts is lower, and the risk of the disease recurrence is reduced...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the plasma disposition and faecal excretion of netobimin (NTB) and its respective metabolites {{as well as the}} efficacy against strongyles in horses following oral administration. Netobimin (10 mg/kg) was administered orally to 8 horses. Blood and faecal samples were collected from 1 to 120 h post-treatment and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using a chiral phase-based HPLC, plasma disposition of ABZSO enantiomers produced was also determined. Faecal strongyle egg counts (EPG) were performed by a modified McMaster???s technique before and after the treatment. Neither NTB nor ABZ were present and only <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> (ABZSO) and sulphone metabolites (ABZSO 2) were detected in the plasma samples. Maximum plasma concentration of ABZSO (0. 53 ?? 0. 14 ??g/ml) and ABZSO 2 (0. 36 ?? 0. 09 ??g/ml) were observed at (tmax) 10. 50 and 19. 50 h, respectively following administration of NTB. The area under the curve (AUC) of the two metabolites was similar to each other. Netobimin was not detected, and ABZ was predominant in faecal samples. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of (???) ABZSO was significantly higher than (+) ABZSO, but the area under the curves (AUCs) of the enantiomer were not significantly different each other in plasma samples. The enantiomers of ABZSO were close to racemate in the faecal samples analyzed. Netobimin reduced the EPG by 100 %, 100 %, 77 %, 80 % and 75 % 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks post-treatment, respectively. The specific behaviour of the two enantiomers probably reflects different enantioselectivity of the enzymatic systems of the liver which are responsible for sulphoxidation and sulphonation of ABZ. Considering the pharmacokinetic and efficacy parameters NTB could be used as an anthelmintic in horses...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of albendazole (ABZ) {{and its main}} metabolites <b>albendazole</b> <b>sulphoxide</b> (ABZSO), albendazole sulphone (ABZSO(2)) and albendazole 2 -aminosulphone (NH(2) ABZSO(2)) were investigated in bulk milk and milk products after administration of a single oral dose of the drug (12. 5 mg/kg) to 80 Laticauda sheep. An analytical method was developed for this investigation from an existing procedure used for the determination of these compounds in plasma and digesta samples. No traces of the parent compound or NH(2) ABZSO(2) were found in milk or milk products, {{with the exception of}} the milk collected 36 h after treatment in which 89 mu g NH(2) ABZSO(2) /kg was detected. Results indicated that ABZ was rapidly oxidized to ABZSO and then to ABZSO(2). These metabolites were found at high levels (1 - 4 mg/kg) in milk collected within 24 h after treatment. Products derived from such milk also contained high concentrations of the two oxidized metabolites, including up to 5 mg ABZSO/kg in Pecorino cheese. Only small quantities of these two metabolites were found in milk collected during the second day after treatment (range 50 - 500 mu g/kg). They were no longer detectable in milk collected during the third day after dosing; nor were they found in products made from such milli. These findings confirm that the two polar metabolites ABZSO and ABZSO(2) were efficiently excreted from the body. Considering that the established maximum residue limit for ovine milk is 100 mu g/kg for ABZ plus its metabolites, our results confirmed the appropriateness of the currently prescribed withdrawal time (3 d) after the use of ABZ in lactating sheep. However, considerable levels of ABZSO were detected in milk collected within 24 h after treatment as well as in products and by-products derived from such milk. Owing to the known toxicity of the ABZSO, we stress the need for careful control to ensure adherence to the prescribed withdrawal time...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintic resistance in Haemonchus contortus was investigated. The total binding (TB), low-affinity binding (LAB) and high-affinity (specific) binding (HAB) of ($ sp 3 $H) BZs (mebendazole (MBZ), oxibendazole (OBZ), albendazole (ABZ) and oxfendazole (OFZ)) in supernatants derived from BZ-susceptible (S) and BZ-resistant (R) strains were examined and compared. The TB of all ($ sp 3 $H) BZs was reduced for the R strain. The TB of OBZ, MBZ and ABZ was separated into LAB and HAB. However, OFZ bound with low-affinity. The binding affinity, K$ sb{ rm a},$ and maximum binding, B$ sb{ rm max},$ for the HAB of OBZ and MBZ were calculated using computer programs. Compared with the S strain, the B$ sb{ rm max}$ of the R strain was reduced but the K$ sb{ rm a}$ was not affected. LAB to parasite preparations devoid of tubulin was observed but HAB occurred to preparations containing tubulin only. The HAB per mg protein decreased from egg through larva to adult stage. It was shown by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blot and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) analysis that the tubulin content per mg protein decreased from egg, through larva to adult worm.
