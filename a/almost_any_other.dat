5|$|Tyrannosaurids walked {{exclusively}} on their hindlimbs, so their leg bones were massive. In {{contrast to the}} forelimbs, the hindlimbs were longer compared to body size than <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> theropods. Juveniles and even some smaller adults, like more basal tyrannosauroids, had longer tibiae than femora, a characteristic of fast-running dinosaurs like ornithomimids. Larger adults had leg proportions characteristic of slower-moving animals, {{but not to the}} extent seen in other large theropods like abelisaurids or carnosaurs. The third metatarsals of tyrannosaurids were pinched between the second and fourth metatarsals, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} armament plan Kronan was to be equipped with 124–126guns; 34–36guns {{on each of the}} gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and sterncastle decks. Guns were classed by the weight of the cannonballs they fired, varying between 3 and 36pounds (1.3–15.3kg). The guns themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 tons) with the heaviest pieces placed {{in the middle of the}} lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on the decks above. Kronans most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> warship. The guns lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict damage on the enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.|$|E

5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E

5000|$|Participatory documentaries {{believe that}} it is {{impossible}} for the act of filmmaking to not influence or alter the events being filmed. What these films do is emulate the approach of the anthropologist: participant-observation. Not only is the filmmaker part of the film, we also {{get a sense of how}} situations in the film are affected or altered by their presence. Nichols: [...] "The filmmaker steps out from behind the cloak of voice-over commentary, steps away from poetic meditation, steps down from a fly-on-the-wall perch, and becomes a social actor (<b>almost)</b> like <b>any</b> <b>other.</b> (<b>Almost</b> like <b>any</b> <b>other</b> because the filmmaker retains the camera, and with it, a certain degree of potential power and control over events.)" [...] The encounter between filmmaker and subject becomes a critical element of the film. Rouch and Morin named the approach cinéma vérité, translating Dziga Vertov's kinopravda into French; the [...] "truth" [...] refers to the truth of the encounter rather than some absolute truth.|$|R

40|$|How did {{free and}} fair {{democratic}} elections lead to the extraordinary anti-democratic Nazi Party winning control of the Weimar Republic? The profound implications of this question have led "Who voted for Hitler?" {{to be the most}} studied question in the history of voting behavior research. Yet, despite the overwhelming attention, scholars have treated these elections as unique events and comparison with other elections as mostly irrelevant. Indeed, the literature rarely builds on insights from voting behavior research in political science or from modern statistical methods. By adding these approaches, we find that some of the most widely accepted current theories of Nazi voting do not distinguish the Weimar elections from <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> <b>others,</b> in <b>any</b> country. Like some researchers, we adopt a restrospective voting account, but we also recognize that the voters who were most hurt by the economic depression and hence most likely to oppose the government fall into two separate groups with divergent interests.

25|$|Despite his {{preoccupation with}} the stage, and later with his {{official}} duties, Schubert found time during these years for {{a significant amount of}} composition.

The reason he left it unfinished—after two movements and sketches some way into a third—remains an enigma, and it is also remarkable that he did not mention it to any of his friends, even though, as Brian Newbould notes, he must have felt thrilled by what he was achieving.

25|$|The {{range of}} the marimba has been {{gradually}} expanding, with companies like Marimba One adding notes up to F above the normal high C (C7) on their 5.5 octave instrument, or marimba tuners adding notes lower than the low C on the 5 octave C2. Adding lower notes is somewhat impractical; as the bars become bigger and the resonators become longer, the instrument must be taller and the mallets must be heavier {{in order to produce}} a tone rather than just a percussive attack. Adding higher notes is also impractical because the hardness of the mallets required to produce the characteristic tone of a marimba are much too hard to play with in <b>almost</b> <b>any</b> <b>other,</b> lower range on the instrument.|$|E
