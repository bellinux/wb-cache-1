5|$|Ivall's Farm House is on {{the south}} side of the road near the Star Inn. It is a timber framed and cruck-built (<b>A-frame)</b> tiled roof {{building}} with a lobby entrance, previously a farmhouse, originally built around 1600. The south end dates to the 18th century.The tiled roof, with four small gabled dormers, half-hipped at the north west angle, was restored in the late 20th century. It became a Grade II listed building on 31 July 1963. Holt Cottage is a small thatched cottage situated on the edge of the village and was built in 1503. A Grade II listed building since 31 May 1985, much of the current building dates to the 17th and early 19th centuries. The roof is half-hipped at the south end and hipped at the north, with painted brickwork in monk bond.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 the {{advanced}} platoon of E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived {{on top of}} Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. Some of the engineers fired on the E Company men before the latter identified themselves. The E Company platoon went into position {{on the right of}} Vandygriff, and Kennedy turned over command of the combined force to the E Company commander. Kennedy then assembled 12 wounded men and started down the mountain with them. The party was under small arms fire most of the way. A carrying party of Korean <b>A-frame</b> porters led by an American officer had started up the mountain during the morning with supplies. North Korean fire, killing several of the porters, turned it back.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the chassis}} {{components}} {{were the same}} as the first generation (the <b>A-frames</b> {{between the first and second}} generation were the same although they were originally sourced from GM's G-body vehicle lineup), along with the steering knuckle, leaf springs, and differential assembly but suspension and axles were greatly enhanced. Lower <b>A-frames</b> for the 2WD had 1/4 inch thicker steering stops - the second generation <b>A-frames</b> are commonly used as an upgrade for the first generation. Utility models (Blazer, Jimmy, Bravada) came with thicker front and rear sway bars.|$|R

25|$|Oscar Dyson has a traction-type oceanographic winch {{which can}} deploy up to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) of 17-mm (0.67-inch) wire rope or other cable, {{including}} fiberoptic cable. She also has two hydrographic winches, {{each of which}} can deploy 3,600 meters (11,811 feet) of 9.5-mm (3/8-inch) EM cable, two trawl winches, each of which can deploy 4,300 meters (14,107 feet) of cable, and a Gilson winch. She has a 60-foot (18.3-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 6,250 pounds (2,835 kg) aft and a 23-foot (7-meter) fixed boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454kg) at her bow. She has an <b>A-frame</b> on her starboard side with a safe working load of 8,050 pounds (3,651kg) and a large <b>A-frame</b> aft. The oceanographic winch and large after <b>A-frame</b> work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side <b>A-frame</b> to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Oscar Dyson the capability to have two scientific packages ready for sequential operations. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Oscar Dyson also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays.|$|E

Each of the winches serves a specialized function ranging from trawling to hydrographic surveys.|$|R
50|$|The STbK and the Notenkopfkeramik are a {{development}} of the LBK. Much of the Musical Note pottery features incised zig-zag bands going around the pot, with punctures at the line segment junctions. The STK abandons incision in favor bands of small punctures, also in zig-zag patterns, with a vertical band dividing each angle. The effect is a band pattern of contiguous <b>A-frames.</b>|$|R
25|$|Trinity Lutheran Church — now {{occupying a}} large but undistinguished <b>A-frame</b> {{building}} on Ottawa Street {{in the heart}} of Germantown — remains the centre of Regina's Lutheran constituency, though Canadian Lutheranism, while maintaining the historic episcopacy and indeed being in full communion with the Anglican Church of Canada, does not designate metropolitan churches as cathedrals. Trinity for many years maintained a traditional German parish church in Germantown; in due course, when it had built its new modern building, it sold its impressive German pipe organ to an Anglican parish church.|$|E
25|$|The Roadsport {{is now the}} second-level {{offering}} from Caterham. It {{is available}} in both S3 and SV chassis sizes, and {{is more or less}} the former Classic with a more powerful engine and a few more extras as standard: heater; hood; spare wheel/carrier; carpets. The engine options are based around the Ford Sigma 1.6 (125bhp, 140bhp) and the Ford Duratec 2.0 (175bhp). Suspension is double-wishbone and anti-roll bar at the front; de dion axle located by an <b>A-frame</b> at the rear, where the old Classic specification had a live-axle set-up.|$|E
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} {{outrigger trawler}} (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship <b>A-frame</b> or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|E
50|$|The campus {{consists}} of 230 acre of wood- and grasslands, including eight cabins {{on the west}} side of campus, each able to house five students, and twelve <b>A-frames</b> on the east side of campus, each capable of housing two students. All cabins are heated with wood-burning stoves in the winter. Each residential area has a bath house, each containing four sinks, four toilets, and two showers.|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} timber viaducts on the line: the most {{important}} was the Thames crossing between Wargrave and Shiplake; it was constructed of three main spans of 40 feet using <b>A-frames</b> by which the clearance beneath the truss is maximised. There were 16 approach spans between 25ft 6in and 32 feet span. It {{was replaced by a}} masonry and iron structure in 1895 - 1898.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{they have}} only two [...] "legs", <b>A-frames</b> are usually set up in rows {{so that they can}} have good stability. A saw horse {{is a good example of}} this structure. More complex {{structures}} will have a crossmember connecting the two materials in the middle to prevent the legs from bowing outwards under load, giving the structure the appearance of the capital letter A.|$|R
25|$|The Contemporary Tower, {{the most}} {{prominent}} of the resort's four stand-alone buildings, was built as an <b>A-frame</b> with outer walls which slope inwards around an inner atrium. This design was a collaboration by Disney, the United States Steel Corporation, and Los Angeles architect Welton Becket. To construct the building, steel frames were erected on-site and modular pre-constructed rooms, designed by California architect Donald Wexler, were lifted into place by crane. Most of Disney's Polynesian Village Resort and the Court of Flags Resort were built the same way, except rooms were stacked instead of slid in.|$|E
25|$|On 21 July 2/9 Marines {{discovered}} a major NVA bunker complex 6km southwest of Con Thien. Composed of 60 <b>A-frame</b> timbered bunkers {{built into the}} sides of bomb craters, each with an average overhead cover 10-feet-thick, the system was connected to a large command bunker by a network of interconnecting tunnels. The command bunker featured an aperture overlooking Con Thien and C-2 and documents found in the bunker indicated that the NVA had been observing and reporting the movement of helicopters, tanks, and trucks entering and leaving Con Thien and C-2.|$|E
25|$|Kikutake's {{vision for}} {{floating}} towers was partly realised in 1975 when he {{designed and built}} the Aquapolis for the Okinawa Ocean Expo. The 100 x 100 meter floating city block contained accommodation that included a banquet hall, offices and residences for 40 staff and {{it was built in}} Hiroshima and then towed to Okinawa. Further unbuilt floating city projects were undertaken, including a floating city in Hawaii for ocean research and a plug-in floating <b>A-frame</b> unit containing housing and offices that could have been used to provide mobile homes {{in the event of a}} natural disaster.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{buildings}} are straw bale, adobe brick, and straw clay structures and were built by residents of Lama and/or participants in natural building workshops. Common structures were adobe with vigas and latillas, or <b>a-frames</b> - with names like [...] "Muffin House", [...] "Tower House", and [...] "Orange Room". A massive forest fire in 1996 destroyed 24 of the community's buildings, though the central complex survived.|$|R
5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with <b>A-frames</b> as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} mountains to the front lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work, at an average of about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, {{the company}} {{manufactured}} <b>A-frames,</b> wooden boxes, and wings for the de Havilland Mosquito, and also repaired gliders, returning to furniture manufacturing after the war. The company was {{listed on the}} London Stock Exchange in 1950. The company's reclining chairs became a signature item during the 1960s. The company opened new factory in Chipping Norton in the 1960s, which closed in 2003. Other factories in Andover and Bridgend were also closed in 2003.|$|R
