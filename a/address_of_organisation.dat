40|$|Organisation {{culture is}} {{increasingly}} seen {{as important in}} sustaining the competitive position <b>of</b> <b>organisations.</b> An innovation culture is perceived as the behavioural norms, attitudes, beliefs and (frequently unspoken) rules related to knowledge sharing and decision-making and as such these have a significant influence the management of innovation. During industry based research studies {{in the fields of}} inter-organisational collaboration and innovation there are increasing references to "a culture of collaboration" and the need for an "innovative culture" in these fields. If organisations are to achieve beneficial outcomes from active collaboration and from embracing innovation as part of that process they need to <b>address</b> issues <b>of</b> <b>organisation</b> culture. Market and value drivers shape organisation culture, with market drivers influencing what things are done, and value drivers influencing how they are done and what outcomes the organisation is altempting to achieve. This paper presents an approach used to characterise aspects of innovation culture, and analyses these aspects within two organisations in Australia. The first case study is a not-for-profit company that seeks to be a "centre for toolmaking innovation". The company was established by a number of relatively small companies associated with the toolmaking industry who realised there were many things that needed to be done to support their long term viability that they could not do on their own. The second case study' is a highly innovative and entrepreneurial firm with strong leadership provided by the CEO and owner. The analysis shows that there are different operational attributes needed to engender an innovative culture in the two organisations and that leadership does shape the approach taken and the organisational outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is a {{prominent}} framework that <b>addresses</b> the challenge <b>of</b> <b>organisations</b> {{to understand and}} promote the factors that lead to acceptance of new technologies. Nevertheless, our understanding {{of one of the}} model's key variables – social influence – remains limited. Drawing upon earlier studies that <b>address</b> the role <b>of</b> referent individuals to technology acceptance, this paper introduces the notion of ‘coalition’ as a social group that can affect the opinion of other members within an organisation. Our empirical study centres on an organisation that has recently decided to introduce Big Data into its formal operations. Through a unique empirical approach that analyses sentiments expressed by individuals about this technology on the organisation's online forum, we demonstrate the emergence of a central referent, and in turn the dynamics of a coalition that builds around this referent as the attitudes of individuals converge upon the Big Data issue. Our paper contributes to existing TAM frameworks by elaborating the social influence variable and providing a dynamic lens to the technology acceptance process. We concurrently offer a methodological tool for organisations to understand social dynamics that form about a newly introduced technology and accelerate its acceptance by employees...|$|R

40|$|Management and {{administration}} in higher learning institutions becoming more complex, facing more demanding expectations from stakeholders, {{and a more}} limited financial resources. Hence, the university and faculty administrators must understand their internal environment for an improved sense of identity, purpose, and efficiency. High levels of conflict and tension between the academic staff and administrative staff in higher learning institutions can cause institutional paralysis. However, {{research in the area}} remains sparse. This study seeks to identify the levels of conflict and clarify reasons for gaps between academic staff and administrative staff in local higher learning institution. This understanding may allows leadership in these institutions to effectively manage conflict and tension for healthier and more productive internal environment. Using the higher education and organizational study literature domains, questions were formulated to <b>address</b> areas <b>of</b> <b>organisation</b> visions, organisation management, job dimensions, and job satisfactions. A survey was conducted among academic staff and administrative staff in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai to explore areas for conflicts found between these two groups. Differences in means were calculated to distinguish the differences of perceptions between academic staff and administrative staff. It was found that perception towards university visions, management, and job dimension issues shows a conflicting viewpoints with academic and administrative staff.

Reform proposals either <b>address</b> the <b>Organisation</b> <b>of</b> Economic Co-operation and Development approach to international profit allocation or target tax bases {{that are less}} mobile than profits. This paper investigates cash flow as a tax base. A business cash flow tax abolishes current accrual accounting and {{has the potential to}} block international profit shifting. Financing vanishes to become a tax-planning tool because the investments’ market return is tax free under a cash flow tax. Profit shifting via intra-group transactions is eliminated if the business cash flow tax is based on the country of destination principle. However, a destination-based business cash flow tax might distort the investment decisions of international groups...|$|R

But it also presents an interesting opportunity in the small-scale food production sector. Drying food offers the chance to increase the value of surplus seasonal produce and earn extra income. The expansion of vegetable farms and the development of urban markets have opened up new perspectives for improving traditional drying methods and developing the potential of this food processing technique. This manual, from the Groupe énergies renouvelables et environnement (GERES), a French NGO with more than a decade s experience in the field of food drying, offers a step-by-by step guide to anyone thinking of setting themselves up in business in this sector. The easy-to-follow text describes the technology involved in some detail, including technical notes on the main dryers available. But it also devotes considerable space to financial issues, with advice on identifying markets, how to increase profits and how to manage cash flow.
