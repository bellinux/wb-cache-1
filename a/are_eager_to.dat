5|$|Olaf Tryggvason's ships {{pass the}} {{anchorage}} of his allied enemies {{in a long}} column without order, as no attack is expected. Conveniently placed to observe the fleet, Jarl Eirik and the two kings remark upon the passing vessels. Svein and Olaf <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> join battle, but Eirik is portrayed as more cautious and familiar with the Norwegian forces.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|The Overlords <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{escape from}} their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} emptiness when the children have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of fulfillment. The Earth evaporates in a flash of light. Karellen looks back at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to the human species.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{are sent}} on {{assignment}} {{to make a}} sales pitch to a client, and <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> land the sale. However, Danny Cordray (Timothy Olyphant), a rival paper salesman from the very small Osprey company who steals more potential sales away from Dunder Mifflin than anyone, has also arrived for a sales pitch. Dwight also reveals that Danny had a romantic history with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) four years previously. Jim and Dwight call in Michael Scott (Steve Carell), who is ecstatic at getting {{a chance to make}} a sale, to come and try to save them. The company ends up taking Danny's offer, even after Michael promises at-cost paper sales and weekend delivery. The trio leaves the client's office and head back home, defeated.|$|E

25|$|The Kennewick Man is {{a notable}} example of human remains {{caught in a}} {{struggle}} between scientific merit and cultural traditions.

As {{one of the oldest}} well-preserved ancient skeletons found in America, scientists <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> conduct various testing on the remains. Native American groups, however, have been adamantly calling for his repatriation and reburial, as per their traditions.|$|E

25|$|The team, {{along with}} Ivan, kidnaps Stanton. Frank calls Cooper, {{offering}} to trade Stanton for Sarah. At the meeting point, Dunning arrives. After a short dialogue, Dunning injures Stanton, revealing himself and Cynthia Wilkes to be masterminds behind the assassinations. Disgusted with Wilkes' corruption, Cooper pretends to arrest Frank, but shoots Wilkes. Marvin and Victoria kill Dunning's bodyguards, and Frank kills Dunning by crushing his windpipe. Cooper lets Frank's team go. As {{they leave the}} scene, Frank and Sarah <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{start a new life}} together.|$|E
25|$|Clearing is {{when the}} player in {{possession}} of the ball is pressed hard, often near his own goal, and chooses to shoot the ball away with low precision simply {{in order to get}} out of a dangerous situation. When opponent pressure is extremely high, the ball is often cleared to a corner kick or to a throw-in. Clearing long, but into opponent control, may give the defence time and the opportunity to organise, including setting up the correct formation and pressure height. If the attack was high up the field, such as in or near the penalty area, defenders will thus quickly push out, and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid offside in the next move. Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a long pass or a long through ball. Players high up in the field who are pressed hard, and who <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> avoid a counter-attack, may in some instances combine clearing with a shot.|$|E
25|$|After {{surviving}} {{the tail of}} a typhoon, the Surprise finds the Norfolk wrecked on a reef by the same typhoon and her survivors encamped on an island. Aubrey, Mr Martin and some of the crew take Maturin ashore for surgery; he is in a coma since hitting his head during the typhoon. Just as the surgeon from the Norfolk, Dr Butcher, prepares to operate, Maturin wakes from his coma. A heavy storm blows the Surprise away. Relations between the two marooned groups are tense, because some of the Norfolks were mutineers in 1797 aboard HMS Hermione; they will be hanged by the British. One admits this to Bonden. Aubrey tells the American Captain Palmer that he and his crew are prisoners of war. Both groups <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> leave this island. Aubrey orders his carpenters to lengthen the launch so they can sail away, pushing the rest to collect food. He sees an American whaler on the horizon. The crew of the Norfolk spot the same whaler, cheer at the sight, and then kill their informer. The Norfolks fight with the Surprises. Their cheering stops when the whaler loses two masts and strikes her colours, because it is the Surprise that takes her in chase.|$|E

While recording their third album, Survivor, in late 2000, Beyoncé announced the group would be put on hiatus {{in order for the}} members to produce solo albums in the coming years, which they hoped would boost interest in Destiny's Child. The idea of individual releases emanated from the group's manager and Beyoncé's father, Mathew.|$|E
500|$|The 2011 {{release of}} the Nintendo 3DS, the {{successor}} to the Nintendo DS series of handhelds, was announced on March 23, 2010, to preempt impending news leaks by the Japanese press and to attract potential attendees to the Electronic Entertainment Expo. According to industry analysts, the timing drew attention from the North American launch of the DSi XL. M2 Research senior analyst Billy Pigeon argued the [...] "XL is old news ... in Japan– and Nintendo is a very Japan-centric organization. This is just the corporate parent in Japan maybe not acting {{in the best interest}} of Nintendo of America." [...] Iwata dismissed any significant impact when speaking to concerned investors, [...] "those who <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> buy Nintendo 3DS right after the announcement generally tend to react quickly to anything new on the market, and those who are purchasing a Nintendo DS today tend to react relatively slowly." ...|$|E

Speed overcomes a slow start {{to catch up with}} Taylor, who uses a {{cheating}} device called a spearhook to latch the Mach 6 to his own car. Speed uses his jump jacks to expose the device to video cameras, causing Taylor to crash. Speed wins the race, having successfully exposed Royalton's crimes. While Racer X watches it is revealed in a flashback montage that he really is Rex, who has faked his death and undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance as part of his plan to save his family and the sport of racing. He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family, declaring that he must live with his decision. The Racer family celebrates Speed's victory as Speed and Trixie kiss, and Royalton is sent to jail.|$|E

2500|$|Estrella {{and others}} have {{postulated}} that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks (or bank-like financial institutions).

[...] When the yield curve is upward sloping, banks can profitably take-in short term deposits and make long-term loans so they <b>are</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> supply credit to borrowers. This eventually leads to a credit bubble.|$|E
