In aphasia, the inherent neurological damage is frequently assumed to be a loss of implicit linguistic competence that has damaged or wiped out neural centers or pathways that are necessary for maintenance of the language rules and representations needed to communicate.

The defective approximate number system hypothesis and the <b>access</b> <b>deficit</b> hypothesis were tested using two different groups of children with DD (11 - 13 years old) : a group with arithmetic fact dyscalculia (AFD) and a group with general dyscalculia (GD). Several different aspects of number magnitude processing were assessed in these two groups and compared with age-matched typically achieving children. The GD group displayed weaknesses with both symbolic and nonsymbolic number processing, whereas the AFD group displayed problems only with symbolic number processing. These findings provide evidence that the origins of DD in children with different profiles of mathematical problems diverge. Children with GD have impairment in the innate approximate number system, whereas children with AFD suffer from an <b>access</b> <b>deficit.</b> These findings have implications for researchers selection procedures when studying dyscalculia, and also for practitioners in the educational setting.

40|$|This paper aims at {{clarifying}} {{the nature of}} fact retrieval difficulties in an 18 -year-old young man (MO) who exhibited a puzzling pattern of developmental dyscalculia. Contrasting performance on explicit (production and verification tasks) and implicit (priming) tasks we observed poor overt retrieval of addition and multiplication facts, classical interference effects in verification tasks and inconsistency of error patterns. Hence, MO's performance pattern is suggestive {{of the existence of}} a partly stored network of facts (reflecting imperfect storage), but is also compatible with an <b>access</b> <b>deficit</b> according to Warrington and Cipolotti's [Brain 119 (1996) 611] criteria for distinguishing access and storage deficits in dysphasic patients. Furthermore, while MO displayed interference effects in verification tasks, he did not show automatic access to arithmetic facts in implicit tasks. Finally, similar to the findings of Roussel, Fayol, and Barrouillet [European Journal of Cognitive Psychology 14 (1) (2002) 61] on normal subjects, MO's performance pattern is suggestive of the existence of differential processing mechanisms for addition and multiplication facts. We propose a unifying mechanism, namely a deficit of the central executive of working memory (WM), that accounts both for the constitution of a fuzzy network of fact representations, and for an <b>access</b> <b>deficit</b> modulated by attentional demands as required in explicit/implicit task paradigms. Overall, our results clearly provide evidence that even in (a developmental) case of a non-perfect network of memory representations (e. g.

40|$|The {{starting}} {{purpose of}} this project was to investigate some {{issues related to the}} mechanisms underlying the efficient access to concepts within the semantic memory systems. These issues were mainly related to the role of refractoriness in explaining the comprehension <b>deficits</b> underlying semantic <b>access.</b> The insights derived from this first approach were then used to formulate and test hypotheses about the organization of the contents of the semantic system itself. The first part of the thesis presents an investigation of the semantic abilities of an unselected case-series of patients affected by tumours to either the left or right temporal lobes in order to detect possible semantic access difficulties. Semantic <b>access</b> <b>deficits</b> are typically attributed to the semantic system becoming temporarily refractory to repeated activation. Previous investigations on the topic were mainly based on single case reports, mainly on stroke patients. The rare examples of group studies suggested moreover the possibility that the syndrome might not be functionally unitary. The tasks used in the study were two word-to-picture matching tasks aimed to control for the typical variables held to be able to distinguish semantic access from degradation syndromes (consistency of access, semantic relatedness, word frequency, presentation rate and serial position). In the group of tumour patients tested <b>access</b> <b>deficits</b> were consistently found in patients with high grade tumours in the left posterior superior temporal lobe. However, the patients were overall only weakly affected by the typical temporal factors (presentation rate and serial position) characterizing an access syndrome as refractory. The pattern of deficit, together with the localization data, suggested that the deficit described is qualitatively different from typical semantic access syndromes and possibly caused by the disconnection of posterior temporal lexical input areas from the semantic system. In the second study we tried to answer the question whether semantic <b>access</b> <b>deficits</b> are caused by the co-occurrence of two causes (refractoriness and a lexicalsemantic disconnection) or whether the presence of refractoriness in itself is sufficient to induce all the behavioural effects described in access syndromes. A second aim of the study was moreover to investigate the precise locus of refractory behaviour, since refractory effects have also been reported in naming tasks in which the possibility exists that the interference might be located at a post-semantic lexical stage of processing. To address these issues a series of three behavioural experiments on healthy subjects was conducted. The tasks used were speeded versions of the same word-to picture matching tasks used in the previous study. A speeded paradigm was adopted in order to induce a mild refractory state also in healthy participants. The results showed {{that it was possible to}} induce, in the group of subjects tested, a performance similar to that of refractory semantic access patients. Since no post-semantic stage of processing is assumed to be necessary to perform these tasks it was argued that refractoriness arises due to interference occurring between representations within the semantic system itself. In the second part of the project, the finding that refractoriness arises due to interference involving semantic representations themselves, was used to investigate issues related to the organization of the content within the semantic memory. In particular, a second series of behavioural experiments was performed to investigate whether the way an object is manipulated is indeed a feature that defines manipulable objects at a semantic level. The tasks used were speeded word-to-picture matching tasks similar to those previously described. A significantly greater interference was found in the recognition of objects sharing similar manipulation than in the recognition of objects sharing only visual similarity. Moreover the repeated presentation of objects with similar manipulation created a ‘negative’ serial position effect (with error increasing over presentations), while the repeated presentation of objects sharing only visual similarity created an opposite ‘positive’ serial position effect (learning). The role of manipulability in the semantic representation of manipulable objects was further investigated in the last study of this work. In a second unselected group of brain tumour patients the ability to name living things and artifacts was investigated. Artifacts were manipulable objects, varying in the degree of their manipulability. Results from both behavioural and Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) analyses showed that the only patients showing a selective deficit in naming artifacts (particularly highly manipulable objects) were patients with lesions in the posterior middle and superior portions of the left temporal lobe, an area lying within the basin of those regions involved in processing object-directed actions and previously linked to the processing of manipulable objects in a wide range of studies. The results of these last two studies support ‘property-based networks’ accounts of semantic knowledge rather than ‘undifferentiated network’ accounts. Overall this series of studies represents an attempt to better understand the mechanisms that underlie the access to semantic representations and, indirectly, the structure of representations stored within semantic networks. The insights obtained about the mechanisms of access to stored semantic representations were used as a tool to investigate the structures of the same semantic representations. A combination of different approaches was used (from behavioural speeded interference paradigms on healthy subjects, to neuropsychological case series investigations, as well as Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping technique), to ‘cross-validate’ the results obtained at any level of analysis...|$|R

40|$|Social {{capital has}} so far been {{suggested}} to enhance the career outcomes of disadvantaged immigrants by compensating for their lack of human capital. Contrastingly, by examining labor market outcomes by immigrant groups, my dissertation argues that social capital can actually serve as a source of disadvantages for immigrants in the labor market, especially for a socially disadvantaged immigrant group like Mexican immigrants. Specifically, the dissertation proposes three kinds of social capital processes through which social status and network processes interplay to disadvantage disproportionately a low-status immigrant group in the job attainment process: access, activation, and return deficit of social capital. Using data from the 2005 U. S. Social Capital-USA survey, I examine these three kinds of social capital deficit across three ethnic immigrant groups: Mexican, non-Mexican Hispanic, and non-Hispanic immigrants. The first chapter explores the inequality of social capital across immigrant groups. The result shows that among the three immigrant groups, Mexican immigrants are the only immigrant group who have smaller, less diverse networks than the native-born. This <b>access</b> <b>deficit</b> of social capital for Mexican immigrants is driven primarily by their relative lack of human capital compared with other immigrant groups. The second chapter investigates whether ethnic enclaves constrain the access to social capital of enclave immigrants. The result shows that the constraining effect of ethnic enclaves on the social capital building of enclave immigrants is found only for the ethnic enclave of Mexican immigrants. This is because the ethnic enclaves of disadvantaged immigrants facilitate social connections to other coethnic enclave immigrants with similar socioeconomic traits, while constraining them from extending their networks beyond the enclaves. The <b>access</b> <b>deficit</b> of social capital for Mexican immigrants will eventually aggravate their job prospects because they cannot mobilize social capital for their job finding as much as other immigrant groups do. The third chapter examines the activation and mobilization of social capital in the job attainment process across immigrant groups. The result shows that Mexican immigrants activate and reap the benefit from mobilizing social capital for their job finding in ways that are {{different from those of the}} native-born as well as the high-status immigrant group. Due to their <b>access</b> <b>deficit</b> of social capital and negative stereotypes about them, Mexican immigrants are obliged to use a less rewarding job search method (i. e., using information passed from job contacts) rather than use a more rewarding job search method (i. e., using invitations from job contacts). Although Mexican immigrants benefit to some degrees from using information passed from job contacts in getting low-tier occupations, their heavy reliance on such a job search method can also prevent them from attaining middle- or top-tier occupations. By illuminating these serial processes of social capital in the job attainment for disadvantaged immigrants, my dissertation, therefore, sheds light on a new role of social capital as a source of immigrant disadvantages in the labor market.

40|$|Introduction Semantic {{memory is}} crucial for {{understanding}} and interacting with the world. Contrasting patterns of semantic deficits have been claimed for semantic dementia (SD) patients and comprehension-impaired stroke (SA) patients, leading to the proposal of a separation between semantic knowledge and processes that act on it. Specifically, SD patients have been argued to have a loss of amodal semantic representations, whereas SA patients have an impairment of executive control used to access and manipulate these representations (Jefferies & Lambon Ralph, 2006). In line with these claims, SD patients have shown consistent performance across semantic tasks, while SD patients show consistency only across tasks with similar executive demands. However, the distinction between patients groups is based on studies contrasting {{a relatively small number}} of SD and SA patients and limited testing of SD patients on measures of executive function. Methods The current study overcomes these shortcomings by testing SD and SA patients on several measures of executive function in addition to tasks of semantic comprehension. Comprehension tasks included: picture and word versions of the Camel and Cactus Test, where one must choose which item is most closely associated with a target item from four related items (e. g. camel is associated with cactus, not oak tree, sunflower, or rose); an environmental sounds–picture matching test; auditory word-picture matching with within-category distracters; and picture naming. Executive tasks included: digit and word span, N-back, cued task-set shifting, a modified trail-making task, verbal and non-verbal Stroop, picture-word interference, and the Wisconsin Card Sort Task. Results and Conclusions Results from 5 SD patients and 4 SA patients in our ongoing study suggest similar patterns of impairment on both semantic and executive function tasks for both patient groups. Both showed multi-modal semantic deficits via poor performance on at least 3 out of 5 semantic tasks tapping different modalities. Also, SA and SD patients showed no difference in consistency across semantic tasks (see Fig. 1 a & b). Both groups also showed consistently poor performance on trail-making and verbal Stroop tasks compared to controls (see Figs. 1 c & 1 d). SD patients seem to be less impaired on both span measures (word span range: 2. 17 – 4. 43; digit span: 3. 17 – 5. 5) than SA patients (word span range: 1. 63 – 3. 75; digit span: 1. 17 – 4. 17), and performance was variable for both groups on non-verbal Stroop and picture-word interference. SD patients found many executive tasks too difficult to understand, which may be the reason for limited prior data for them on EF tasks [...] These findings suggest that the use of syndrome categories like semantic dementia and comprehension-impaired stroke aphasia are not useful in distinguishing between storage and <b>access</b> <b>deficits.</b> Patients classified as having SD seem as likely as SA patients to have certain kinds of executive deficits and SA patients may be as likely as SD patients to show consistency across semantic tasks. The results imply that some other behavioral or neuroanatomical basis rather than syndrome classification should be used to address the hypothesized separation of storage vs. control aspects of semantic memory...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case series {{analysis}} {{of a group of}} seven patients with apparent "category-specific" disorders affecting living things. On standard diagnostic tests, a range of deficits were apparent, with some cases appearing to have impaired visual access to stored knowledge, some with impaired semantic knowledge (across modalities), and some with an impairment primarily at a name retrieval stage. Patients with a semantic deficit were impaired for both visual and associative/functional knowledge about living things, whilst patients with a modality-specific <b>access</b> <b>deficit</b> showed worse performance when stored visual knowledge was probed. In addition, patients with impaired access to visual knowledge were affected when perceptual input was degraded by masking, and all patients showed an interaction between perceptual similarity and category when matching pictures to names or defining statements. We discuss the results in terms of the Hierarchical Interactive Theory (HIT) of object recognition and naming (Humphreys and Forde, 2001). We also discuss evidence on lesion sites in relation to research from functional brain imaging on category differences in object identification in normal observers...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{asserted}} {{that children with}} mathematics learning difficulties (MLD) constitute a heterogeneous group. To date, most researchers have investigated differences between predefined MLD subtypes. Specifically MLD children are frequently categorized a priori into groups based on {{the presence or absence}} of an additional disorder, such as a reading disorder, to examine cognitive differences between MLD subtypes. In the current study 226 third to six grade children (M age= 131 months) with MLD completed a selection of number specific and general cognitive measures. The data driven approach was used to identify the extent to which performance of the MLD children on these measures could be clustered into distinct groups. In particular, after conducting a factor analysis, a 200 times repeated K-means clustering approach was used to classify the children's performance. Results revealed six distinguishable clusters of MLD children, specifically (a) a weak mental number line group, (b) weak ANS group, (c) spatial difficulties group, (d) <b>access</b> <b>deficit</b> group, (e) no numerical cognitive deficit group and (f) a garden-variety group. These findings imply that different cognitive subtypes of MLD exist and that these can be derived from data-driven approaches to classification. These findings strengthen the notion that MLD is a heterogeneous disorder, which has implications for the way in which intervention may be tailored for individuals within the different subtypes...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{semantic}} degradation disorders, {{the mechanisms}} and the anatomical underpinnings of semantic access disorders are still unclear. We report {{the results of}} a case series study on the effects of temporal lobe gliomas on semantic access abilities of a group of 20 patients. Patients were tested 1 – 2 days before and 4 – 6 days after the removal of the tumour. Their semantic access skills were assessed with two spoken word-to-picture matching tasks, which aimed to separately control for rate of presentation, consistency and serial position effects (Experiment 1) and for word frequency and semantic distance effects (Experiment 2). These variables have been held to be critical in characterizing access in contrast to degraded-store semantic deficits, with access deficits characterized by inconsistency of response, better performance with slower presentation rates and with semantically distant stimuli, in the absence of frequency effects. Degradation deficits show the opposite pattern. Our results showed that low-grade slowly growing tumours tend not to produce signs of access problems. However, high-grade tumours especially within the left hemisphere consistently produce strong semantic deficits of a clear access type: response inconsistency and strong semantic distance effects in the absence of word frequency effects were detected. However, effects of presentation rate and serial position were very weak, suggesting non-refractory behaviour in the tumour patients tested. This evidence, together with the results of lesion overlapping, suggests the presence of a type of non-refractory semantic <b>access</b> <b>deficit.</b> We suggest tha...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in technology have meant that operators of complex systems, {{such as those}} found in the modern aircraft cockpit, now have access to an unprecedented volume of information. Significant attention within the Human Factors and Ergonomics community has therefore been focussed upon developing methods by which externally represented information can be made as accessible as possible within the interface. However, commensurate attention has not been paid to recent experimental work demonstrating that even millisecond changes to the accessibility of information provided within the interface can have surprisingly large consequences for the deployment of human memory during low-level routine interactive behaviour (Gray, Simms, Fu, & Schoelles, 2006). Therefore, a series of nine studies explored the impact of information accessibility upon more complex human behaviour, with particular emphasis placed upon learning, memory and planning. Three experiments contained within Chapter 2 point to caveats {{associated with the use of}} information fusion as a means of increasing the availability of onscreen information during a series of simulated flight navigation missions. Paradoxically, increasing information availability was found to lead to greater problems for retention of visual-spatial information. The cost of accessing problem solving information was manipulated across three further experiments reported in Chapter 3. Least-effort tradeoffs concerning the use of memory, previously observed during routine copying (Gray et al., 2006), were extended to problem solving and were found to also influence planning behaviour, as reflected by eye-tracker and verbal protocol data. The final three experiments constituting Chapter 4 demonstrated expedited learning during repeated problem solving when task-relevant information was harder to <b>access.</b> Performance <b>deficits</b> were observed when interactive behaviour was characterised by excessive reliance upon highly accessible externally represented information. The results are contrasted to similar work conducted in the training literature, and future directions for exploiting information access costs to facilitate learning, memory and planning are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Specialist {{physician}} {{concentration in}} urban areas can affect access and quality of care for rural patients. As effective drug treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) becomes increasingly available, {{the extent to which}} rural patients needing HCV specialists face <b>access</b> or quality <b>deficits</b> is unknown. We sought to determine the influence of rural residency on access to HCV specialists and quality of liver care. Methods: The study used a national cohort of 151, 965 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients with HCV starting in 2005 and followed to 2009. The VHA’s constant national benefit structure reduces the impact of insurance as an explanation for observed disparities. Multivariate cox proportion regression models for each quality indicator were performed. Results: Thirty percent of VHA patients with HCV reside in rural and highly rural areas. Compared to urban residents, highly rural (HR 0. 70, CI 0. 65 - 0. 75) and rural (HR 0. 96, CI 0. 94 - 0. 97) residents were significantly less likely to access HCV specialty care. The quality indicators were more mixed. While rural residents were less likely to receive HIV screening, {{there were no significant differences}} in hepatitis vaccinations, endoscopic variceal and hepatocellular carcinoma screening between the geographic subgroups. Of note, highly rural (HR 1. 31, CI 1. 14 - 1. 50...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the results of}} public budgets in the CR in the period 1993 to 2009. This is a hot topic, {{with the growth of}} public debt is becoming increasingly important. The aim of this work is a comprehensive analysis of public finances, specifically addressing issues of <b>access</b> to public <b>deficit</b> and reform public finances. The theoretical part is focused on defining the area being examined and the theory describing this area have their roots back more than sixty years ago in the USA.
