40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} commodity price stabilization on producers <b>and</b> <b>consumers,</b> both in the short run, {{and in the long}} run, when producers have adjusted their production decisions to take account of the change in the price distribution. We derive conditions under which (a) both producers <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> may be better off; and (b) both producers <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> may be worse off. Moreover, we show that the long-run effects may differ not only quantitatively but also qualitatively from the short-run effects. The anomalous results may occur even with reasonable assumptions concerning production functions and utility functions of producers <b>and</b> <b>consumers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the strengths and}} weaknesses of the Career Network Satellite Center identified by the officers <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> who were interviewed for this evaluation. Although only a few officers <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> participated in the evaluation, the information in this report provides insight into what parts of the Career Network Satellite Center are working well and which parts could be improved. The perceived strengths of the Career Network Satellite Center are divided into four categories: Staff, Resources, Accessibility, and Administrative Structure. Both officers <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> identified strengths that pertained to these categories. The resources of the Career Network Satellite Center appear to be the strongest aspect, according to both groups (officers <b>and</b> <b>consumers).</b> For example, both officers <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> mentioned the telephones and computers that are available in the Center as strengths...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of online shopping services is stimulated by both retailers <b>and</b> <b>consumers.</b> Compared to the brick-and-mortar type of stores, the online shopping retailers can save selling cost, such as rent and labor cost, <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> who purchase items via online shopping site also can save time for shopping trips. In this study, we confirm how the online shopping affects retailer's selling cost <b>and</b> <b>consumer's</b> purchasing cost {{compared with the}} case of shopping at brick-and-mortar stores. Furthermore, we examine how delivery manners affects retailer's <b>and</b> <b>consumer's</b> cost, concluding that the online shopping retailers should clearly introduce the delivery charge independent from {{the price of the}} items...|$|R

5|$|Australian Competition <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a tenderer for various government contracts, was bound by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative governmental immunity: whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.|$|E

5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes {{the danger of the}} streets and puts it in a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger of the streets.|$|E

5|$|Government policy {{designed}} to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression. Barack Obama, the first African American and multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> Protection Act {{in an attempt to}} mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> protection, although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.|$|E
