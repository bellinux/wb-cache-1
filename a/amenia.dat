5|$|New York State Route343 (NY343) is a {{state highway}} located entirely within central Dutchess County, in the Hudson Valley region of the U.S. state of New York. It runs east–west from the {{intersection}} of NY82 {{in the village of}} Millbrook to the Connecticut state line in the town of <b>Amenia,</b> where it continues eastward briefly as Connecticut Route343. Along the way, it has a 7.3-mile (11.7km) concurrency with NY22 from vicinity of the hamlet of Dover Plains to the hamlet of <b>Amenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{when state}} {{highways}} were first marked by route numbers in New York, {{the main line}} of the Dutchess Turnpike was designated as NY21. Other portions of modern US44, aside from the overlap with NY22, were unnumbered in the 1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the old NY21 was partitioned into three numbered routes. Between Poughkeepsie and South Millbrook, old NY21 became the western half of NY200, which continued east to Dover Plains using the Dover branch route of the Dutchess Turnpike (modern NY343). The section from South Millbrook to <b>Amenia</b> became part of NY82A, which continued past <b>Amenia</b> to Pine Plains. The easternmost section from <b>Amenia</b> to the Connecticut line was designated as NY343. West of the Hudson River, NY55 was also designated in 1930 between Barryville and Pawling, running along the portion of modern US44 between Kerhonkson and Poughkeepsie.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} US44 between Poughkeepsie and <b>Amenia</b> {{was the main}} line of an early toll road known as the Dutchess Turnpike. The turnpike {{continued}} past <b>Amenia</b> into the Connecticut town of Sharon along modern NY343. Between the Wallkill River near the hamlet of Gardiner and the hamlet of Ardonia, modern US44 was also roughly located along another early toll road known as the Farmer's Turnpike. The Farmer's Turnpike continued east past Ardonia {{to the village of}} Milton where a ferry across the Hudson River once existed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{school is}} {{situated}} on a 1 acre {{lot on the}} north side of the road, at the north fringe of the developed area of the hamlet. The surrounding terrain is level, mostly open and rural. <b>Amenia's</b> Rural Cemetery is across the curve in the road. To the west is an altered 18th-century house, with an early 19th-century gambrel-roofed farmhouse on the east. Maplebrook School, a private institution for children with learning disabilities, is to the north, across a meadow.|$|R
50|$|The synagogue is on a 46 by 124 ft lot on {{the south}} side of East Main, about a quarter-mile (250 m) east of the {{intersection}} of highways NY 22, US 44 and NY 343 at the center of the hamlet. There are houses across the street from various eras of <b>Amenia's</b> existence. To the west of the synagogue is a woodlot; to the east is a 19th-century house. Rows of planted evergreen trees set off the synagogue lot lines on east and west and a small concrete sidewalk leads to the front steps from the main sidewalk along East Main.|$|R
5|$|Route44 {{gradually}} descends {{into the}} upper Harlem Valley, with a sharp hairpin turn providing a panoramic view to the south. A gradual descent takes it into downtown <b>Amenia.</b> At the center of town, the highway turns north and replaces NY343 as NY22's overlap.|$|E
5|$|Routes22 and 55 {{continue}} their long curve {{into the town}} of Dover, past the Harlem Valley–Wingdale station next to the road across from the now-closed buildings of Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center. The NY55 concurrency ends when that road heads towards Connecticut at Wingdale. The road continues through Dover Plains and into <b>Amenia,</b> where an overlap with NY343 begins. The railroad line ends at Wassaic, the most distant Metro-North station from the city in direct miles. Route343 remains joined with Route22 into the hamlet of <b>Amenia,</b> where it separates and heads towards state line. At the same junction, US44 comes in from Millbrook to begin an overlap with Route22. The valley opens up as the southern Taconics loom ahead. Shortly after crossing into the Town of North East, the highway passes by the large Coleman Station Historic District.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of modern Route343 was originally the Dover {{branch of the}} Dutchess Turnpike. The turnpike, which was in operation from the early to the mid-19th century, was a major transportation route at the time, connecting several local communities to Litchfield County, Connecticut, {{and the city of}} Poughkeepsie. NY343 was designated in 1930, connecting the hamlet of <b>Amenia</b> to the state line, but was relocated a few years later onto the portion of New York State Route200 from South Millbrook to the hamlet of Dover Plains. The NY200 designation was transferred to NY343's original alignment. NY343 absorbed NY200 in the early 1940s, creating an overlap with NY22 between Dover Plains and <b>Amenia.</b> The Connecticut portion of the highway was originally designated as part of Route4; however, it was renumbered to Route343 in 1932.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} plan for the U.S. Highway System, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY22 to <b>Amenia,</b> where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut to use old New England Route4 through Massachusetts and Vermont {{all the way to}} the Canadian border. Apparently New York State did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by AASHO (now known as AASHTO) had been amended so that the southern end of US7 began in Norwalk, Connecticut instead.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{the land}} {{upon which the}} park is located was sold to the Town of <b>Amenia</b> by Walter Beekman for the sum of $1. The park was officially opened in 1983. Before the park existed, it {{was the site of}} Lake <b>Amenia,</b> formed in the 1920s by a {{freshwater}} dam over a sawmill pond at the intersection of Lake <b>Amenia</b> Road and West Lake <b>Amenia</b> Road. The dam's original use was to power a nearby saw mill where, with the new lake in place, people now had the opportunity to swim. During the 1920s, the lake became surrounded by cottages, pavilions, docks, and some railings.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, {{the portion of}} pre-1921 legislative Route1 between Pine Plains and Ancram became part of NY82, a new route extending from {{the vicinity of the}} village of Fishkill in the south to the town of Livingston in the north. At the same time, the segment of old Route1 from <b>Amenia</b> to Pine Plains became part of NY82A, an alternate route of NY82 between the hamlets of South Millbrook and Pine Plains by way of <b>Amenia.</b>|$|E
25|$|On October 18, 1930, the Public Service Commission {{listed the}} {{elimination}} of a grade crossing in <b>Amenia,</b> Benson crossing, {{as one of its}} projects to consider. The cost estimate for eliminating it was $100,000.|$|E
25|$|After the {{flooding}} of Hurricane Diane, the former wetlands became {{the ownership of}} Walter Beekman from Beekman and Beekman Inc. He kept ownership of the land for only nineteen years before selling the land {{to the town of}} <b>Amenia</b> in 1974 for one dollar. The land remained unkept at that point, until the 1980s, when groups of volunteers (funded by the town) started installing ball fields and park like scenery. In 1983, Beekman Park was open for business as the new local park. In 1985, the local baseball fields started hosting their own games for locals team on the local Don Herring Field. Some of the former lake remains, including a portion of the former dam in the southwestern corner of the park, and <b>Amenia</b> Island Cemetery still stands along New York State Route 343 towards Sharon, Connecticut, but on stable ground. On May 14, 2009, the town of <b>Amenia</b> secured $3,829 (2009 USD) from their recreation fund to help make improvements to Beekman Park, and on June 11, 2009, the money distribution was approved.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route1, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} New York City to Rensselaer. Route1 left modern NY22 at the hamlet of <b>Amenia</b> and followed {{what is now}} U.S. Route44 west to Smithfield Valley Road. From there, the route headed north through the town of North East and northwest through the town of Pine Plains to the community of Pine Plains by way of Smithfield Valley Road. Route1 continued northward on Silvernails and Gallatinville Roads and modern CR7 to the hamlet of Ancram, where it turned northeast to follow today's CR7 toward Copake. On March1, 1921, Route1 was realigned between <b>Amenia</b> and Copake to use modern NY22 instead.|$|E
25|$|Lake <b>Amenia</b> {{remained}} intact for another 30 years, however, in 1955, Hurricane Diane struck {{the area and}} eradicated any trace of the lake. The storm's heavy rains caused the lake's water gates to fail. The resulting flood drained the lake. This area {{is now part of}} the New York State Wetlands. In 1974, the land that makes up the park, including the remains of the lake, now the wetlands, were sold to the Town of <b>Amenia</b> for a single dollar, by Walter Beekman. Groups of volunteers began construction on the park, which included ball fields. The park officially opened in 1983, with the first Little League games being played on one of their fields, with two more fields soon after. The park remains in active use to this date.|$|E
500|$|US44 was {{assigned}} [...] West of the Hudson River, it was overlaid on the pre-existing NY55, with US44 officially beginning at US209, {{which was also}} extended into New York [...] East of the river, US44 was routed on the original Dutchess Turnpike main line from Poughkeepsie to <b>Amenia,</b> supplanting NY200 west of South Millbrook, NY82A west of <b>Amenia,</b> and a short portion of NY343 between NY82A and the hamlet of <b>Amenia.</b> US44 left the turnpike at <b>Amenia</b> and followed NY22 north to Millerton, where it continued east on a short piece of former NY199 into Connecticut. The alignments of NY200 and NY343 were flipped as part of US44's assignment.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of many years, several {{sections}} of NY22 were straightened, realigned to new roads, or both. Some old alignments are still either county-maintained or state-maintained. Several of these are in Dutchess County. In Dover Plains, the southern leg of NY22's junction with NY343 is maintained by the state as NY980G, a reference route. To the north {{in the town of}} <b>Amenia,</b> a [...] long loop off NY22 between Wassaic and <b>Amenia</b> is designated as CR81. Another former routing of NY22 in the town of Dover exists as CR6, a loop route between the hamlets of Wingdale and Dover Plains that runs along {{the west bank of the}} Ten Mile River. Within the 44/22 concurrency, the intersection with CR5 south of Millerton is also a former alignment of Route22.|$|E
500|$|Several {{landmarks}} {{along the}} way include the Silo Ridge Country Club in the hamlet of Wassaic, Beekman Park in the hamlet of <b>Amenia,</b> and the Troutbeck Conference Center in the hamlet of Leedsville. When NY343 crosses the state line, it becomes Connecticut's Route343 and passes through more rural and residential areas. Route343 stretches for [...] into the town of Sharon, Connecticut, where it terminates at a junction with Route4 and Route41.|$|E
2500|$|The {{portions}} of NY82 and NY82A between Washington's Hollow and <b>Amenia</b> {{were incorporated into}} the new US44 [...] As a result, NY82A was truncated to begin at US44 near <b>Amenia</b> while NY82 overlapped US44 from South Millbrook to Washington's Hollow. The routings of NY82 and NY82A between South Millbrook and Pine Plains were swapped , with the route via <b>Amenia</b> becoming NY82 and the route via Stanford becoming NY82A. From South Millbrook to <b>Amenia,</b> NY82 overlapped US44.|$|E
2500|$|As {{popular as}} the {{community}} had become, {{there were no}} doubts {{that the end of}} vacationing in <b>Amenia</b> would soon imminent. In 1955, during the destruction left by Hurricane Diane swept through New York and Pennsylvania, the dam on Lake <b>Amenia</b> burst. Local folklore claims the floodgates to open Lake Amenia's dam were supposed to be opened for the high waters. However, the dam keeper dropped his keys into the rushing waters of Lake <b>Amenia,</b> and the resulting outflow caused a catastrophe.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the site}} of Beekman Park was the former Lake <b>Amenia,</b> a shallow, {{one and a half}} acre-wide {{freshwater}} lake in the center of <b>Amenia.</b> The lake first originated as a millpond for a local corn and grain mill in the area. Eventually, the mill changed over to a sawmill, and during the 1920s, a dam was built in the millpond, creating Lake <b>Amenia.</b> The lake had two streams that flowed water {{in and out of the}} body. One ran near the local pizzeria and one ran near the current-day tennis courts. The freshwater lake became an instant tourist destination two hours north of New York City. People took advantage of the lake, including Beekman and Beekman Inc., a tourist agency developed by two brothers. They used the area around Lake <b>Amenia</b> to develop theaters and a living environment. The lake even had a cemetery built in one of the islands, which exists to this date as <b>Amenia</b> Island Cemetery. People [...] would come to the lake for vacationing, which included a pool hall in the post office, beaches, and even a brand new golf course. Summer vacationers would take the train to <b>Amenia</b> Station on the New York Central Railroad to visit the lakeside resorts and summer camps on the lake.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flooding}} overtook {{much of the}} community, {{including the}} golf course, and although the flooding receded, the dam was never repaired. The community could not adapt to the sweeping changes from flooding and the popular community became an economic ghost town. Locals reported that the once busy streets of <b>Amenia</b> became empty storefronts. Much of the lake drained into wetlands, some {{of which has been}} adaptive into the Wassaic portion of the New York State Wetlands. People often would comment that Lake <b>Amenia</b> Road, named after the lake on the southern side of Beekman Park, served no lake.|$|E
2500|$|Beekman Park {{is a small}} {{local park}} in the census-designated place of <b>Amenia,</b> part of Dutchess County, New York. It is located on U.S. Route 44 and is visible off New York State Route 22 and New York State Route 343.|$|E
2500|$|The park {{is made up}} {{mainly of}} three {{baseball}} and softball fields. The three fields are named after famous players in <b>Amenia,</b> including one named for William [...] "Doc" [...] Bartlett, [...] which was opened in 1985. There are some undeveloped parts, with a house running along {{the northern edge of}} the park. At the northeast corner, there is a remnant of the old dam that impounded former Lake <b>Amenia.</b> There are two ways to access Beekman Park, one by foot and one by car. The first is on U.S. Route 44, where the parking lot (which holds approximately 75 cars), is located. The second, a pedestrian entrance, is at Broadway and East Broadway Avenues.|$|E
2500|$|Because of his {{unexpected}} {{rise to the}} throne, Horemheb had two tombs {{constructed for}} himself: the first [...] {{when he was a}} mere nobleman [...] at Saqqara near Memphis, and the other in the Valley of the Kings, in Thebes, in tomb KV57 [...] as king. His chief wife was Queen Mutnedjmet, who may have been Nefertiti's younger sister. They did not have any children. He is not known to have any children by his first wife, <b>Amenia,</b> who died before Horemheb assumed power.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, NY82 and NY82A were {{restored}} to their [...] alignments, with NY82 routed through Washington's Hollow and NY82A beginning in <b>Amenia.</b> On April1, 1980, ownership {{and maintenance of}} NY82A was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Dutchess County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Also transferred from the state to the county was the portion of NY82's original routing in Pine Plains between NY199 and Silvernails Road. Following the swap, NY82A was redesignated as CR83 while NY82's former routing in Pine Plains became CR83A.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Augustus Wheaton {{was born}} on 1 July 1809 in <b>Amenia,</b> New York, the son of Augustus Wheaton, a farmer and drover, and his wife. He had two brothers. The parents {{purchased}} a [...] farm {{in the town of}} Pompey in Onondaga County in 1807. [...] They migrated there from Dutchess County with their family in 1810. [...] They had followed three of the elder Wheaton's sisters: Lydia, Sylvia and Loraine, who had already moved to Pompey with their families, part of a westward migration of many in the state in the years after the American Revolutionary War. [...] Charles attended the Pompey Academy, a well-regarded boys' school.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, the Taconic {{has been}} the subject of much praise over the years not only for its vistas but for the way it harmonizes with the {{surrounding}} landscape. Sociologist Lewis Mumford, who often criticized the effect of superhighway construction on contemporary cities, always advised friends traveling up from New York to visit him at his house in <b>Amenia</b> that they should take the Taconic. He described it as [...] "a consummate work of art, fit to stand on a par with our loftiest creations". The engineers, he said, had avoided [...] "brutal assaults against the landscape". Albany-born novelist William Kennedy, whose family frequently drove the Taconic during his childhood to visit relatives further south, calls it [...] "a 110-mile postcard. It's the most beautiful road I've ever known — in all seasons". [...] "You can drive it with confidence", says automotive writer David E. Davis. [...] "There are no bad surprises about the way the road is engineered." ...|$|E

U.S. Route 44 also passes through <b>Amenia,</b> intersecting Route 22 within the hamlet of <b>Amenia.</b> Metro-North Railroad has two rail commuter rail stations in <b>Amenia,</b> with service to New York City via the Harlem Line. The Tenmile River station is off Sinpatch Road east of Route 22, and the Wassaic station is 2 mi north of Tenmile River. Trains leave every two hours during midday, evenings and weekends. In rush hour, peak-direction trains leave about every 30 minutes. There is no train service into or out of <b>Amenia</b> after midnight.|$|E
