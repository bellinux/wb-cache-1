50|$|Soon {{after its}} first flight in March 1949 the second prototype, {{equipped}} with DFS <b>airbrakes</b> and <b>flaps</b> and flown by Paul Lepanse, {{set a new}} French distance record of 470 km (292 mi). This was later broken by Roger Biagi in the second production aircraft (900S-2) with a distance of 525 km (326 mi). 900S-4, piloted by Robert Delhoume, set a record speed around a 100 km (62 mi) triangle.|$|R
50|$|A {{simplified}} version {{called the}} T-65C Sport Vega has a non-retractable mainwheel and hinged trailing edge <b>airbrakes</b> instead of <b>flaps.</b> This {{version of the}} Vega first flew on 18 December 1979 and has no provision for water ballast.|$|R
50|$|In any case, {{this new}} {{aircraft}} didn't compare {{well with the}} Ju 87's capabilities, even with {{a new set of}} <b>airbrakes,</b> <b>flaps</b> and other improvements (but also hampered by the addition of a new cockpit that provided poor rear and side vision for the pilot). The only marginal advantage compared to the Ju 87 was the twin-engine configuration, but the limited power of each engine was not enough to assure a return home if one of these was disabled. The air-cooled design allowed for the elimination of radiators and their vulnerability (with an improvement on aerodynamics, cost and weight), but at low speed and with a limited airflow, overheating was always an issue for this type of engine. The SM.86 was 32 km/h (20 mph) faster than the Junkers Ju-87B and even 2 km/h (1.2 mph) faster than the Ju 87D, but these differences, when compared to opposing fighter's speeds, were minimal. Without a good field of view all-around, and without the second crewmember in the cockpit armed with a defensive machine gun (nor a forward-firing weapon), the SM.86 was clearly more vulnerable to enemy fighters than the Junkers.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is made predominantly from fiberglass sandwiches, {{with the}} wing spar made from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. The cockpit {{is made from}} welded steel tube, reinforced with Aramid. Its 15 m span wing has optional extensions that bring the span to 18 m. Glidepath control is via full span trailing edge flaps, coupled with top surface Schempp-Hirth-style <b>airbrakes.</b> The <b>flaps</b> can be set to +15°, +10°, +5°, 0°, and -5° in flight. The cockpit was designed to accommodate a pilot of up to 76 in in height and weighing up to 260 lb with parachute. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel.|$|R
2500|$|The motorglider wing uses a {{different}} wing section, also designed by Dykins, with its {{center of pressure}} coincident {{with that of the}} smaller wing to ensure that the rudder and tailplane are equally effective with either.

50|$|The City of Leeds was {{designed}} and built by R. F. Stedman, a member of {{what was then the}} Bradford and County Gliding Club, over the period 1932-4. It flew {{for the first time on}} 21 July 1934 from Baildon in West Yorkshire. It was a simple wooden aircraft, with open cockpits and wings of modest aspect ratio, not intended for high performance. Its wing was built around two spars and had constant chord apart from slight leading edge taper near the tip. There were no <b>airbrakes</b> or <b>flaps.</b> The wing was mounted parasol fashion on pairs of parallel, broad chord lift struts which joined the spars at about mid-span to the lower fuselage longerons.|$|R
50|$|The Abbott Farnham sailplane, {{named after}} its builders, was {{designed}} by T. C. Letcher and first flew in August 1930. It was an all-wood single-seat glider with a cantilever three piece high wing. The central half span had constant chord; outboard long elliptical tips contained the ailerons. No <b>airbrakes</b> or <b>flaps</b> were fitted. The fuselage was roughly elliptical in cross-section, tapering towards the tail where it carried mid-mounted, straight-tapered elevators with rounded tips. The rudder was hinged at the extreme end of the fuselage and was of rounded triangular shape with a steep rising leading edge. The open cockpit was immediately ahead of the wing leading edge. Its undercarriage was a single long skid, reaching from the nose to well behind the wing trailing edge, with a small tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings of}} the Flamingo had a laminar flow airfoil and were made entirely of wood. The first {{prototype}} was powered by 150 hp (112 kW) Lycoming O-320 flat-four engines but later aircraft had 200 hp (150 kW) Lycoming IO-360 flat-fours. These were conventionally mounted ahead of the leading edge in long cowlings with their propeller shafts, driving two-blade airscrews, centred above the wing upper surface. There were fuel tanks in the thin wings, with more fuel in wing tip tanks. Unusually, the Flamingo was fitted with both <b>flaps</b> and <b>airbrakes.</b> The <b>flaps</b> were of the camber changing type, to increase lift at low speed; they were split into three sections on each wing and slid rearwards and downwards on concealed rails. The airbrakes were wing mounted spoilers for losing speed. Like the wings the empennage was all-wood; the cantilever tailplane was set low on the fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|The FS-26 Moseppl is a {{cantilever}} high-wing monoplane with a monocoque nacelle fuselage and a glassfibre/balsa sandwich wing structure, {{fitted with}} <b>airbrakes</b> but no <b>flaps</b> or ailerons. To {{make room for}} the engine the Moseppl has twin fins and rudders attached to the wing trailing edge with an all-moving tailplane between the tops of the vertically surfaces. The pilot sits in an enclosed cockpit with a transparent canopy and the landing gear is a retracting rear monowheel and non-steerable nosewheel. The rear-mounted engine is a [...] Solo-Hirth engine with a variable pitch pusher propeller.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first real}} {{tests of the}} Reiher came from Hanna Reitsch's {{experiences}} with it at the 1937 International Championships at the famous Wasserkuppe glider field in the Rhön mountains, which revealed worrying wing flexure, heavy ailerons and unpredictable airbrakes. [...] In response, Jacobs revised the design {{to that of the}} Reiher II, which had more tapered wings, no <b>flaps,</b> <b>airbrakes</b> as described above and mass balanced ailerons. [...] The fuselage was further refined and the fin and rudder increased in area. Much improved, Reiher IIs were factory built in a short production series, followed by the further developed Reiher III.|$|R
25|$|The Hawk was {{designed}} to be manoeuvrable and can reach Mach0.88 in level flight and Mach1.15 in a dive, thus allowing trainees to experience transonic flight before advancing to a supersonic trainer. The airframe is very durable and strong, stressed for +9g, the normal limit in RAF service is +7.5/-4g. A dual hydraulic system supplies power to operate systems such as the aircraft's <b>flaps,</b> <b>airbrakes</b> and landing gear, together with the flight controls. A ram air turbine is fitted in front of the single tail fin to provide backup hydraulic power for the flight controls {{in the event of an}} engine failure, additionally a gas turbine auxiliary power unit is housed directly above the engine.|$|R
50|$|The D-17 was a wood framed {{aircraft}} with a high, cantilever, single spar wing with stressed plywood covering {{from the}} spar to {{the leading edge}} and fabric covered aft. Its 16 m (52 ft 6 in) was built in three parts, a 6 m (19 ft 9 in) inner section with constant chord and thickness and outer panels which tapered in both chord and thickness to elliptical tips. The D-17 had the thick, high lift to drag ratio Göttingen 535 profile that Akaflieg had first used on the Konsul. Ailerons mounted on slightly angled hinges occupied the whole trailing edges of the outer panels. No <b>flaps,</b> <b>airbrakes</b> or spoilers were fitted, normal for the time.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the control design and the {{performance}} analysis of Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMAs) for aircraft application. In particular, the study is focused on evaluating the suitability of using the closed-loop current controls, depending on the application the EMA is addressed for. Current loops, implying additional sensors and digital processing at high frequency rates, significantly impact on EMA development costs, and their use must be settled by correctly balancing related advantages and drawbacks. In the work, two EMA applications are analysed via modelling and simulation: position-controlled (e. g. flight control) and speed-controlled (e. g. landing gears, <b>flaps,</b> <b>airbrakes).</b> For both cases, two control strategies are developed, by implementing or not the closed-loop control on the motor currents. The dynamic behaviour of the EMA solutions are thus characterised in terms of command tracking and power absorption, highlighting and discussing {{the effects of the}} current loops on actuator performances...|$|R
2500|$|The Konsul was a wood framed {{aircraft}} with a high, cantilever, single spar wing with stressed 3-ply covering {{from the}} spar to {{the leading edge}} and fabric covered aft. It was built in three parts, an 8m (26ft3in) inner section with a box spar and outer panels with an I-section one. The wing had a thick and strongly cambered profile, using the then new Göttingen 535 airfoil with its high lift to drag ratio that attracted many pre-World War II sailplane designers. The long wings had constant chord except for tapered tips, where the wing decreased in thickness. There was no dihedral. [...] Half span, large area ailerons had angled hinges attached to the spar at its tip and, in the early flight tests, projected well beyond the fixed wing tip. [...] These proved both heavy in flight and vulnerable on the ground, so were soon tapered and rounded off, slightly reducing the span and aspect ratio. The ailerons operated differentially, upward deflections being smaller than downward ones; this was a relatively new way of reducing adverse yaw but in addition the rudder and ailerons were interconnected. [...] Small rudder deflections {{did not affect the}} ailerons but larger ones moved them appropriately. [...] No <b>flaps,</b> <b>airbrakes</b> or spoilers were fitted, normal for the time ...|$|R
2500|$|The Sb.1 was {{designed}} by two engineering students from the Technische Universität München (Technical University of Munich), Ernst von Lößl/Loessl, (cousin of Eugen von Loessl killed at the Wasserkuppe on 9 August 1920) and Albert Finsterwalder. It was built by them {{with the assistance of}} the Munich branch of the Bayern Gliding Club during the winter of 1920-21. They were aware of the high-wing monoplane gliders that had been under development by Friedrich Harth, assisted by the teenage Willy Messerschmitt, since before 1915. By about 1920 Harth was convinced that long glider flights depended on energy capture from gusts (ridge and thermal lift was undiscovered) and the Harth-Messerschmitt designs were controlled in pitch by a variable angle of incidence wing and roll by wing warping. Its pilot had two levers, one for roll and the other for pitch. The tailplane was fixed. Lößl and Finsterwalder took these ideas a stage further by making the wings separately rotatable and controlled with a conventional column, which when moved sideways rotated the wings in opposite directions. [...] The fixed tailplane was retained but the conventional fin and rudder of the Harth-Messerschmitt was entirely removed; instead, yaw was controlled by the opening above and below the wing of little wing tip trailing edge double split <b>flap</b> <b>airbrakes.</b> This last feature did not work well so the brakes were replaced by a conventional, rectangular rudder; this was further modified later by adding a triangular tip, forming a balanced rudder. At the same time a fixed fin was added.|$|R
