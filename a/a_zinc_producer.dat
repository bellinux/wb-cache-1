It is hosted by a succession f Paleoproterozoic supracrustal units belonging to the Svecofennian domain and was considered as a genetically distinct ore district within Bergslagen already {{at the beginning of}} this century. The most prominent ore deposit belonging tothis district is Zinkgruvan which has been <b>a</b> major <b>zinc</b> <b>producer</b> for more than 100 years. In this paper, the results from an investigation f the stratigraphy, geochemistry, and U-Pb and Sm-Nd isotope systematics are reported from the ca. 10 -km-thick volcanosedimentary succession which forms the country, rocks in the ore district, informally named the Emme group. The Emme group may be subdivided stratigraphically into eight lithological units and generally into four parts. The lowermost part (the M 6 sj 6 n and G 6 kberget units and the Igelfors formation) is dominated by felsic volcanic rocks and contains the subeconomic Zn-Pb-(Cu) deposit at Marketorp. The lowermost part of the group also contains intrusions ofsubvolcanic rhyolitic porphyries (U/Pb age 1901 _ 18 Ma). The lowermost volcanite-dominated partgrades upward into homogeneous, medium-grained arkoses (the Narkesberg forma-tion) of continental derivation.

25|$|The firm {{suddenly}} found itself without {{the vast majority}} of its business (despite later receiving financial compensation for the physical assets seized by Mobutu's regime) but managed to survive: full ownership passed to conglomerate Société Générale de Belgique, where it was grouped with its other metals and mining interests. As a reflection of its enforced departure from the Katanga Province, the new, simplified name Union Minière was adopted. With its more European focus, Union Minière began to grow its business again through the 1980s, initially largely organically. In 1989 however, Société Générale announced plans to merge Union Minière with three other Belgian metals companies in which it held <b>a</b> significant stake: <b>zinc</b> <b>producer</b> Vieille Montagne (with a history stretching back to 1805); Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt, which dealt {{in a wide range of}} metals including copper, cobalt, and lead; and Mechim, an engineering firm. The much enlarged company was initially renamed Acec-Union Minière (although the prefix was dropped in 1992) and subsequently set about streamlining its organisational structure, but the global economic downturn of the early-to-mid-1990s hit profits and forced management to implement a major restructuring programme in 1995. The three-year plan, implemented under the guidance of recently appointed CEO Karel Vinck, involved the loss of around 25% of Union Minière's workforce and the sale of a number of non-core assets, including <b>a</b> <b>zinc</b> wire operation, French roofing material retailer Asturienne and much of the company's exposure to the diamond products sector (including Diamant Boart).|$|R
