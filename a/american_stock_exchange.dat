40|$|Dual-class share {{structure}} (DCSS) {{is prohibited}} in Mainland China currently with the OSOV (one share one vote) principle clearly written {{in both the}} Chinese company law and listing rules. As a result, those <b>American</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> become attractive to Mainland Chinese companies due to their tolerance of takeover defences, in particular, DCSS. To seek the soft regulation with the issuance of multiple voting shares, dozens of Chinese companies chose the <b>American</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> as their IPO (initial public offering) venues. In this paper, empirical research will be conducted to analyse those US-listed Mainland Chinese companies with DCSS. This paper aims to assess those transnational companies, their characteristics and corporate performances. As to the range of data to be covered, only those companies listed after 2011 will be sampled in this paper. It is because some of those data of the Mainland Chinese companies on NYSE or NASDAQ listed prior to 2011 were not available or were inaccurate; counting them leads to misleading results. Furthermore, those data is dated for such a changing area of law. In order to reflect the up-to-date status accurately, this paper focuses its empirical study of data which date back to 2011...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a time-series-based classification approach to identify similarities in pairs of simulated human-generated patterns. An example for a pattern is a time-series representing a heart rate during a specific time-range, wherein the time-series is {{a sequence of}} data points that represent {{the changes in the}} heart rate values. A bio-medical simulator system was developed to acquire a collection of 7, 871 price patterns of financial instruments. The financial instruments traded in real-time on three <b>American</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges,</b> NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX, simulate bio-medical measurements. The system simulates a human in which each price pattern represents one bio-medical sensor. Data provided during trading hours from the <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> allowed real-time classification. Classification is based on new machine learning techniques: self-labeling, which allows the application of supervised learning methods on unlabeled time-series and similarity ranking, which applied on a decision tree learning algorithm to classify time-series regardless of type and quantity.

This paper explores {{the process by which}} firms come to be delisted. We calculate the returns of firms from ten years before delisting to their delisting date and show that, on average, the economic grim reaper kills poorly performing firms. We document takeover and distress delisting rates through time, analyze pre-delisting equity market returns for both groups, and explore how firm characteristics and regulations governing corporate takeovers and bankruptcy affect the friction with which these processes operate. We believe this is the first analysis to document long-term equity market and operating performance of delisting firms. The study builds on research from both finance and industrial organization and is consistent with a Schumpeterian view of economic development. Baker 2 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} post-listing equity price performance of foreign firms which cross-listed sponsored American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on the New York and the <b>American</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchanges</b> {{during the period}} 1982 - 1992. We use three valuation metrics – price-to-book, price-to-cash-earnings, and price-to-earnings – which are adjusted for the home country and world industry indices to which the listing firm's stock belongs. We find positive valuation effects associated with cross-listing for both country-benchmarked and industry-benchmarked price ratios. Variables that proxy for home country characteristics such as governance styles, disclosure quality, market liquidity, and so forth are unable to explain the cross-sectional variation in the data. Our results thus suggest that cross-listing in the U. S. enhances valuations for listing firms by simply reducing the overall effect of segmentation among different national securities markets. © 1996 JIBS.
