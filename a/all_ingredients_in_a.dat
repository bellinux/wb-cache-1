The Z. cassumunar blended patches incorporating Z. cassumunar Roxb. also known as Plai were prepared from chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol with glycerin as plasticizer. They were prepared by adding <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> beaker and homogeneously mixing them. Then, they were transferred into Petri-dish and dried in hot air oven. The hydrophilic nature of the Z. cassumunar blended patches was confirmed by the moisture uptake, swelling ratio, erosion, and porosity values. The FTIR, DSC, XRD, and SEM studies showed revealed blended patches with amorphous region that was homogeneously smooth and compact in both surface and cross section dimensions. They exhibited controlled the release behavior of (E) - 4 -(3 ′, 4 ′-dimethoxyphenyl) but- 3 -en-l-ol (compound D) that is the main active compound in Z. cassumunar for anti-inflammation activity. However, in in vitro skin permeation study, the compound D was accumulated in newborn pig skin {{more than in the}} receptor medium. Thus, the blended patches showed the suitable entrapment and controlled release of compound D.

40|$|During {{traditional}} {{industrial processing}} {{of fruit and}} vegetable derived foods, consideration of the eventual retention, bio-accessibility or bio-availability of nutrients has hitherto been a secondary priority. Indeed standard processing of soups and sauces involves treating <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar way, usually by prolonged heat treatment and results in both lowered nutritional value and sensory quality of food products. Such products are typically structured using various additives including starches, gums and stabilizers, which consumers regard as unnatural, rather than exploiting the endogenous structuring potential of the fruit and vegetable ingredients as available at the farm gate. Recent studies undertaken within the EU sponsored 2 ̆ 7 Healthy Structuring 2 ̆ 7 project have shown how to design an industrially manufactured product with good sensory qualities that is natural and nutritious. The strategy has been to use the inherent structural and nutritional properties of the raw material ingredients, {{on the one hand}} to ensure the textural quality of the final product without the use of artificial gums or stabilizers and, on the other hand to optimize the nutritional quality of the final product. This review briefly summarizes both the approach taken and the results obtained within the project...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{photometry}} of {{the classical}} open cluster M 67 and the thorough membership survey, we made a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of high-membership stars for the cluster. Apart from the stars Ðtted by a conventional isochrone (single-star evolutionary model) scheme, we noticed a number of fea-tures on the CMD that are usually ignored when constructing the corresponding single stellar population (SSP), especially {{the large number of}} blue stragglers. As {{for the study of the}} integrated properties of SSPs, we argue that the contributions from <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single population of stars, such as the luminous blue stragglers, should be included. These bright blue objects may modify remarkably the spec-tral energy distribution (SED) in the blue and ultraviolet. In this paper we investigate their eects on the integrated light of single stellar populations. We will show in this work that, by using the observation of M 67 in a multicolor intermediate-band system, we can assign adequate theoretical spectra to individual stars. The integrated spectrum of this cluster is dramatically dierent from the SSP built using iso-chrones only, which shows increasing enhancement toward shorter wavelengths (starting from about 5000 of the spectrum. Taking this as a general case for SSPs, we can expect a considerable amount ofA) modiÐcation to the integrated SEDs, which might cast new light on the analysis of the stellar content in the complex stellar systems...|$|E
5000|$|Aesthetic {{judgments}} {{usually go}} beyond sensory discrimination. For David Hume, delicacy of taste {{is not merely}} [...] "the ability to detect <b>all</b> the <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> composition", but also our sensitivity [...] "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind." [...] (Essays Moral Political and Literary. Indianapolis, Literary Classics 5, 1987.) Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure. For Kant [...] "enjoyment" [...] is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be [...] "beautiful" [...] has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dung’s argumentation system {{takes as}} input {{a set of}} {{arguments}} and a binary relation encoding attacks among these arguments, and returns different ex-tensions of arguments. However, no indication is given on how to instantiate this setting, i. e. how to build arguments from a knowledge base and how to choose an appropriate attack relation. This leads {{in some cases to}} undesirable results like inconsistent extensions (i. e. the set of formulas forming an extension is inconsis-tent). This is due to the gap between the abstract setting and the knowledge base from which it is defined. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold: First it proposes to fill in this gap by ex-tending Dung’s system. The idea is to consider <b>all</b> the <b>ingredients</b> involved <b>in</b> <b>an</b> argumentation problem. We start with an abstract monotonic logic which consists of a set of formulas and a consequence operator. We show how to build arguments from a knowledge base using the consequence operator of the logic. Second, we show that the choice of an attack relation is crucial for ensuring consistent results, and should not be arbitrary. In particular, we argue that an attack relation should be at least grounded on the minimal conflicts contained in the knowledge base. Moreover, due to the binary character of this relation, some attack relations may lead to unintended results. Namely, symmetric relations are not suitable when ternary (or more) minimal conflicts are in the knowledge base. We propose then the characteristics of attack relations that ensure sound results. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDung’s (1995) argumentation {{framework}} {{takes as}} input two abstract entities: {{a set of}} arguments and a binary relation encoding attacks between these arguments. It returns acceptable sets of arguments, called extensions, w. r. t. a given semantics. While the abstract nature of this setting {{is seen as a}} great advantage, it induces a big gap with the application that it is used to. This raises some questions about the compatibility of the setting with a logical formalism (i. e., whether it is possible to instantiate it properly from a logical knowledge base), and about the significance of the various semantics in the application context. In this paper we tackle the above questions. We first propose to fill in the previous gap by extending Dung’s (1995) framework. The idea is to consider <b>all</b> the <b>ingredients</b> involved <b>in</b> <b>an</b> argumentation process. We start with the notion of an abstract monotonic logic which consists of a language (defining the formulas) and a consequence operator. We show how to build, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> systematic way, arguments from a knowledge base formalised <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> logic. We then recall some basic postulates that any instantiation should satisfy. We study how to choose an attack relation so that the instantiation satisfies the postulates. We show that symmetric attack relations are generally not suitable. However, we identify at least one ‘appropriate’ attack relation. Next, we investigate under stable, semi-stable, preferred, grounded and ideal semantics the outputs of logic-based instantiations that satisfy the postulates. For each semantics, we delimit the number of extensions an argumentation system may have, characterise the extensions in terms of subsets of the knowledge base, and finally characterise the set of conclusions that are drawn from the knowledge base. The study reveals that stable, semi-stable and preferred semantics either lead to counter-intuitive results or provide no added value w. r. t. naive semantics. Besides, naive semantics either leads to arbitrary results or generalises the coherence-based approach initially developed by Rescher and Manor (1970). Ideal and grounded semantics either coincide and generalise the free consequence relation developed by Benferhat, Dubois, and Prade (1997), or return arbitrary results. Consequently, Dung’s (1995) framework seems problematic when applied over deductive logical formalisms...|$|R
