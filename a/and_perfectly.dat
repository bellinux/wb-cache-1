5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E
5|$|The highly {{decorative}} Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> {{reflected the}} social order of the island at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, {{it was in fact}} governed by a wealthy and often extravagant aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The pieces {{relating}} to Ireland {{are those of}} a public nature; in which the Dean appears, as usual, in the best light, because they do honour to his heart {{as well as to}} his head; furnishing some additional proofs, that, though he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that country, as well natives as foreigners, he had their interest sincerely at heart, <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> understood it. His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so small a compass.|$|E

5|$|While {{stories of}} pig-faced women vary in detail, {{they have the}} same basic form. A {{pregnant}} noblewoman would be approached by a beggar accompanied by her children, and would dismiss the beggar, and in so doing would in some way compare the beggar's children to pigs. The beggar would curse the pregnant noblewoman, and come the birth of the child it would be a girl, healthy <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> formed in every respect other than having the face of a pig.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is {{the best of all possible}} worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both {{had been seen}} to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash. Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his {{with him when he}} came to Rhodesia. Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns. Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and {{the only member of the}} column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard. The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí {{evolved from}} plane to spatial geometry, to ruled geometry. These {{constructional}} forms are highly {{suited to the}} use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaudí frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional Catalan vault, using the brick laid flat instead of on its side. This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he exploited his research and experience in his masterpiece, the Sagrada Família. Gaudí conceived the interior of the church {{as if it were a}} forest, with a set of tree-like columns divided into various branches to support a structure of intertwined hyperboloid vaults. He inclined the columns so they could better resist the perpendicular pressure on their section. He also gave them a double-turn helicoidal shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and trunks of trees. This created a structure that is now known as fractal. Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates a structure that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for buttresses, as required by the neo-Gothic style. Gaudí thus achieved a rational, structured <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> logical solution, creating at the same time a new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the film}} {{not being a}} {{critical}} or financial success, the film's lead Shane West received critical acclaim for his performance as Darby Crash with many critics even pointing out that West was able to emulate Crash's behavior <b>and</b> mannerisms <b>perfectly</b> <b>and</b> bears an uncanny likeness to Crash himself.|$|R
25|$|Rayburn {{also had}} a knack for {{dressing}} to suit his occasion. While in Washington, D.C., he would sport expensive suits, starched shirts, <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> shined shoes. However, while back in his poorer district in Texas, Rayburn would wear simple shirts, blue jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. Several politicians have imitated this pattern, including Ronald Reagan's famous example of clearing brush when at home in California, while wearing fine suits in Washington.|$|E
25|$|The Nocedals {{have always}} {{remained}} mutual closest collaborators, demonstrating also similar political style <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> fitting the like father like son scheme. When commencing his public {{activities in the}} early 1860s Ramón has followed his parent; at that time, Candido Nocedal has already departed from the moderados camp and formed part of the neocatólicos. The movement, with its foundations laid in early Isabelline years, strived to politically accommodate orthodox Roman Catholicism {{within the framework of}} the liberal monarchy; in the 1860s Candido acted as one of its leaders.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} a plaster-cast model, directly on {{the skin of the}} patient’s thorax, can be used {{in the design of the}} implants. The evolution of medical imaging and CAD (computer-aided design) now allows customised 3D implants to be designed directly from the ribcage, therefore being much more precise, easier to place sub-pectorally <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> adapted to the shape of each patient. The implants are made of medical silicon rubber which is age-resistant and unbreakable (different to the silicon gel used in breast implants). They will last for life (apart from the case of adverse reactions) and are not visible externally.|$|E

25|$|Described by Wighart von Koenigswald and Gerhard Storch in 1987. It was {{the largest}} species of all at ninety {{centimetres}} long. It {{is one of the}} species found in the Messel pit, in Lutetian strata. The species is dedicated to Heinz Tobien, descriptor of the genus Leptictidium and promotor of research in the Messel pit during the 1960s. The holotype is a complete <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> preserved skeleton of an adult specimen which was uncovered in September 1984 and which {{can be found at the}} Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt. There is also a paratype; a non-complete and badly preserved specimen which can be found at the Institut Royal des Sciences Naturelles de Belgique.|$|E
25|$|His old {{opinions}} about parliamentary reform seem still {{to cling to}} him—the only decided observation he ever made when the Bill was first explained {{to him and he}} said, ‘Well this is a new constitution’ and though he is of course very anxious for the success of your administration I am not at all clear that he is equally anxious for the measure upon which that success depends. The truth is that he never yielded at all upon the question till my own opinions had become very strong <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> unchangeable, and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E
25|$|Satchel Pooch is Rob's overweight, naïve, {{and easily}} amused dog. His father, named Copernicus, a Labrador Retriever and retired guide dog, and his mother, a Shar Pei, live in Cheticamp, Nova Scotia. It is {{suggested}} by Rob's friend Joe Doman, that he is named after the Baseball Hall of Fame player Satchel Paige. Satchel is kind, gentle, and sympathetic. These traits, coupled with his naïvete and gullibility, make him a natural target for the scheming Bucky. Satchel's personality serves as foil to that of Bucky's: easy to please, optimistic to the extreme, having (barely) less common sense than Bucky, <b>and</b> <b>perfectly</b> content to peacefully coexist with everyone. He is good friends with Bucky's nemesis, Fungo Squiggly, much to Bucky's dismay.|$|E
