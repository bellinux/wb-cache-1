50|$|Enough {{construction}} {{was completed by}} the spring that on 8 April 1956, the full 461st Bombardment Wing was assigned to Blytheville from Hill, along with two more B-57 squadrons (765th, 766th). The mission of the 461st Bomb Wing was to provide training in air support of ground forces and air interdiction from lessons learned during the Korean War. However, a number of B-57Bs were lost in accidents, particularly during high-speed, low-level operations when aircraft suddenly and unexplainably dove into the ground. As these accidents persisted, all tactically-assigned B-57Bs were grounded in May 1956 {{for a period of}} four months while the problem was investigated. The fault was eventually traced to a faulty tailplane actuator which set the trim incorrectly. The installation of a new <b>actuator</b> <b>switch</b> cured the problem.|$|E
50|$|The Invader, however, {{was used}} as a {{transitory}} aircraft until the unit could receive the jet-powered Martin B-57 Canberra, which was still under development by Air Materiel Command. On 5 January the wing received its first B-57B and on 1 October 1955 the wing moved to its permanent base at Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas. It was redesignated as the 461st Bombardment wing, Tactical, and began receiving production B-57B Canberras. However, a number of B-57Bs were lost in accidents, particularly during high-speed, low-level operations when aircraft suddenly and unexplainably dove into the ground. As these accidents persisted, all tactically assigned B-57Bs were grounded in May 1956 for a period of four months while the problem was investigated.

40|$|An Adaptive Cruise Controller (ACC) is an {{extension}} of an ordinary cruise controller. In addition to maintaining a desired set velocity, an ACC can also maintain a desired time gap to the vehicle ahead. For this end, both the engine andthe brakes are controlled. The purpose with this thesis has been to develop control strategies for an ACC used in heavy vehicles. The focus of the work has been the methods used for switching between the use of engine and brake. Two different methods have been studied, a hybrid controller and an MPC-controller. For the hybrid controller, the main contribution has been to use the influence of the surroundings on the acceleration of the truck. This consists of several parts such as wind drag, road slope and rolling resistance. The estimated influence of the surroundings is used as a switch point between the use of engine and brakes. Ideally, these switch points give bumpless actuator switches. The interest in the MPC-controller as an alternative solution was to achieve automatic actuator switching, thus with no explicitly defined switch points. The MPC-controller is based on a model of the system including bounds on the control signals. Using this knowledge, the MPC-controller will choose the correct actuator for the current driving situation. Results from simulations show that both methods solve the <b>actuator</b> <b>switch</b> problem. The advantages with the hybrid controller are that it is implementable in a truck with the hardware used today and that it is relatively simple to parameterise. A drawback is that explicit switch points between the uses of the different actuators have to be included. The advantages with the MPC-controller are that no explicit switch points have to be introduced and that constraints and time delays on signals in the system can be handled in a simple way. Among the drawbacks, it can be mentioned that the variant of MPC, used in this thesis, is too complex to implement in the control system currently used in trucks. One further important drawback is that MPC demands a mathematical model of the system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{considers}} a hybrid controller scheme for the optimal switching of a moving (or scanning) actuator (MA) {{for a class}} of distributed parameter systems (DPS). The proposed hybrid controller switches both the location and control signal of the actuator {{at the beginning of}} a time interval and remains unchanged over the duration of the time-interval. As time progresses, the above policy is repeated over a sequence of “time windows”, thus generating an algorithmic procedure which results in the actuator/controller switching policy. Guiding the MA at certain a priori selected actuator positions at different time-intervals is made possible by solving a double optimization problem. The decision method for <b>actuator</b> <b>switching</b> utilizes a finite-horizon LQR optimal control policy and, using optimality criteria, the associated optimal control problem is solved backwards-in-time for several time subintervals.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we report}} spring corner designs and driving {{waveforms}} {{to improve the}} reliability for a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) actuator. In order to prevent the stiction problems, no stopper or damping absorber is adopted. Therefore, an actuator could travel long distance by electromagnetic force without any object in moving path to absorb excess momentum. Due to long displacement and large mass, springs of MEMS actuators tend to crack from weak points with high stress concentration and this situation degrades reliability performance. Stress distribution over different spring designs were simulated and a serpentine spring with circular and wide corner design was chosen due to its low stress concentration. This design has smaller stress concentration versus displacement. Furthermore, the resonant frequencies are removed from the driving waveform based on the analysis of discrete Fourier transfer function. The reshaped waveform not only shortens <b>actuator</b> <b>switching</b> time, but also ensures that the spring is in a small displacement region without overshooting so that the maximum stress is kept below 200 MPa. The experimental {{results show that the}} MEMS device designed by theses principles can survive 500 g (gravity acceleration) shock test and pass 150 million switching cycles without failure...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} development of reduced complexity controllers for hybrid switched systems. A diverse number of applications from automotive industry, ﬂuid dyna- mics and power systems are treated. Some general open loop optimal and predictive control schemes are proposed. The main motivation behind each method is {{the reduction of the}} combinatorics. In this thesis, two main contributions can be distinguished. The ﬁrst one concerns the optimal control of switched nonlinear systems where an algorithm based on strong variations is proposed and some convergence results proven. The complexity of the scheme is linear in the number of locations, this in conjunction with its simplicity makes it attractive for large scale systems. An example from the automotive industry is treated to further illustrate the tractability of the scheme. The second contribution concerns {{the development of}} a hierarchical approach for switched nonlinear systems. At the lower level, feedback controllers are associated to each location and at the higher level a predictive approach with a reduced order parametrization is in force. Based on this methodology, two schemes are developed and successfully tested in respectively ﬂuid stabilisation by <b>actuator</b> <b>switching</b> and voltage stabilization in power systems...|$|R
