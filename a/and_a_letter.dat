5|$|After serving 40 years, Red is paroled. He {{struggles to}} adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will.

5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> not part of her name. As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.|$|E

Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey.

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire).

Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants.

5|$|Stage Struck is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on a country girl who joins a traveling production after the company performs in her home town. She runs away from her home to join them and is hired, but the hard life soon takes it toll and she is unable to continue on with them. A traveling sales man buys her a ticket home and she goes home to her father. Several weeks later she receives a letter offering her a position in a New York theater production <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> requesting her marriage from the salesman. She decides to accept his offer and become his wife. The film was released on March 3, 1911 and was met with good reviews, but the film's intended daydream sequence was not understood by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming more expensive and requiring larger technical resources, particularly with the rise of sound production, making it increasingly difficult for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with hopes and dreams, but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (Mr. Jones) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> of recommendation outlining his talents, but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E
5|$|During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried {{some notable}} and {{interesting}} passengers. On 1 August 1904, {{one of the}} ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners refused {{to speak to the}} others involved {{for the duration of the}} voyage.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, a royal {{letter was}} {{received}} from the Maharaja Ranjit Singh, ruler of Sikh Empire in Punjab, addressed to King Rajendra. The Nepalese court seized this opportunity to establish diplomatic contact with Punjab {{as well as other}} states such as Burma and Gwalior. In April 1835, Bhimsen also hatched a plan to make a state visit to Britain, hoping to force Britain to acknowledge the sovereignty of Nepal; but since he could not make the visit himself, his nephew Colonel Mathabar Singh Thapa was chosen as the representative of Nepal, bearing a few gifts <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from King Rajendra addressed to King William IV. The idea was initially received favorably by Hodgson as well as the Governor-General, who hoped that the mission could increase the trust between the two nations. In this process, Mathabar Singh was promoted to Chota General; his brother, Ranbir Singh, the governor of Palpa, was made Full General; and Mathabar's nephew, the sixteen-year-old Sherjung Thapa, was made Commanding Colonel. Thus, Bhimsen managed to consolidate his military powers. Both Rajendra and Samrajya Laxmi were also pleased with this plan, and on 1 November 1835, Bhimsen was conferred the title of Commander-in-Chief. On 27 November 1835, Mathabar Singh left Kathmandu with a retinue of two thousand men, including 200 officers and 600 soldiers, for London via Calcutta.|$|E
