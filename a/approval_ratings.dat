40|$|This article {{presents}} findings of and highlights {{issues associated with}} an extensive internal loss severity study for the JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) wholesale bank. The recently completed loss given default (LGD) study draws upon 18 years of loan loss history at JPMC for 3, 761 defaulted borrowers at its several heritage organizations. Estimates of LGD are key parameters in a bank’s risk-rating system that impact facility <b>ratings,</b> <b>approval</b> levels, and the setting of loss reserves, as well as developing credit capital underlying risk and profitability calculations. LGD can be measured as either the net charge-off rate (accounting LGD), or {{the present value of}} cash losses (economic LGD), with respect to the initial book value of a defaulted obligation. Analysis of JPMC’s loss history entailed compilation of quarter-end book balances, charge-offs, recoveries of chargeoffs, and cash flows for all customers that defaulted in the period 1982 - 99, with losses determined through 2002. LGD was computed for JPMC as a whol...|$|R
