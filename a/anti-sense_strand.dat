The regulation of PhaP expression is achieved by an autoregulated repressor, which is encoded by phaR in R. eutropha.

5000|$|The {{effects of}} {{antisense}} RNA are related {{with the effects}} of RNA interference (RNAi). The RNAi process, found only in eukaryotes, is initiated by double-stranded RNA fragments, which may be created by the expression of an anti-sense RNA followed by the base-pairing of the <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strand</b> to the target transcript. Double-stranded RNA may be created by other mechanisms (including secondary RNA structure). The double-stranded RNA is cleaved into small fragments by DICER, and then a single strand of the fragment is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) so that the RISC may bind to and degrade the complementary mRNA target. Some genetically engineered transgenic plants that express antisense RNA do activate the RNAi pathway. [...] This processes resulted in differing magnitudes of gene silencing induced by the expression of antisense RNA. Well-known examples include the Flavr Savr tomato and two cultivars of ringspot-resistant papaya.|$|E

However, the levels of total RNA synthesis and 5 S RNA synthesis in chromatin were each stimulated 10 - to 50 -fold by an exogenous RNA polymerase III purified from X. laevis oocytes. The 5 S genes in chromatin were transcribed by the exogenous enzyme in a highly selective (3000 -fold above random) and predominately asymmetric fashion. A significant fraction of 5 S RNA sequences were also found in a discrete transcript, approximately 5 S in size. Total RNA synthesis was significantly stimulated when chromatin was transcribed by oocyte RNA polymerase I, murine RNA polymerase II, {{and low levels of}} Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. However, these enzymes did not significantly stimulate 5 S RNA synthesis above the endogenous levels. Both homologous oocyte RNA polymerase I and III and E. coli RNA polymerase transcribed the 5 S genes in deproteinized DNA to approximately the same extent (severalfold above random) and both the sense and <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strands</b> of the gene were transcribed.

Design ing highly efficient small interference RNA (siRNA) sequence with maximum target specificity for mammalian RNAi is one of important topics in recent years. In this work, a statistical analysis of the information for a large number (3734) of siRNA presented in the database {{available on the internet}} is done. This is to improve the design of efficient siRNA molecules. The (3734) siRNAs are classified according to their efficiency to three groups (high efficient, moderate efficient and low efficient). Thirteen properties (positional and thermodynamics) are identified in the high efficient group in the primary statistical study. In the final statistical study, the average weight of each identified property is calculated. A very good linear correlation was found between the aver age percentage efficiency and the weighted score of siRNA properties.

5000|$|The {{results of}} this {{investigation}} were not accepted by some authors, who {{agreed that it was}} established satisfactorily that [...] "Form V" [...] is different from native DNA, but did not establish that [...] "Form V" [...] has the SBS structure. While the strands of native circular DNA are known not to be separable under common denaturing conditions, in 1996, following his earlier theoretical studies in 1969, Tai Te Wu reported having found conditions under which fully intact single strands of two different circular duplex plasmids could be separated. [...] Wu believed that, because these plasmids have D-loops with DNA-RNA duplexes from RNA transcription only on their sense side, and since DNA-RNA interactions are stronger than DNA-DNA interactions, the sense and <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strands</b> would thus have different electrophoretic mobilities. He employed a very low voltage, so that the electrophoresis required 48 hours to go to completion. DNA sequencing then indicated that each of the two bands were enriched in one of the two strands of the chromosome. Separately, the Stetter et al. experiment was revisited in 2009 by Youcheng Xu, who noted that brief re-annealing times (i.e. 20-30 minutes) resulted in anomalous structures which did not co-migrate with routinely prepared DNA topoisomers, while prolonged re-annealing times (in his case, 72 hours at 4º) resulted in structures which did co-migrate with the topoisomers, suggesting normal base-pairing. They interpreted their data as supporting the possibility that the two strands inside the native DNA double helix are winding ambidextrously rather than plectonemically, with left-handed and right-handed regions coexisting in a zero linking number topoisomer.|$|R
40|$|Complement {{receptor}} 2 (CR 2) {{is important}} in the regulation of the B lymphocyte response; the regulation of its expression is therefore of central importance. We recently reported that a 42 kDa heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the human CR 2 gene [Tolnay, Lambris and Tsokos (1997) J. Immunol. 159, 5492 - 5501]. We cloned the cDNA encoding this protein and found it to be identical with hnRNP D 0 B, a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein. By using a set of mutated oligonucleotides, we demonstrated that the recombinant hnRNP D 0 B displays sequence specificity for double-stranded oligonucleotide defined by the CR 2 promoter. We conducted electrophoretic mobility-shift assays to estimate the apparent Kd of hnRNP D 0 B for the double-stranded DNA motif and found it to be 59 nM. Interestingly, hnRNP D 0 B displayed affinities of 28 and 18 nM for the sense and <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strands</b> of the CR 2 promoter-defined oligonucleotide respectively. The significantly greater binding affinity of hnRNP D 0 B for single-stranded DNA than for double-stranded DNA suggests that the protein might melt the double helix. The intranuclear concentration of sequence-specific protein was estimated to be 250 - 400 nM, indicating that the protein binds to the CR 2 promoter in vivo. Co-precipitation of a complex formed in vivo between hnRNP D 0 B and the TATA-binding protein demonstrates that hnRNP D 0 B interacts with the basal transcription apparatus. Our results suggest a new physiological role for hnRNP D 0 B that involves binding to double- and single-stranded DNA sequences in a specific manner and functioning as a transcription factor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background DNA {{microarray}} is {{an invaluable}} tool for gene expression explorations. In the two-dye microarray, fluorescence intensities of two samples, each labeled {{with a different}} dye, are compared after hybridization. To compare {{a large number of}} samples, the 'reference design' is widely used, in which all RNA samples are hybridized to a common reference. Genomic DNA is an attractive candidate for use as a universal reference, especially for bacterial systems with a low percentage of non-coding sequences. However, genomic DNA, comprising of both the sense and <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strands,</b> is unlike the single stranded cDNA usually used in microarray hybridizations. The presence of the antisense strand in the 'reference' leads to reactions between complementary labeled strands in solution and may cause the assay result to deviate from true values. Results We have developed a mathematical model to predict the validity of using genomic DNA as a reference in the microarray assay. The model predicts that the assay can accurately estimate relative concentrations {{for a wide range of}} initial cDNA concentrations. Experimental results of DNA microarray assay using genomic DNA as a reference correlated well to those obtained by a direct hybridization between two cDNA samples. The model predicts that the initial concentrations of labeled genomic DNA strands and immobilized strands, and the hybridization time do not significantly affect the assay performance. At low values of the rate constant for hybridization between immobilized and mobile strands, the assay performance varies with the hybridization time and initial cDNA concentrations. For the case where a microarray with immobilized single strands is used, results from hybridizations using genomic DNA as a reference will correspond to true ratios under all conditions. Conclusion Simulation using the mathematical model, and the experimental study presented here show the potential utility of microarray assays using genomic DNA as a reference. We conclude that the use of genomic DNA as reference DNA should greatly facilitate comparative transcriptome analysis. </p...|$|R

We found that cyclin D 2 directly interacts with Mel- 18, one of the polycomb group gene products in a yeast two hybrid screen. Further, we have determined the binding domains that are required for interaction between cyclin D 2 and Mel- 18. The proline/serine-rich domain (P/S domain) of Mel- 18 is required to interact with cyclin D 2, and the N-terminal region of cyclin D 2 is necessary to interact with Mel- 18. A co-localization study shows that cyclin D 2 and Mel- 18 interact within the nucleus. To determine whether Mel- 18 affects cyclin D 2 activity, we blocked Mel- 18 expression using an <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strand</b> system in cyclin D 2 over-expressing cells.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the host to {{distinguish}} between self and foreign nucleic acids {{is one of the}} critical factors contributing to the recognition of pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Under certain circumstances, eukaryotic self-RNA may reach TLR-containing compartments allowing for self-recognition. Specific modifications were previously demonstrated to suppress immune activation when placed at several positions in an immune stimulatory RNA or silencing RNA (siRNA). However, we show that even a simple natural modification such as a single 2 ′-O-methylation at different nucleotide positions throughout a sequence derived from a self-RNA strongly interferes with TLR-mediated effects. Such a single modification can even have an inhibitory effect in vitro and in vivo when placed in a different than the immune stimulatory RNA strand acting as suppressive RNA. Several safeguard mechanisms appear to have evolved to avoid cellular TLR-mediated activation by self-RNAs that may under other circumstances result in inflammatory or autoimmune responses.

40|$|Non-coding {{regulatory}} RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate {{a host of}} gene {{functions in}} prokaryotes, e. g., transcription and translation regulations, RNA processing and modification, and mRNA stability. Some ncRNAs have been identified experimentally, but many are yet to be found. ncRNAs can be classified as either cis- or trans-acting. cis-ncRNAs perfectly complement their target genes and are usually encoded on the <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strands</b> of the targets. On the contrary, trans-ncRNAs regulate their target genes through short and often imperfect base-pairings with the targets, and are usually encoded elsewhere on the genome. A whole-genome thermodynamic analysis can be performed to identify all imperfect but stable base-pairings between all annotated genes and some genomic regions encoding ncRNAs from the same species. However, the sizes of these base-paring regions are short and variable, and their melting temperatures vary greatly between perfectly and imperfectly matched targets. It is difficult to predict trans-acting ncRNAs solely based on the thermodynamic analysis. Therefore, {{we also have to}} consider known ncRNA structures to improve our predictions. We find that Hfq-binding ncRNAs, which require Hfq protein to function, share three common structural properties. We predict these special ncRNAs in E. coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens according to a systematic, novel 5 -step approach based on thermodynamic analyses as well as known structural properties of this class of ncRNAs. Whole genome tiling microarrays are chosen to validate our predictions. We describe how the microarrays have been designed, created, and validated for E. coli MG 1655 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens C 58. We match our new ncRNA prediction results with known ncRNAs, calculate correlation coefficient values between each ncRNA candidate and their predicted targets measure by the whole-genome tiling microarrays, and confirm the results with 3 other ncRNA identification software tools. We also perform a gene ontology network analysis to reveal the associations of ncRNA candidates and their predicted targets.

40|$|RNA {{molecules}} {{were found}} to separate into numerous metastable conformational forms upon non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. The equilibration of the conformations was accelerated by heating or mild denaturing conditions. Single-base substitutions in the sequence of the RNAs caused changes in the conformational patterns, including mobility shifts of major and minor conformations, appearance of new conformations and loss of other conformations. This sequence-dependent RNA conformational polymorphism was used to detect point mutations in p 53 and, dihydrofolate reductase genes. Sense and <b>anti-sense</b> RNA <b>strands</b> corresponding to the same segment of the p 53 gene gave entirely different conformational patterns. To generate the RNA, short regions of the target genes (up to about 250 bp) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and the resulting DNA segments transcribed to RNA by T 7 RNA polymerase.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{simplest}} conceivable {{example of}} evolving systems is RNA molecules that can replicate themselves. Since replication produces a new RNA strand complementary to a template, all templates would eventually become double-stranded and, hence, become unavailable for replication. Thus {{the problem of}} how to separate the two strands is considered a major issue for the early evolution of self-replicating RNA. One biologically plausible way to copy a double-stranded RNA is to displace a preexisting strand by a newly synthesized strand. Such copying can in principle be initiated from either the (+) or (-) strand of a double-stranded RNA. Assuming that only one of them, say (+), can act as replicase when single-stranded, strand displacement produces a new replicase if the (-) strand is the template. If, however, the (+) strand is the template, it produces a new template (but no replicase). Modern transcription exhibits extreme <b>strand</b> preference wherein <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strands</b> are always the template. Likewise, replication by strand displacement seems optimal if it also exhibits extreme strand preference wherein (-) strands are always the template, favoring replicase production. Here we investigate whether such strand preference can evolve in a simple RNA replicator system with strand displacement. Results We first studied a simple mathematical model of the replicator dynamics. Our results indicated that if the system is well-mixed, there is no selective force acting upon strand preference per se. Next, we studied an individual-based simulation model to investigate the evolution of strand preference under finite diffusion. Interestingly, the results showed that selective forces "emerge" because of finite diffusion. Strikingly, the direction of the strand preference that evolves [i. e. (+) or (-) strand excess] is a complex non-monotonic function of the diffusion intensity. The mechanism underlying this behavior is elucidated. Furthermore, a speciation-like phenomenon is observed under certain conditions: two extreme replication strategies, namely replicase producers and template producers, emerge and coexist among competing replicators. Conclusion Finite diffusion enables the evolution of strand preference, the direction of which is a non-monotonic function of the diffusion intensity. By identifying the conditions under which strand preference evolves, this study provides an insight into how a rudimentary transcription-like pattern might have emerged in an RNA-based replicator system.

Conversely, in two cases of B-cell lymphoma progressed into leukemia the c-myc locus was translocated intact in its coding and 5 '-flanking region into an Ig region different from C alpha 1, and over-expressed in two normal mRNA species.

In this report we demonstrate that the cA 1 peptide can be a target for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes in HIV- 1 -infected or envelope-immunized individuals. The cA 1 peptide is recognized in association with different MHC class I allotypes and could prime in vitro CTLs, derived from gp 160 -immunized individuals capable to recognize virus variants. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: For the first time a theoretically designed immunogen involved in broad-based cell-immune memory activation is described. Our findings may thus contribute to the advance in vaccine research by describing a novel strategy to develop a synthetic AIDS vaccine...|$|R

40|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is {{an unusual}} form of bronchiolar disease {{affecting}} exclusively East Asians. Strong associations of DPB with the class I human leukocyte antigens HLA-B 54 in Japan and China and HLA-A 11 in Korea suggest that the susceptible locus for DPB is located between the HLA-B and HLA-A genes. We have previously reported that the susceptibility gene for DPB could be localized within a 200 -kb segment between the S and TFIIH loci in the HLA class I region, using refined microsatellite-based association mapping. However, no genes have been recognized in this candidate region to date. In order to identify a novel candidate gene for DPB from this segment, the expressed sequence tag databases were searched using the genomic sequence. As a result, a cDNA clone was isolated from a human lung cDNA library. This gene, designated C 6 orf 37 (Chromosome 6 open reading frame 37), spans approximately 2. 5 kb and consists of two exons encoding a 235 -amino acid protein, sharing homology with the mucin-like domain of human zonadhesin, which is a sperm multiple-domain transmembrane protein with the sperm zona pellucida binding activity. Unexpectedly, RT-PCR analysis detected transcripts from the <b>anti-sense</b> DNA <b>strand</b> of this C 6 orf 37 locus. The gene designated as C 6 orf 37 OS (C 6 orf 37 Opposite Strand) and represented by these anti-sense transcripts contained no open reading frame. The transcripts from C 6 orf 37 and C 6 orf 37 OS were observed in numerous tissues, with most-abundant expression in lung, kidney, and testis. Taken together, these results, especially the abundant expression in lung, indicate that C 6 orf 37 and C 6 orf 37 OS are excellent candidate genes for DPB...|$|R

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) {{is known to}} be increased in patients and experimental animals with chronic cardiac failure (CCF). The importance of an increase in biosynthesis of AVP in the hypothalamus has, however, not heretofore been investigated and is {{the purpose of the present}} study. CCF secondary to infarction of myocardial tissue was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and sham operated animals served as controls. Four weeks later hypothalamic AVP mRNA was determined by solution hybridization using sense and <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strand</b> RNA. The blood pressure was lower in CCF than sham animals (131. 2 ± 3. 1 vs. 112. 8 ± 4. 0 mm Hg, P < 0. 05) and the total heart, and right and left ventricle weights were significantly higher in CCF rats. Plasma AVP was higher in CCF (sham 6. 78 ± 0. 30; CCF 11. 46 ± 0. 64 pg/ml, P < 0. 001) and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was also higher in CCF than sham animals (205 ± 36 vs. 554 ± 56 pg/ml, P < 0. 001). The AVP mRNA in hypothalamus was significantly higher in CCF than sham animals (55. 5 ± 3. 7 vs. 95. 9 ± 4. 0 pg/µg total RNA, P < 0. 001). There was no difference in β-actin mRNA in the hypothalamus of sham and CCF rats, indicating that the AVP-mRNA increase was specific in CCF. These results therefore demonstrate that increased AVP biosynthesis in the hypothalamus, in addition to release of the hormone from the posterior pituitary, may occur in CCF...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One {{member of}} the W family of human {{endogenous}} retroviruses (HERV) {{appears to have been}} functionally adopted by the human host. Nevertheless, a highly diversified and regulated transcription from a range of HERV-W elements has been observed in human tissues and cells. Aberrant expression of members of this family has also been associated with human disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and schizophrenia. It is not known whether this broad expression of HERV-W elements represents transcriptional leakage or specific transcription initiated from the retroviral promoter in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. Therefore, potential influences of genomic context, structure and orientation on the expression levels of individual HERV-W elements in normal human tissues were systematically investigated. Results Whereas intronic HERV-W elements with a pseudogene structure exhibited a strong anti-sense orientation bias, intronic elements with a proviral structure and solo LTRs did not. Although a highly variable expression across tissues and elements was observed, systematic effects of context, structure and orientation were also observed. Elements located in intronic regions appeared to be expressed at higher levels than elements located in intergenic regions. Intronic elements with proviral structures were expressed at higher levels than those elements bearing hallmarks of processed pseudogenes or solo LTRs. Relative to their corresponding genes, intronic elements integrated on the sense strand appeared to be transcribed at higher levels than those integrated on the <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strand.</b> Moreover, the expression of proviral elements appeared to be independent from that of their corresponding genes. Conclusions Intronic HERV-W provirus integrations on the sense strand appear to have elicited a weaker negative selection than pseudogene integrations of transcripts from such elements. Our current findings suggest that the previously observed diversified and tissue-specific expression of elements in the HERV-W family is the result of both directed transcription (involving both the LTR and internal sequence) and leaky transcription of HERV-W elements in normal human tissues. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduced}} into tk- human 143 cells adenovirus type 2 (Ad 2) genes by transformation with a plasmid (p 711) containing both Ad 2 sequences and the {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1) tk gene. p 711 contained approximately the left 8 % of the Ad 2 genome inserted in the HindIII site of pBR 322, whereas the fragment of HSV- 1 containing the tk gene was inserted in the BamHI site. Three tk+ cell lines were isolated after selection in HAT medium. The arrangement of viral sequences in the three transformants was analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and filter hybridization. All three lines contained a single insertion of Ad 2 DNA which was present at approximately one copy per cell. The arrangement of Ad 2 sequences in these lines was identical to that found in the linear p 711 DNA used in the transformation. S 1 analysis of the Ad 2 -specified RNA from two of these lines indicated that the early region 1 a mRNA's were synthesized, though in lower amounts than found in lytic infections. These cell lines contained only the left half of early region 1 b (4. 6 to 11. 2), which encoded the 5 ' portion of the 1 b mRNA's. A complex pattern of 1 b RNAs was made in these cell lines. Transcription of most of these RNAs began {{at or near the}} 1 b promoter and proceeded through the 1 b sequences into the flanking pBR 322, HSV- 1, or host sequences. Since many of the RNAs were terminated or spliced in the HSV- 1 (<b>anti-sense</b> <b>strand)</b> or pBR 322 sequences, new RNA processing sites must be used in the formation of these mRNA's. All three lines fully complemented the 1 a deletion mutant Ad 5 dl 312. Surprisingly, these lines also permitted the growth of 1 b deletion mutants (Ad 5 dl 313 and Ad 5 dl 434), although the complementation was not always complete. Presumably the new gene product(s) which contained only part of the 1 b gene provided most of the essential function(s) required for viral multiplication. Alternatively, the 1 b 19 -kilodalton protein which was entirely encoded by the adenovirus sequences present in these cell lines was sufficient for viral growth {{even in the absence of}} the 1 b 55 -kilodalton protein...|$|E
40|$|In diverse {{eukaryotic}} organisms, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces robust silencing {{of cellular}} RNA cognate to either strand of the input dsRNA; a phenomenon {{now known as}} RNA interference (RNAi). Within the RNAi pathway, small, 21 nucleotide (nt) duplexed RNA, dubbed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), derived from the longer input dsRNA, guide the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) to destroy its target RNA. Due to its ability to silence virtually any gene, whether endogenous or exogenous, {{in a variety of}} model organisms and systems, RNAi has become a valuable laboratory tool, and is even being heralded as a potential therapy for an array of human diseases. In order to understand this complex and unique pathway, we have undertaken the biochemical characterization of RNAi in the model insect, Drosophila melanogaster. To begin, we investigated the role of ATP in the RNAi pathway. Our data reveal several ATP-dependent steps and suggest that the RNAi reaction comprises as least five sequential stages: ATP-dependent processing of double-stranded RNA into siRNAs, ATP-independent incorporation of siRNAs into an inactive 360 kDa protein/RNA complex, ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex to generate an active complex, ATP-dependent activation of RISC following siRNA unwinding, and ATP-independent recognition and cleavage of the RNA target. In addition, ATP is used to maintain 5 ´ phosphates on siRNAs, and only siRNAs with these characteristic 5 ´ phosphates gain entry into the RNAi pathway. Next, we determined that RISC programmed exogenously with an siRNA, like that programmed endogenously with microRNAs (miRNAs), is an enzyme. However, while RISC behaves like a classical Michaelis-Menten enzyme in the presence of ATP, without ATP, multiple rounds of catalysis are limited by release of RISC-produced cleavage products. Kinetic analysis of RISC suggests that different regions of the siRNA play distinct roles in the cycle of target recognition, cleavage and product release. Bases near the siRNA 5 ´ end disproportionately contribute to target RNA-binding energy, whereas base pairs formed by the central and 3 ´ region of the siRNA provide helical geometry required for catalysis. Lastly, the position of the scissile phosphate is determined during RISC assembly, before the siRNA encounters its RNA target. In the course of performing the kinetic assessment of RISC, we observed that when siRNAs are designed with regard to 2 ̆ 7 functional asymmetry 2 ̆ 7 (by unpairing the 5 ´ terminal nucleotide of the siRNA 2 ̆ 7 s guide strand, i. e. the <b>strand</b> <b>anti-sense</b> to the target RNA), not all of the RISC formed was active for target cleavage. We observed, somewhat paradoxically, that increased siRNA unwinding and subsequent accumulation of single-stranded RNA into RISC led to reduced levels of active RISC formation. This inactive RISC did not act as a competitor for the active fraction. In order to characterize this non-cleaving complex, we performed a series of protein-siRNA photo-crosslinking assays. From these assays we found that thermodynamic stability and termini structure plays a role in determining which proteins an siRNA will associate with, and how association occurs. Furthermore, we have found, by means of the photo-crosslinking assays, that siRNAs commingle with components of the miRNA pathway, particularly Ago 1, suggesting overlapping functions or crosstalk for factors thought to be involved in separate, distinct pathways...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is a plant antiviral defence mechanism. A {{hallmark of}} RNA silencing is {{the production of}} small interfering (si) RNAs of 21 - 25 nucleotides that are generated from the viral genome. Moreover, profiles of viral siRNAs suggest that certain regions, namely hotspots, of the viral genome {{are more prone to}} RNA silencing-mediated degradation. African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) causes cassava mosaic disease which {{is considered one of the}} greatest threats to the production of cassava in Africa and throughout the world. Geminiviruses such as ACMV are believed to be both inducers and targets of RNA silencing. The hypothesis of this research is that by targeting siRNA hotspots in the viral genome a novel strategy can be developed to control viral infection. This project has three main objectives. First, it aims to profile siRNAs associated with cassava-infecting DNA viruses via hybridisation and deep sequencing technology. Second, it aims to test the interaction between hotspot vsiRNAs and ACMV. Third, it aims to induce resistance to ACMV, and assess the level of resistance developed, by direct delivery of hotspot vsiRNA in plants. As a preliminarily study, it was demonstrated that synthetic exogenous siRNA targeting one of the siRNA hotspots in the genome of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) had a negative impact on virus infection in terms of RNA accumulation and symptom severity in Nicotiana benthmiana plants. In further experiments, different sized siRNAs associated with ACMV infection was detected by both northern blotting and high throughput 454 sequencing of samples from infected plants. Based on the 454 sequencing data obtained sense and <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strand</b> siRNAs have been produced corresponding to siRNA hotspot and coldspot regions. The effects of these exogenous siRNAs on ACMV infection in N. benthamiana plants were investigated. The results revealed that the co-inoculation of the hotspot siRNAs with ACMV reduced viral DNA replication and disease development. ACMV/siRNA co-inoculated plants remained symptomless throughout the 3 -month course of the experiments. On the other hand, when ACMV was coinoculated with coldspot targeted siRNA, the viral DNA accumulation was comparable to infection with ACMV alone, and plants displayed typical ACMV infection symptoms. The effect of hotspot siRNA in inducing viral resistance was dose-dependent. The results also revealed that the effectiveness of hotspot siRNA to elicit durable resistance to ACMV infection requires a functional host RNAdependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR 6). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that hotspot vsiRNA could offer a novel strategy for controlling major destructive viral diseases in plants. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceEgypt.

40|$|Human {{endogenous}} retroviruses (HERV) comprise 8 % of {{the human}} genome and can be classified into at least 31 families. A typical HERV provirus consists of internal gag, pol and env genes, flanked by two long terminal repeats (LTRs). HERV are by nature repetitive and have with few notable exceptions lost their protein-coding capacity. Therefore, HERV are consistently not included in large scale expression studies and hence little is known of their expression, regulation and potential functional significance. Aberrant expression of HERV-W has been associated with human diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. It has been reported that HERV-W elements, including ERVWE 1 (the so far only known HERV-W gene functionally adopted by the human host), can be transactivated in a range of human non-placental cell-lines during influenza virus infections. Applying a recently developed technique for obtaining high resolution melting temperature analyses, transcripts containing HERV-W gag sequences were found to be expressed in non-random patterns with extensive variations in the expression between tissues, brain regions and individuals. Furthermore, the patterns of such transcripts varied more between individuals in brain regions than other tissues (I). To determine the effect of genomic context, viral structure and orientation on the transcription of HERV-W, PCR directed at specific HERV-W loci were employed on panel of normal human tissues. HERV-W elements in intronic regions were found to be expressed at higher levels than elements in intergenic regions. With regard to intronic elements, proviruses were expressed at higher levels than pseudoelements or solo LTRs. Relative to their corresponding genes, intronic elements integrated on the sense strand appeared to be transcribed at higher levels than those integrated on the <b>anti-sense</b> <b>strand.</b> Furthermore, the expression of transcripts containing intronic proviral elements appeared to be independent from that of their corresponding genes (II). When addressing mechanisms underlying transactivation of HERV-W following virus infection we detected up-regulation of spliced ERVWE 1 transcripts and those encoding the transcription factor glial cells missing 1 (GCM 1) which acts as an enhancer element upstream of ERVWE 1. Knock-down of GCM 1 by siRNA, followed by infection suppressed the transactivation of ERVWE 1. In addition, ChIP assays detected decreased H 3 K 9 trimethylation and histone methytransferase SETDB 1 levels along with influenza viral proteins associated with ERVWE 1 and other HERV-W loci in infected CCF-STTG 1 cells (III). Finally, by analyzing publicly available RNA sequencing datasets generated from three different regions of human brains of multiple individuals, a consistent expression (0. 1 - 0. 2 % of mappable reads) of HERV families was observed across three regions of brains. Spearman correlations between tissues revealed highly correlated expression levels across 475 consensus sequences. By mapping sequences aligned to the consensus sequences of HERV-W and HERV-H families to individual loci on chromosome 7, more than 60 loci from each family were identified, some of which are being transcribed. Elevated expressions of overall HERV, as well as of HERV-W family were observed in samples from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients (IV). In conclusion, our studies show that 1) HERV-W gag transcripts appear to exhibit a highly diversified expression pattern across both tissues and individuals; 2) Both LTR directed and leaky transcription of HERV-W elements contribute to their tissue-specific expression pattern; 3) Chromatin modifications potentially mediate the effect of influenza A virus infection on HERV-W expression; 4) An independent method of RNA sequencing verifies expression of HERV in human brain regions...|$|E
