40|$|Abstract: The {{potential}} {{relevance of}} wave skewness and sloping beds on morphodynamic predictions is investigated. Based on a comparison with measurements {{it was shown}} that the phase lag is potentially important for modeling nearshore bar dynamics as it influences the suspended wave related transports (magnitude and direction). Velocity skewness results in a phase shift between the orbital motion and the instantaneous bed shear stress increasing onshore bed load transport. It was seen that its influence is relatively small but does affect bar migration and helps to predict the observed <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bar</b> shape. The bed slope affecting the initiation of motion and sediment bed-load transport magnitude and direction are investigated by comparing scour hole predictions. The initiation of motion, which is also included on the suspended transports, only has an effect for somewhat steeper slopes. The modifications of bed-load direction and magnitude significantly affect the horizontal and vertical scour hole equilibrium dimensions...|$|R

40|$|We derive the {{essentials}} of the skewed weak lensing likelihood via a simple Hierarchical Model. Our likelihood passes four objective and cosmology-independent tests which a standard Gaussian likelihood fails. We demonstrate that sound weak lensing analyses are naturally biased low, and this does not indicate any new physics such as deviations from ΛCDM. Mathematically, the biases arise because noisy two-point functions follow skewed distributions. This form of bias is already known from CMB analyses, where the low multipoles have <b>asymmetric</b> error <b>bars.</b> Weak lensing is more strongly affected by this asymmetry as galaxies form a discrete set of shear tracer particles, {{in contrast to a}} smooth shear field. We demonstrate that the biases can be up to 30 percent of the standard deviation per data point, dependent on the properties of the weak lensing survey. Our likelihood provides a versatile framework with which to address this bias in future weak lensing analyses. Comment: Submitted to MNRA...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, the {{universal}} behaviour of Fano resonance in symmetry-broken resonators is investigated in <b>asymmetric</b> dipole <b>bars.</b> Sharp <b>asymmetric</b> and strong resonant lineshape were observed with Q-factor {{of at least}} 20 from the near-infrared to terahertz regime. Positive and complementary structures follow closely to the Babinet’s Principle for electromagnetic fields. A standard system based on exponential decay function has been developed to characterize the behaviour of Q-factor under varying asymmetry parameter or Fano resonance frequency. Decay constants obtained from the exponential fittings provide insights into {{the rate at which}} energy is stored under different conditions. This work will be more extensive if a larger superset can be established based on varying materials or geometries, and further evaluated based on their decay trends. The process may be tedious but once a standard system is developed, it would enable smart designing of the metamaterial structure to tailor its Q-factor by itself through machine learning techniques. The standard system is beneficial and useful for the realization of scalable and “smart” metadevices across a wide spectral range.|$|R

The circling technique prior to performing double layout somersault dismounts from the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bars</b> in Women’s Artistic Gymnastics appears {{to be similar to}} the “traditional” technique used by some male gymnasts on the high bar. It was speculated that as a result the female gymnasts would have margins for error similar to those of male gymnasts who use the traditional technique. However, it is unclear how the technique of the female gymnasts is affected by the need to avoid the lower bar. A four segment planar simulation model of the gymnast and upper bar was used to determine the margins for error when releasing the bar for nine double layout somersault dismounts at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The elastic properties of the gymnast and bar were modelled using damped linear springs. Model parameters, primarily the inertia and spring parameters, were optimised to obtain a close match between simulated and actual performances in terms of rotation angle (1. 2 °), bar displacement (0. 011 m) and release velocities (< 1 %). Each matching simulation was used to determine the time window around the actual point of release for which the model had appropriate release parameters to complete the dismount successfully. The margins for error of the nine female gymnasts (release window 43 - 102 ms) were comparable with those of the three male gymnasts using the traditional technique (release window 79 - 84 ms) ...|$|E

The scale length of the outer disk is only 1. 6 ± 0. 1 kpc, substantially smaller than previous results. This implies that the shapes of the inner and outer disk are different. Meanwhile, the disk flaring is not only found in older populations, but also in younger population. Moreover, the vertical oscillations of the disk are identified in a wide range or R from 8 to 14 kpc.

The in-plane and out-of-plane lattice parameters were determined {{as a function of}} film thickness by x-ray reciprocal space mapping around the <b>asymmetric</b> ((1) over <b>bar</b> 03) Bragg reflection. BaTiO 3 films were found to be fully strained by the SrTiO 3 substrate up to a thickness of about 30 nm. Ferroelectric capacitors were then fabricated by depositing SrRuO 3 top electrodes, and the polarization-voltage hysteresis loops were recorded at the frequencies 1 - 30 kHz. The observed thickness effect on the lattice parameters and polarization in BaTiO 3 films was analyzed in the light of strain and depolarizing-field effects using the nonlinear thermodynamics theory. The theoretical predictions are in reasonable agreement with the measured thickness dependences, although the maximum experimental values of the spontaneous polarization and the out-of-plane lattice parameter exceed the theoretical estimates (43 mu C/cm(2) vs 35 mu C/cm(2) and 4. 166 angstrom vs 4. 143 angstrom).

The point bar accumulated {{as part of a}} lowstand systems tract at the base of an incised valley cut into lacustrine mud.

This bar was characterized by early expansion followed by downstream accretion, which was abruptly interrupted by lacustrine deposition. The onset of downstream accretion started when the channel expanded to reach the more resistant valley wall. Sediment accreted on the downstream side of the point bar and accumulated both during bankfull discharge and overbank floods, with significant modification of the channel flow where the floodwater re-entered the main channel (i. e., riffle zone).

30|$|Fano {{resonance}} in optical metamaterial {{system is}} highly attractive, primarily {{because at the}} resonance frequency, it has strong electromagnetic field confinement within the structures and an extremely narrow linewidth which also dictates its quality (Q) factor. Q-factor is often used as a dimensionless parameter to characterize the strength of damping on the metamaterial resonators. For a metamaterial system with heavy damping, the resonance {{will not be able}} to sufficiently survive the energy lost through radiative and non-radiative pathways which cause the resonance linewidth to be largely broadened, and vice versa. Therefore, Q-factor helps to determine how much of the energy is being lost or confined, which allows further refinements to be made to optimize the performance of the metamaterial system. Albeit the abundance of discussion on Fano system, there remains a void in the systematization of the Q-factors for different asymmetry parameters in complementary structures across the near-infrared (NIR) to terahertz (THz) regime. It has been observed in several works that the Q-factor of Fano system decays exponentially with increasing asymmetry parameter [33 – 35]. However, the similarity in the decay trend of the Q-factor ubiquitous in Fano system has received less attention and remains an essential part of understanding the implications of radiative and non-radiative losses. Hence, if a standard system of decay trends under different situations could be developed, it could serve as a guide for appropriate optimization and fabrication of scalable and functional metamaterial-based devices. In this work, we performed numerical calculations on a complementary <b>asymmetric</b> dipole <b>bars,</b> and by proportionally scaling the dimensions we induced Fano resonance at different frequency regimes ranging from NIR to THz. The Q-factors at different regimes were evaluated and fitted with an exponential decay function to extract the decay constants. Our results further show that for the smallest asymmetry parameter, the decay constant of the Q-factor obtained as a function of the Fano resonance frequency from NIR to THz regime is the largest. We also observed that the decay constant of the Q-factor obtained as a function of asymmetry parameter is largest at the NIR Fano resonance frequency and then decreases (with saturation) towards THz Fano resonance frequency. Both distributions display similar trend which tend towards an exponential decay behaviour.|$|R

In this study we assessed our results with a new minimally invasive repair of pectus carinatum that requires neither cartilage incision nor sternotomy. MethodsFrom June 2005, we have corrected pectus carinatum using a method analogous to the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum repair. Thus far, we performed this intervention on 14 patients (mean age, 15 ± 1. 5 years). A steel bar has been inserted {{at the level of}} the maximum point of the sternal protrusion through small lateral incisions. The sternum is pushed back without osteotomy or chondrotomy. The bar is removed after 2 years. Patients' characteristics, operation time, hospital stay, and complications have been recorded. ResultsIn 1 patient with <b>asymmetric</b> deformity, 2 <b>bars</b> were placed. Operative time was 42 ± 20 minutes (mean ± standard deviation), and hospital stay was 3 days (median quartiles, 3 – 4 days) postoperatively. We experienced lateral shift of the bar in 1 patient, which was treated with remodeling and repositioning of the bar. No other complication occurred during the 18 -month follow-up period (mean range, 2 – 38 months). Thirteen of the 14 patients reported excellent or very good results. Patients returned to full activity within 2 months. Five bars have been removed. ConclusionsMinimally invasive repair of pectus carinatum leaves the integrity of the chest wall untouched.
