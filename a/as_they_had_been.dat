5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became evident {{that some of}} the other inbound flights were performing missed approaches, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unable to complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway.

5|$|In 1153, {{the wife}} of Roger de Beaumont, 2ndEarl of Warwick, was tricked into believing {{that her husband was}} dead, and {{surrendered}} control of the castle to the invading army of Henry of Anjou, later King Henry II. According to the Gesta Regis Stephani, a 12th-century historical text, Roger de Beaumont died on hearing the news that his wife had handed over the castle. Henry later returned the castle to the Earls of Warwick <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> supporters of his mother, Empress Matilda, in The Anarchy of 1135–1154.|$|E
5|$|In the {{election}} of 1796, under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential electors had two votes, which they were to cast for different men. The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President. This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> thought disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned {{to deal with this}} by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Installation of {{military}} communications equipment {{and plans to}} reclaim land. Malaysia alleged that Singapore's installation {{of military}} communications equipment on Pedra Branca was done secretly, {{and that it had}} only learned about this when it received Singapore's memorial in the case. As regards Singapore's plans to reclaim land around the island, Malaysia said it could not have reacted to some of the documents <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> secret.|$|E

5|$|While the Beatles were there, the Maharishi was {{negotiating}} with the Indian government to use some nearby parkland for an airstrip for a plane {{which he had been}} given; a deal which several thousand landless peasants objected to <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> denied the use of the land for farming. The ashram was surrounded by barbed wire and the gates were kept locked and guarded. While the Maharishi kept the media away from his famous students, he himself gave interviews to the press.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} The Sting (1986) and Electro Reggae (1987) {{as members}} of their Taxi Gang band, Sly and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on Rhythm Killers. They recorded the album {{over a period of}} three months at Quad Recording in New York City. Before entering the studio, Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at the studio, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> known to do since their early years in Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{continued}} to issue orders, Sudirman only returned to active duty on 17December; {{in light of the}} growing tension between the Dutch and Indonesian forces, he ordered the TNI soldiers to maintain an increased level of awareness; he also ordered large-scale military exercises as a in an unsuccessful attempt to convince the Dutch that the TNI was too strong to attack. Two days later, after a nighttime announcement that they were no longer bound by the Renville Agreement, on 19 December the Dutch launched Operation Kraai, an attempt to capture the capital at Yogyakarta. By 07:10 local time (UTC+7), the airfield at Maguwo had been taken by paratroopers under the command of Captain Eekhout. Sudirman, upon becoming aware of the attack, had an order read over RRI which stated that soldiers should fight <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> trained– as guerrillas.|$|E

5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E
5|$|During Princess Elizabeth's 1950 tour of Canada, she {{was promised}} a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the {{arrangements}} {{to be made}} by Peter Scott. Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> fed for decades by conservationist Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{interpreted}} the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11thand 12thcenturies {{as evidence that}} warfare was common, and usually between local lords. Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Before the 12thcentury, castles were as uncommon in Denmark <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in England before the Norman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences. The motte and bailey remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Ireland well into the 12thcentury. At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{sales of}} Hardy Boys books began to drop. The Stratemeyer Syndicate {{conducted}} a survey, which {{revealed that the}} decline in sales {{was due to the}} perceived high cost of the books and to competition from television. As a result, the Syndicate approved an hour-long pilot for a new Hardy Boys television show. The pilot, based on The Mystery of the Chinese Junk, was aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on September 8, 1967 and starred Tim Matthieson (later Matheson) as Joe Hardy and Rick Gates as Frank. Both actors were twenty at the time of production and portrayed the Hardy Boys as young adults rather than children, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the Mickey Mouse Club serials. The show did poorly, however, and the series was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it {{was found to be}} in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation. After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive's exhaust stack, it was soon running smoothly.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1907, a gas {{explosion}} aboard the ship injured several crewmen. During political unrest in April 1913, {{part of the}} crew of Vasco da Gama {{had to be removed}} from the ship, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> involved in a planned ultra-Radical coup d'état against the First Portuguese Republic. On 14 May 1915, the crew again participated in unrest; they mutinied and killed the ship's captain and bombarded Lisbon, killing around one hundred people. Vasco da Gama remained the flagship of the Portuguese Navy at least as late as 1914, as the Portuguese naval budget was insufficient to fund a suitable replacement vessel. Thoroughly obsolete, she remained in the Portuguese fleet until 1935, when she was sold for scrapping.|$|E

5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E
5|$|Storm and the Hurricanes {{received}} the most votes in the first Mersey Beat magazine poll, but many votes were disqualified <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> posted from the same {{place at the same}} time and were written in green ink; although never proven, it was thought that Storm had posted the votes. This meant that the Beatles reached the top position, with the Hurricanes coming fourth, even though the Beatles had also been sending in extra votes themselves. Storm was often photographed for the magazine, such as being surrounded by nurses when he left the hospital after breaking a leg during a performance, or playing for the Mersey Beat XI football team.|$|E
5|$|The NZRFU named Gallaher captain for the tour, with Billy Stead as vice-captain. A week {{into the}} voyage to Britain aboard the SS Rumutaka, rumours {{circulated}} {{that some of}} the southern players were unhappy with the appointment of Gallaher, and with what they perceived as an Auckland bias in the squad. The dissidents contended that the captain and vice-captain should have been elected by the players, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> on the 1897 and 1903 tours to Australia. Gallaher recognised the damage factionalism might do to the team and offered to resign, as did the vice-captain Stead. Although the teams' manager refused to accept the resignations, the players still took a vote—17 out of 29 endorsed the NZRFU's selections.|$|E
