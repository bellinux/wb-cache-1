She relieved her sister Ramillies as the parent ship of the division in June 1911, and was in turn relieved of this duty by her sister Empress of India in November. The ship was taken out of service in December 1911 and towed to the Motherbank by the battleship Bellerophon in August 1912.

At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units.

5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unit.</b> The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E
