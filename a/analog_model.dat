2500|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} (FDR) was an antiquated <b>analog</b> <b>model</b> which used metal foil strips scratched by moving pins. Here, it did not record vertical acceleration readings and misrecorded heading indications. One needle recorded some lines twice, initially confusing the investigators, leading the team to send the FDR to the American company which manufactured it. The manufacturer asked an ex-employee, the highest expert regarding the company's {{flight data recorder}}s, to temporarily leave retirement to examine the recorder. The expert concluded that the needle {{supposed to have been}} recording the altitude had been shaking so much that it left other stray marks on the foil. This particular FDR was able to record for hundreds of hours; further investigations found that the needle had been shaking abnormally for months. This told investigators that another component, not just the APU with the broken mount, had also been vibrating. The investigators charted the vibrations and found that two months before the crash, the vibrations stopped for two weeks, since during that period the aircraft received a major overhaul in Canada by the airline's previous owner. Afterward, the vibrations increased up to the accident flight. During the Canadian company's test flights of the aircraft and its first several passenger flights for Partnair, the FDR recorded almost no abnormal vibrations. A review of the maintenance records of the aircraft revealed that during the overhaul, the mechanic discovered wear on one of the four bolts and sleeves that held the vertical fin and fuselage together and replaced them. The vibrations stopped after the parts were replaced, but gradually worsened afterwards.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} if a polymer {{is suitable}} for <b>analog</b> <b>modeling,</b> {{it is essential to}} know the theological properties of the material. Polymers used in <b>analog</b> <b>modeling</b> exhibit a complex theological behavior; only part of which has been taken into account in most modeling studies. The mechanical behavior is strongly dependent on strain rate and temperature, and is characterized by specific dependencies of the storage and loss moduli, related to the elasticity and viscosity, on the deformation rate (frequency). We have measured the storage and loss moduli at a broad range of strain rates and strains, using an oscillatory parallel-disk rheometer. Investigated materials are polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), mixtures of PDMS and BaSO 4 (filler), Rhodorsil Gomme and mixtures of Rhodorsil Gomme and plastilina, all commonly used in analog experiments. Our measurements show that the theological properties of mixtures of plastilina and Rhodorsil Gomme depend on its deformation history. Therefore, these mixtures are problematic for <b>analog</b> <b>modeling.</b> For mixtures of PDMS and BaSO 4, the significance of the elastic component increases with increasing filler content, and accordingly, these mixtures have a limited application for modeling of viscous deformation. Pure PDMS and Rhodorsil Gomme exhibit Newtonian flow behavior at strain rates commonly used in <b>analog</b> <b>modeling.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Are <b>analog</b> <b>models</b> of {{computations}} {{more powerful}} than classical models of computations? From a series of recent papers, {{it is now clear}} that many realistic <b>analog</b> <b>models</b> of computations are provably equivalent to classical digital models of computations from a computability point of view. Take, for example, the probably most realistic <b>model</b> of <b>analog</b> computation, the General Purpose <b>Analog</b> Computer (GPAC) <b>model</b> from Claude Shannon, a model for Differential Analyzers, which are analog machines used from 1930 s to early 1960 s to solve various problems. It is now known that functions computable by Turing machines are provably exactly those that are computable by GPAC. This paper is about next step: understanding if this equivalence also holds at the complexity level. In this paper we show that the realistic <b>models</b> of <b>analog</b> computation – namely the General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) – can simulate Turing machines in a computationally efficient manner. More concretely we show that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can be simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than those used in the original Turing computation. As we recently proved that functions computable by a GPAC in a polynomial time with similar restrictions can always be simulated by a Turing machine, this opens the way to, first, a proof that realistic <b>analog</b> <b>models</b> of computations do satisfy the effective Church Turing thesis, and second to a well founded theory of complexity for <b>analog</b> <b>models</b> of computations. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{a segment}} of DCC-powered track, it is {{possible}} to power a single <b>analog</b> <b>model</b> locomotive by itself (or in addition to the DCC equipped engines), depending on the choice of commercially available base systems. The technique is known as zero stretching. Either the high or the low pulse of the zero bits can be extended to make the average voltage (and thus the current) either forward or reverse. However, because the raw power contains a heavy AC component, DC motors heat up much more quickly than they would on DC power, and some motor types (particularly coreless electric motors) can be damaged by a DCC signal.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{acoustic}} metrics {{share some}} statistical behaviours {{with the way}} that we expect a future theory of quantum gravity to behave (such as Hawking radiation), these metrics have sometimes been studied in the hope that they might shed light on the statistical mechanics of actual black holes. Some people have suggested [...] that analog models are more than just an analogy and that the actual gravity that we observe is actually an analog theory. But in order for this to hold, since a generic <b>analog</b> <b>model</b> depends upon BOTH the acoustic metric AND the underlying background geometry, the low energy large wavelength limit of the theory has to decouple from the background geometry.|$|E
50|$|A direct (mechanical) model {{uses the}} {{variables}} of air and water pressure, fluid velocity and viscosity, and displacement. An electrical <b>analog</b> <b>model</b> uses {{a different set of}} variables, namely, voltage and current. The outer and middle parts of the ear can be represented with a collection of coils, capacitors, and an ideal transformer to represent the leveraging effect of the ossicles. This circuit terminates with a capacitor representing the oval window. From there, the two channels are represented with a sequence of inductors and resistors for fluid flow within each channel with the two channels joined with a sequence of series resonant RLC circuits. Voltages across capacitances represent basilar membrane displacements. Element values along the cochlea are tapered in a logarithmic fashion to represent lowering frequency responses with distance.|$|E

40|$|To {{broaden the}} {{availability}} of granular materials that are suitable for the <b>analog</b> <b>modeling</b> of upper crustal deformation, we investigated the mechanical behaviors of pure quartz sand and two sandmixtures (quartz sandepowdered barite and quartz sand mica crystals) using ring-shear tests and simple convergent sandbox experiments. The ring-shear test {{results indicate that the}} three materials have similar peak friction angles (between 39. 25 ° and 36. 02 °), but the magnitude of the shear strain and the shear strength required to cause their failure are different. The differences between the <b>analog</b> <b>models</b> are identified by distinct fault kinematics and different grain flows, which are primarily related to differences in the plastic elasto-frictional rheology. We conclude that the use of the quartzemica mixture, which showed the strongest distributed (plastic) deformation, can improve <b>analog</b> <b>models</b> where different materials are required to simulate crystalline basement (sand) and supracrustal rocks (sand mica mixture). This is a common situation in extension and inversion tectonics, such as, for example, in inversion tectonics, when a granitic basement block acts as a buttress...|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{regulatory}} structures {{have been}} built for an <b>analog</b> <b>model</b> and are not optimized for cognitive radio. Regulatory bodies in the world (including the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and Ofcom in the United Kingdom) as well as different independent measurement campaigns found that most radio frequency spectrum was inefficiently utilized. Cellular network bands are overloaded {{in most parts of}} the world, but other frequency bands (such as military, amateur radio and paging frequencies) are insufficiently utilized. Independent studies performed in some countries confirmed that observation, and concluded that spectrum utilization depends on time and place. Moreover, fixed spectrum allocation prevents rarely used frequencies (those assigned to specific services) from being used, even when any unlicensed users would not cause noticeable interference to the assigned service. Regulatory bodies in the world have been considering whether to allow unlicensed users in licensed bands if they would not cause any interference to licensed users. These initiatives have focused cognitive-radio research on dynamic spectrum access.|$|E

Deep editing, however, wasn't as straightforward, because the sound engine contained no less than 13 DSP-modeled oscillator types, each one offering {{a large number of}} parameters to adjust. Some of the most used DSP models were the <b>analog</b> <b>model</b> (based on the classic osc+filter+amp scheme, although with many powerful enhancements), the VPM model (some sort of FM synthesis which cleverly avoided Yamaha's FM patent) and the [...] "physical modeling" [...] algorithms. The latter deserves special mention. In the mid to late 1990s, it was believed that digital [...] "physical modeling", which recreated the sound of acoustic instruments (brass, strings, woodwinds, etc.) using DSP algorithms instead of samples, would eventually replace sample-based synthesis of those instruments, because of its unprecedented realism and expressiveness. As time passed, physical modeling seemed to lose its appeal to both manufacturers (because of the cost of investigation and implementation) and final users, who complained about the realism of the models and limited polyphony. Also, more complex playing techniques were required to play the models in a convincing way. Nevertheless, the Prophecy's low cost and broad implementation of sound generation techniques earned it a significant place in synthesizer history.|$|E
