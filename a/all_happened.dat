5|$|During the war, strong Germanization was {{introduced}} by the Nazi authorities. The Jews were in the worst position, followed by the Poles. Poles received lower food rations, {{they were supposed to}} pay extra taxes, and were not allowed to enter theatres, cinemas, and other venues. Polish and Czech education ceased to exist, Polish organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. The Nazis especially targeted the Polish intelligentsia and many functionaries died during the war. The German authorities introduced terror into Zaolzie. Mass killings, executions, arrests, taking locals to forced labour, and deportations to concentration camps <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> on a daily basis. The most notorious war crime was a murder of 36 villagers in and around Żywocice on 6 August 1944. Most of the victims were Poles. This massacre is known as Tragedia Żywocicka (the Żywocice tragedy). The resistance movement, mostly of Poles, was fairly strong in Zaolzie.|$|E
25|$|After Singapore's {{independence}} in 1965, the museum focused its collection to nation-building {{and the history}} of Singapore and was renamed the National Museum. Its zoological collections was moved to the biology department of the National University of Singapore and to some museums such as in Kolkata in India and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. This <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> in 1969. Its most iconic artefact was the skeleton of a blue whale found in Port Dickson in 1893 and was displayed from 1903 to 1969. The museum then featured exhibits on history, ethnology and arts of Singapore and the region.|$|E
25|$|The Riverworld series {{originated}} in a novel, Owe for the Flesh, written {{in one month}} in 1952 as a contest entry. It won the contest, but the book was left unpublished and orphaned when the prize money was misappropriated, and Farmer nearly gave up writing altogether. The original manuscript of the novel was lost, but years later Farmer reworked the material into the Riverworld magazine stories mentioned above. Eventually, {{a copy of a}} revised version of the original novel surfaced in a box in a garage and was published as River of Eternity by Phantasia Press in 1983. Farmer's Introduction to this edition gives the details of how it <b>all</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

25|$|As well as {{sharing the}} same seven actors, the trilogy was also written {{to use the same}} set: a flat in the London Docklands, where Ayckbourn himself owns a flat. Beyond that, there was no {{intentional}} link between the plays, and the only reason the name Damsels in Distress was chosen was that the plays <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> to include a female character in some sort of trouble. However, there were nonetheless a number of common themes that arose from the plays' settings: flats owned by well-to-do Londoners who know little of who their neighbours are or what they do; and seedy vices left behind from London's old East End coming back to haunt them. The plays also shared themes common to most Ayckbourn plays.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the regime}} of Karmal, the Parchamis took the most {{important}} government positions, while also Independent politician rose to power. The Khalqi faction still outnumbered the Parchamis, especially in Afghan military and other security sectors. Because of the Khalq-Parcham power struggle discipline within the party broke down. Karmal tried to replace seven Khalqi military officers with Parchamis to get better control of the party, the officers ended sending the letters back. The government did nothing to intervene or stop these officers, while the government of Karmal eventually executed thirteen Amin supporters. This would indirectly lead to the Khalqi failed military coups in June, July and October which <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> in 1980. This {{eventually led to the}} purge of the Khalqis from the government which virtually shut down the government leaving the country {{at the hands of the}} Soviet advisers. During this phase the Parchamis with the help of the Soviets were able to crush the coup at the last second. While Karmal was unsuccessful when it came to destroy factionalism within the party, the party became more secure because of the Khalqi purge of the government. In June 1981 the Revolutionary Council with the Central Committee was again expanded, with now including fifteen more members. At this meeting Nur was appointed President of the Council and Sultan Ali Keshtmand became the new Prime Minister of Afghanistan.|$|E

Meissner {{had been assigned to}} the 2009 Rostelecom Cup and the 2009 NHK Trophy for the Grand Prix season. She announced her withdrawal from both events on October 8, 2009 due to an injury to her right knee. Due to this, she did not receive a bye to the 2010 U.S. Championships and was too late to register to compete at the regional championships, thereby ending her season. She did not return to amateur competition. Commenting in July 2016, she said, [...] "The injury wasn't devastating, but things in my personal life <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|William Hurt was {{initially}} offered {{the role of}} Alan Grant, but turned it down without reading the script. Harrison Ford was also offered the role of Grant.

I hadn't read the book, knew nothing about it, hadn't heard anything about it, and {{in a matter of weeks}} I'm working with Spielberg." [...] Janet Hirshenson, the film's casting director, felt that Jeff Goldblum would be the right choice to play Ian Malcolm after reading the novel. Jim Carrey also auditioned for the role.

It's an amazing group of people and they are great to work with." [...] Fairbank-Hynes attended five auditions for the part, and she found out she got the part two days before filming started. She stated that she was pleased when she found out as attending that many auditions—the most she had auditioned for any part—made her want the part more. The character was still being written and changed a lot during the audition process. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." ...|$|E

500|$|Miller {{first heard}} about the {{clearing}} of the Les Innocents cemetery ten years before writing the novel, when reading a book by French medievalist and historian, Philippe Ariès; specifically his 1977 work entitled L'Homme devant la mort, or The Hour of Our Death. Ariès' book did not go into {{a great deal of}} detail concerning this actual event, however Miller was [...] "taken by the theatricality" [...] of it and decided to write a novel based around the exhumation. In an interview with Kira Cochrane he stated the novel [...] "appealed to [...] as being interesting, visually interesting", stating [...] "it was when it <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> that made it stand out. It's the 1780s, a few years before the French revolution". Miller further stated that his father's occupation as a doctor also had some bearing in his interest in the human body, stating [...] "I grew up looking at these things – my Beano and Dandy were the BMJ and The Lancet". Miller decided not to include any French dialogue in the novel as [...] "it is so pretentious" [...] in an English-language novel, stating [...] "I was afraid that my editor would strike it out".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I was {{supposed}} to be in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E

The most notorious war crime was a murder of 36 villagers in and around Żywocice on 6 August 1944. This massacre {{is known as the}} Żywocice tragedy (...) [...] The resistance movement, mostly composed of Poles, was fairly strong in Zaolzie. So-called Volksliste – a document in which a non-German citizen declared that he had some German ancestry by signing it; refusal to sign this document could lead to deportation to a concentration camp – were introduced. Local people who took them were later on enrolled in the Wehrmacht. Many local people with no German ancestry were also forced to take them. The World War II death toll in Zaolzie is estimated at about 6,000people: about 2,500Jews, 2,000other citizens (80% of them being Poles) and more than 1,000locals who died in the Wehrmacht (those who took the Volksliste). Also a few hundred Poles from Zaolzie were murdered by Soviets in the Katyn massacre.|$|E

500|$|Coulter and Grewal {{investigated}} if the birthday-number effect {{could be}} exploited {{in sales and}} marketing. Over 200 participants of an online survey were asked about an advertisement for a pasta dinner, where the price was secretly matched to {{the day of the}} month of their birthday. For example, someone born on the 16th [...] of a certain month would see the price $39.16. The researchers found that matching numbers increased price liking and purchase intention. When introducing a perceived threat to the self into the task, they found an exaggerated effect. From this they concluded that the positive affect linked to birthday-numbers transfers directly to consumers’ price predilections, and ultimately affects their purchase intentions. Keller and Gierl sought to replicate Coulter and Grewal's study. They manipulated the prices in advertisements for pizza and a music streaming service to match the birthday (day, year) of the participants in their lab study. They did not find any disproportionate liking of matching prices, neither for the year the participant was born in or the day. Keller and Gierl concluded that there must be some prerequisites such as priming stimuli to trigger the effect, although they suggested it is possible that their participants, who <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> to have been born between 1990 and 1999, saw their birthyear as price so often in real life that it had become too common.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast for}} series 2 were {{announced}} on 29 July 2010. Heshima Thompson and Tosin Cole were cast as brothers Asher and Sol Levi.

Everyone is fantastic to work with. I'm really excited." [...] Thompson, who has appeared in The Bill and Spooks, stated [...] "It's a great project {{to be a part}} of and I get to dance so this is going to be fun."

I'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders, which is one of the reasons I wanted to do the show." [...] Finally, Amanda Fairbank-Hynes, who appeared in An Education, said of her casting as Stevie Dickinson, [...] "It <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> so quickly but I'm really excited to be working on EastEnders. It's an amazing group of people and they are great to work with." [...] Additionally, Hollyoaks actress Roxanne McKee, and dance acts Flawless and Avant Garde also make appearances. Flawless were asked to appear in the show by Sathe, who has previously worked with Marlon Wallen from the troupe.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had <b>all</b> <b>happened.</b> The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
