Cartesian mathematical descriptions of motion held that all mathematical formulations had to be justifiable in terms of direct physical action, a position held by Huygens and the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, who, while following in the Cartesian tradition, developed his own philosophical alternative to Scholasticism, which he outlined in his 1714 work, The Monadology. Descartes has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy', and much subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. In particular, his Meditations on First Philosophy continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the Cartesian coordinate system — allowing algebraic equations to be expressed as geometric shapes in a two-dimensional coordinate system — was named after him.

This will ensure fatigue survivability in high vibration environments, {{opening the door}} to vertical interconnection in RF circuit design. This is, to the best of knowledge, the first complete design and prototype for an orthogonal interconnect at the board level for broadband RF circuits. An analytical approach is used to define the driving parameters in the stress distribution within a smooth curve joining two perpendicular surfaces using <b>analytical</b> <b>geometries,</b> and Finite Element Analysis is used to finalize the design and ensure all constituent materials in the interconnect are subjected to stresses below their fatigue strength at 10 million cycles at full deflection. A manufacturing process is then proposed using thermoforming to shape the Liquid Crystal Polymer base material into the desired geometry, as well as an assembly solution to mount the interconnect to an RF signal feed card. Finally, a test setup is designed allowing for high cycle fatigue testing within the order of hours, including the capability to monitor performance of the interconnect by tracking DC continuity through a simulated application using a single post design. The prototype interconnect is tested to failure and is shown to survive 18 million cycles of a typical loading application before failure of the LCP springs occurs in the mode predicted by the initial FEA model.

40|$|The {{encounter}} between the Stardust spacecraft and particles from comet 81 P/Wild 2 gave impacts at a relative velocity of 6. 1 km s- 1 and near perpendicular incidence to the collector surface. Such conditions are {{well within the}} performance limits of light gas gun laboratory simulations. For this study, two series of shots were conducted at the University of Kent, firing magnesium silicates (Mg end-member forsterite, enstatite, diopside and lizardite), followed by a suite of increasingly Ferich olivines (through to Fe end-member fayalite) into Stardust flight-spare foils. Preserved residues were analysed using scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray analyses (SEM/EDX). X-ray count integrals show that mineral compositions remain distinct from one another after impact, although they do show increased scatter. However, {{there is a small}} but systematic increase in Mg relative to Si for all residues when compared to projectile compositions. While some changes in Mg:Si ay be due to complex <b>analytical</b> <b>geometries</b> in craters, there appears to be some preferential loss of Si. In practice, EDX analyses in craters on Stardust AI 1100 foil inevitably include contributions from Fe- and Si-rich alloy inclusions, leading to further scattering of element ratios. Such inclusions have complicated Mg:Fe data interpretation. Compositional heterogeneity in the synthetic olivine projectiles also introduces data spread. Nevertheless, even with the preceding caveats, we find that the main groups of mafic silicates can be easily and reliably distinguished in EDX analyses performed in rapid surveys of foil craters, enabling access to a valuable additional collection of cometary materials Â© The Meteoritical Society, 2009.

Also in this process, there is a danger of losing fidelity of the geometry under consideration. This stresses the importance of a standard geometry definition for the communication link between varying CAD/CAM and grid system. The IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification) file is a widely used communication between CAD/CAM and the analysis tools. The scientists at NASA Research Centers - including NASA Ames, NASA Langley, NASA Lewis, NASA Marshall - have recognized this importance and, therefore, in 1992 they formed the committee of the 'NASA-IGES' which is the subset of the standard IGES. This committee stresses the importance and encourages the CFD community to use the standard IGES file for the interface between the CAD/CAM and CFD analysis.

40|$|A {{solution}} {{has been}} developed {{to the challenges of}} computation of derivatives with respect to geometry, which is not straightforward because these are not typically direct inputs to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver. To overcome these issues, a procedure has been devised that can be used without having access to the mesh generator, while still being applicable to all types of meshes. The basic approach is inspired by the mesh motion algorithms used to deform the interior mesh nodes in a smooth manner when the surface nodes, for example, are in a fluid structure interaction problem. The general idea is to model the mesh edges and nodes as constituting a spring-mass system. Changes to boundary node locations are propagated to interior nodes by allowing them to assume their new equilibrium positions, for instance, one where the forces on each node are in balance. The main advantage of the technique is that it is independent of the volumetric mesh generator, and can be applied to structured, unstructured, single- and multi-block meshes. It essentially reduces the problem down to defining the surface mesh node derivatives with respect to the geometry parameters of interest. For <b>analytical</b> <b>geometries,</b> this is quite straightforward. In the more general case, one would {{need to be able to}} interrogate the underlying parametric CAD (computer aided design) model and to evaluate the derivatives either analytically, or by a finite difference technique.
