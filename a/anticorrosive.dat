The pieces that composed its rifles and machine guns were schemed or executed by winches or drop hammers, except for the marks of the pistols gas release devices, that were of smelting.

40|$|In recent applications, {{nanotubes}} (NTs), nanometer-scale hollow cylinders, {{are emerging}} as a favourable choice to other vehicles (microparticles, layered clays, zeolites, etc.) for the entrapment and/or the delivery of active molecules, thanks to the advantages that they can offer: (1) NTs have open mouths, which makes the inner surface accessible and incorporation of species within the tubes particularly easy; (2) NTs have no swelling or porosity changes with changes in pH, {{and they are not}} vulnerable to microbic attack, therefore they are able to effectively protect the entrapped molecules against deterioration phenomena induced by external environment; (3) NTs have larger inner volumes (relative to the dimension of the tube), which can be filled with any desired chemical or biochemical species ranging in size from small molecules to proteins, and allow for loading more than one active agent in the same nanocarrier so that multifunctional systems can be obtained 1. Amongst the different types of existing NT, halloysite NT (HNT), a two-layered (1 : 1) aluminosilicate chemically similar to kaolin [Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 •nH 2 O], with the 1 ÷ 15 micron of length and 10 - 100 nm of inner diameter, is a nature material and an economical viable clay material that can be mined from deposits as a raw mineral. HNTs are available in thousands of tons, and remain sophisticated and novel natural nanomaterials which can be used for the loading of agents, i. e. <b>anticorrosives</b> for plastic and metals, biocides, pest repellent, drugs, etc. 2. The aims of this work is the development of a novel HNTs-based nanofiller with antimicrobial activity, useful for control the biodeterioration process of construction materials. Thanks to the high chemical compatibility of the HNTs with the cementitious materials, this nanofiller is expected to have improved antimicrobial effectiveness and higher stability, compared to the neat biocide not anchored to the HNTs. At this regard, natural HNTs were functionalized with a commercial biocide and used as co-formulating agent in a mortar substrate.

40|$|The {{ban on the}} use of {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFC's), {{the amendment}} of the second ordinance of the federal immissions control act and as well the general public's concern about the dangers of halogenated hydrocarbon solvents has initiated an intensive search for substitutes suitable for all use categories. The substitutes are mainly hydrocarbon solvents (HCS) which are defined as aliphatic (n- and iso-paraffins) and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons with a chainlength between 9 and 13, a boiling range of 180 to 220 C and a flashpoint above 55 C. These substances are hazardous not only because of their inflammability but also because of the poor knowledge about their longterm toxicologic properties. For these reasons a hearing on the health related assessment has been conducted by the Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veterinary Medicine (BgVV) and the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA). Estimates are that the total production and marketing of HCS ranges between 260 - 450 000 t/a. However, there is no information concerning the amount of HCS used in the different use categories. HCS' generated vapours can lead to explosive mixtures with air. Safety margins are poorly comparable {{because of the lack of}} standardized techniques to determine this physicochemical property. The toxicological relevance of additives like cleaning enhancers, stabilizers, viscosity adjusters and <b>anticorrosives</b> is not clear. The main route of emissions for HCS is the air. The knowledge about the ecotoxicological relevance is poor as well. The need for further research activities is deducted. Concerning the human exposure, a satisfactory amount of measurements are available only for the workplace in dry cleaning facilities. The burden in the housing area is much lower (values are given here up to 100 #mu#g/m" 3 [90 %]). The acute toxicity via the oral, inhalative or dermal pathway seems to be low. For rats, there is evidence for isoparaffins to have nephrotoxic as well as neurotoxic effects. Further studies on the longterm toxicology or on the carcinogenicity of the HCS were not reported. Gentoxic effects could not be deducted, although there is concern for the tumor promoting activity of HCS. Lamp oils are clearly hazardous for children. Epidemiological investigations on the longterm effect of HCS were not presented. (orig.)

30|$|The {{xenobiotic}} compounds benzotriazole (BTri), 5 -tolyltriazole (5 -TTri), and 4 -tolyltriazole (4 -TTri) are polar micropollutants {{commonly used}} as corrosion inhibitors. 4 - and 5 -TTri are commercially available as tolyltriazole mixture (TTri) that {{is widely used}} in metal finishing and as corrosion protection in cooling systems [1, 2]. Among other applications, these three benzotriazole species are mainly used as <b>anticorrosives</b> in aircraft deicing or breaking fluids [3], in household dishwashing detergents for silver protection [4], and as UV stabilizers [5, 6]. Due to an annual production volume of around 9, 000 tons in the USA and probably a much higher global production [7, 8], their widespread usage, high polarity (logP 1.26 and 1.78 for BTri and TTri, respectively), high water solubility, and poor biodegradability, these compounds occur in nearly all aquatic compartments [9 – 12]. This includes ground water with up to 1, 548  ng/L (all three compounds) [13], river systems with up to 7, 997  ng/L for BTri, and 19, 396  ng/L for TTri [14], and the North Sea (up to 40  ng/L, all three benzotriazoles) [15, 16]. Highest concentrations of 128 and 198  mg/L for BTri and TTri, respectively, were detected at a perched water monitoring well at an international airport [17]. Concentrations above 40  mg/L for BTri and 6  mg/L for 5 -TTri show toxic effects in Microtox® tests (Vibrio fischeri light emission as toxicity test system, Azur Environmental, Oceanside, CA, USA) and other organisms [18 – 20]. Thus, benzotriazoles might exhibit detrimental effects on aquatic systems [21]. However, due to their high efficiency in protecting metal surfaces from corrosion, their low costs, and a general low toxicity, these chemicals are frequently used in industrial and household applications [7, 22]. As wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are incapable of completely removing these compounds during the treatment process [6, 23 – 25], WWTP effluents constitute a major point source for benzotriazoles in the receiving rivers. Several workgroups reported different removal efficiencies in conventional WWTP ranging from 13 % to 62 % for BTri, 11 % to 74 % for 5 -TTri, and far less for 4 -TTri [26 – 29]. At laboratory conditions, biological removal of BTri is also incomplete while one study with 5 -TTri showed its biodegradation under aerobic conditions within 91  days [9]. Reported half-lives of BTri and 5 -TTri with 114 and 14  days [9], respectively, are not applicable in WWTP where hydraulic retention times (HRT) are often below 15  h during biological treatment [9]. Therefore, these three compounds are ubiquitous in river water across Europe receiving WWTP effluents [14].|$|R

50|$|Bioceramics' {{properties}} of being <b>anticorrosive,</b> biocompatible, and aesthetic make them quite suitable for medical usage. Zirconia ceramic has bioinertness and noncytotoxicity. Carbon is another alternative with similar mechanical properties to bone, {{and it also}} features blood compatibility, no tissue reaction, and non-toxicity to cells. None of the three bioinert ceramics exhibit bonding with the bone. However, bioactivity of bioinert ceramics {{can be achieved by}} forming composites with bioactive ceramics. Bioglass and glass ceramics are nontoxic and chemically bond to bone. Glass ceramics elicit osteoinductive properties, while calcium phosphate ceramics also exhibit non-toxicity to tissues and bioresorption. The ceramic particulate reinforcement has led to the choice of more materials for implant applications that include ceramic/ceramic, ceramic/polymer, and ceramic/metal composites. Among these composites ceramic/polymer composites have been found to release toxic elements into the surrounding tissues. Metals face corrosion related problems, and ceramic coatings on metallic implants degrade over time during lengthy applications. Ceramic/ceramic composites enjoy superiority due to similarity to bone minerals, exhibiting biocompatibility and a readiness to be shaped. The biological activity of bioceramics has to be considered under various in vitro and in vivo studies. Performance needs must be considered in accordance with the particular site of implantation.|$|E
5000|$|Hexavalent {{chromium}} (chromium(VI), Cr(VI), chromium 6) {{refers to}} chemical compounds that contain the element chromium in the +6 oxidation state (thus hexavalent). Virtually all chromium ore is processed via hexavalent chromium, specifically the salt sodium dichromate. Approximately 136000 tonne lb of hexavalent chromium were produced in 1985. Additional hexavalent chromium compounds are chromium trioxide and various salts of chromate and dichromate, among others. Hexavalent chromium {{is used in}} textile dyes, wood preservation, anti-corrosion products, chromate conversion coatings, {{and a variety of}} niche uses. Industrial uses of hexavalent chromium compounds include chromate pigments in dyes, paints, inks, and plastics; chromates added as <b>anticorrosive</b> agents to paints, primers, and other surface coatings; and chromic acid electroplated onto metal parts to provide a decorative or protective coating. Hexavalent chromium can be formed when performing [...] "hot work" [...] such as welding on stainless steel or melting chromium metal.
