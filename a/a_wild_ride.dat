25|$|Hubert has had {{the most}} success in the Craftsman Truck Series, scoring two top fives in fifteen races. He would make his first start in 1997 with Dana Racing at Colorado where he would finish 23rd. Hubert would race an {{additional}} four races in the #18 Dana Dodge. He dominated the 1997 Kragen / Exide 151 at Infineon Raceway only to finish second to Joe Ruttman. In 1998 he would drive five races for Phelon Motorsports in the #66 Carlin Burners & Controls Ford. His best finish was a 5th at Gateway {{and he was able}} to get a pole at Sears Point. Hubert would also drive one race for Engineered Victories Inc and finish 24th in the #89 Cyberdyne Tech Chevrolet. In 1999, he would compete in three races for Conley Racing and one race for Marty Walsh's #81 team. He had <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ride</b> during the 100th race in Craftsman Truck series history at Evergreen when he spun after contact from behind by David Starr through an opening in the inside wall and went into the infield. Amazingly, he didn't hit anything, but when he brought it into the pits seconds later, his brakes failed and his truck caught fire, sending him out. His best finish during the season, 17th, would come in the #7 Conely Racing Engines Chevrolet at Phoenix. He has yet to return to the Craftsman Truck Series since the 1999 season.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{hailed the}} story, characters, setting, and {{dialogue}} of Anachronox, citing its science fiction themes and offbeat, quirky humor. The Advertiser summarized the plot as [...] "a beefy storyline loaded with strong characters, powerful dialogue, outrageous humour, seemingly endless surprises and <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ride</b> around the galaxy." [...] Elliott Chin singled out the game's humor, which, while divisive of Computer Gaming Worlds staff at first, won it the publication's [...] "Best Use of Humor" [...] 2001 award. Even apart from humor, the dialogue was acclaimed as [...] "so clever, it almost distracts {{from the game}} play" [...] and as [...] "very natural and colloquial". David Gordon of The Independent enjoyed the game for its [...] "dark and ominous" [...] plot and setting, centered on the quest to stop {{the destruction of the}} universe. The setting was compared to Blade Runner, film noir, The Matrix, Total Recall and the Dark City franchise. Reviewers enjoyed the game's odd characters and how the team of [...] "has-beens and rejects" [...] brought new life to the genre, particularly by averting the coming-of-age cliché. Sly was well-received, described as a [...] "typical downtrodden B-movie private eye", a [...] "Mickey Spillane-style hero" [...] in a cyberpunk setting, and a [...] "space-age Sam Spade". Several critics complained about the game's slow start on the planet Anachronox, especially its elevator-riding scenes. Reviewer Elliott Chin disagreed, evoking [...] "a superb sense of timing, starting out small and slowly building to the main event", while David Phelan stated that strong character writing would encourage gamers to play beyond the [...] "pedestrian-paced" [...] opening scenes.|$|E
500|$|Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four, saying [...] "Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is easily the best stop-motion {{animated}} necrophiliac musical romantic comedy of all time. It is also just simply, wonderful: a morbid, merry tale of true love that dazzles the eyes and delights the soul." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Corpse Bride is a delightful mix of strange goings-on and imaginatively crafted puppetry, <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ride</b> through Burton's chaotic, splendidly original world." [...] Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "Corpse Bride will win your heart, if it doesn't rip it out of your chest first." [...] Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "There's a happy Halloween in store even for children who aren't allowed to trick or treat, and it's courtesy of Tim Burton's animated Corpse Bride." [...] Bruce Westbrook of The Houston Chronicle gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Amazingly fluid and drop-dead gorgeous, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is the best-looking, stop-motion animation film ever." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "Corpse Bride suffers from the same problem that has plagued Burton's recent live-action films: for all its formidable razzle-dazzle, it doesn't engage the heart." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "This vibrantly imaginative mix of horror and humor puts the f-u-n in funeral." ...|$|E
500|$|Young Adult Library Services Association {{placed the}} first volume of Arisa on its list of [...] "Great Graphic Novels for Teens" [...] for 2011. About.com's Deb Aoki {{reviewed}} {{the first volume}} of Arisa positively, praising it as [...] "compelling" [...] and [...] "a much darker tale" [...] than Ando's previous work Kitchen Princess; she later placed Arisa on her 2010 list of the [...] "Best New Manga" [...] for the shōjo category. Otaku USA magazine's Danica Davidson agreed that the plot was darker than Kitchen Princess and described the artwork as [...] "pretty and cutesy". According to Matthew Warner of Mania Entertainment, the initially cliched-seeming characters and plain premise helped to provide a [...] "strong contrast" [...] to the main storyline and [...] "the depraved and twisted nature of Arisa's class". While noting the presence of clichés and [...] "plot holes", Carlo Santos of Anime News Network enjoyed the first volume, describing it as [...] "a shoujo-styled Naoki Urasawa thriller, built upon layers of addictive mystery"; he had mixed feelings about her artwork, writing that it conveyed the plot well, but did not possess a distinct artistic style. In her review of the third volume, Rebecca Silverman, another reviewer for Anime News Network, wrote that while the middle-school setting felt believable and the mystery was intriguing, some aspects of the plot were trying on the reader's suspension of disbelief, and the artwork, though usually enjoyable, failed to be convincingly scary during frightening scenes. In her follow-up review of the eleventh and twelfth volumes, Silverman interpreted Arisa as struggling with Stockholm syndrome and wrote that it was unsettling, as by the conclusion, the character still remained in [...] "an emotionally unhealthy (or even abusive) relationship." [...] She enjoyed the suspense and wrote that Midori's backstory sufficed to explain his actions, concluding [...] "Arisa has been <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ride,</b> an unexpected horror/mystery shoujo gem." ...|$|E
