5|$|At the Prom, Chuck foils a plot by Penelope (Amanda Setton), Hazel (Dreama Walker), Isabel (Nicole Fiscella), and Nelly Yuki (Yin Chang) {{to humiliate}} Blair during Prom royalty elections. Chuck admits to Serena and Dan {{that he has}} {{secretly}} been altering Nate and Blair’s Prom night in order to recreate the scenes from Blair's Prom scrapbook. Meanwhile, Blair feels disconcerted while dancing with Nate and ends their relationship {{by the end of}} the night. Blair explains to Serena that after completing high school with Nate, he feels like simply a high school boyfriend. The girls reminisce about growing up together through crazy times, like sisters. Lily apologizes to Rufus and CeCe. Rufus expresses concern that Lily is too unpredictable <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like her mother. CeCe remains indifferent, but agrees to return to Lily's home.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert was the {{recipient}} of a long letter from Boniface who complained about the lax morals of the clergy in the British Isles, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> drinking of alcohol by the Anglo-Saxon bishops. Cuthbert also sent letters to Lull who was Archbishop of Mainz and a native of England. During Cuthbert's time as archbishop he no longer claimed authority over all of Britain, like his predecessor Theodore. Pope Gregory III in 735 had sent a pallium to the bishop of York, raising the see of York {{to the status of}} an archbishopric. As a sign of the enhanced status of York, Cuthbert only consecrated bishops south of the Humber and his synods were attended only by bishops from the south of England.|$|E
25|$|According to some critics, however, {{some of the}} {{research}} lacks the rigor of a coherent economic theory, contains unstated ideological biases, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of it is undertaken by individuals closely associated with the index and reforms, so it is not sufficiently independent to be fully credible.|$|E

Subsequently they worked with Malcolm McLaren for several months, later becoming a prototype for the Sex Pistols.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} is that IMF programs are only {{designed to address}} poor governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention in markets, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> state ownership. This assumes that this narrow range of issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised and differing contexts are ignored. A country may also be compelled to accept conditions it would not normally accept had they not been in a financial crisis in need of assistance.|$|E

This is {{in addition to those}} who have dysplastic nevi being at higher risk of this cancer (the uncertainty is in regard to acquiring benign moles). To prevent and reduce the risk of melanoma caused by UV radiation, the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute recommends staying out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. standard time (or whenever one's shadow is shorter than one's height). The National Cancer Institute also recommends wearing long sleeves and trousers, hats with a wide brim, sunscreens, and sunglasses that have UV-deflecting lenses.|$|E
25|$|On 24March 1943, Päts {{was sent}} to forced {{treatment}} in psychoneurotic hospitals first in Kazan, then in Chistopol in Tatar ASSR. His forced psychiatric hospitalization was justified by his “persistent claiming of being the President of Estonia”. On 29April 1952, Päts was found guilty according to § 58-14 and § 58-10 of the Penal Code, which meant counter-revolutionary sabotage and anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary propaganda and agitation. Forced treatment was ended in 1954 and Päts {{was sent to}} a psychoneurology hospital in Jämejala, Estonia. Recognition by the locals <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention resulted him being sent to Burashevo psychiatric hospital in Kalinin Oblast (now Tver Oblast), where he eventually died on 18 January 1956.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 {{one of the}} U.S. Senate {{seats for}} Delaware became vacant and the Union Republicans in the Delaware General Assembly {{attempted}} to electing Addicks. Although {{they did not have}} enough votes to do so, the Union Republicans were able to block the election of any other candidate. Because of this deadlock, the seat remained vacant for four years. When the other Senate seat came open in 1901, it too was left vacant due to the deadlock. Finally, in 1903, the matter became national news <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of an embarrassment. Addicks relented and allowed Ball to be elected to the remaining two years left on the first seat and Addicks' lieutenant, J. Frank Allee was elected to the second seat.|$|E

25|$|Norway Post {{took the}} {{initiative}} to start an airline service from Bergen via Trondheim to Tromsø, which would allow a letter to travel between Bergen and Tromsø in two days, rather than eight. Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) received a concessional monopoly on all scheduled air services in Norway from 1935, and the postal service contracted DNL to operate a route to Northern Norway. Several places were considered, such as Skansen, which was located in the city center on the Trondheimsfjord. However, DNL considered that the fjord was not sufficiently protected against the elements, had too large waves <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> ship traffic. The airline therefore chose a site at Valsen {{on the shore of}} Jonsvatnet. The decision was made only days before the maiden flight.|$|E
25|$|The EFSA panel also {{determined}} intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes {{in the elderly}} {{are the same as}} for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity. Pregnant and breastfeeding women require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300 mL/day. To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration - too little <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> water, respectively - can have harmful consequences. Drinking too much water is one of the possible causes of hyponatremia, i.e., low serum sodium.|$|E
25|$|American Communications Association v. Douds was {{the first}} {{important}} test of loyalty oaths in the U.S. Supreme Court. A year later, the Court relied heavily on Douds oath-as-predictor-of-future-action rationale in upholding a local government loyalty test in Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716 (1951). The divided court in Douds anticipated the difficulty the Supreme Court would have in the coming years, during which time it usually upheld loyalty oaths but found no clear test or rule for doing so. The case {{was also the first}} time the Court applied a balancing test to indirect restrictions on free speech, a test the Court would consistently apply in many similar cases in the future. But the balancing test itself has been criticized as offering little guidance to future courts, not enough protection to First Amendment rights, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> deference to the legislature.|$|E

25|$|This {{concept of}} decisively {{altering}} genes has {{coined the concept}} of the Designer Baby. Currently, PGD can alter some physical and health attributes, and projections for the future power of PGD in its ability to create the ideal human has raised many ethical issues. Projections for societal repercussions include changing the realm of athletics, creating human weapons, and exchanging autonomy over one’s life course for predesignation. Also, with a limited view of the future, it is difficult to alter a human’s genetic makeup without knowing full repercussions. For example, through gene therapy, a lab was able to make rats lose weight, but the long-term effects of the gene manipulation lead to worry of toxin production <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> weight loss. To prevent some of these issues from arising, scientists work towards stabilising the entire process to make it safer before applying a higher degree of gene modification to the human embryos in IVF.|$|E
25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities {{is not just about}} cars <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E
25|$|No tactical-technical section {{existed in}} either the RLM or Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL), with a near-complete lack of any system for a direct manner for combat pilots to place field {{requests}} for improvements to existing weapons systems, and to address improved tactics for their use. The Luftwaffe was therefore unable to provide appropriate equipment for the task asked of its units. Starting in 1940, all planning was short-sighted {{as a matter of}} policy. The need for technical improvements was resisted as pushing through upgrades would have reduced production rates of standard aircraft. Hardware would have to {{be turned over to the}} production of new types, causing a drop in output. This meant obsolete sub-variant or main types were kept in production too long. The OKL failed to produce adequate numbers of aircraft and refused to cut bomber production in favour of fighters until mid-1944. Even when these events were corrected, procurement was poor. As one key example late in the war, the Messerschmitt Me 262 was unable to be introduced rapidly enough. Partly through the pioneering nature of its axial-flow jet engines, the first ever placed in production, requiring much development time to make them reliable enough for front-line use, <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time was wasted between operational testing, tactical-doctrinal development and training. General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters) Adolf Galland took responsibility for this failure.|$|E

500|$|Further {{controversy}} {{arose in}} New York in May 1913, {{two months after}} the conclusion of the Chicago trial. Anthony Comstock, head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and nationally recognized for his campaigns against [...] "smut", saw September Morn sources differ as to whether it was the original or a print [...] on display in the window of Braun and Company, an art dealership on West 46th Street. Rushing inside, he raged [...] "There's too little morn <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> maid! Take it out!".

There is something cold and lifeless about the results." [...] Vermeule suggests that the quarter started a trend of similar portrait coins issued by the United States, notably the Jefferson nickel and Franklin half dollar. [...] The historian preferred Laura Fraser's version, and termed Flanagan's reverse [...] "a stiff bit of heraldry amid too large a wreath <b>and</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> or too large lettering".|$|E
