5|$|Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Valestra; a {{powerful}} crime boss who goes into business with Carl Beaumont, and threatens {{to kill him}} for embezzling money. Once Andrea returns, he is an old, decrepit man, dependent on <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> tank to live due to years of smoking. He hires the Joker to kill Batman, but the Joker double-crosses him and kills him with Joker venom.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
50|$|ECTFE shows good fire {{resistance}} with <b>a</b> limiting <b>oxygen</b> index of 52%. This {{is between the}} fully fluorinated polymers PTFE, PFA and FEP with <b>an</b> limiting <b>oxygen</b> index of 95% and other partially fluorinated polymer like PVDF with <b>a</b> limiting <b>oxygen</b> index of 44% and ETFE with <b>an</b> limiting <b>oxygen</b> index of 30%.|$|R
50|$|Oxonine is an {{unsaturated}} heterocycle of nine atoms, with <b>a</b> <b>oxygen</b> replacing <b>a</b> carbon at one position. Oxonine is a nonaromatic compound.|$|R
25|$|Filling {{a diving}} {{cylinder}} with pure oxygen costs around {{five times more}} than filling it with compressed air. <b>As</b> <b>oxygen</b> supports combustion and causes rust in diving cylinders, it should be handled with caution when gas blending.|$|R
5|$|Nitrite is also {{a common}} ligand that can {{coordinate}} in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from <b>an</b> <b>oxygen).</b> Nitro-nitrito isomerism is common, where the nitrito form is usually less stable.|$|E
5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. <b>An</b> <b>oxygen</b> tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E
30|$|OUR {{values were}} {{measured}} using <b>a</b> 5331 <b>oxygen</b> probe connected to <b>a</b> 5300 <b>A</b> <b>oxygen</b> monitor (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH), which was calibrated before each assay {{according to the}} manufacturer’s instructions and then was used immediately following calibration to ensure accuracy. Immersion of the probe into the cell suspension caused the initial volume to rise, thus leaving no headspace. The conversion from per cent saturation to mg/L oxygen was determined {{on the basis of}} assay temperature and salinity.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>oxygen</b> binds to one monomer of hemoglobin, the tetramer's {{conformation}} {{shifts from}} the T (tense) {{state to the}} R (relaxed) state. This shift promotes the binding of oxygen to the remaining three monomer's heme groups, thus saturating the hemoglobin molecule with oxygen.|$|R
50|$|There is <b>a</b> {{hyperbaric}} <b>oxygen</b> facility.|$|R
5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E
5|$|Sudeep takes Bindu to {{his home}} and Nani follows them. Nani seriously injures Sudeep with a needle. The latter clips Nani's wing and fatally stabs him with the same needle. Nani jumps through the flame of a burning match then into a loaded cannon, which fires. The {{projectile}} passes through Sudeep and hits <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> cylinder, which explodes and kills him. Bindu takes the fly's wing and makes an amulet with it. One day when travelling to work, an eve teaser bothers her; Nani, again reborn as a fly, attacks him with a needle before announcing his return.|$|E
5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{consumption}} is <b>an</b> independent variable, a fixed feed rate {{will give a}} range of possible oxygen fractions for any given depth. In the interests of safety, the range can be determined by calculating oxygen fraction for maximum and minimum oxygen consumption {{as well as the}} expected rate.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>oxygen</b> metabolizes in the body, {{potentially}} harmful {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) are created. The human body implements an antioxidant defense system to protect against ROS. In the event that these defenses are overpowered by the ROS, cell damage results (which is {{a major cause of}} aging in the body).|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that unless the surface of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) is free of {{hydrocarbon}} contamination, anomalous changes in the oxygen and fluorine contents, as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and hence also the surface properties, may be improperly ascribed to a PTFE film exposed to <b>a</b> <b>oxygen</b> plasma...|$|R
5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. The model of the mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John {{and forces}} him {{to lead him}} to the house. John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda {{appears in the doorway}} and seals the door, leaving Eric to die.|$|E
50|$|One quality this {{explosive}} has, that PETN does not, is <b>a</b> positive <b>oxygen</b> balance. Having <b>a</b> positive <b>oxygen</b> balance {{means that}} ETN possesses {{more than enough}} oxygen in its structure to fully oxidize all of its carbon and hydrogen upon detonation. This {{can be seen in}} the schematic chemical equation below.|$|R

5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues {{as to what the}} player should do next, features no HUD except for <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.|$|E
5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which water is splashed in Leslie's face was only shot twice, because McCarthy-Miller said Poehler would start anticipating it in more takes {{and it would not}} have {{appeared}} spontaneous. The first time the scene was acted, the cameras were accidentally not turned on, so only one take was usable for the episode. During the banquet for the Tellenson Awards, a video is shown of an ill Tony Tellenson (for whom the award was named) in his hospital room. McCarthy-Miller shot the scene with minimal staff on a separate set. Multiple takes were filmed, and the severity of illness differed in each one. The final clip used in the episode shows Tellenson wearing a mask attached to <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> tank, {{which is one of the}} healthiest versions they filmed. The Jeanine Restrepo character was originally named Janet Restrepo, but was changed at the last moment. Poehler and the rest of the cast had already memorized the lines with the name Janet, and the actors had difficulty filming the scenes correctly as a result.|$|E
50|$|Without {{sufficient}} <b>oxygen,</b> <b>a</b> fire cannot begin, and it cannot continue. With <b>a</b> decreased <b>oxygen</b> concentration, {{the combustion}} process slows. Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, a fire blanket or water.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>oxygen</b> is <b>a</b> group 16 {{chemical}} element, sulfur atoms {{can replace}} some oxygen atoms in carbon-oxygen-central inorganic atom covalent bonds of an ester. As a result, thiosulfinates and thiosulfonates, {{with a central}} inorganic sulfur atom, demonstrate clearly the assortment of sulfur esters, that also includes sulfates, sulfites, sulfonates, sulfinates, sulfenates esters.|$|R
40|$|Large {{amplitude}} rotor vibration of LE- 7 <b>A</b> <b>oxygen</b> turbopump was {{encountered in}} tests of LE- 7 A whole engine using LOX (liquid oxygen) {{although it was}} not large in tests of the turbopump alone using LN 2 (liquid nitrogen). Tests of the turbopump alone using LN 2 or LOX were conducted to confirm effects of fluid difference. Results of LOX tests were different from those of LN 2 tests. On the other hand, design modification of the inducer geometry and optimization of the inducer liner were carried out to suppress rotor vibration due to rotating cavitation. Tests of LE- 7 <b>A</b> <b>oxygen</b> turbopump installed the modified inducer and optimized inducer liner were also conducted to confirm improvement of the design in cryogenic fluids. Rotating cavitation was suppressed by the modification, but cavitation surge appeared. Test results of the turbopump will be discussed...|$|R
5|$|The song {{appears in}} The Acoustic Album (2006). It was {{performed}} in 2006 by the New England octogenarian chorus group Young@Heart. The group's performance was led by former chorus member Fred Knittle, who suffered from congestive heart failure and breathed with assistance from <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> tank. The performance was originally planned to be a duet between Knittle and Bob Salvini, another former chorus member, but Salvini died shortly before the show. Knittle performed it as a solo, {{as a tribute to}} his friend. The performance was initially recorded for a British documentary that aired on Channel 4; footage of the performance was uploaded to YouTube in November 2006 to positive response. An expanded version of the film, titled Young@Heart, debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival and was released in US theatres in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Tinker {{had serious}} health {{problems}} in his later life. Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright's disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> tent. However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of a toe and persisted until his left leg above the knee was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is <b>an</b> <b>oxygen</b> carrier {{that occurs}} in red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
