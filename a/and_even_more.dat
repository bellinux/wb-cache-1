Gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimise the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief for a man who had inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> suited for agricultural work.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell {{was used in the}} photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> efficient silicon rectifiers.|$|E
5|$|In December 1959, Manekshaw was {{appointed}} the commandant of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. Soon, {{he was in}} middle of an unwanted controversy that almost ended his career. In May 1961, Thimayya resigned as the COAS, and was succeeded by General Pran Nath Thapar. Earlier in the year, Major General Brij Mohan Kaul was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as the Quarter Master General (QMG) by Defence Minister Menon against the recommendation of Thimayya. This incident had led to Thimayya's resignation. Within no time, Kaul was made the Chief of General Staff (CGS), the second highest appointment at Army Headquarters after the COAS. Kaul soon became close to Nehru and Menon, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> powerful than the chief himself. This was not liked by senior army officials, including Manekshaw. He made a few derogatory comments on the political leadership, which led him to be marked as an anti-national.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{acquisitions}} {{have become increasingly}} difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for Old Masters – <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so for the Impressionists and Post-impressionists – have risen beyond its means. Some of the Gallery's most significant purchases in this period {{would have been impossible}} without the major public appeals backing them, including The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist by Leonardo da Vinci (bought in 1962) and Titian’s Death of Actaeon (1972). The Gallery's purchase grant from the government was frozen in 1985, but later that year it received an endowment of £50 million from Sir Paul Getty, enabling many major purchases to be made. In April 1985 Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his brothers, the Hon. Simon Sainsbury and Sir Timothy Sainsbury, had made a donation that would enable the construction of the Sainsbury Wing.|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism was {{pioneered by}} Gavin Hamilton and his proteges, the {{brothers}} John and Alexander Runciman, and David Allan. Alexander Runciman pioneered historical painting and Alan helped develop genre art, {{both of which}} would be taken up by Scottish artists in the next century. After the Acts of Union in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to be made in relatively cheap lead <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> economical painted or gilded plaster. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.|$|E
