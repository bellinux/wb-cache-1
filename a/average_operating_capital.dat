40|$|We draw {{on three}} strands of {{literature}} dealing with utilization, maintenance, and scrapping {{in order to}} analyze {{the properties of the}} respective policies and their interac-tions. We do so by focusing on the last period of the received multi-period service life model and extending it in three directions: first, by associating the physical deteriora-tion of equipment to the intensity of its utilization and maintenance; second, by ex-panding on the range of explainable operating policies to allow for idling, mothballing, capacity depleting, capacity preserving, full capacity, upgrading, and downgrading; and, third, by linking the operating policies to the capital policy of scrapping. Owing to these enhancements, the analysis leads to several important findings. One among them is that optimal operating policies behave usually in opposite directions, proceed-ing in time from harder to softer or vice versa, depending on the net revenue earning capability of the equipment under consideration. Another is that profit (loss) making equipment is scrappable iff on the <b>average</b> the <b>operating</b> <b>capital</b> deteriorates faster (slower), or equivalently improves slower (faster), than the scrapping capital. And still an-other result is that operating policies are determined jointly with scrapping policy capi-tal policies, thus suggesting that empirical investigations of their determinants should allow for this simultaneity.

40|$|The {{effect of}} capital {{structure}} and seasonality of fresh market vegetables was examined via the Target MOTAD model. The level of capital indebtedness and {{the selection of}} either a fall or spring season resulted in significantly different levels of enterprise mixes, expected returns, risk magnitudes, rates of change of risk magnitudes, and <b>operating</b> <b>capital</b> requirements. The fall season demonstrated larger initial levels of risk and larger increases {{in the level of}} risk due to increases in indebtedness. The spring season showed larger increases in risk between minimum risk point and the maximum expected return point (linear programming solution) on the risk-efficient frontier. <b>Operating</b> <b>capital</b> requirements were substantially higher for the fall season than for the spring season.

40|$|Abstract only. Balanced feed {{represents}} approximately 60 % {{of production}} costs in fish culture and ration size has significant effects on this parameter. Ration size {{varies according to}} culture strategies and producer knowledge. It can also have environmental implications since feed can be a pollutant. A bioeconomic model was developed for an intensive system with recirculation considering different ration sizes (100 % recommended levels, 80 %, 50 % and satiety). Assumptions for model parameterization were based on previous production experiments and market factors in Mexico. The 80 % ration resulted in the greatest reduction in water changes, energy and <b>operating</b> <b>capital,</b> and was profitable. The 50 % and satiety rations were not profitable, and the latter had the highest water change and <b>operating</b> <b>capital</b> requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to ease the planning of new toll projects by providing estimates of operating costs, and to help us make better informed decisions about the design of the toll collection system. To do so we use panel data for Norwegian toll companies to estimate average cost functions. The main results can be summarised as follows. We provide evidence of very important unexploited economies of scale. The estimates cost curves are very steep for traffic levels below the sample mean, and becomes almost entirely flat over a wide range above the sample mean. A higher share of vehicles using on board units will significantly reduce average costs. Competitive tendering will significantly reduce <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> costs by as much as 25 %. Our results also suggest that increased number of lanes, higher debt and passenger charging will increase <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> costs whereas <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> costs are lower for toll cordons compared with other projects. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} feasibility of four grow-out diets for the Asian catfish Clarias macrocephalus was evaluated on a 1000 m 2 /crop basis. Hatchery-bred catfish juveniles with mean body weight (MBW) of 3. 6 g and mean total length (MTL) of 7. 8 cm were stocked at 10 fish/m 2. Laboratory-formulated diet with 20 % crude protein (CP; Diet 1) resulted in net losses. Laboratory-formulated diet with 34 % CP (Diet 2), commercial feed pellet with 29 % CP (Diet 3), and a mixed diet of blanched chicken entrails (80 %) and rice bran (20 %) with 32 % CP (Diet 4) gave acceptable {{return on investment}} (ROI) of 131 - 326 % and return on <b>operating</b> <b>capital</b> of 52 - 71 %. Culture of Asian catfish fed Diet 2, however, attained higher net profit before tax per 1000 m 2 /crop, ROI (326 %), and has the lowest payback period on investment (0. 3 yr) or <b>operating</b> <b>capital</b> (1. 4 yr) compared with using Diets 3 and 4. Partial budget analysis showed that higher net benefit can be earned by using Diet 2 as feed for C. macrocephalus compared with using Diet 4. Sensitivity analysis done by increasing in feed cost by 20 % and decreasing the selling price of fish by 20 % showed that ROI were 107 - 262 % and 46 - 159 %, respectively and return on <b>operating</b> <b>capital</b> of 42 - 57 % and 18 - 35 %, respectively. Payback period on investment were 0. 4 - 0. 9 yr and 0. 6 - 1. 9 yr, respectively while payback period on <b>operating</b> <b>capital</b> were 1. 7 - 2. 2 yr and 2. 7 - 4. 7 yr, respectively. Results suggest that C. macrocephalus culture is economically feasible with Diets 2, 3 and 4 as feed {{but the use of}} Diet 2 is more profitable...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{the results of}} an econometric analysis of the influences of airline characteristics on the <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> costs per aircraft movement. The analysis combines a comprehensive selection of airline-output variables, airline-fleet variables, and airline-market variables. The results confirm the existence of economies of density, economies of load factor, economies of aircraft utilisation and economies of aircraft size. The paper does not provide evidence of economies of scale, economies of stage length or economies of fleet commonality. Furthermore, airlines that additionally operate full freighters, airlines that are members of a worldwide alliance and airlines that operate a multi-hub system face higher <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> costs per aircraft movement. Surprisingly, the regression results demonstrate that airlines that use newer aircraft have higher <b>average</b> <b>operating</b> costs per aircraft movement, suggesting that ownership costs (depreciation and leasing costs) of new aircraft outweigh the increasing maintenance costs of old aircraft. Finally, the results show that airlines that have a dominant position at their hubs or bases have higher operating costs per aircraft movement, implying that the absence of serious competitive pressure enables airlines to charge higher ticket prices and, with that, leads to a limited focus on cost savings...|$|R
