In his return against the San Diego Padres, he nearly {{hit a home}} run in his first at-bat. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4. Upon his return, Bonds resumed his high-caliber performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18 to 21 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.|$|E
5|$|Cain went 4–1 {{over his}} next five starts. This stretch was bolstered {{in part by}} a power surge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> by Cain himself. He hit his first and second career home runs in these starts, off Tim Redding of the Washington Nationals and Cubs' ace Carlos Zambrano. In September, he had an 03 record.|$|E

5|$|In the postseason, the Cardinals first {{faced the}} San Diego Padres in the 1996 National League Division Series. After sitting out Game1, Smith got the start in Game2 at Busch Stadium, helping his team go up {{two games in}} the series by {{notching}} a run, a hit and two walks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> along with an assist and a putout in the field. The Cardinals then swept the series by winning Game3 in San Diego.|$|E
5|$|The team flew to Miami for the season's {{penultimate}} series. Despite Hamels' quality {{start in}} game one, the Phillies were shut out 2–0. In {{the second game}} Kendrick made possibly his final start in a Phillies uniform a fine overall effort, allowing one run in seven innings of a 2–1 win and going three-for-three <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> (doubling and driving in a run). The Phillies lost the series, with the bullpen failing to hold the lead in a third-game 6–4 loss.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's {{teammate}} Jack Clark hit a late-inning {{home run}} {{of his own}} in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series.

5|$|Hansen {{earned his}} first win a week later, an 8–3 {{victory over the}} Philadelphia Phillies on July 16. The victory came in relief of Frank Seward, who started the game but pitched only one inning. He pitched four innings, {{allowing}} only one run; Ace Adams followed with four scoreless innings and earned the save. His fourth decision, a second career victory, did not come until July 31, when he defeated future teammate Jim Konstanty in a 9–7 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Hansen appeared again in a relief role, but pitched eight innings of one-run ball after starter Bill Voiselle allowed six runs in the game's first inning. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> Hansen got his first major-league hit and scored his second career run while striking out once.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Hansen was {{assigned}} to the Pirates-affiliated Hollywood Stars, an Open-classification minor league team based in Los Angeles. He appeared in three games, accumulating a 1.35 ERA on the mound and one hit in three at-bats <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> In one of those contests, he and Red Munger combined to hold the rival Los Angeles Angels to a 1–0 shutout. After being voted outstanding player of the week for his short tenure, Hansen voluntarily retired himself a second time after Pittsburgh Pirates president Branch Rickey refused to pay him $750 ($ today) that he was owed. The Pirates sent him a contract to play for the Triple-A New Orleans Pelicans, along with a paycheck, but he did not report, opting to remain retired.|$|E

However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E

40|$|An {{incompressible}} rigid viscoplastic {{material is}} confined between two planar plates which are inclined {{at an angle}} 2 ?. In a certain sense, the viscoplastic model adopted approaches rigid perfectly plastic models as the equivalent strain rate approaches zero and infinity. <b>The</b> <b>plates</b> intersect in a hinged line, and the angle ? slowly decreases from an initial value. The maximum-friction law is assumed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b> A boundary value problem for {{the flow of the}} material is formulated, and its asymptotic analysis is carried out near the friction surface. The solution may exhibit sliding or sticking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b> Solutions which exhibit sticking may have a rigidly rotating zone in the region adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b> Solutions which exhibit sliding are singular.

It was the Giants' 16th straight victory {{in a row in}} games started by Zito (including the 2012 regular season and postseason), the longest such streak by a Giants pitcher since 1936 by Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher Carl Hubbell. However, Zito struggled {{for the rest of the}} season, going 2–10 with a 6.24 ERA after April 21 and losing his rotation spot a couple times late in the year.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the regular}} season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also {{dangerous}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the Federal League, had begun play, and the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored that city to the major leagues {{for the first time}} since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the initial}} {{characterizations}} of tsunami earthquakes came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the slip of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E

40|$|Large plastic {{deformation}} of homogeneous square and rectangular steel plates at high impulsive blast loading has been investigated. <b>The</b> <b>plates</b> were clamped along all edges to a rigid support. The typical pyramidal {{shape of the}} test objects proves that the movement is completely different from static laoding effects. High peaks of shear force cause tearing off <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> along <b>the</b> support <b>at</b> impulsive overloading. <b>The</b> targets can withstand high impulsive loading {{only if they are}} designed in such a manner that tearing off is prevented and large deflection is possible. Small-scale experiments at plates of 1 qm, 1 / 4 qm and 1 / 16 qm were conducted to find the deformation of homogeneous steel plates as a function of blast impulse. The distribution of blast impulse <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate's</b> surface was carefully measured. The test results from differently sized plates are in agreement with Hopkinson-Cranz scaling. The observed pyramidal shape of the test objects and <b>the</b> maximum deflection <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate's</b> center are in agreement with Finite Element structural dynamic calculations.

5|$|The Orioles {{decided to}} put Davis at first base {{full-time}} in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches and teammates believed this helped Davis succeed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> as well. He set a personal home run goal before the season but refused to share it. On April 5, Davis set a new Major League record with 16 RBI {{in the first four}} games of a season. He also became the fourth MLB player in history to hit a home run in the first four games of the season (Nelson Cruz, Mark McGwire, Willie Mays), including a grand slam against Tyler Robertson in the fourth game, a 95 victory over the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} minor league career in Class A for the Bellingham Giants.

He gave more thought to his future in baseball, however, and after graduation decided to return to the Giants organization and developed into a standout pitching prospect. After a season with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes, he pitched for both the A and AA levels for (the San Jose Giants and Shreveport Captains) in 1998 as a starter. During his tenure with San Jose he started 22games with an ERA of 3.32 and 118 strikeouts, leading the Class A Giants to the California League championship. Promoted to AA Shreveport in 1999, he pitched in only two games before being promoted to the parent club in 1999.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} inning, after {{striking}} out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem {{gave up a}} solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came {{into the bottom of}} the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2011, Young {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the New York Mets worth $1.1 million with the ability to reach up to $4.5 million through incentives. In his first career start with the Mets on April 5, 2011, Young went five and a third innings while striking out seven batters, recording the victory in a 7–1 Mets win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He also went three for three <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> with two runs batted in against Phillies starter Cole Hamels. In that game, Young became the first Mets pitcher in team history to record two hits in a single inning. Shortly after the start of the season, Young sustained an arm injury which forced him to miss the remainder of the 2011 season on the disabled list. Following the season, he was a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Ruth had {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E
