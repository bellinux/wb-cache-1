5|$|In 1964, the fort's ditch {{became a}} tank {{cleaning}} farm for the Malta Drydocks. The depot, {{which is known}} as Ricasoli Tank Cleaning Facilities, treats liquid waste from ships <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grand Harbour and removes oil and other chemicals prior to releasing the waste into the sea. The facility was privatized in 2012, and it is currently under the management of Waste Oils Co. Ltd.|$|E

In July 2001, Atta met with bin al-Shibh in Spain, where they coordinated {{details of the}} plot, including final target selection. Bin al-Shibh also passed along bin Laden's wish for the attacks {{to be carried out}} as soon as possible. Some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt Saudi officials who were family members, or used fraudulent passports to gain entry.|$|E

5|$|It {{seems that}} most of the Romano-British sites were {{abandoned}} by the 5th century and the arable land reverted to scrub and woodland. <b>Arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 6th century, the Anglo-Saxons began to clear the land again. Bletchley ("Blaeca's clearing") and Shenley ("Bright clearing") date from this period. Large settlements have been excavated at Pennyland and near Milton Keynes Village. Their cemeteries have been found at Newport Pagnell, Shenley and Tattenhoe.|$|E
5|$|Johan Björnsson Printz, who it {{had been}} ennobled, was {{appointed}} {{to be the first}} royal governor of New Sweden, <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony on 15 February 1643. Under his ten-year rule, the administrative center of New Sweden was moved north to Tinicum Island (to the immediate SW of today's Philadelphia), where he built Fort New Gothenburg and his own manor house which he called the Printzhof.|$|E
5|$|Many {{new plant}} {{medicines}} arrived in Europe as products of Early Modern exploration {{and the resulting}} Columbian Exchange, in which livestock, crops and technologies were transferred between the Old World and the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. Medicinal herbs <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas included garlic, ginger, and turmeric; coffee, tobacco and coca travelled in the other direction.|$|E
50|$|Humans first <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Trout Creek {{area around}} 10,000 years ago. A pit-house {{discovered}} near Willowdale dates {{back at least}} 5,000 years. The first European Americans to <b>arrive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area were fur traders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1820s, including a group led by Peter Skene Ogden. <b>The</b> first settlers <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s. <b>In</b> 1896 and 1897, gold and silver were discovered. The Ashwood post office opened in 1898, and it quickly expanded as silver and cinnabar mines operated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. Many homesteaders <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1910s, and cinnabar production peaked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. After major floods <b>in</b> 1964, <b>the</b> United States Army Corps of Engineers straightened portions of Trout Creek, creating berms that have obstructed some of the creek's smaller tributaries.|$|R

Instead, Briones marched towards New Spain with his forces, <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Guatemalan Highlands {{in the first}} half of 1525, where his men {{assisted}} in Pedro de Alvarado's campaigns against the highland Maya. In 1525, the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo, based in Hispaniola, sent Pedro Moreno to Honduras in a separate attempt to mediate between Olid and González.|$|E
5|$|Solomon Creek {{was first}} settled by Native Americans around 8000 to 6000 B.C.E. A settler {{arrived at the}} {{confluence}} of the creek with the Susquehanna River by 1774. In the 1800s, more people began <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed to exploit its natural resources. Anthracite mining was especially prevalent in the watershed in the 19th and 20th centuries, to the point that numerous streams were altered or destroyed and the Laurel Run mine fire started.|$|E
5|$|The Iroquois and Delaware Indians {{were the}} first {{inhabitants}} of the Kettle Creek watershed. The first European settler arrived in 1794 and with more settlers <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following decades. The coal mining industry began in the watershed in 1874 and lasted until the 1970s. The lumbering industry lasted from the mid-1800s to around 1910. Natural gas was also extracted in the watershed in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May and into early June, ships {{carrying}} troops and war supplies continued to arrive at Quebec. By June 2, Carleton had added the 9th, 20th, 29th, 53rd and 60th Regiments of Foot, along with General John Burgoyne, to his command. Also <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fleet were Hessian troops from Brunswick commanded by Baron Riedesel.|$|E

50|$|The province's {{economic}} history dates to before European contact, and was originally {{based on a}} First Nations trading network. European traders <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century and organized a trans-Atlantic fur trade.

50|$|In 2001, 98% of Canadians of Filipino origin {{were born}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippines. Most {{immigrants}} of Filipino origin <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past twenty years. In 2001, 53% of Filipino immigrants <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Canada between 1991 and 2000, and another 24% arrived between 1981 and 1990. However, only 4% <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, {{and less than}} 1% came to Canada before 1961.|$|R
5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner Solar System {{from a particular}} region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E
5|$|After <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion {{conducted}} {{more training}} in Palestine until April 1941 {{when it was}} transported to Mersa Matruh, where the battalion began a year-long period serving in the garrison role. Towards {{the end of this}} period– January 1942– the battalion was reassigned to the 9th Division and moved to Syria where it undertook further garrison duty as part of the Allied occupation force that had been established after the Syria–Lebanon campaign to defend against a possible German attack across the Caucasus Mountains. This came to an end in late June 1942 when the 9th was rushed to El Alamein to help establish a hasty defence line.|$|E
5|$|After <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New York area, Washington {{founded a}} company {{producing}} kerosene gas mantles. At this time, {{they lived in}} New Brighton on Staten Island, but his company, George Washington Lighting Company, was based in nearby Jersey City. This business was abandoned with the maturation of incandescent light bulb technology. Washington also had a camera company for a time. By {{the time of the}} 1900 US Census, Washington, recorded in the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and a child of two of the servants.|$|E

5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{second wave}} on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was to capture Bayeux and a nearby ridge, thus cutting the N13 highway between Caen and Bayeux {{to make it}} {{difficult}} for the Germans to move in reinforcements. The second wave on King, the 151st Infantry Brigade, was tasked with capturing the Caen road and railway, along with setting up positions on high ground between the Aure and Seulles rivers. Other forces involved in the landing included artillery regiments, signals corps, and engineering units.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of limited}} data {{concerning}} gong music prior to European exploration, theories abound {{as to when}} the prototypes {{of what is now}} the kulintang came to be. One theory suggest that the bronze gong had an ancient history in Southeast Asia, <b>arriving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malay archipelago two or even three thousand years ago, making its way to the Philippines from China in the 3rd century AD. Another theory lays doubt to the former claim, suggesting the kulintang could not have existed prior to the 15th century due to the belief that Javanese gong tradition, which is what the kulintang was believed to be derived from, developed only by the 15th century.|$|E
