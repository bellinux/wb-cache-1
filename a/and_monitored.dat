5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined <b>and</b> <b>monitored</b> by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent <b>and</b> <b>monitored</b> by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, German New Guinea was only lightly defended; even after all available reservists had reported for duty and the Melanesian police had been armed, the total strength was only 61German officers and non-commissioned officers, and about 240Melanesian police. To compound the defenders' problems, most of the Germans were reservists with either limited experience or who {{had served in the}} military many years earlier. The Bita Paka radio station itself was occupied by eight Germans and 60 Melanesians, under the command of Hauptmann (Captain) Hans Wuchert. Wuchert's force was assigned to defend against any hostile landing at a point near the coast, and was authorised to withdraw halfway between Toma and Bita Paka to Tobera if necessary, but only after demolishing the radio station. A company of 10Germans and 140Melanesians was also stationed at Herbertshöhe, commanded by Leutnant (Lieutenant) Mayer, while a squad of Melanesians at Toma under Leutnant Robert von Blumenthal ("Lord Bob") was charged with digging in and improving defences. Section outposts were established at various locations <b>and</b> <b>monitored</b> the coast from St. George's Channel to Rabaul. Despite the limits of manpower, such arrangements proved effective and the reconnaissance of the Australian Squadron on 12 August had been quickly detected, with German forces subsequently directed towards the coast to repel any invasion.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} has implicitly assumed that only mean levels of trust <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> in teams {{are critical for}} explaining their interrelations and their relationships with team performance.

The authors introduce "trust asymmetry" and "monitoring dissensus" as critical dispersion properties of trust <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> hypothesize that these moderate the relationships between mean <b>monitoring,</b> mean trust, <b>and</b> team performance. Data from a cross-lagged panel study and a partially lagged study support the hypotheses. The first study also offered support for an integrative model that includes mean and dispersion levels of both trust <b>and</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Overall, the studies provide a comprehensive and clear picture of how trust <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> emerge <b>and</b> function at the team level via mean and dispersion. © 2011 American Psychological Association...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{explores the}} potential of collaborative approaches for nontimber forest product inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> in the United States. It begins by reviewing results of a federal and state survey that documented inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts for nontimber forest products in the United States. The surveys show {{that the majority of}} NTFP-related inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> on National Forests and state forests consists of non-scientific forms of monitoring, such as tracking permits, general site inspections, and informal visual checks of harvest areas. We argue that broadening participation in inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts can provide managers and policymakers with the data needed to develop and maintain sustainable NTFP management programs in an era of declining forest management budgets and staffing levels. Our fieldwork with NTFP harvesters identified several characteristics of harvesters and their work that could be compatible with or enhance inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts. In addition, harvester perspectives regarding incentives for participation are discussed. Profiles of eight participatory inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> projects illustrate how this concept has already been put into practice. We then draw on our ethnographic research and results from four regional workshops to explore the barriers to involving harvesters in inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of NTFP species. In testing the idea of collaboration, we found that NTFP stakeholders are generally supportive of th...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that marine {{ecosystems}} are not only complex but also extremely difficult to replicate. Reef aquarists aim to replicate these marine ecosystems within aquariums in their homes, for the aesthetic beauty of such coral reef tanks. To assist aquarists in the task of maintaining environmental parameters in their tanks, a number of control <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems have been created through the advancement of embedded systems. The project, that this thesis is based on, involves {{the development of a}} control <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> system for a marine ecosystem sustained within an aquarium. The aim for the system was to control <b>and</b> <b>monitor</b> water parameters not yet considered by existing systems, in turn improving the stability of the ecosystem and reducing maintenance of the aquarium. As a part of this report, significant research was undertaken to assess existing systems and further understand the important water parameters necessary for marine ecosystems. The main focus of this thesis was to outline the approach, design and implementation of the control <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> system. This includes details on the systems selected features including: Control <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature and Salinity. Control of realistic lighting. Control <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of system parameters, water levels, pumps and other equipment. HMI interface for easy monitoring. To facilitate these features a PiLeven microcontroller has been programmed as a master device and performs all control <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> functions along with the communication to slave sensors. Additionally a Raspberry Pi microprocessor was utilised as the computer interface enabling the programming of the microcontroller <b>and</b> HMI for <b>monitoring.</b> At the completion of this thesis all aspects of the control <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> system are considered complete aside from the control of the pH and Salinity. Despite this the control <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> system was effectively implemented and is ready to house a marine ecosystem...|$|R
