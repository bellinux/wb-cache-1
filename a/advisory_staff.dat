5|$|In {{response}} to increasing pressure from Navy leaders, Long created a permanent <b>advisory</b> <b>staff</b> after the war. The board, created in March 1900, {{was designed to}} unify {{the work of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence, the Naval War College, and the fleet leadership for the production of war plans and the proper preparation, planning, and deployment of naval resources in pursuit of objectives defined in those plans. After the war, Long pushed forward plans to establish a naval base in the Philippines, however, the funding for plans was held up in Congress, which repeatedly sought review of potential base locations in the islands. The matter was also caught up in branch rivalry with the War Department, which objected to the Navy's establishment of a permanent base there that was not under its authority. Construction of the Subic Bay Naval Base did not begin until after Long left office.|$|E

2500|$|The November 1950 Communist Chinese {{intervention}} {{into the}} Korean War was first detected by Det. 2 aircraft, when it saw thousands of troops, trucks, {{on the ground}} in Manchuria, on the Chinese side of the Yalu River. [...] This intelligence, however, was not taken seriously and, as history shows, the massive Chinese attack took the UN Command in Korea by surprise. [...] Also, Det 2's [...] "bomber" [...] operations were ordered to be immediately shut down when UN headquarters was made aware of a plan to attack the headquarters of the Soviet <b>Advisory</b> <b>staff</b> in North Korea. [...] As UN forces retreated south during the Chinese attack, contact was lost between the two armies. The order came down from FECOM Intelligence to find the Chinese. [...] In response, Det. 2 parachuted an early warning line of Rabbits at various distances along an east-west axis across the Korean peninsula. Due to various constraints with the SCR-300 radios and the mountainous terrain, the agents were given smoke grenades. At the same time the C-47s were painted with large black and white stripes under the wings for identification purposes. A system was developed that if the Chinese had crossed a point near a Rabbit, red smoke was put out, green if South Korean troops were near the agent, yellow if no one had crossed the areas. [...] Crude, but effective, the system worked.|$|E
