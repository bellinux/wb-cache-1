40|$|A {{new method}} for {{selecting}} {{stars in the}} Galactic bar based on 2 MASS infrared photometry in combination with stellar proper motions from the Kharkiv XPM catalogue has been implemented. In accordance with this method, red clump and red giant branch stars are preselected on the color [...] magnitude diagram and their photometric distances are calculated. Since the stellar proper motions are indicators of a larger velocity dispersion toward the bar and the spiral arms compared to the stars with circular orbits, applying the constraints on the proper motions of the preselected stars that {{take into account the}} Galactic rotation has allowed the background stars to be eliminated.

40|$|Thrust-generating {{flapping}} foils {{are known}} to produce jets inclined to the free stream at high Strouhal numbers St = fA/U-infinity, where f is the frequency and A is the amplitude of flapping and U-infinity is the free-stream velocity. Our experiments, in the limiting case of St —> infinity (zero free-stream speed), show that a purely oscillatory pitching motion of a chordwise flexible foil produces a coherent jet composed of a reverse Benard-Karman vortex street along the centreline, albeit over a specific range of effective flap stiffnesses. We obtain flexibility by attaching a thin flap to {{the trailing edge of}} a rigid NACA 0015 foil; length of flap is 0. 79 c where c is rigid foil chord length. It is the time-varying deflections of the flexible flap that suppress the meandering found in the jets produced by a pitching rigid foil for zero free-stream condition. Recent experiments (Marais et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 710, 2012, p. 659) have also shown that the flexibility increases the St at which non-deflected jets are obtained. Analysing the near-wake vortex dynamics from flow visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we identify the mechanisms by which flexibility suppresses jet deflection and meandering. A convenient characterization of flap deformation, caused by fluid-flap interaction, is through a non-dimensional effective stiffness', EI* = 8 EI/(rho V-TEmax(2) s(f) c(f) (3) / 2), representing the inverse of the flap deflection due to the fluid-dynamic loading; here, EI is the bending stiffness of flap, rho is fluid density, V-TEmax is the maximum velocity of rigid foil trailing edge, s(f) is span and c(f) is chord length of the flexible flap. By varying the amplitude and frequency of pitching, we obtain a variation in EI* over nearly two orders of magnitude and show that only moderate EI*. (0. 1 less than or similar to EI * less than or similar to 1 generates a sustained, coherent, orderly jet. Relatively `stiff' flaps (EI* greater than or similar to 1), including the extreme case <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>flap,</b> produce meandering jets, whereas highly `flexible' flaps (EI* less than or similar to 0. 1) produce spread-out jets.

We analyze stagnation points as well as points on the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> symmetry.

50|$|A common {{variable}} displacement pump used in vehicle technology is the axial piston pump. This pump has several pistons in cylinders arranged {{parallel to each other}} and rotating around a central shaft. A swashplate at one end is connected to the pistons. As the pistons rotate, the angle of the plate causes them to move in and out of their cylinders. A rotary valve at the opposite end from the swashplate alternately connects each cylinder to the fluid supply and delivery lines. By changing the angle of the swashplate, the stroke of the pistons can be varied continuously. If the swashplate is perpendicular to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation, <b>no</b> fluid will flow. If it is at a sharp angle, a large volume of fluid will be pumped.

40|$|This Appendix {{documents}} the salient results from {{an effort to}} mitigate the so-called flap-edge noise generated at the split between a flap edge that is deployed and the undeployed flap. Utilizing a Coanda surface installed at the flap edge, steady blowing was used {{in an attempt to}} diminish the vortex strength resulting from the uneven lift distribution. The strength of this lifting vortex was augmented by steady blowing over the deployed flap. The test article for this study was the same 2 D airfoil used in the steady blowing program reported earlier (also used in pulsed blowing tests, see Appendix G), however its trailing edge geometry was modified. An exact duplicate of the airfoil shape was made out <b>of</b> fiberglass with <b>no</b> <b>flap,</b> and in the clean configuration. It was attached to the existing airfoil to make an airfoil that has half of its flap deployed and half un-deployed.

40|$|Background: Delaying flap {{rotation}} for 48 to 72 hours {{leads to}} opening of choke anastomotic vessels linking adjacent vascular territories. This mechanism enhances flap circulation. Lateral supramalleolar flap with larger dimensions or vascular variations can potentially have survival problems. The {{purpose of this}} study is to assess the outcome of delayed lateral supramalleolar flap. Methods: This descriptive case series was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi from May 1999 to December 2004. Eight cases of delayed lateral supramalleolar flap were identified through medical records maintained through Health Information Management Systems (HIMS). A detailed questionnaire was developed addressing variables of interest. Results: Eight patients required flap delay for 48 hours out of 25 patients, who underwent lateral supramalleolar flap for coverage of foot and ankle soft tissue defects. There were six male (75 %) and two female (25 %) patients with average age of 31. 25 years ranging from 5 - 52. The reasons for delaying lateral supramalleolar flap were larger flap dimension in four (50 %), absent peroneal artery perforator in three (37. 5 %) and one patient (12. 5 %) had poor circulation in immediate postoperative period. All the patients required two stage procedure and had excellent coverage <b>of</b> defects. <b>No</b> <b>flap</b> failure occurred subsequent to the delay procedure. Conclusions: Flap delay enhanced survival and extended the viable dimensions of lateral supramalleolar flap. Compromised circulation in larger flaps and flaps with vascular variations can be improved by delaying flap transfer to the recipient site for 48 hours following its elevation...|$|R

Orientated growth of the germ tubes seems to start only upon contact with the epidermal cell junctions. The lateral growing of the germ tube over the first epidermal cell junction that it meets is longer than the subsequent lateral growings. These lateral growings, especially the first one, may help the germ tube to grow along the transverse <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the leaf. <b>No</b> evidence was found of attraction of the germ tube by stomata.
