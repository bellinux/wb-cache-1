5|$|The Northwest Power and Conservation Council {{divides the}} Kootenay River {{watershed}} into six biomes: aquatic (rivers and lakes), riparian zones, wetlands, grassland/shrubs, moderately wet forest, and dry forest. The forested zones extend through the alpine and subalpine {{reaches of the}} watershed, while grasslands dominate the low terraces and plateaus surrounding the river, especially in the Lake Koocanusa area and the Montana-Idaho portion of the watershed. In the Canada portion of the watershed, an <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> ecozone occupies most of the high ridges and valleys of the mountains.|$|E
25|$|In polar {{regions that}} are {{expected}} to experience among the most rapid impact from climate warming, springtails have shown contrasting responses to warming in experimental warming studies. There are negative, positive and neutral responses reported. Neutral responses to experimental warming have also been reported in studies of non-polar regions. The importance of soil moisture has been demonstrated in experiments using infrared heating in an <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow,</b> which had a negative effect on mesofauna biomass and diversity in drier parts and a positive effect in moist sub-areas. Furthermore, a study with 20 years of experimental warming in three contrasting plant communities found that small scale heterogeneity may buffer springtails to potential climate warming.|$|E
25|$|The climates can {{be further}} subdivided: hot and semihumid; semihot and semihumid; {{temperate}} and semihumid; semicold and semihumid; and cold. The hot and semihumid climate covers about 78% of the state's territory, with an average temperature of 22C, with rains in the summer. This area presents mostly subtropical rainforest type vegetation. The semihot and semihumid climate {{can be found in}} a strip in the north of the state and accounts for 13% of the territory. Average temperature varies between 18 degrees and 22 degrees Celsius, with rains in the summer and a dry season in the winter. A temperate and semihumid climate covers about 10% of the territory and is found in the north of the state around the municipalities of Huitzilac, Tlanepantla, Totolapan, Tetela del Volcán and parts of Cuernavaca, Tepoztlan, Ocuituco, Tlayacapan and Miacatlán. This area has an average temperature of between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius, with mixed forests of pine and holm oak. A semicold and semihumid climate accounts for only 2% of the territory and found along the borders of the Federal District, Mexico State and Puebla. This area has pine forests and some alpine meadows. The coldest climate is found in the upper parts of Popocatepetl that belong to the state. Average temperature here is less than 5 degrees Celsius with frequent freezes. Most of the vegetation is <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> or moss.|$|E

500|$|Two of the Trust's nature {{reserves}} are Ramsar sites, internationally important wetland reserves; fifteen are SSSIs, and five are Local Nature Reserves. The first site was Fox Covert, donated by Mr Fordham of Letchworth on the Trust's foundation in 1964. The largest is King's Meads, at this is water meadows where 265 wildflower {{species have been}} recorded, {{and it is an}} important site for over-wintering stonechats.

40|$|The distribution, {{abundance}} and density of small rodents was {{studied in the}} <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> of the polish Bieszczady Mountains (Eastern Carpathians). The energy flow through the population of rodents was estimated in this ecosystem. The <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> ("polonina's") have an autonomous community of small rodents. The voles (Pitymys sub-terraneus and Microtus agrestis) are dominating, other meadow rodents (Sicista betulina, Apodemus agrarius, Arvicola terrestis) occur only sporadically while the forest rodents (Apodemus flavicollis, Clethrio-nomys glareolus) may occasionally feed in <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows.</b> The distri-bution of rodents in the <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> is uneven; in the dwarf shrubs (scrub) they are four times as abundant as in the open meadows. The estimated mean rodent density on grass <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> was 15 per hectare (13 P. subterraneus and 2 M. agrestis). The energy flow through these populations of P. subterraneus and M. agrestis amounts to 61, 012 Kcal/ha/year. Of this, the cost of maintenance is 60 thousand Kcal and the net production is only one thousand Kcal. The annual food consumption of these rodents is over 76, 000 Kcal/ha. This cor-responds to 20 kg of dry hay which was eaten from every hectare. However, the influence of rodents on the <b>alpine</b> <b>meadows</b> vegetation is negligible, as they are consuming only 1. 03 % of the annual primary productivity. I...|$|R
2500|$|Robert Wise hired Mike Kaplan {{to direct}} the {{publicity}} campaign for the film. After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line [...] "The Happiest Sound in All the World", which would appear on promotional material and artwork. Kaplan also brought in outside agencies {{to work with the}} studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an <b>alpine</b> <b>meadow</b> with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background. In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project. The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound. The roadshow concept involved two showings a day with reserved seating and an intermission similar to Broadway musicals. Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities. During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century Fox organized press junkets for America journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members.|$|E
