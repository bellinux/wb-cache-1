40|$|We {{discuss a}} model of dipolar bosons trapped in a weakly coupled planar array of {{one-dimensional}} tubes. We consider the situation where the dipolar moments are aligned by an external field, and find a rich phase diagram {{as a function of}} the angle of this field exhibiting quantum phase transitions between solid, superfluid and supersolid phases. In the low energy limit, the model turns out to be identical to one describing quasi-one-dimensional superconductivity in condensed matter systems.

An unexpected extra peak in the velocity spectrum is observed for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise with large correlation time.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to apply our definition of a simulator to well-known situations in which the term is used. The majority of experimental devices advertised as quantum simulations are so-called <b>analogue</b> <b>simulators</b> [45 – 50]. They are devices whose Hamiltonians can be engineered to approximate those of a subset of models put forward to describe a real system. This closely fits our definition of simulators {{as well as their}} usual purpose and context outlined above. Another different type of device is Lloyd’s digital quantum simulator [52]. This replicates universal unitary evolution by mapping it, via Trotter decompositions, to a circuit, which can then be made arbitrarily accurate by the use of error correction. Whilst going by the name simulator, it is effectively a universal quantum computer. From our arguments above, we would also describe this as a computer: error correction ensures the result applying to the modelled system can be interpreted without comparison to a real physical system, thus playing the role of a computation. Finally, the company D-wave has developed a device to find the ground state of the classical Ising model [53]. While this is a device that returns a property of a physical model, it is advertised as a computer. We would agree, since its primary use seems to be in solving optimisation problems embedded in the Ising ground state, rather than comparing this to a real physical system.|$|R

40|$|Historically the {{analogue}} and digitel {{parts of}} a hardware design have been modelled and simulated in different environments {{and could not be}} combined in a single simulator. On the other hand, if a design contains both analog and digital parts simulating their interactions are most important to reliably verify the design. Therefore, we present a method for simulating analogue circuits and digital components in a VHDL simulator. For executing analogue simulations in a VHDL environment an <b>analogue</b> <b>simulator</b> has been developed. It permits to model linear and non-linear circuits using only standard VHDL language elements. This fact allows a similar conversion of this method to different VHDL environments.

40|$|Abstract- Small signal {{stability}} of power systems is eval-uated by eigenvalues of state equations derived from system models. The values are given by off-line computer analyses.

40|$|In modern {{consumer}} electronics and communications applications, the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) {{is a central}} component of these designs. The PLL circuit {{is not a new}} concept and in fact has been used for over 60 years after its invention for the synchronous reception of radio signals. The widespread use of the circuit is due to its ease of use and also the compact nature of the final IC. Designers have been using various simulation tools and methods to model and simulate PLLs at different levels. For example at the system level MatrixX, Saber, Matlab and high level languages such as C or FORTRAN have been used to analyze the loop response, while digital simulators have been used to examine the time domain response of the purely digital PLLs using gate level, Verilog or VHDL descriptions. Mixed mode simulators such as Saber have been used to analyze the mixed signal and mixed level aspects of the design and finally <b>analogue</b> <b>simulators</b> such as Spice have been applied to the lowest transistor level simulations of the final IC design. The unfortunate problem in general for designers has been the lack of an integrated approach allowing all of these different methods to be applied to the same physical design with a resulting discontinuity in the design process.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of real-life optimization problems {{with a large number}} of degrees of freedom are intractable by classical computers, since their complexity grows exponentially fast with the number of variables. Many of these problems can be mapped into classical spin models, such as the Ising, the XY or the Heisenberg models, so that optimization problems are reduced to finding the global minimum of spin models. Here, we propose and investigate the potential of polariton graphs as an efficient <b>analogue</b> <b>simulator</b> for finding the global minimum of the XY model. By imprinting polariton condensate lattices of bespoke geometries we show that we can engineer various coupling strengths between the lattice sites and read out the result of the global minimization through the relative phases. Besides solving optimization problems, polariton graphs can simulate a large variety of systems undergoing the U(1) symmetry-breaking transition. We realize various magnetic phases, such as ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, and frustrated spin configurations on a linear chain, the unit cells of square and triangular lattices, a disordered graph, and demonstrate the potential for size scalability on an extended square lattice of 45 coherently coupled polariton condensates.

We will see that the model is identical to one describing quasi-one-dimensional superconductivity in condensed matter systems giving rise {{to the possibility of}} using this ultracold atoms system as an <b>analogue</b> <b>simulator</b> of interesting electronic systems. In investigating the properties of this model we find a rich phase diagram containing density wave, superfluid, and possibly supersolid phases, accessible by tuning the optical lattice parameters and the alignment of the dipole moments. An important property of this model {{turns out to be the}} existence of an enhanced symmetry at the self dual point where the density wave and superfluid orders are maximally competing. At this point the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of either phase must necessarily vanish to zero due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. Inspired by this model we go on to study a more general system in two dimensions with O(M) x O(2) symmetry which has an enhanced symmetry point of O(M + 2) symmetry. The BKT transition in the O(2) sector is mediated by vortex excitations, but these must somehow disappear as the high symmetry point is approached. Using both a variational argument adapting the standard BKT argument, and a more rigorous RG analysis we show that the size of the vortex cores in such a system must diverge as 1 /√(Δ) where Δ measures the distance from the high symmetry point, and further that the BKT transition temperature must vanish as 1 /ln(1 /Δ) ...|$|E

Qualitative {{modeling}} of linear networks in ecad applications (1999) by M Lee Venue: Pages 146 ? 152 of: Proceedings 13 th international workshop on qualitative reasoning, QR ? 99 There {{is a real}} need for qualitative circuit analysis tools in the ECAD application area. Recent simulators based on finite many valued resistance and current models (switch-level models) {{have been shown to}} have serious limitations. Through independent parallel research the QR community has produced qualitative electrical models and simulators that have been successfully used in software tools for specific engineering tasks. Many of these systems are based on steady-state models using three valued resistance networks. This paper examines the relationship between qualitative and more conventional electrical circuit modelling and explores the characteristics of certain qualitative formulations with a view to satisfying the needs of future intermediate level models. An existing three valued resistance model is analysed and then extended to deal with additional cases. The problems associated with bridge circuits may pose a major barrier to future progress and this is examined in detail and some solutions are described. The Importance of Qualitative Concepts in ECAD There has been a long standing interest in the ECAD community to find an intermediate modelling level between the gate-level simulators and other analysis tools used in digital logic and the electrical analogue simulators that work at the transistor level. Circuit analysis often involves predictions of both logical/state information and details of electrical parameters and ideally this should be performed in an integrated and coherent environment. While it is possible to model a complete circuit on an <b>analogue</b> <b>simulator</b> this does not capture the distinct qualitative states that characterise important abstractions valued by engineers. Even more important is the problem of maintaining close affinities between the properties of the model and the preferred notations and concepts used by human engineers. This is very difficult to achieve with the voluminous numeric output generated by conventional simulators. This problem is confirmed by reports from ECAD experts who have access to considerable data on engineers ' experience, e. g. Non peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} realisation {{of large}} scale many-body systems has seen immense progress in recent years, rendering full tomography tools for state identification inefficient, especially for continuous systems. In order {{to work with}} these emerging physical platforms, new technologies for state identification are required. In this work, we present first steps towards efficient experimental quantum field tomography. We employ our procedure to capture ultracold atomic systems using atom chips, a setup that allows for the quantum simulation of static and dynamical properties of interacting quantum fields. Our procedure is based on cMPS, the continuous analogues of matrix product states (MPS), ubiquitous in condensed-matter theory. These states naturally incorporate the locality present in realistic physical settings and are thus prime candidates for describing the physics of locally interacting quantum fields. The reconstruction procedure is based on two- and four-point correlation functions, from which we predict higher-order correlation functions, thus validating our reconstruction for the experimental situation at hand. We apply our procedure to quenched prethermalisation experiments for quasi-condensates. In this setting, {{we can use the}} quality of our tomographic reconstruction as a probe for the non-equilibrium nature of the involved physical processes.

40|$|Power systems {{stability}} {{is a complex}} problem which was first recognised in 1920 and has been widely investigated by power system engineers ever since. The first laboratory test on a practical power system was conducted in 1924, followed by the first field test in the following year. The models and method of analysis were relatively simple, with long fault clearing times (0. 5 to 2. 0 seconds). In 1930, network analysers (which were <b>analogue</b> <b>simulators</b> of the power system) were developed and {{this led to the}} improvement of stability analysis. In early 1950 ’s, they were used to analyse problems which required detailed models of the synchronous machine, excitation system and speed governor. In the mid 1950 ’s, the first digital computer program for power systems stability was developed. Since the 1960 's most of the industry efforts and interests relating to system stability have been concentrated on transient stability. Power systems are designed and operated to criteria concerning transient stability (Kundur, 1994). There have been significant developments in equipment modelling and testing, for synchronous machines, excitation systems and loads. In addition, using high speed fault clearing, fast exciters and special stability aids have been used to improve the transient stability of power systems. The high speed exciters adversely affect the small signal stability associated with local plant mode of oscillations by introducing negative damping of the rotor angle oscillations. Such problems have been solved using power systems stabilisers (PSS). The incorporation of a power systems stabiliser (PSS) into the excitation controller is to improve the system’s performance where the system’s damping is low. At the same time, it can also combat the damping reductions introduced by an AVR (Hughes, 1991). The damping of the rotor angle oscillations can be improved by adding a supplementary signal to the excitation control system to produce a component of the electrical torque on the rotor in phase with speed variations (Larsen and Swann, 1981). Figure 5. 1 shows the block diagram of a power system stabiliser added to the excitation control system. The rotor angle oscillations of a generator feeding power to a large inter-connected power system occur in the frequency range of 0. 2 to 2 Hz. Different signals have been used as the input to the PSS including: the rotor speed deviation, the bus frequency, the electrical power deviation and the accelerating power (Padiyar, 1996). When a speed signal is employed as an input for the PSS, then a phase lead compensator is required to provide sufficient phase lead (Hughes, 1991). A transient gain or washout is normally used to remove any steady state offset in the speed signal. This filter acts as a high pass filter and is required to ensure that the stabilising signal (PSS output) does not affect the steady state regulation characteristics...|$|R
