40|$|A {{method for}} the {{isolation}} of outer root sheath keratinocytes from plucked human hair follicles and for their subsequent cultivation has been developed. The selective trypsinization of outer root sheath keratinocytes provided a single cell suspension of defined origin within the hair follicle. The 3 T 3 feeder layer technique supports sustained growth of these cells in that as little as one single plucked hair follicle (yielding <b>approximately</b> <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> × 104 cells) consistently {{gave rise to a}} confluent 35 -mm culture dish (with <b>approximately</b> <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> × 106 cells) within about 2 weeks.

It is inferred that the energy to power the radio source comes from the central engine, but the source's structure may be heavily influenced by the past history of the galaxy and the inflowing intracluster medium. It is shown that, while the radio source is energetically unimportant for the cluster as a whole, it is important on the scale of the cooling flow. The mere existence of cosmic rays and magnetic fields within a substantial fraction of the volume inside the cooling radius has important consequences for cooling-flow models...|$|R
