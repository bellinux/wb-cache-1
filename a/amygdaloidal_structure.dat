50|$|The lavas, having cooled {{rapidly in}} contact with the air or water, are mostly finely {{crystalline}} or have at least fine-grained ground-mass representing that part of the viscous semi-crystalline lava flow that was still liquid at the moment of eruption. At this time they were exposed only to atmospheric pressure, and the steam and other gases, which they contained in great quantity were free to escape; many important modifications arise from this, the most striking being the frequent presence of numerous steam cavities (vesicular structure) often drawn out to elongated shapes subsequently filled up with minerals by infiltration (<b>amygdaloidal</b> <b>structure).</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{preliminary}} assessment of basalt of the Khodzhirbulakskoy Suite of Surkhantau Mountains for the basalt fiber production are presented. According to petrographic study, the rocks {{are described as}} basalts of <b>amygdaloidal</b> <b>structure.</b> On the base of content {{of the amount of}} glassy form and nodular calcite, three groups of basalts were identified. The inverse relationship between the bulk content of the volcanic rock and the content of calcite: the greater volume of volcanic rocks, the less content of calcite, and vice versa.

30|$|The Hwasun {{andesite}} {{consists of}} andesitic tuff and lava, {{as well as}} intrusive rocks. The andesitic tuff, a lapilli (coarse) tuff, contains light-green rock fragments (5 – 10  mm) and purplish brown pumice. The andesitic tuff consists of multiple tuff layers, implying multiple eruptions. They are normally dark green or dark gray, but they are brown or reddish brown under weathered conditions. Only andesitic tuffs have phenocrysts, <b>amygdaloidal</b> <b>structures,</b> and slight flow <b>structures.</b> <b>Amygdaloidal</b> <b>structures</b> are elliptic and amygdales are composed of calcite, chlorite, and chalcedony. Most phenocrysts are plagioclase. Some other colored minerals are observed. The Hwasun andesite contains plagioclase, hyaline, and chloritized colored minerals, and microcrystalline crystals are spread on the hyaline base (Kim et al., 2002).|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} the first-known Mesoproterozoic ophiolite from the southwestern {{part of the}} Amazon craton, corresponding to the Trincheira Complex of Calymmian age, and propose a tectonic model that explains many previously enigmatic features of the Precambrian history of this key craton, and discuss {{its role in the}} reconstruction of the Columbia supercontinent. The complex comprises extrusive rocks (fine-grained amphibolites derived from massive and pillowed basalts), mafic-ultramafic intrusive rocks, chert, banded iron formation (BIFs), pelites, psammitic and a smaller proportion of calc-silicate rocks. This sequence was deformed, metasomatized and metamorphosed during the development of the Alto Guaporé Belt, a Mesoproterozoic accretionary orogen. The rocks were deformed by a single tectonic event, which included isoclinal folding and metamorphism of the granulite-amphibolite facies. Layered magmatic structures were preserved in areas of low strain, including <b>amygdaloidal</b> and cumulate <b>structures.</b> Metamorphism was pervasive and reached temperatures of 780 - 853 °C in mafic granulites and 680 - 720 °C in amphibolites under an overall pressure of 6. 8 kbar. The geochemical composition of the extrusive and intrusive rocks indicates that all noncumulus mafic-ultramafic rocks are tholeiitic basalts. The mafic-ultramafic rocks display moderately to strongly fractionation of light rare earth elements (LREE), near-flat heavy rare earth elements (HREE) patterns and moderate to strong negative high field strength elements (HFSE) anomalies (especially Nb), a geochemical signature typical of subduction zones. The lowest units of mafic granulites and porphyroblastic amphibolites in the Trincheira ophiolite are similar to the modern mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB), although they locally display small Ta, Ti and Nb negative anomalies, indicating a small subduction influence. This behavior changes to an island arc tholeiites (IAT) signature in the upper units of fine-grained amphibolites and amphibole rich-amphibolites, characterized by progressive depletion in the incompatible elements and more pronounced negative Ta and Nb anomalies, as well as common Ti and Zr negative anomalies. Tectono-magmatic variation diagrams and chondrite-normalized REE and primitive mantle normalized patterns suggest a back-arc to intra-oceanic island arc tectonic regime for the eruption of these rocks. Therefore, the Trincheira ophiolite appears to have originated in an intraoceanic supra-subduction setting composed of an arc-back-arc system. Accordingly, the Trincheira Complex is a record of oceanic crust relics obducted during the collision of the Amazon craton and the Paraguá block during the Middle Mesoproterozoic. Thus, the recognition of the Trincheira ophiolite and suture significantly changes views on the evolution of the southern margin of the Amazon craton, and how it can influence the global tectonics and the reconstruction of the continents...|$|R
