5|$|Finally, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) {{falls for}} a new staffer, a blind woman named Jennifer (Maria Thayer). Kenneth cannot bring himself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy (Tracy Morgan) decides to help him. On their date, at the 30 Rock studios, Kenneth and Jennifer are joined by Tracy—who does <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy was doing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> Jennifer tells him she does not mind of what has happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, horrified at his appearance.|$|E
500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time I told him what I expected {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E
500|$|According to Clash and Gikow, Elmo's pet {{goldfish}} Dorothy and {{the members}} of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking,</b> and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen. [...] Dorothy's silence allowed children to fill in the blanks, and her curiosity, which was created and enhanced by Elmo's imagination, allowed the writers and researchers to insert the curriculum lessons they want to convey. Up to nine goldfish were used per episode, so they could be replaced when necessary. Several fish were needed each season, and the surviving Dorothys were given good homes afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Long-time writer Judy Freudberg came up {{with the}} concept of [...] "Elmo's World", and writer Tony Geiss and {{executive}} producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it. Instead of the realism {{of the rest of the}} show, the segment presented Elmo moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, which looked like [...] "a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life" [...] created by the host, and with [...] "a stream-of-consciousness feel to it". [...] Elmo's pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking,</b> and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have called}} the video NSFW, {{comparing}} it to the 2013 video for [...] "Blurred Lines" [...] by Robin Thicke with Pharrell Williams and T.I.. In an interview with Capital FM, Thicke responded {{to a question about}} the videos' similarity: [...] "No comment. I'll let you do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> It's a subject that has no good ending." [...] Fact magazine called the video's concept simple, and said its production team was unconcerned. According to Spins Jordan Sargent, [...] "Like his new album The 20/20 Experience, in which half the songs run longer than seven minutes, the 'Tunnel Vision' video is self-consciously artistic and mature. But the video is also at times effective, particularly when the editing gets choppier during the bridge." ...|$|E
500|$|Two filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season 3 DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the bonus feature. In the first scene, Kenneth tells Tracy that he cannot go through his date with Jennifer as {{he does not want to}} deceive Jennifer, as the plan is that Tracy will do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> for Kenneth during the date. Tracy, however, tells Kenneth that no deceiving will occur and that he will be honest during the date. Kenneth is still not convinced about the whole idea, but Tracy manages to change his mind. In the second scene, Jack and Elisa are in church. Jack intrigued with what has happened during church is ready to leave, though, Elisa tells him that the sermon is almost over, but that the service is about to begin.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Out of Control was positive. Aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 63% based on nine critic reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable" [...] reception. It {{was described as}} [...] "their most melancholy album to date". The Times wrote that Girls Aloud [...] "show no sign of flagging {{in their quest to}} push the boundaries of the pop song" [...] and noticed that they [...] "continue to be as inventive as ever." [...] BBC Music described Out of Control as [...] "a shimmering album of heartbreaking electro pop" [...] and exclaimed that it is [...] "pop music at its finest." [...] Digital Spy found it [...] "smart, adventurous, emotionally resonant and often very, very catchy" [...] and called it [...] "an absolute delight" [...] and Girls Aloud's [...] "fourth terrific album in a row". MusicOMH noticed that it is [...] "chock-full of those trademark, otherworldy electro-synth songs" [...] and concluded by calling it [...] "yet another excellent album from a group who may have risen from a lot of people's 'guilty pleasure' to becoming full-on national treasures". Slant Magazine hailed it as [...] "one of the best pop albums of 2008" [...] and said that Girls Aloud [...] "are {{in a position where they}} can let the music do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> for them". NME praised the songs [...] "Love Is The Key", [...] "Rolling Back the Rivers in Time" [...] and [...] "Untouchable" [...] and stated that although it is [...] "not their best" [...] effort, it is [...] "more consistent than any British indie album released this year".|$|E
2500|$|In 1969 Burton {{enjoyed a}} {{commercial}} blockbuster with Clint Eastwood in the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare; {{he received a}} $1million fee plus {{a share of the}} film's box office gross. According to his daughter Kate Burton, “He did that one for us kids, because we kept asking him, 'Can you do a fun movie that we can go see?" [...] Eastwood [...] thought the script [...] "terrible" [...] and was [...] "all exposition and complications". He asked the film's producer Elliott Kastner and its screenwriter Alistair MacLean to be given less dialogue, later remarking [...] "I just stood around firing my machine gun while Burton handled the dialogue." [...] Burton enjoyed working with Eastwood and said of the picture that he [...] "did <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> and [...] did all the killing". Burton's last film of the decade, Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) for which he was paid $1.25million, was commercially successful but garnered mixed opinions from reviewers. Noted British film critic Tom Milne of Time Out magazine believed that Burton [...] "plays throughout on a monotonous note of bluff ferocity". Conversely, Vincent Canby of The New York Times appreciated Burton's portrayal of the English monarch, noting that he [...] "is in excellent form and voice—funny, loutish and sometimes wise". Anne of the Thousand Days received ten nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards, including one for Burton's performance as Henry VIII of England, which many thought to be largely the result of an expensive advertising campaign by Universal Studios. The same year, Staircase in which he and his [...] "Cleopatra" [...] co-star Rex Harrison appeared as a bickering homosexual couple, received negative reviews and was unsuccessful.|$|E
