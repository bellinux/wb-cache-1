Starting with oil sketches of his wife painted on location in Europe, he developed a style that presents ambiguous figures in abstract, unresolved landscapes.

50|$|Ryckaert’s {{compositions}} are painstakingly {{constructed with}} meticulous attention to detail. The objects and forms {{are arranged in}} separation from {{each other on the}} inclined surface of a table. By juxtaposing food, dishes and precious objects within various planes in space David Rijckaert II is able to increase their legibility. The frontal and distributive presentation is still archaic while his attention for detail and strong realism show his adherence to the Flemish tradition. Characteristic for his style are the dark <b>abstract</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and the bright, enamel-like colours.|$|R

As a student there she was influenced by her tutors Robert Ellis and Colin McCahon, and her early work explored the structures and patterns of cityscapes. Her figurative paintings, which often depict geometrical portraits on <b>abstract</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> frequently feature figures wearing hats, headpieces or simplified floral headbands — a probable result of her previous training in millinery.|$|R

5000|$|McGee {{rose out of}} the Mission School art {{movement}} and graffiti boom in the San Francisco Bay Area during the early nineties. His work draws heavily from a pessimistic view of the urban experience, which he describes as, [...] "urban ills, overstimulations, frustrations, addictions & trying to maintain a level head under the constant bombardment of advertising". McGee's paintings are very iconic, with central figures dominating <b>abstracted</b> <b>backgrounds</b> of drips, patterns and color fields. He has also painted portraits of street characters on their own empty bottles of liquor, painted flattened spray cans picked up at train yards and painted wrecked vehicles for art shows.|$|R

40|$|<b>ABSTRACT</b> <b>Backgrounds</b> and objectives: Previous {{studies suggest}} a {{deleterious}} effect of cigarette smoking on semen quality, but their results {{have not been}} consistent. We studied the association between current smoking and semen characteristics. Material and method: Our study was performed on 105 normal asymptomatic healthy males (50 control, 55 smokers) with age-group between 18 - 47 years. The effects of both severity and duration of smoking on semen parameters were studied. Results: we observed an inverse dose–response relation between smoking and semen volume, total sperm count and percentage motile and viable sperm. Heavy smokers had a lower sperm concentration than non-smokers. Conclusion: We observed a dose and duration dependent association between tobacco exposure, lower sperm concentration and higher risk of oligozoospermia...|$|R
