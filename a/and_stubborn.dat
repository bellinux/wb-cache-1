He writes of difficult individuals he has negotiated with in the private sector, calling them difficult to deal with <b>and</b> <b>stubborn.</b> Trump believes he can import past relations with high finance businessmen to the global stage, writing, America requires new leadership from those with experience in cutthroat financial private sector tactics.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} that {{grappling}} hooks were needed to climb the fort's walls, but despite this <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> resistance by the pirates, who defended themselves with rifles, grenades, spears and stones, the Spaniards managed to scale the walls and enter the fort. Some 25 pirates were killed inside, while another 30 or 40 dove {{into the water and}} were drowned or killed by the fire from the Spanish feluccas and armed boats. 14 artillery pieces were taken.

25|$|Though {{the treaty}} which was {{eventually}} signed by Bidault and Molotov carried symbolic importance {{in that it}} enabled de Gaulle to demonstrate that he was recognised as the official head of state and show that France's voice was being heard abroad, it was of little relevance to Stalin due to France's lack of real political and military power; it {{did not affect the}} outcome of the post-war settlement. Stalin later commented that like Churchill and Roosevelt, he found de Gaulle to be awkward <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> and believed that he was 'not a complicated person' (by which he meant that he was an old-style nationalist). Stalin also felt that he lacked realism in claiming the same rights as the major powers and did not object to Roosevelt's refusal to allow de Gaulle to attend the 'Big Three' conferences that were to come at Yalta and Potsdam.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{was often}} the case with the Polish electoral monarchy, the outcome was {{strongly}} contested by the greedy <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> Polish nobility who backed and supported the Archduke Maximilian III of Austria for King of Poland. Upon hearing of his election King Sigismund slipped through the clutches of the Protestants in Sweden and landed in Poland on 7 October, immediately agreeing to give up several royal privileges to the parliament (Sejm) in the hope of winning over some of his enemies and settling the disputed election. He was proclaimed by the Lesser Prussian Treasurer Jan Dulski as king on behalf of Crown Marshal Andrzej Opaliński, and after arriving in the Royal Capital City of Kraków he was crowned on 27 December at Wawel Cathedral. It seemed that the issue of who would be King of Poland had been settled when Maximilian III invaded Poland to claim the crown. Hetman Jan Zamoyski defeated Maximilian at the Battle of Byczyna and took him prisoner. However, at the request of Pope Sixtus V, King Sigismund III released Maximilian, who surrendered his claim to Poland in 1589. King Sigismund also tried to maintain peace with his powerful neighbor by marrying Archduchess Anne Habsburg in 1592. It was always his intention to maintain an alliance with Catholic Austria against the Protestant forces.|$|E
25|$|After Peta Nocona's death (c. 1864), being now Parra-o-coom ("Bull Bear") {{the head}} {{chief of the}} Quahadi band and Kobay-o-burra ("Wild Horse") the second ranking, Quanah was {{introduced}} into the Nokoni band, where the head chief Tirhayaquahip also called Kiyou ("Horseback") took him under his wing. After Peta Nocona and Pohebits-quasho, Tirhayaquahip taught Quanah {{the ways of the}} Comanche Warrior and he grew to considerable standing as a warrior. He left and joined again the Quahadi (Antelope Eaters) band with warriors from another band. Quanah Parker surrendered to Mackenzie and was taken to Fort Sill, Indian Territory where he led the Comanches successfully {{for a number of years}} on the reservation. Quanah was never elected principal chief of the Comanche by the tribe. The U.S. government appointed him principal chief of the entire nation once the people had gathered on the reservation and later introduced general elections. In October 1867, when Quanah was only a young man, he had come along with the Comanche chiefs as an observer at treaty negotiations at Medicine Lodge, Kansas. Tirhayaquahip made a statement about Quanah's refusal to sign the treaty. In the early 1870s, the Plains Indians were losing the battle for their land with the United States government. Following the capture of the Kiowa chiefs Sitting Bear, Big Tree, and Satanta, the last two paroled in 1873 after two years thanks to the firm <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> behaviour of Guipago, the Kiowa, Comanche, and Southern Cheyenne tribes joined forces in several battles. Colonel Ranald Mackenzie led U.S. Army forces to round up or kill the remaining Indians who had not settled on reservations.|$|E

50|$|The book, on the whole, portrays Erdős in a {{favourable}} light, {{pointing out}} his many endearing qualities, like his childlike simplicity, his generosity and altruistic nature, his kindness and gentleness towards children. However, it also attempts to illustrate his helplessness in doing mundane tasks, the difficulties faced by {{those close to}} {{him because of his}} eccentricities, <b>and</b> his <b>stubborn</b> <b>and</b> frustrating behaviour.|$|R

On campus, Jack attended student meetings and could be booked for social functions. He weighed [...] and his color was described as [...] "red fawn."

With Ottoman and German machine guns hard to locate amongst the boulders, the fighting was severe <b>and</b> <b>stubborn.</b> On 29 November the 60th (2/2nd London) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions were joined by the 53rd (Welsh) Division. A general British infantry advance on a [...] front moved their front line [...] on the right and [...] on the left. They pushed the whole line along the Nablus road to beyond Ramallah and Bireh by 30 December. Final objectives were gained and the line along the whole front secured.|$|E
500|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, fears grew among Hamilton {{and his supporters}} that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> to follow their directions once elected. Desiring [...] "a more pliant president than Adams," [...] Hamilton maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for [...] "favorite son" [...] Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's scheme was undone, however, when several New England state electors heard of it, conferred, and agreed not to vote for Pinckney. Adams was nonetheless angered, writing shortly after the election that Hamilton was a [...] "proud Spirited, conceited, aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than any one I know." ...|$|E

500|$|Ed Park of the Los Angeles Times {{hailed the}} novel as a [...] "puzzle palace of bewitching {{proportions}} <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> echoes", noting the fact that antihero Hubertus Bigend was the most prominent link to Pattern Recognition as [...] "deliciously sinister". Tim Martin thought that the plot lacked direction at times. Although he conceded that the novel's main Henry/Bigend storyline felt lightweight, Matt Thorne writing in The Independent conjectured that {{it was part of}} Gibson's conscious design that that thread [...] "plays out against a backdrop of hidden machinations that have a much darker, wider resonance". Thorne declared Spook Country a more substantial novel than its predecessor on this basis. John Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald concurred, writing that despite the similarity in the plots of the novels, the narrative foundation of the later novel was firmer, its structure [...] "more sophisticated" [...] and its [...] "seams less visible".|$|E
500|$|With her spiky {{hair and}} bright clothing, Daphne {{stood out from}} other female {{characters}} on television at the time. She was portrayed as a strong, smart and independent woman. She was often shrewd and [...] "a warm friend" [...] to those around her. Tony Johnston, author of Neighbours: 20 years of Ramsay Street stated that Daphne had [...] "an appealing mix of cheek, savvy and the-girl-next-door." [...] She was a woman in charge of her own life, which helped her to become the serial's first [...] "sweetheart." [...] Smith told Kingsley that her favourite aspects of Daphne's personality were her confidence <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> streak. Smith also commented that Daphne wore [...] "zanier clothes" [...] than she did and was more outgoing. The fact that she embodied a [...] "no-nonsense approach" [...] to life and was not embarrassed by her profession as a stripper, meant Daphne became an immediate favourite with viewers.|$|E
500|$|Allied to {{this were}} his {{boundless}} determination and vigour <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> refusal to countenance defeat. He held {{himself to the}} same high standard as he held those around him, saying: [...] "He who leads troops {{has no right to}} think about himself". His visits to the front may not have helped operational efficiency, but they energized his men, who consistently held him in much higher regard than did his officers. As commanding general of Ninth Army he was once recorded as personally leading a battalion attack against a Soviet position, pistol in hand. In combat he spared neither himself nor his subordinates. His peers respected his ability and iron will, even though they may have detested his personality. Guderian thought him the best choice to command Army Group Centre during the crisis of Operation Bagration; the Ninth Army's War Diary recorded, after he arrived at army group headquarters in Minsk: [...] "The news of Field Marshal Model's arrival is noted with satisfaction and confidence." ...|$|E

500|$|Views of Disney and {{his work}} have changed over the decades, {{and there have been}} {{polarized}} opinions. Mark Langer, in the American Dictionary of National Biography, writes that [...] "Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture." [...] Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney [...] "as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas", while PBS records that critics have censured his work because of its [...] "smooth façade of sentimentality <b>and</b> <b>stubborn</b> optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history". Although Disney's films have been highly praised, very popular and commercially successful over time, there were criticisms by reviewers. Caroline Lejeune comments in The Observer that Snow White (1937) [...] "has more faults than any earlier Disney cartoon. It is vulnerable again and again to the barbed criticisms of the experts. Sometimes it is, frankly, badly drawn." [...] Robin Allen, writing for The Times, notes that Fantasia (1940) was [...] "condemned for its vulgarity and lurches into bathos", while Lejeune, reviewing Alice in Wonderland (1951), feels the film [...] "may drive lovers of Lewis Carroll to frenzy". Peter Pan (1953) was criticized in The Times as [...] "a children's classic vulgarized" [...] with [...] "Tinker Bell... a peroxided American cutie". The reviewer opined that Disney [...] "has slaughtered good Barrie and has only second-rate Disney to put in its place".|$|E
