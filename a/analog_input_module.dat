40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a voting scheme for safety-related <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> <b>module</b> to arbitrate between {{the results of}} redundant channels in fault-tolerant system. The design approach is a distributed system using a sophisticated form of duplication. For each running process, there is a backup process running on a different CPU. The voter is responsible for checkpointing its state to duplex CPUs. In order to increase the dependability for safety-related controllers, the I/O modules use redundancy {{to reduce the risk}} associated with relying upon any single component operating flawlessly. The 1 oo 2 D voting principle is commonly used in fault tolerant I/O modules to provide passive redundancy for masking runtime faults at hardware and software levels, respectively. A dual architecture (1 oo 2 D) which provides high safety integrity to a rating of SIL 3 is presented. The outputs from two identical channels operating in parallel with the same inputs are supplied to a voting unit that arbitrates between them to produce an overall output. Based on the hardware logic model and FPGA technique, the study adopts the hardware voter which has much more advantage in the velocity and reliability. Finally, using modelsim simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed voter design in preserving the hazard-free property of the response of an analog inputs module...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an investigation {{and development of}} a real-time on-site condition monitoring system for induction motors. Induction motors are employed in various industries as an essential machine. In order to prevent catastrophic faults during its serviceable life, condition monitoring of induction motors is commonly used in industrial applications to maintain safety and reliability of plant operation. The current practice in condition monitoring primarily involves using various forms of mobile or portable devices, usually with a single sensor input to perform tests at regular intervals. However, such devices and monitoring services can be expensive and require an experienced operator for reliable decisions. Therefore, this thesis investigates an alternative low-cost solution for continuous condition monitoring of induction machines using multiple sensors, which can be located next to a machine under test and can provide condition information using indicator lights for quick diagnosis. The thesis provides hardware and software implementation details using an FPGA based CompactRIO platform. The CompactRIO embedded reconfigurable platform incorporates an FPGA, an <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> <b>module,</b> a real-time host controller and a custom-made indicator module as an on-site monitoring system. The CompactRIO custom-made indicator module utilizes bi-colour LEDs and requirements of CompactRIO MDK to display each level fault. Furthermore, a data acquisition and monitoring system was developed under LabVIEW FPGA environment and LabVIEW Real Time software. The system that has been successfully designed has had its performances and capabilities evaluated through several tests. In addition, real faults are also introduced to demonstrate the system’s performance. The {{results show that the}} CompactRIO system is capable of being implemented as condition monitoring system, especially as an early warning unit. The early warning information obtained from this system can be used as valuable data for further detailed fault assessment. Thesis (M. Eng. Sc.)

The Tricon provides error-free, uninterrupted control in the presence of either hard failures of components, or transient faults from internal or external sources.The Tricon is designed with a fully triplicated architecture throughout, from the <b>input</b> <b>modules</b> through the Main Processors to the output modules.

In addition to voting the input data, the TriBus votes the output data.

It enables {{the development of a}} wide range of high performance analog ICs capable of 33 V operation in a footprint that no previous generation of high voltage parts could achieve. Unlike analog ICs using conventional CMOS processes, iCMOS components can accept bipolar input signals while providing increased performance, dramatically reduced power consumption, and reduced package size. The AD 7321 can accept true bipolar <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> signals. The AD 7321 has four software-selectable input ranges, ± 10 V, ± 5 V, ± 2. 5 V, and 0 V to + 10 V. Each <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> channel is independently programmed to one of the four <b>input</b> ranges. The <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> channels on the AD 7321 are programmed to be single-ended, true differential, or pseudo differential. The ADC contains a 2. 5 V internal reference.
