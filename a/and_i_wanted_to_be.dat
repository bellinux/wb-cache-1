25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E

Another paternal cousin, Ayan Mukerji, is a scriptwriter and film director. Despite her parents and most of her relatives being members of the Indian film industry, Mukerji was uninterested in pursuing a career in film. She said, [...] "There were already too many actresses at home <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> someone different".|$|E
500|$|Beghe was a {{guest in}} May 2009 on the BBC World Service radio program , where he {{discussed}} his views on {{what he thought of}} Scientology when he first joined: [...] "I thought that it was something that was going to deliver miracles, and that it was the most selfless group of people that were totally dedicated to helping mankind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of it." [...] He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership, including its head David Miscavige: [...] "I think that there are probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main issue is not with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, and {{that has to do with}} people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige..." ...|$|E

500|$|Emily Blunt plays Sergeant Rita Vrataski, {{a veteran}} who guides and trains Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. Blunt {{said of her}} role, [...] "In these male-fueled genres, it's usually the woman who's holding {{the hand of the}} guy and he's running through explosions leading her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing the leading." [...] Chris Nashawaty, {{reviewing}} the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it [...] "the most feminist summer action flick in years". Bustles Alicia Lutes described Rita as [...] "ruthless and exacting in her takedown ... of a bunch of aliens" [...] and said: [...] "This is very much counter to the age-old ideals about ladies being the constant, delicate flowers of emotional heartstring-pulling." [...] Lutes noted how Cage's strength depended on Rita's guidance, as [...] "she trains him, aids him, and protects him (and in turn the fate of humanity) time and time again." [...] Tasha Robinson, writing a piece in The Dissolve about [...] "strong female characters" [...] that lack real purpose in films, said that Rita in Edge of Tomorrow was an exception. Robinson acknowledged that Rita existed to support Cage in his trials, but believed that [...] "the story doesn't degrade, devalue, weaken, or dismiss her".|$|E
500|$|Lafourcade {{launched}} a promotional tour throughout Mexico and only performed at theaters {{that were at}} least 100 years old. The Village Voice, reporting on an interview with Lafourcade, noted, [...] "There are enough such grand old structures in her country to make this possible", although according to Lafourcade, [...] "some of them are better maintained than others." [...] The [...] "Hasta la Raíz Tour" [...] opened in Tijuana on April18, 2015, and also visited several cities in the United States such as San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In Hollywood, Lafourcade participated on the Latin Grammy Acoustic Sessions at the Fonda Theatre. A few dates in Argentina, Chile, Italy, and Spain were announced; however, her record label, Sony Music, announced that due to illness the performance in Spain, set for June, would be canceled. In September, Lafourcade performed at [...] "Festival DCODE 2015" [...] in Madrid, Spain. The singer also visited Colombia on October1, 2015, performing at Bogotá's Royal Center. On November4, 2015, Lafourcade fulfilled a long-held dream of performing {{for the first time}} at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. [...] "I've been here with Julieta Venegas, and someone reminded me that I opened for Juanes a few years ago. When I was 13 years old, I ran away from home with my best friend to come to the Auditorio Nacional to see Christina Aguilera, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on stage, longing to have this opportunity. After many years of work, this became a reality." [...] To further promote the album, Lafourcade became the first Mexican female singer-songwriter to record an acoustic session for the music streaming service Spotify. Titled Spotify Sessions, the live EP includes six tracks from Hasta la Raíz ("Para Qué Sufrir", the title track, [...] "Nunca Es Suficiente", [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer", [...] "Palomas Blancas", and [...] "No Más Llorar") and a cover version of Rafael Hernández's [...] "Silencio". Lafourcade performed [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2015. Lafourcade also presented the tour in a sold-out show held at the Teatro Cariola in Santiago de Chile, Chile on November 25, 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Streisand {{changed her}} name from [...] "Barbara" [...] to [...] "Barbra" [...] because, she said, [...] "I hated the name, but I refused to change it." [...] Streisand further explained, [...] "Well, I was 18 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unique, but I didn't {{want to change}} my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or {{something}} like that. (My middle name is Joan.) And I said, 'No, let's see, if I take out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique." [...] A 1967 biography with a concert program said, [...] "the spelling of her first name is an instance of partial rebellion: she was advised to change her last name and retaliated by dropping an [...] "a" [...] from the first instead." ...|$|E
2500|$|The singer also {{explained}} his foray {{into a more}} poppy sound than his usual milieu. [...] "The last year I've been wanting to have more fun. I think I took myself very seriously as an artist <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like Marvin Gaye, and John Lennon and Bob Marley and these great artists and songwriters that sang about love and sang about relationships," [...] Robin explained. [...] "And then the last year, my wife and I just really wanted to have fun again, {{we wanted to be}} young again and we wanted to dance again and go out with our friends, so I wanted to make music that reflected that culture also." [...] The song has been a worldwide hit, has peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and has also reached number one in 13 more countries including the United Kingdom, where Blurred Lines became only the 137th record in history to surpass the one million sales mark, and the United States. The new album [...] Blurred Lines was released on July 30, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics, {{including}} former feminist colleagues, concluded that she reinforced the stereotypes she sought to subvert. As {{was the case}} for other women artists that were reclaiming their bodies through their art practice, she was accused of regressive female narcissism. Chadwick declared that [...] "I'm disappointed that a false rationalism is used as a stick with which to measure what I'm doing when I am looking to cross the taboos that have been instigated. I hate being hauled up as an example of negative women's work." [...] In 1988 Chadwick made a conscious decision [...] "...not to represent my body.... It immediately declares female gender <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more deft." [...] Her practice then moved inside the body to flesh in her Meat Abstracts (1989) and Meat Lamps (1989-91) and to bodily excrement’s in Piss Flowers (1991–92). Chadwick commented, [...] "I felt compelled to use materials that were still bodily, that were still a kind of self-portrait, but did not rely on representation of my own body" ...|$|E

2500|$|During Osbourne's {{appearance}} on The Graham Norton Show, she stated, {{in reference to}} Minogue, [...] "She knows she's there because of her looks, not because of her contribution to the music industry." [...] In a press conference held on 12 December 2007, when asked why she had been publicly talking about Minogue, Osbourne said [...] "It's an even playing field, Dannii speaks about me, I speak about her." [...] Minogue said in turn [...] "I've looked up to Sharon and Louis for years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of that gang. But when they're slating you, you think: 'Please don't, I really like you.'" [...] Cowell admitted that Osbourne did not feel comfortable about having a new judge and that Osbourne and Minogue would never be [...] "the best of buddies," [...] adding that if Osbourne wanted to leave the show, he would let her (in fact, Osbourne left after series 4). The Daily Mail reported that Cowell was forced to sit the judges down, asking them to maintain a civil relationship with each other behind the scenes. The apparent flirting between Cowell and Minogue also generated comment in the popular media.|$|E
2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when I was six. And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we {{suddenly}} didn’t have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, {{and we have a lot}} of uncles and friends over there. And when my father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who really affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod.
