5000|$|Genoise {{is a basic}} {{building}} block of much French pâtisserie and is used for making several different types of cake. The batter usually is baked to form a thin sheet. An 1884 cookbook gives a simple recipe for a genoise: Work together briskly in a basin half a pound of flour, half a pound of sugar, and four eggs: after five minutes' good stirring, add {{a quarter of a}} pound of melted butter. Butter <b>a</b> square <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> spread the paste upon it, and bake it in a moderate oven until it turns a golden yellow.|$|R
5000|$|Drops are a {{traditional}} small, round confectionery. It {{is a general}} term {{that can be used}} for any mixture of boiled sugar and flavourings that has been [...] "dropped" [...] onto <b>a</b> pan or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> in rounds to set. In the 1840s, [...] drop roller machines came on the market. These machines took the hot, 120 °C, cooked sugar, and molded it into shapes between two hand cranked brass rollers.|$|R
50|$|The classic Ellio's pizza may be {{prepared}} {{only in a}} conventional or toaster oven. In each instance, the baking temperature is 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 °C), with the pizza baking either directly on the rack for about 9-12 minutes, or on <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> for 14-16 minutes (not more than 14 minutes in a toaster oven).|$|E
50|$|The {{recipe for}} {{peppermint}} bark uses few ingredients, with only chocolate and mint candies required. Some recipes also add peppermint flavoring. The candies used may be candy canes. The candies should be broken up, and the chocolate is melted. These two ingredients are combined on <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> and then chilled until firm. The bark is then {{removed from the}} sheet and broken into pieces {{in a similar way}} to peanut brittle.|$|E
50|$|Putting <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> {{pan over}} a furnace can allow for baking, {{which is in}} turn derived from {{the concept of the}} masonry oven. This was common for centuries, used to make breads, pies, and other items, and is still popular today, {{particularly}} among campers who enjoy stuffing their meats. Ovens can be made from cast iron, sheet metal or aluminum foil covered cardboard box. Reflector ovens are metal containers designed to surround an article of food being baked over an open flame and reflect the heat back towards the food.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to paper, cupcake liners {{may be made}} from very thin aluminum foil or, in a non-disposable version, silicone rubber. Because they can stand up on their own, foil and silicone liners {{can also be used}} on <b>a</b> flat <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> which makes them popular among people who do not have a specialized muffin tin. Some of the largest paper liners are not fluted and are made out of thicker paper, often rolled at the top edge for additional strength, so that they can also stand independently for <b>baking</b> without <b>a</b> cupcake tin. Some bakers use two or three thin paper liners, nested together, to simulate the strength of a single foil cup.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>sheet</b> pan, <b>baking</b> tray or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> is <b>a</b> flat, {{rectangular}} {{metal pan}} {{used in an}} oven. It is often used for baking bread rolls, pastries and flat products such as cookies, sheet cakes, swiss rolls and pizzas.|$|R
5000|$|Elzer Zwetschgenkuchen: The fifth verse of the Elz kermis song runs Quetschekuche soiß än zoart, bäckt mer in Elz die richtig Oart, or in {{standard}} High German, Zwetschgenkuchen süß und zart, bäckt man in Elz auf die richtige Art, or indeed in English, “Zwetschge cake sweet and mellow, is baked in Elz {{in the right}} way.” This describes the regional speciality, which at Elz kermis time in September is well known far beyond the village’s limits. The reason for the zwetschge cake’s popularity is, among other things, that the fair’s end traditionally falls {{at the same time}} as the zwetschge harvest also ends. The cake is traditionally prepared on <b>a</b> great oblong <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> The dough is a yeast dough upon which are laid pitted and chopped zwetschgen. In the preparation, the grounds for choosing zwetschgen over plums can be seen. Plums would give off too much moisture while baking and would soak the cake. The Zwetschgenkuchen is eaten with whipped cream at afternoon coffee time.|$|R
50|$|The Hungarian kalács (pronounced ˈkɒlaːtʃ) is a sweet bread {{very similar}} to brioche, usually baked in a braided form, and {{traditionally}} considered an Easter food. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century, the preparation of kalács was similar to that of everyday bread; the difference was in the shape, and in the better/quality flour used for the kalács. Nowadays kalács is prepared from dough enriched with milk and eggs. It is baked in an oven or brick oven, sometimes directly on the stones of the brick oven, or on <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
50|$|By using <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> pan placed {{above the}} grill surface, {{as well as}} a drip pan below the surface, it is {{possible}} to combine grilling and roasting to cook meats that are stuffed or coated with breadcrumbs or batter, and to bake breads and even casseroles and desserts. When cooking stuffed or coated meats, the foods can be baked first on the sheet pan, and then placed directly on the grilling surface for char marks, effectively cooking twice; the drip pan will be used to capture any crumbs that fall off from the coating or stuffing.|$|E
50|$|Shortcake is {{typically}} made with flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, salt, butter, milk or cream, and sometimes eggs. The dry ingredients are blended, {{and then the}} butter is cut in until the mixture resembles cornmeal. The liquid ingredients are then mixed in just until moistened, resulting in a shortened dough. The dough is then dropped in spoonfuls onto <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> rolled and cut like baking powder biscuits, or poured into a cake pan, depending on how wet the dough is and the baker's preferences. Then it is baked at a relatively high temperature until set.|$|E

5000|$|Cookie cutting sheet: Used {{for larger}} volumes, a {{production}} cookie cutting sheet {{is a piece}} of study plastic the size of a full sheet pan that essentially has dozens of cutout cookie cutters mounted on to it. [...] Rather than rolling out the dough and pressing the cutter into the top of the dough, the cutting sheet is placed of the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> cutting side up. A sheet of cookie dough, already rolled to the correct thickness, is laid on top of the cutting sheet, and a rolling pin is used to press the dough down on to the sharp edges of the cutting sheet. The cut cookies fall through the holes into the sheet, into their properly spaced positions on the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> The scrap dough and cutting sheet are removed, and the pan is ready for <b>baking.</b> Cookie cutter <b>sheets</b> allow high volume production without the time or risk of moving cut cookies to <b>baking</b> <b>sheets,</b> resulting in rapid production of a more uniformly shaped and spaced product.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to prepare {{butternut}} squash is roasting. To do this, the squash is cut in half lengthwise (see pictures), lightly brushed with cooking oil or put in a thin layer of water and placed cut side down on <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> It is then baked for 45 minutes or until soft. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways.The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked. However, the seeds are edible, either raw or roasted, and the skin is also edible and softens when roasted.|$|E
5000|$|Zwetschgenkuchen, Pflaumenkuchen and Zwetschgendatschi (southern Bavaria) is a sheet cake or pie {{made from}} yeast dough or shortcrust dough that is thinly spread onto <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> or other baking mold {{and covered with}} pitted zwetschgen.It is popular as a summer cake and has {{different}} local labelings throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland.In Hessen, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Moselle it is known as Quetschekuche, in Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg and parts of Austria it is called Zwetschgendatschi and in Rhineland and the Eifel Prummetaat."Datschi" [...] {{is thought to be}} derived from the dialect word [...] "detschen" [...] or [...] "datschen" [...] that can be translated as [...] "pinching" [...] (as the plums are pinched into the dough). Although it is common to serve it with Streusel (a crumbly mixture of butter, sugar and flour) the original recipe serves it plain without any toppings.|$|E
50|$|Matzah pizza is {{prepared}} by covering {{a piece of}} matzo with sauce and melted cheese. It can be eaten as is, or baked first. In the latter case, the matzo is first softened in water; alternately, the sauce ingredients are used to soften the matzo. Other traditional pizza toppings {{may be used in}} addition to cheese. For example, chef Spike Mendelsohn suggests topping matzah pizza with figs and asparagus, peppers and feta cheese, or cherry tomatoes, olives, and rosemary, while Martha Stewart recommends placing a fried egg on top of a matzah pizza. Other recipes suggest using crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and some recipes suggest substituting hummus for sauce. Some recipes recommend baking the matzo and toppings on <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> either in a conventional oven or in a microwave oven, while other recipes recommend baking matzah pizza in a casserole pan, so that the dish resembles a layered lasagna. Vegan recipes suggest utilizing vegan cheese or omitting the cheese entirely.|$|E
50|$|For {{consolidated}} freight loads, like a pallet {{of boxes}} or an item too oddly shaped {{to fit into}} a container, flat metal pallets that resemble large <b>baking</b> <b>sheets</b> that are compatible with the loading equipment are used.|$|R
50|$|Cookie press: An {{automated}} or hand-operated cookie press, {{also called}} a cookie gun, {{is used to}} make large batches of cookies quickly. The cookie dough is extruded onto the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> in ornate shapes {{that would otherwise be}} too difficult or time-consuming to create by hand.|$|R
2500|$|The Romans {{introduced}} an oven called a [...] "furn" [...] ("purni" [...] in Talmudic Aramaic), a large, wood-burning, stone-lined oven with a bottom {{on which the}} dough or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> was placed. This provided a major advance in bread and pastry baking, and made the baking of much thicker loaves possible.|$|R
50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E
50|$|The major {{ingredients}} of springerle are eggs, white (wheat) flour, and very fine or powdered sugar. The biscuits are traditionally anise-flavored, although the anise {{is not usually}} mixed into the dough; instead it is dusted onto the <b>baking</b> <b>sheets</b> so that the biscuit sits {{on top of the}} crushed anise seeds.|$|R
50|$|Sheet {{aluminium}} is spun or stamped into form. Due to {{the softness}} of the metal it may be alloyed with magnesium, copper, or bronze to increase its strength. Sheet aluminium is commonly used for <b>baking</b> <b>sheets,</b> pie plates, and cake or muffin pans. Deep or shallow pots may be formed from sheet aluminium.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most famous}} Crimean Karaite food is Kybyn ( [...] pl. , [...] kybyn pl. kybynlar, [...] ). Kybynlar are half moon shaped pies of leavened dough with a {{stuffing}} of chopped beef or mutton, baked in dutch oven or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> Other meals common for Crimean Karaites and Tatars are Chiburekki, Pelmeni, Shishlik (These {{are most often}} made from mutton).|$|R
5000|$|Biscuits can be {{prepared}} for baking in several ways. The dough can be rolled out flat and cut into rounds, which expand when baked into flaky-layered cylinders. If extra liquid is added, the dough's texture changes to resemble stiff pancake batter so that small spoonfuls can be dropped into the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> to produce [...] "drop biscuits," [...] which are more amorphous in texture and shape.|$|R
5000|$|Every issue {{includes}} a detailed equipment test, where {{a panel of}} users tries a variety of items such as knives, cutting boards or <b>baking</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the case of more expensive pieces of equipment, an overall winner {{as well as a}} [...] "best buy" [...] are selected. Both types of tests sort their results into four categories: Highly Recommended, Recommended, Recommended with Reservations, and Not Recommended. As with recipes, much space is devoted to explaining the selection and testing process, and any exceptions to the general conclusions.|$|R
5000|$|To make springerle, very cold, stiff {{dough is}} rolled thin and pressed into a mold, or {{impressed}} by a specialized, carved rolling pin. The dough is unmolded {{and then left}} to dry for about 24 hours before being baked at a low temperature on greased, anise-dusted <b>baking</b> <b>sheets.</b> The drying period allows time for the pattern {{in the top of}} the cookie to set, so that the cookie has a [...] "pop-up" [...] effect from leavening, producing the characteristic [...] "foot" [...] along the edges, below the molded surface.|$|R
5000|$|Drop {{cookies are}} made from a {{relatively}} soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> During <b>baking,</b> the mounds of dough spread and flatten. Chocolate chip cookies (Toll House cookies), oatmeal (or oatmeal raisin) cookies, and rock cakes are popular examples of drop cookies. This may also include thumbprint cookies, for which a small central depression is created with a thumb or small spoon before <b>baking</b> to contain <b>a</b> filling, such as jam or a chocolate chip. In the UK, the term [...] "cookie" [...] often refers only to this particular type of product.|$|R

50|$|The batter is a pound cake, a cake made {{of equal}} amounts by weight of butter, flour, eggs and sugar, {{which is then}} divided into two parts, {{one of which is}} colored with cocoa. The two batters are spread in layers onto the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> the {{chocolate}} batter above the plain batter, before the top is strewn with sour cherries. During baking, the cherries sink {{to the bottom of the}} cake, causing the wavy pattern. After the cake has cooled it is decorated with a thick layer of buttercream and iced with a chocolate glaze which may then be ornamented in a wavy manner with a fork.|$|R
