5|$|Several nuns {{were given}} a {{platform}} to air their views including activist nuns such as Marjorie Tuite, Margaret Traxler, and six nuns of the order Sisters of Loretto, an order known for its work on pacifism and social justice. In some cases, signers of the statement grew more radical in their beliefs after being reprimanded by church authority. In the publicity surrounding the dispute with the nuns and the theologians, the statistics showing that most American Catholics disagreed with church teachings <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> were repeated many times. Traxler appeared in a television spot with a tube of toothpaste, saying that you cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube. The various responses to the 1984 advertisement and its aftermath remained in the news through 1986.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Barack Obama as the 44th President {{took place on}} January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued {{executive}} orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. He ordered {{the closing of the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling <b>about</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{abortion}} remains {{illegal in}} Ireland, the constitutional ban {{on it was}} softened somewhat in 1992. After a referendum in that year, the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992 (Ireland) was approved, it was made legal to perform an abortion {{to save the life}} of a mother, to give information <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> and to travel to another country for an abortion.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution has also, since 1983, {{contained}} a controversial prohibition of abortion. However, {{this does not}} apply in cases {{where there is a}} threat {{to the life of the}} mother (including from risk of suicide) and may not be used to limit the distribution of information <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> services in other countries or the right of freedom of travel to procure an abortion.|$|E
25|$|For example, a 1999 {{study by}} the Guttmacher Institute found that most U.S. sex {{education}} courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, HIV, STIs, abstinence, implications of teenage pregnancy, and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of birth control and infection prevention, sexual orientation, sexual abuse, and factual and ethical information <b>about</b> <b>abortion,</b> varied more widely.|$|E
25|$|Leave It to Beaver faced stiff {{competition}} in its time slots. During its {{next to last}} season, for example, the show ran against The Defenders, a program examining highly charged courtroom cases <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> and the death penalty.

25|$|The Church {{does not}} approve {{of the use of}} {{abortion}} as a means of birth control or family planning, but recognizes a woman's right to receive one. Abortion is condoned only in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, or when a mother's physical or mental health is at risk. The Church opposes any legislation which would prevent women from obtaining <b>abortions</b> or information <b>about</b> <b>abortions.</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{reports on}} a way of {{measuring}} abortion where the procedure is illegal, not openly tolerated and socially stigmatized, but in a coun- try context where women are knowledgeable about and willing {{to report on the}} abortion experience of their close friends/relatives. In this innovative method, neither a woman who has had an abortion nor a provider who has supplied one is asked to disclose socially sanctioned infor- mation about themselves. Instead, individuals are asked to report on the abortions of their confidants (i. e., those of the women who confide in the respondents). The chapter describes an application in Burkina Faso of this method to obtain more complete reporting by asking <b>about</b> the <b>abortions</b> of others. Qualitative interviews showed that, in this setting, women who are unwilling to talk <b>about</b> their own <b>abortions</b> were more forthcoming <b>about</b> <b>abortions</b> obtained by women in their social network. The methodology converts information on confidants’ abortions into measures of abortion prevalence...|$|R

25|$|In 2003, {{an honorary}} degree and public {{platform}} {{was given to}} pro-choice Holy Cross alumnus Chris Matthews despite pro-life alumni objections. College President Fr. Michael McFarland defended the invitation and degree, despite clear direction from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishop policies and Catholic Church policies never to give a public platform to those at odds with central holdings of the Church, such as the teachings on abortion. McFarland along {{with the majority of}} the current Holy Cross community continue to defend this, stating that while Matthews is pro-choice, that is not his defining characteristic and he did not talk purely <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> in his speech.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1928, with October still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, {{accompanied}} by his perennial film collaborator Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse. Officially, the trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and company to learn about sound motion pictures and to present the famous Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, {{it was also an}} opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zürich, London, and Paris. In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> directed by Tissé entitled Frauennot - Frauenglück.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Christian {{denominations}} have nuanced positions, thoughts, and teachings <b>about</b> <b>abortion,</b> {{especially in}} extenuating circumstances. The Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church Oriental Orthodoxy, and most evangelical Protestants oppose deliberate abortion as immoral, while allowing what {{is sometimes called}} indirect abortion, namely, an action that does not seek {{the death of the}} fetus as an end or a means, but that is followed by the death as a side effect. Some mainline Protestant denominations such as the Methodist Church, United Church of Christ, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, among others, are more permissive of abortion. More generally, some Christian denominations can be considered pro-life, while others may be considered pro-choice. Additionally, there are sizable minorities in some denominations that disagree with their denomination's stance on abortion.|$|E
50|$|The Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland {{explains}} its pro-life position {{through a}} biblical {{narrative of the}} human status of the unborn child. It also acknowledges that women facing a crisis pregnancy often are confronted with the most difficult decision {{of their lives and}} encourages support which helps women to choose an alternative to abortion. The church has expressed a particular concern <b>about</b> <b>abortions</b> for minor abnormalities such as club foot, cleft lip or cleft palate.|$|R
25|$|South Australia is {{the only}} state which {{collects}} and publishes data on abortions. In 2002 there were 5,147 medical abortions performed in South Australia, or 17.2 per 1000 women aged 15–44. Projected nationally, this would suggest that <b>about</b> 73,300 <b>abortions</b> were performed nationwide. This {{does not take into account}} differences between states. For example, unpublished data from Western Australia estimates a rate of 19.4 terminations per 1000 women in the same age bracket, which would indicate <b>about</b> 82,700 <b>abortions</b> projected nationally.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{publications}} by the organization, in 2006 it prevented the <b>abortion</b> of <b>about</b> 2,600 fetuses, and, in total, has prevented <b>about</b> 25,000 <b>abortions</b> as of 2007.|$|R
25|$|The images {{played an}} {{important}} role in debates <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> and the beginning of human life. Nilsson himself declined to comment on the origins of some of the photographs' subjects, which in fact included many images of terminated and miscarried fetuses: all but one of the images that appeared in Life were of fetuses that had been surgically removed from the womb. Nilsson also refused to be drawn on the question of the point at which life begins, describing himself as a journalist and the debate as one for other authorities. Pro-life campaigners perceived and presented the book's images as evidence that a fetus is a well-developed, discrete human person from well before birth. Pro-choice activists, on the other hand, have portrayed the images (and the technology they represent) as evidence of medical and imaging techniques that now allow serious fetal defects to be detected very early and furnish pregnant parents with more information upon which to base choices. Some critics have described as ironic the image's popularity with pro-life campaigners who argue that the fetus is a living human, given that many of them depict (surgically or spontaneously) aborted fetuses.|$|E
25|$|A Child Is Born (full title: A Child Is Born: The {{drama of}} life before birth in {{unprecedented}} photographs. A practical {{guide for the}} expectant mother; original Swedish title: Ett barn blir till) is a 1965 photographic book by Swedish photojournalist Lennart Nilsson. The book consists of photographs charting {{the development of the}} human embryo and fetus from conception to birth; it is reportedly the best-selling illustrated book ever published. Nilsson's photographs are accompanied by text, written by doctors, describing prenatal development and offering advice on antenatal care. The images were among the first of developing fetuses to reach a wide popular audience. Their reproduction in the April 30, 1965, edition of Life magazine sparked so much interest that the entire print run, of eight million copies, sold out within four days; they won Nilsson the American National Press Association Picture of the Year award, and reached a sufficiently iconic status to be chosen for launch into space aboard the NASA probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. The book and its images have figured in debates <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> and the beginning of life, and the book {{is the subject of a}} substantial body of feminist critique.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig {{wrote in}} a 2014 article for First Things that moralizing with the phrase was {{commonly}} seen in discussions of sexuality, attributing this to society's increasing perception of morality as a feminine domain.

500|$|Mansour {{personally}} {{disapproved of}} abortion. However, {{she held the}} belief that, because abortion was legal, it should be equally available to all women, poor and rich. In July 1982 during her unsuccessful political campaign, Mansour wrote a [...] "Position Paper on Abortion and Legislation". In late summer 1984, she joined 96 other leading theologians, nuns and priests who signed another position paper titled [...] "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion", asking for Catholic discussion <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> and requesting religious pluralism in Catholicism.|$|E
500|$|When asked <b>about</b> <b>abortion</b> in 2000, Bush {{said she}} did not believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. She did not comment on whether women had the right to an abortion. She did say, however, that the country should do [...] "what we can {{to limit the number of}} abortions, to try to reduce the number of abortions in a lot of ways, and that is, by talking about {{responsibility}} with girls and boys, by teaching abstinence, having abstinence classes everywhere in schools and in churches and in Sunday school".|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, the Department of Health (DOH) {{significantly}} reduced the statistical information it provided <b>about</b> <b>abortions</b> for suspected foetal abnormalities.

An appeal by the DOH to the Information Tribunal failed. The Tribunal rejected the DOH view that personal information would be unreasonably endangered, and commented on the Department's duty to ensure compliance with the Abortion Act and its failure to scrutinise reporting forms [...] "either clinically or substantively". The Department first planned to appeal to the High Court, but subsequently conceded and made the requested information available in July 2011.|$|R

Although Ginsburg has consistently supported abortion rights and joined in the Court's opinion striking down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law in Stenberg v. Carhart , on the fortieth anniversary of the Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade , she criticized the decision in Roe as terminating a nascent democratic movement to liberalize abortion laws which might have built a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1967, the {{national}} debate on abortion was starting to gain traction. In {{the early stages of}} the debate, Democratic California state senator Anthony C. Beilenson introduced the [...] "Therapeutic Abortion Act" [...] in an effort to reduce the number of [...] "back-room abortions" [...] performed in California. The state legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it on June 14, 1967. About two million abortions would be performed as a result, mostly because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother. Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor, he would not have signed it. After he recognized what he called the [...] "consequences" [...] of the bill, he announced that he was pro-life. He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively <b>about</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E

Frank Schaeffer and his associate, Jim Buchfuehrer provided a private, five-hour screening of Whatever Happened to the Human Race? to Jack Kemp and wife Joanne in their home that, according to Frank Schaeffer's account of the late evening and early morning event in his book Crazy for God, led to both the Schaeffers and Koop obtaining [...] "...access to everyone in the Republican Party".
