25|$|My sister's {{disposition}} was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her {{tendency to}} seclusion; except {{to go to}} church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.|$|E
25|$|The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} on 3 July that host Gretel Killeen is {{being accused of}} being aggressive towards some housemates, in particular Jamie during his eviction interview after he suggested the video package shown of him crying and sitting alone was biased towards the negative. Later she was criticised for being particularly aggressive towards Rebecca, Thomas and Jamie. Killeen was also criticised for hypocrisy having aggressively questioned why Jamie did not intervene when Michelle argued with Aleisha, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> was receptive towards Michelle herself on her eviction, and even rationalised Michelle's behaviour during the argument. Michelle was also named the most unpopular housemate ever to inhabit the Australian Big Brother House.|$|E
500|$|Following Native Son, Baker had a {{critically}} acclaimed lead {{role as the}} wife of a schizophrenic drifter (played by Jack Nicholson) in Ironweed (1987), alongside Meryl Streep. Her performance in the film was again praised by Roger Ebert, who said: [...] "Nicholson's homecoming [...] is all the more effective because Carroll Baker is so good as his wife... she finds a whole new range. It may seem surprising to say that Baker holds the screen against Jack Nicholson, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> does".|$|E

I've {{never been able to}} feel really grown-up and tremendous, like other chaps. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she's</b> firmly persuaded that I'm an arbitrary overbearing bossing kind of person.

500|$|Amra Ademovic is a Bosnian nurse {{working in}} a {{hospital}} in Afghanistan {{after the fall of}} the Taliban. She cares for and later adopts Roshi, a critically wounded Afghan orphan. Amra, according to Hosseini, was created to represent the foreign aid workers serving in Afghanistan. While visiting the country in 2003, he had encountered a number of people who had left comfortable lifestyles to help provide relief aid, and he had wanted to pay tribute to them through the portrayal of Amra. Hosseini described the character as one of his favorites and said, [...] "She has seen humanity at its worst, having worked in war zones most of her career, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> has retained great capacity for compassion and mercy. She is also very street smart, fiercely intelligent, and brutally honest." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{harm done}} by Formosa lies in this,— that the {{character}} is utterly false, false to human nature and false to London life. She is a wretch, abominable almost beyond conception, {{so as to be}} odious, if known, to the most odious. She is sharper as well as prostitute,—and is false to all with whom she comes in contact, to those whom she is supposed to love and to those who love her. Her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> is exhibited to us as a fine creature, a noble woman, one whom a man might be honoured by loving;—and at last she ends with a success! ... That which is vile and dirty, squalid and miserable,—that, of which we may say that were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance,—is exhibited as a bright existence, full of danger indeed, but still open to all that is noble, and capable of final success.|$|E

[...] "Applause" [...] was later {{included}} in the setlist of Gaga's Manhattan residency show at Roseland Ballroom. Gaga appeared in a purple sequin studded two-piece with a matching face-mask and green colored wig during the performance. The song was included on the set list of her [...] tour. Following [...] "Bad Romance", Gaga joined her dancers on the catwalks, where she performed a choreographed dance routine in a rave inspired outfit. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail described Gaga's performance as [...] "unstoppable and enthralling" [...] but criticized the show's production for drowning out Gaga's vocals and said: [...] "She’s not like Jennifer Lopez or Britney Spears or even Madonna, who were raised as dancers and lime-lighters, not musicians. <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>she</b> prefers to perform spectacles that, by design, fail to showcase all of her abilities." ...|$|E

I {{absolutely}} am worse, this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to wake her last night." ...|$|R
500|$|Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{said that}} their first album [...] "is a {{compendium}} of slick secondhand urban pop encompassing [...] G-funk synths on 'Say You'll Be There' [...] and Babyface's guitar and strings balladry on '2 Become 1'". Larry Flick of Billboard magazine compared it to [...] "Wannabe" [...] saying that it [...] "is as immediately infectious, though it's not nearly as silly and novelty-driven". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a bid for street cred", while David Browne from the same magazine commented about the confusing lyrics, [...] "let's see: She wants to be friends, he wants more, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> croons, 'I'm giving you everything/All that joy can bring'? She's as confused as I am. Better to revel in the delectably frothy girl-group melody". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, {{in a review of}} their debut album Spice, said that [...] "what is surprising is how the sultry soul of 'Say You'll Be There' {{is more than just a}} guilty pleasure". In a review of the group's 2007 compilation album Greatest Hits, NME said that it is a [...] "fine song in any age".|$|E
500|$|Aurora's blurb on the Disney Princess website once {{cited the}} {{character}} as [...] "gentle and loving". Walt Disney introduced Aurora to Costa as [...] "a very layered character", describing her as [...] "different. She's calm, yet she's playful. She {{has a sense}} of humor, and she has an imagination." [...] Despite popular opinion that Aurora is a very passive character, Costa believes that the princess is actually [...] "very strong", citing her urge to defy her guardians as an example of her strength, while referring to the character as [...] "a beautiful personification of femininity." [...] Raised exclusively by three women in a very sheltered environment, Aurora had never been exposed to a man prior to meeting Phillip. Costa believes that, because of this, Aurora is [...] "innately romantic" [...] as opposed to simply lonely, explaining, there [...] "was a certain part of her that maybe she didn’t realize that was just so romantic and maybe expecting something that she didn’t even know what", and credits {{the fact that she was}} raised by three older women as opposed to her parents with making her [...] "a little bit older, <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>she</b> ... had this young outreaching spirit." [...] A very loving character, Aurora enjoyed her lonely life as much as she did because she had never experienced anything else. Additionally, the character's close companionship with woodland creatures is used to demonstrate that she is a loving individual.|$|E
500|$|Describing Beyoncé as [...] "a veteran on the VMA stage", Kaufman {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{audience}} was clearly feeling the love also" [...] and praised how she [...] " [...] a bit wild as {{she brought the}} tune home with some of her signature." [...] Staff members of the AOL's The Boombox commented that the lyrics of the song [...] "felt especially meaningful" [...] to announce her pregnancy to the world. Staff members of Rolling Stone called the performance [...] "spectacular" [...] while Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "rousing". Claire Suddath of Time magazine commented that [...] "this offering from the reigning queen of pop music is relatively toned down <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> still looked and sounded better than nearly everyone else at the awards." [...] Similarly, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "If you had to pick one defining moment, {{it would have to}} be Beyoncé’s baby bump. The diva's rendition of 'Love on Top' might not have been her best VMA performance ever, but there’s no denying the sheer electricity in the room when she ended her set by proudly revealing her pregnant tummy." [...] A critic of Essence magazine concluded that [...] " [...] performance of 'Love on Top' at the 2011 VMAs [...] will surely be one of the year's most memorable pop culture moments." [...] The writers of MTV News placed the performance at number 4 on their list of Best Live MTV Performances of 2011. It was stated that Beyoncé was in [...] "typical Sasha Fierce fashion" [...] while the performance was described as [...] "ebullient". Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine put the performance at number two on her list of [...] "Beyonce's 5 Biggest TV Performances" [...] adding that it was [...] "one of the most memorable TV moments of her career". Dan Hyman from Rolling Stone listed the performance and Beyoncé's announcement of her pregnancy at number 17 on the list of [...] "The 24 Wildest Moments in VMA History", while Billboard listed it at number 7 on its list of [...] "MTV VMAs' 10 Best Performances Ever" [...] in 2013.|$|E

She's modern to her finger tips, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she's</b> extraordinarily American--in {{spite of her}} modernity, she embodies in some queer way our tradition.

2500|$|The {{theme song}} [...] "Nagpapanggap" [...] (Pretending/Deceiving) {{from the film}} Kerida (The Mistress) depicts a person's {{awareness}} that her lover is only pretending to love her, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> has this pragmatic acceptance and is even thankful that she was loved, no matter how false that love may be.|$|E

2500|$|<b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> is {{also shown}} as having real {{power in the}} play. When {{threatened}} to be made a fool and fully overpowered by Octavius, she takes her own life: [...] "She {{is not to be}} silenced by the new master, she is the one who will silence herself: 'My resolution and my hands I'll trust/ None about Caesar' (IV. 15.51–52)". From this, connections can be made between power and the performance of the female role as portrayed by Cleopatra.|$|E
2500|$|Oppewall {{said of her}} career, [...] "What I do for {{a living}} is not {{dissimilar}} from what an actor does. I have a different set of tools, but it's the same process. The reason that it's fun to design sets is that it allows you to try on personalities that you'd never otherwise experience." [...] Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, said of Oppewall, [...] "Jeannine doesn't suffer fools gladly, and she hasn't suffered me gladly when I've been a fool. She's fastidious, restrained and refined, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> has this impulsive side where she just takes off and chases butterflies." [...] Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: [...] "While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{regretted that}} she had to give up journalism, and could only write about {{tradition}} and culture. In her articles collected later into [...] "Mother's Words of Old", she bemoaned the loosening of social cohesion, morals, and traditional values in dress and manner which she blamed on economic disorder, consumerism and globalisation, and Chinese immigration. She once wrote that the Chinese had occupied Mandalay without firing a shot, and had dubbed the present Lawpan [...] (boss in Chinese) era; she felt as if Mandalay was an undeclared colony of Yunnan Province. Daw Amar was a staunch defender of Burmese history, culture, religion and sovereignty embodied in her birthplace, the last royal capital of Burma, Mandalay - thus broadly nationalistic, religious and ethnocentric traditionalist in her perspective, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> had been in the forefront of modernising the written language, fostering mutual understanding and friendship between the dominant Bamar and the ethnic minorities in tandem with her husband, promoting sex education and public awareness of the HIV/AIDS problem, and voicing complaints regarding unpaid labour contributions of women in society.|$|E
