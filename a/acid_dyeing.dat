40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of low {{temperature}} plasma (LTP) treatment on the dyeing properties of wool were studied. Wool fibres were treated with oxygen plasma and three types of dyeing systems that are commonly used for wool dyeing, namely: (i) acid dye, (ii) chrome dye and (iii) reactive dye; {{were used in the}} dyeing process. For <b>acid</b> <b>dyeing,</b> the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was greatly increased, but the final dyeinq exhaustion equilibrium did not show any significant change. For chrome dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was increased, but the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased only to a small extent. In addition, the rate of the afterchroming process was similar to the chrome dyeing process. In the case of reactive dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was greatly increased and also the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased significantly. As a result, it may be concluded that the LTP treatment could improve the dyeing behaviour of wool fibre under different dyeing systems. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} {{of even a}} very small quantity of dye in water bodies is undesirable and affects the water bodies. Dye removal from industrial waste water is significant; hence in this study, a material that is an economical waste product was employed to test its <b>acid</b> <b>dye</b> removing capacity from aqueous solution. Methods: In this study, batch mode experiments were performed in the sorption process of Acid Red 97 (AR 97), Acid Red 114 (AR 114) and Acid Red 151 (AR 151) onto Curcuma angustifolia scales (CS). Also, the effect of process parameters like pH and adsorbent dosage was studied. The experimental data of AR 97, AR 114 and AR 151 sorption was fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models. Kinetic results in AR 97, AR 114 and AR 151 sorption were fitted at various concentrations to pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich and Intra-particle diffusion model. Results: The monolayer sorption capacity of the <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> {{was found to be}} AR 97 (350. 87 mg/g), AR 114 (202. 42 mg/g) and AR 151 (168. 91 mg/g).

Conclusion: The results showed higher <b>dye</b> removal for <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> at pH 2. The isotherm data, demonstrated good sorption capacity with AR 97 >AR 114 >AR 151.
