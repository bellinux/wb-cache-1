25|$|The {{works of}} Asín Palacios are widely admired, {{notwithstanding}} criticism that his view point {{was of a}} Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of Islamic studies. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. Perhaps, too, along with Louis Massignon and others, {{it can be said}} that the Professor Rev.

25|$|The {{structural}} reform process {{that started in}} 1992 under the government of President Alberto Fujimori led to the privatization of the electricity sector in a decade in {{which most of the}} countries in the region underwent a similar process. The restructuring process, <b>articulated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Electricity Concessions Law (LCE) of 1992, unbundled the vertically integrated state monopoly into generation, transmission and distribution and led the basis for the introduction of private operators and competition for generation and commercialization, with transmission and distribution regulated on the basis of free entry and open access. The 1992 Law was modified by Law No. 26876 (Anti-monopoly and Anti-oligopoly Law) in 1997. The process of concessions and transfer of generation assets to private companies was started in 1994 and relaunched in 2002 as it had not been completed yet.|$|E
25|$|Marcus Garvey {{encouraged}} African {{people around}} the world to be proud of their race and to see beauty in their own kind. This form of Black nationalism later became known as Garveyism. A central idea to Garveyism was that African people in every part of the world were one people and they would never advance if they did not put aside their cultural and ethnic differences and unite under their own shared history. He was heavily influenced by the earlier works of Booker T. Washington, Martin Delany, and Henry McNeal Turner. Garvey used his own personal magnetism and the understanding of black psychology and the psychology of confrontation to create a movement that challenged bourgeois blacks for the minds and souls of African Americans. Marcus Garvey's return to America had to do with his desire to meet with the man who inspired him most, Booker T. Washington but unfortunately Garvey did not return in time to meet Washington. Despite this, Garvey moved forward with his efforts and two years later, a year after Washington's death, Garvey established a similar organization in America known as the United Negro Improvement Association otherwise known as the UNIA. Garvey's beliefs are <b>articulated</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey as well as Message To The People: The Course of African Philosophy.|$|E

40|$|From {{the study}} of the "historical truth" syntagma in Freud <b>in</b> {{relation}} to <b>the</b> concept of psychic reality and the structure of the myth, and from the incidences on Freud's work and on other texts, such syntagma is examined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aspects of both the truth and the idea of a constellation –as it appears in Freud, Lacan, and Goethe. Then, based on the same authors, it is articulated with the clinic of the obsessional neurosis. Thus a hypothesis was inferred: a possible relationship between the syntagma –that comes from the Freudian text and was taken up by Lacan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of speech and language– and what Lacan would later <b>articulate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of jouissance.

500|$|Paine's book {{followed}} {{in the tradition of}} early eighteenth-century British deism. These deists, while maintaining individual positions, still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine <b>articulated</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Age of Reason. The most important position that united the early deists was their call for [...] "free rational inquiry" [...] into all subjects, especially religion. Saying that early Christianity was founded on freedom of conscience, they demanded religious toleration and an end to religious persecution. They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality. Deists embraced a Newtonian worldview, and they believed all things in the universe, even God, must obey the laws of nature. [...] Without a concept of natural law, the deists argued, explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality. This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of miracles. Because miracles had to be observed to be validated, deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God's miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God. Along these lines, deistic writings insisted that God, as the first cause or prime mover, had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan. They held that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to (miraculously) intervene in human affairs. Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious Truth or [...] "one true faith"; religion could only be [...] "simple, apparent, ordinary, and universal" [...] if it was to be the logical product of a benevolent God. They therefore distinguished between [...] "revealed religions" [...] (which they rejected), such as Christianity, and [...] "natural religion", a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God's existence (they were, thus, not atheists).|$|E
