25|$|The Miltenberger (Mi) {{subsystem}} originally {{consisting of}} five phenotypes (Mia, Vw, Mur, Hil and Hut) now has 11 recognised phenotypes numbered I to XI (The antigen 'Mur' {{is named after}} to the patient the original serum was isolated from - a Mrs Murrel.) The name originally given to this complex refers to the reaction erythrocytes gave to the standard Miltenberger <b>antisera</b> used to test them. The subclasses were based on additional reactions with other standard <b>antisera.</b>|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{diagnosis}} {{has been}} done by culturing on sorbitol-MacConkey medium and then using typing antiserum. However, current latex assays and some typing <b>antisera</b> have shown cross reactions with non-E. coli O157 colonies. Furthermore, not all E. coli O157 strains associated with HUS are nonsorbitol fermentors.|$|E
25|$|C. difficile toxins have a {{cytopathic}} effect in cell culture, and neutralization of any effect observed with specific <b>antisera</b> is the practical {{gold standard for}} studies investigating new CDI diagnostic techniques. Toxigenic culture, in which organisms are cultured on selective media and tested for toxin production, remains the gold standard and is the most sensitive and specific test, although it is slow and labor-intensive.|$|E
2500|$|The antigen Thy-1 was {{the first}} T cell marker [...] to be identified. Thy-1 was {{discovered}} [...] by Reif and Allen in 1964 during a search for heterologous <b>antisera</b> against mouse leukemia cells, and was demonstrated by them to be present on murine thymocytes, on T lymphocytes, and on neuronal cells. [...] It was originally named theta (Î¸) antigen, then Thy-1 (THYmocyte differentiation antigen 1) due to its prior identification in thymocytes (precursors of T cells in the thymus). The human homolog was isolated in 1980 as a 25kDa protein (p25) of T-lymphoblastoid cell line MOLT-3 binding with anti-monkey-thymocyte <b>antisera.</b> The discovery of Thy-1 in mice and humans led to the subsequent discovery of many other T cell markers, which is very significant {{to the field of}} immunology since T cells (along with B cells) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the tables}} a fortuitous {{transplant}} between two unrelated individual {{has resulted in}} an antiserum to single alloantigen. By discovering these close-but-non-identical matches, the process with somewhat related haplotypes surface antigens were identified for HLA A, and in the table below, HLA B at the time however these were all grouped together as HL-Antigens. On the left the [...] "B" [...] and [...] "cw" [...] antigens are matched (B and C are close together so if B matches then C likely also matches), but A antigens are not matched. The <b>antisera</b> that is produced by the recipient {{is most likely to}} be A3, but if the direction of transplant is reversed A2 is the likely alloantigen. Two of the first three alloantigens are thus readily easy to detect because of the similarity and frequency of the A2-B7 and A3-B7 haplotypes (see example 1).|$|E
2500|$|H5N1 {{has been}} shown to be {{transmitted}} to tigers, leopards, and domestic cats that were fed uncooked domestic fowl (chickens) with the virus. H3N8 viruses from horses have crossed over and caused outbreaks in dogs. Laboratory mice have been infected successfully with a variety of avian flu genotypes. [...] "Interestingly, recombinant influenza viruses containing the 1918 HA and NA and up to three additional genes derived from the 1918 virus (the other genes being derived from the A/WSN/33 virus) were all highly virulent in mice (Tumpey et al., 2004). Furthermore, expression microarray analysis performed on whole lung tissue of mice infected with the 1918 HA/ NA recombinant showed increased upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, tissue injury, and oxidative damage (Kash et al., 2004). These findings were unusual because the viruses with the 1918 genes had not been adapted to mice. The completion of the sequence of the entire genome of the 1918 virus and the reconstruction and characterization of viruses with 1918 genes under appropriate biosafety conditions will shed more light on these findings and should allow a definitive examination of this explanation. Antigenic analysis of recombinant viruses possessing the 1918 HA and NA by hemagglutination inhibition tests using ferret and chicken <b>antisera</b> suggested a close relationship with the A/swine/Iowa/30 virus and H1N1 viruses isolated in the 1930s (Tumpey et al., 2004), further supporting data of Shope from the 1930s (Shope, 1936). Interestingly, when mice were immunized with different H1N1 virus strains, challenge studies using the 1918-like viruses revealed partial protection by this treatment, suggesting that current vaccination strategies are adequate against a 1918-like virus (Tumpey et al., 2004)." ...|$|E
