5|$|The book {{presents}} <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> {{analysis and}} refutation {{of climate change}} denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E

5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book of the eighteenth century. The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> review of the {{commercial}} dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E
5|$|Rivette {{was unhappy}} with La Religieuse and re-evaluated his career, {{developing}} a unique cinematic style with L'Amour fou. Influenced by the political turmoil of May 1968, improvisational theater and <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> interview with Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold on camera. This technique led to the thirteen-hour Out 1. His films of the 1970s, such as Celine and Julie Go Boating, often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years, with films such as Merry-Go-Round and Le Pont du Nord being difficult productions.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E

5|$|With Peter Schneider, Ehlers {{embarked}} on <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> {{study of the}} foundations of gravitational lensing. One result of this work was a 1992 monograph co-authored with Schneider and Emilio Falco. It was the first systematic exposition of the topic that included both the theoretical foundations and the observational results. From the viewpoint of astronomy, gravitational lensing is often described using a quasi-Newtonian approximation—assuming the gravitational field to be small and the deflection angles to be minute—which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical relevance. In contrast, the monograph developed a thorough and complete description of gravitational lensing from a fully relativistic space-time perspective. This feature of the book played a major part in its long-term positive reception. In the following years, Ehlers continued his research on the propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary spacetimes.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed <b>an</b> <b>in-depth</b> article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days after the fact.|$|E
