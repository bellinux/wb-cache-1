40|$|The APT code {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{software}} tools for complex numerically controlled (N/C) machining. APT is an acronym for Automatically Programmed Tools and is used to denote both a language and the computer software that processes that language. Development of the APT language and software system was begun over twenty years ago as a U. S. government sponsored industry and university research effort. APT is a "problem oriented" language that was developed for the explicit purpose of aiding the N/C machine tools. Machine-tool instructions and geometry definitions are written in the APT language to constitute a "part program. " The APT part program is processed by the APT software to produce a cutter location (CL) file. This CL file may then be processed by user supplied post processors to convert the CL data into a form suitable for a particular N/C machine tool. This June, 1989 offering of the APT system represents an adaptation, with enhancements, of the public domain version of APT IV/SSX 8 to the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 for use by the Engineering Services Division of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Enhancements include the super pocket feature which allows concave and convex polygon shapes of up to 40 points including shapes that overlap, that leave islands of material within the pocket, and that have one or more arcs as part of the pocket boundary. Recent modifications to APT include a rework of the POCKET subroutine and correction of an error that prevented the use within a macro of a macro variable cutter move statement combined with macro variable double check surfaces. Former modifications included the expansion of array and buffer sizes to accommodate larger part programs, and the insertion of a few user friendly error messages. The APT system software on the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 is organized into two separate programs: the load complex and the APT processor. The load complex handles the table initiation phase and is usually only run when changes to the APT processor capabilities are made. This phase initializes character recognition and syntax tables for the APT processor by creating FORTRAN block data programs. The APT processor consists of four components: the translator, the execution complex, the subroutine library, and the CL editor. The translator examines each APT statement in the part program for recognizable structure and generates a new statement, or series of statements, in an intermediate language. The execution complex processes all of the definition, motion, and related statements to generate cutter location coordinates. The subroutine library contains routines defining the algorithms required to process the sequenced list of intermediate language commands generated by the translator. The CL editor re-processes the cutter location coordinates according to user supplied commands to generate a final CL file. A sample post processor is also included which translates a CL file into a form for use with a Wales Strippit Fabramatic Model 30 / 30 sheet metal punch. The user should be able to readily develop post processors for other N/C machine tools. The APT language is a statement oriented, sequence dependent language. With the exception of such programming techniques as looping and macros, statements in an APT program are executed in a strict first-to-last sequence. In order to provide programming capability for the broadest possible range of parts and of machine tools, APT input (and output) is generalized, as represented by 3 -dimensional geometry and tools, and arbitrarily uniform, as represented by the moving tool concept and output data in absolute coordinates. A command procedure allows the user to select the desired part program, ask for a graphics file of cutter motions in IGES format, and submit the procedure as a batch job, if desired. The APT system software is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch and interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer under VMS 4. 4. The enhancements for this version of <b>APT</b> were last <b>updated</b> in June, 1989. The NASA adaptation, with enhancements, of the public domain version of the APT IV/SSX 8 software to the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees. The licensed program product delivered includes the APT IV/SSX 8 system source code, object code, executable images, and command procedures and one set of supporting documentation. Additional copies of the supporting documentation may be purchased at any time at the price indicated below...|$|R
