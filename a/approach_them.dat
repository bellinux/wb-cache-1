5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Keyblade War begins and the player battles four Foretellers before {{collapsing}} in exhaustion. The war ends with numerous Keyblades {{planted in the}} ground, forming the Keyblade Graveyard and with the player's character laying {{in the middle of}} the graveyard (presumably dying) while Chirithy, Skuld, and Ephemer <b>approach</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools {{could no longer}} be considered isolated incidents, and that police and security forces had to <b>approach</b> <b>them</b> with a new perspective in the aftermath of Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of school buildings for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan.|$|E
5|$|Lions are {{the most}} {{socially}} inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature, and have two types of social organisation. Some lions are residents, living in groups of related lionesses, their mates, and offspring. Such a group is called a pride. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females do leave and become nomadic. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up over 30 individuals, have been observed, the average pride consists of around fifteen lions; including several adult females, up to four males (known as a coalition if more than one) and their cubs of both sexes. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organisational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrous may allow nomad males to <b>approach</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|Charlie is {{unsure about}} the creatures, while Nancy is fascinated by {{everything}} about them. Leslie and Sarah decide to <b>approach</b> <b>them</b> again. Leslie pokes Charlie hard, causing Charlie to speak. Leslie replies several times, but Charlie will {{not speak to}} the creature. Nancy finally sits up and greets Sarah. Charlie only says hello after Nancy encourages him.|$|E
25|$|Since 1999, some of {{the toll}} booths (#9 - #13), located to the far left as motorists <b>approach</b> <b>them,</b> are {{unmanned}} and equipped only with a remote payment system (Turkish: OGS) in order to not delay traffic. In addition to OGS, another toll pay system with special contactless smart cards (Turkish: KGS) was installed at specific toll booths in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{attempting}} to understand relative species abundance patterns usually <b>approach</b> <b>them</b> in a descriptive or mechanistic way. Using a descriptive approach biologists attempt {{to fit a}} mathematical model to real data sets and infer the underlying biological principles at work from the model parameters. By contrast, mechanistic approaches create a mathematical model based on biological principles and then test how well these models fit real data sets.|$|E

25|$|Several other designs {{have been}} tried since then, but they {{required}} the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as panty hose and slacks, inhibit women from using them {{because they do not}} want their garments to touch the urinal or the floor. Often, women have little experience with urinals and do not know whether to <b>approach</b> <b>them</b> forward or backward.|$|E
25|$|Herrings are pelagic feeders. Their prey {{consists}} of {{a wide spectrum of}} phytoplankton and zooplankton, amongst which copepods are the dominant prey. Young herring usually capture small copepods by hunting them individually— they <b>approach</b> <b>them</b> from below. The (half speed) video loop at the left shows a juvenile herring feeding on copepods. In the middle of the image a copepod escapes successfully to the left. The opercula (hard bony flaps covering the gills) are spread wide open to compensate the pressure wave which would alert the copepod to trigger a jump.|$|E
25|$|When the lizards <b>approach</b> <b>them,</b> Nancy is fascinated but {{a little}} afraid. She remains close to Charlie. Though she does not agree with him, she does find him a small stick {{to use as a}} defense. It is Nancy who comes {{up with the idea of}} lying down in a {{submissive}} posture when Leslie and Sarah come near. Charlie follows Nancy's directions in most of the dealings with the lizards. After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn about them and make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first.|$|E

25|$|What, by contrast, can be {{established}} is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined {{as it was to}} the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to <b>approach</b> <b>them,</b> in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the Indépendants, during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born {{in the same way as}} the word 'Impressionism' in 1872.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of the Perverted-Justice website consists of online volunteers who carry out sting operations posing as children or teenagers (the age range chosen for the decoys is 10–15) on chat sites and waiting for adults to <b>approach</b> <b>them.</b> After obtaining identifying information of adults posing as minors, who may offer their telephone numbers and other details so that meetings can be arranged, the organization passes the information on to law enforcement. Perverted-Justice's methods are controversial, {{and a number of}} critics have labeled these actions harassment and possibly legal entrapment. The site additionally attracted media attention, both laudatory and critical, {{as a result of their}} collaboration with Dateline NBC on a series of televised sting operations called To Catch a Predator.|$|E
25|$|A {{worldwide}} 2002 {{study by}} the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research showed that 90% of victims of predatory attacks were {{children under the age}} of 18, especially under the age of 10. In the rare cases where adults were killed, the victims were almost always women. This is consistent with wolf hunting strategies, wherein the weakest and most vulnerable categories of prey are targeted. Aside from their physical inferiority, children were historically more vulnerable to wolves as they were more likely to enter forests unattended to pick berries and mushrooms, as well as tend and watch over cattle and sheep on pastures. While these practices have largely died out in Europe, they are still the case in India, where numerous attacks have been recorded in recent decades. Further reason for the vulnerability of children is the fact that some may mistake wolves for dogs and thus <b>approach</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{appeal of}} dinosaurs, as {{suggested}} by author, researcher, and dinosaur enthusiast Donald F. Glut, has multiple factors. Dinosaurs were [...] "monsters," [...] yet are safely extinct, allowing for vicarious thrills. They appeal to the imagination, {{and there are many}} ways to <b>approach</b> <b>them</b> intellectually. Finally, they appeal to adults nostalgic for what they enjoyed as children. Children have been particularly drawn to dinosaurs over the years.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} among major film critics. Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor, {{and the film}} {{has come to be}} seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s success, with Douglas' character declaring that [...] "greed is good." [...] It has also proven influential in inspiring people to work on Wall Street, with Sheen, Douglas, and Stone commenting over the years how people still <b>approach</b> <b>them</b> and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.|$|E
500|$|Wayne Scholes, {{owner of}} the Telford Tigers (currently in the English Premier League) has stated that his {{organisation}} doesn't have any immediate plans to make the step up, but has not ruled {{out the possibility of}} joining the EIHL in the future, saying that “We have had conversations with the Elite League before but they have to invite you. You can’t <b>approach</b> <b>them.</b> It {{is one of those things}} where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E
