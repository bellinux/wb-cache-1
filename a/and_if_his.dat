25|$|India's {{partition}} and independence on 15 August 1947 {{brought with it}} a scourge of violence that swept the Punjab, Bengal, Bihar, Delhi and {{many other parts of}} India. Millions of Hindus and Sikhs fled the newly created Pakistan for India, and millions of Muslims fled for West Pakistan and East Pakistan, created out of East Bengal. Violence claimed the lives of an estimated one million people. Azad took up responsibility for the safety of Muslims in India, touring affected areas in Bengal, Bihar, Assam and the Punjab, guiding the organisation of refugee camps, supplies and security. Azad gave speeches to large crowds encouraging peace and calm in the border areas and encouraging Muslims across the country to remain in India and not fear for their safety and security. Focusing on bringing the capital of Delhi back to peace, Azad organised security and relief efforts, but was drawn into a dispute with the Deputy prime minister and Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel when he demanded the dismissal of Delhi's police commissioner, who was a Sikh accused by Muslims of overlooking attacks and neglecting their safety. Patel argued that the commissioner was not biased, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> dismissal was forced it would provoke anger amongst Hindus and Sikhs and divide the city police. In Cabinet meetings and discussions with Gandhi, Patel and Azad clashed over security issues in Delhi and Punjab, as well as the allocation of resources for relief and rehabilitation. Patel opposed Azad and Nehru's proposal to reserve the houses vacated by Muslims who had departed for Pakistan for Muslims in India displaced by the violence. Patel argued that a secular government could not offer preferential treatment for any religious community, while Azad remained anxious to assure the rehabilitation of Muslims in India, secularism, religious freedom and equality for all Indians. He supported provisions for Muslim citizens to make avail of Muslim personal law in courts.|$|E

In the Test series, he scored 150 runs at 18.75 and took 17 wickets at 30.94. During the tour, Allen struck up a friendship with Bradman and encouraged his team to fraternise with the Australian team.

500|$|Initially, {{director}} Chris Weitz {{wanted to}} recast {{the role of}} Jacob Black for Twilights sequel, , due to the major physical changes that occur in Black between the two novels, and have an actor that would accurately portray [...] "the new, larger Jacob Black." [...] Black's role in the novel also increases significantly, with him {{falling in love with}} Bella and becoming a werewolf, putting the actor in a starring role. Representatives for Weitz had stated that they were make a full effort to recast the [...] "high-profile gig," [...] and MTV News confirmed that Weitz was looking at Michael Copon to take on the role; however, Summit Entertainment said a decision had not been made. In an attempt to keep the role, Lautner weight-trained extensively and gained approximately 30 pounds of muscle. In January 2009, Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue {{to play the role of}} Jacob in the sequel. In an interview, fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner's transformation saying, [...] "He's an entirely different person physically." [...] Stewart later said, [...] "He gets a lot of attention because he's buff, but I think as soon as the movie comes out, people are going to realize that's not why he got the job." [...] Co-star Robert Pattinson said after seeing Lautner's body, [...] "I saw him and thought 'Jesus, I'm going to get fired." [...] In an interview with The Wrap, Weitz said Lautner deserved a lot of credit for the movie's box office, stating, [...] "If you look at the movie, it should have been the weakest in the franchise, because Robert Pattinson doesn't play as big a role." [...] Weitz said Lautner had to [...] "pick up that slack, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> character hadn't been emotionally, not just physically, appealing, the movie wouldn't have been as big a hit." [...] The commercial performance of the film outpaced the first film, setting several box office records including the biggest midnight opening in the United States and Canada and the biggest single-day opening. The opening weekend of New Moon is the third highest opening weekend in domestic history with $142,839,137. The Twilight Saga: New Moon also has the sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total. Critical reception was less favorable, with the movie getting a 4.6/10 average from Rotten Tomatoes, and a 44 on Metacritic. Lautner won Favorite Breakout Movie Actor at the 35th People's Choice Awards.|$|E

2500|$|In modern cricket the bowler is no balled if he bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot (either {{grounded}} or raised) behind the popping crease <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1950s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease. The 1958-59 series was a catalyst towards the change as fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease in order to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, but sometimes they would drag it over the line and they would be no balled. The dust raised by the dragging foot and the distance between the bowling hand and the dragging foot of some six or seven feet made it difficult for umpires to make the correct decision. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease[...] It should have been called as a no ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy to see in a slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire and impossible for the bowler.|$|E

2500|$|The First Cortina War {{began on}} September 28, 1859 when Juan Cortina led about seventy-five men into Brownsville {{to punish the}} town marshal for past grievances. After killing between four and six people, {{releasing}} the prisoners from the town jail, and taking whatever arms and ammunition, the Cortinistas fled northwest to Rancho del Carmen, which was owned by Cortina's mother and used as his base for operations north of the river border. On October 12, the sheriff of Cameron County, James Browne, led a posse to the ranch and succeeded in arresting the sixty-year-old Tomas Cabrera, who {{was not only a}} close friend of Cortina but one of his chief lieutenants that had participated in the Brownsville raid. When Cortina found out what had happened to his friend, he issued an ultimatum to the people of Brownsville, threatening that he would [...] "lay the town in ashes" [...] if Cabrera was not released <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> enemies did not surrender to him. The situation quickly escalated from there. The citizens of Brownsville began constructing defenses, including a barricade to block the main road through town. They also formed a twenty-man militia, called the [...] "Brownsville Tigers," [...] which was sent to Rancho del Carmen and hastily defeated by 300 rebels, who captured both of the Tigers' small artillery pieces. Cortina had his men build a forward base for his artillery outside of town and he formed a frontline close enough to Brownsville so that it could be seen by the Americans at the barricade. However, other than a shot from the cannon every morning at 6:00 am, there was no battle at the town itself. Over the next weeks, volunteers flocked to Cortina's camps {{from both sides of the}} border. Among his new recruits were some sixty Mexican criminals, who had broken out of the prison at Ciudad Victoria, and a band of Tampacaus native Americans from near Reynosa.|$|E
2500|$|Neville Chamberlain's European Policy in 1939 {{was based}} upon {{creating}} a [...] "peace front" [...] of alliances linking western and eastern European states {{to serve as a}} [...] "tripwire" [...] meant to deter any act of German aggression. The new [...] "containment" [...] strategy adopted in March 1939 comprised giving firm warnings to Berlin, increasing the pace of British rearmament and attempting to form an interlocking network of alliances that would block German aggression anywhere in Europe by creating such a formidable deterrence to aggression that Hitler could not rationally choose that option. Underlying the basis of the [...] "containment" [...] of Germany were the so-called [...] "X documents" [...] provided by Carl Friedrich Goerdeler {{over the course of the}} winter of 1938–39. They suggested that the German economy, under the strain of massive military spending, was on the verge of collapse, and led British policy-makers to the conclusion that if Hitler could be deterred from war <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> regime was [...] "contained" [...] long enough, the German economy would collapse, and with it, presumably the Nazi regime. At the same time, British policy-makers were afraid that if Hitler were [...] "contained" [...] and faced with a collapsing economy, he would commit a desperate [...] "mad dog act" [...] of aggression as a way of lashing out. Hence, emphasis was put on pressuring the Poles to allow the return of Danzig to Germany as a way of resolving the crisis peacefully by allowing Hitler to back down without losing face. As part of a dual strategy to avoid war via deterrence and appeasement of Germany, British leaders warned that they would go to war if Germany attacked Poland, but at the same time, they tried to avoid war by holding unofficial talks with would-be peacemakers such as the British newspaper proprietor Lord Kemsley, the Swedish businessman Axel Wenner-Gren and another Swedish businessmen Birger Dahlerus, who attempted to work out the basis for a peaceful return of Danzig.|$|E
