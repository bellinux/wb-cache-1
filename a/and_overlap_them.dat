40|$|The Ion Laser InterAction Setup (ILIAS) {{project at}} the University of Vienna aims at the {{exploration}} of negative ion beam filtering by selective laser photodetachment for applications in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). A gas-filled radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) is used to decelerate and cool negative atomic and molecular ion beams with intensities of up to several hundred nA, <b>and</b> <b>overlap</b> <b>them</b> collinearly with a continuous wave (cw) laser beam. Ion-laser interaction times ranging from 500 μs to several ms allow for highly efficient, selective photodetachment depletion of disturbing ion species within these beams. The elemental selectivity of this technique {{is based on the}} differences in electron affinities, and therefore does not depend on relative differences in atomic numbers. It may therefore provide sufficient isobar suppression for new trace isotopes, which are not accessible with existing AMS techniques. The ILIAS RFQ cooler was characterized at a purpose-built test bench with respect to ion beam transmission, ion cooling capabilities and ion residence times as a function of injected ion current to assess its suitability for future AMS use. $A ^{ 63 }Cu−$ test beam of 600 nA was photodetached with more than 99. 999 % efficiency with a 532 nm laser at 10. 8 W power. At the same time, ions of interest having electron affinities higher than the photon energy passed the cooler unaffected. Total ion losses were thus found to be below 50 % of the sputter source output. Finally, first photodetachment experiments in connection with $^{ 26 }Al$ detection demonstrated selective isobar suppression of MgO− vs. AlO− by more than 4 orders of magnitude. Currently, the RFQ cooler is moved to a new injector beamline at the Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator (VERA) for first applications of this novel technique at a state-of-the-art AMS facility...|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of tablet is often overlooked. A simple compressed mass of active and inactive ingredients hides the complex relationship between achieving the desired drug potency, the tablet {{strength and the}} tablet dissolution. The resulting tablet properties, particularly the tablet strength, are driven by the wet granulation process, an up-stream particle size enlargement process. Studies {{on the influence of}} the wet granulation process on the tablet properties show that there is still confusion over the influence of the wet granulation on the final tablet strength {{due to the lack of}} investigation in the direct impact between wet granulation and tabletting, which paves the path for the objective of this thesis. The influence of the wet granulation process on the final tablet strength was investigated by conducting wet granulation case studies looking at the effects of the liquid level, wet massing time, impeller speed and binder flow rate on a standard formulation of 1 : 1 lactose and microcrystalline cellulose granulated with polyvinyl pyrrolidine polymer in various solutions. A model called the “Unified Compaction Curve” was adopted from the dry roller compaction process and applied to the wet granulation case studies to see the feasibility of the model and understand how the model bridges the relationship between the wet granulation operating conditions and the final tablet strength. To understand this, granules from selected granulation batches were analysed to determine the granule properties including the circularity factor, surface roughness and granule porosity. The effect of the wet massing process, presence of moisture, liquid binder acidity and the presence of hydrogen-bonding in the granule liquid bridges on the microcrystalline cellulose properties was also investigated. The Unified Compaction Curve model was also extended to investigate the effect of the granulator scale on the final tablet strength to explore the possibility of a new up-scale guideline. The results demonstrate that the wet granulation process can have a direct effect on the subsequent tablet strength. As the liquid level, wet massing time and impeller speed increases, the tablet strength decreases from a maximum tablet hardness of approximately 45 kp (from direct compaction) to lowest tablet hardness of 23. 5 kp after 10 minutes of wet massing time. Therefore there is a “loss of compactability” when the formulation is exposed to processing conditions in wet granulation and even in dry roller compaction (Kochhar et al., 1995; Bultmann, 2002; Freitag and Kleinebudde, 2003; Shi et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2011). The loss of compactability in the formulation by the processing compaction forces sets up the fundamental conditions for the Unified Compaction Curve model to be applied. The Unified Compaction Curve model was found to be a feasible model for the wet granulation process in which the model was able to translate the wet granulation compaction curves for various liquid levels, wet massing times, impeller speeds and binder flow rates <b>and</b> <b>overlap</b> <b>them</b> onto the master direction compaction curve, which allows the prediction of the resulting tablet strength. The Unified Compaction Curve is able to quantify the amount of compaction pressure exerted on the granules during wet granulation through the “effective wet granulation compaction pressure”, PWGC. When the PWGC is coupled with the cumulative number of impeller revolutions, the liquid level, wet massing time, impeller speed and binder flow-rate wet granulation data all coincide onto a first-order exponential curve. This makes the Unified Compaction Curve a potentially powerful tool in visually seeing the magnitude of deterioration in the tablet strength by the wet granulation process, which allows the prediction of the final tablet strength. The deterioration in the tablet strength with increasing wet granulation processing time is attributed to the decrease in the granule surface and rounding of the granule structure. This was evident by the increase in the circularity factor with increasing number of impeller revolutions and SEM images. The granulator impeller consolidates the granules, consequently destroying the granule surface roughness and decreases the granule porosity. If the granule porosity is seen as a function of the cumulative number of impeller revolutions, it can be seen that the relationship is the inverse relationship of the PWGC and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. This demonstrates that the granule porosity is one of the main driving factors for the deterioration of the tablet strength with increasing residence time in the granulator. The transition of the granule morphology and porosity during wet granulation can be attributed to the irreversible plastic deformation of microcrystalline cellulose particles, which wrap and encase the lactose particles during the consolidation and densification of the granules during the wet granulation process. This destroys the mechanical inter-locking ability of the granules during the tabletting process, hence leading to the “loss of compactability” and reduction in the final tablet strength. However, the Unified Compaction Curve model will only be valid for granulation formulations comprising at least 30 % liquid level and with at least 50 % microcrystalline cellulose in the formulation used in this study, to effectively translate the kinetic forces from the impeller into compaction forces for significant deformation to occur. This was evident in granulation case studies where a liquid level less than 30 % leads to the compaction data not conforming to the Unified Compaction Curve model. A recent study into the Unified Compaction Curve model found that a formulation comprising of 49 % of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel Ph- 101) was not successful for the model to be valid (Dave and Dudhat, 2013). Investigations into the presence or absence of intra-granular hydrogen bonding in the granule liquid bridges can influence the final tablet. When hydrogen bonding is present (by using water-based liquid binder) between the granules, the granule strength increases which in turn compromises the table strength. The inverse trend was found for the absence of hydrogen-bonding (by using an ethanol-based liquid binder). Therefore strength of the liquid bridges can play a part in controlling the final tablet strength. The exploration of the effect of the liquid binder on the microcrystalline cellulose properties revealed that microcrystalline cellulose swells upon exposure to liquid binder. The swelling of the cellulose would increase the bonding area and confer strength to the tablet. The acidity of the liquid binder appears to influence the crystallite size of microcrystalline cellulose granules. The crystallite size was found to be larger for granulation experiments using a liquid binder with a neutral pH level (such as calcium oxide liquid binders), compared to the crystallite size in granules produced with more acidic liquid binders (such as PVP or hydrochloric acid). The wet massing time did not have any significant effect on the crystalline or amorphous regions of microcrystalline cellulose. The effects of the wet granulator scale was also investigated which revealed that Unified Compaction Curve demonstrates different mixing intensities between the 1 litre and 5 litre granulator bowls in the relationship between the wet granulation compaction pressure (denoted as χ) and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. The compaction pressure per revolution was found to be greater for the 1 L granulator in comparison to the 5 L granulator scale. This formed the basis for the proposal of a new wet granulation scale-up rule which looks at maintaining ‘constant compaction pressure’ during the wet granulation scale-up process. This scale-up rule is a function of the compaction pressure per revolution and the cumulative number of impeller revolutions. The compaction pressure per revolution, χ, is able to compensate for the differences in the granulator bowl geometry and impeller design between the two granulator scales. The proposed rule is anticipated to be a useful tool to help maintain constant granule properties during wet granulation scale-up but also to target the desired tablet. The studies in this thesis will allow a deeper insight into the mechanisms in the relationship between the wet granulation process and the final tablet strength, which would enable the wet granulation to be tailored for optimisation and target tablet specifications, make trouble-shooting easier to carry out and reduce resources for wet granulation case studies. This is of great importance and benefit to the pharmaceutical industry...|$|E

To quantify the vitreoretinal distance, the basic applications of SD-OCT (Spectralis HRA+OCT Heidelberg Engineering) were modified.

40|$|Work {{efficiency}} cannot guarantee utilization maximization {{due to its}} {{susceptibility to}} biases toward either deployed processors P or execution time T, resulting in an imbalanced work distribution. To enhance the overall parallelization effectiveness, balancing work consisting of both computation and communication is critical to equitably optimize both P and T and therefore satisfy the needs of both the user and the resource manager. A "BUCH" measure is introduced to include P-T balancing, maximizing utilization of computations, and communication hiding as important components of truly effective parallelization. PRAM reduction, flawed by the imbalance of O(lg n) for T and O(n/(lg n)) for P, is clearly biased towards minimizing T {{at the expense of}} P and it also completely ignores communication. A new reduction technique called "BUCH-R" conforming to BUCH measure requirements is developed to produce effective schedules, assuming communication costs are bounded by the uniform computation cost. BUCH-R balances work distribution to achieve O(√n) for both P and T. By minimizing communications <b>and</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>them</b> with computations, BUCH-R completely hides communication to eliminate all delays.

Consequently, the validation of truly effective balanced parallel reduction achieving an appropriate compromise between user and resource manager needs via BUCH-R is complete.

40|$|This paper investigates {{comparative}} advantage and its development across selected Asian, American and European countries between 1996 and 2002. In doing so, we calculate the Balassa index of revealed {{comparative advantage}} using industry data at the HS 4 -digit level. The {{major part of the}} analysis concentrates on the factor intensities of the sample countries 2 ̆ 019 comparative advantage <b>and</b> the <b>overlap</b> between <b>them</b> in the Internal Market. The paper shows that there is clearly some convergence in terms of the factor content of comparative advantage between Asian countries, the new member states and the EU 15. The EU 2 ̆ 019 s comparative advantage has recently moved towards intensive use of both human and physical capital...|$|R
5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed almost entirely by Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems <b>and</b> <b>overlapping</b> shields make <b>them</b> ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} learn more about the {{different}} approaches to managing large-scale marine areas, their comparative merits, and the synergies <b>and</b> <b>overlaps</b> between <b>them,</b> Conservation International (CI) commissioned this independent analysis of several widely applied models. Since 2004, CI, together with a multitude of partners, has been developing the Seascapes model to manage large, multiple-use marine areas in which government authorities, private organizations, and other stakeholders cooperate to conserve the diversity and abundance of marine life and to promote human well-being. The definition of the Seascapes approach and the identification of the essential elements of a functioning Seascape were built from the ground up, informed by the extensive field experience of numerous marine management practitioners. Although the report was commissioned by CI, the views expressed in this report are those of the authors; they were charged with providing a critical examination of all the assessed approaches, including the Seascapes approach. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This will help us [...] and, we hope, other readers [...] to identify ways to work together to achieve even greater results through synergistic efforts...|$|R
40|$|We {{documented}} trackways of free-living Crocodylus acutus on beaches at {{the mouths}} of Tamarindo and Ventanas estuaries, Costa Rica. Our crocodiles had estimated total lengths of 1 – 3 meters or more. Manus prints have five digits, with digits I–III bearing claw marks. Pes prints have four digits, with claw marks on digits I–III. The pes is plantigrade. Claws generally dig into the substrate. Apart from claw marks, digit I and the heel of the pes are usually the most deeply impressed parts of footprints. Trackways are wide-gauge. Pes prints are usually positioned just behind ipsilateral manus prints of the same set <b>and</b> may <b>overlap</b> <b>them.</b> Manus <b>and</b> pes prints angle slightly outward {{with respect to the}} crocodile 2 ̆ 7 s direction of movement. Claw-bearing digits of both the manus and pes may create curved, concave-toward-the-midline drag marks as the autopodium is protracted. The tail mark varies in depth and clarity, and in shape from nearly linear to markedly sinuous. Sometimes the tail mark hugs the trackway midline, but sometimes it is closer to, or even cuts across, prints of one side. American crocodile footprints and trackways are similar to those observed in other extant crocodylian species, indicating substantial trackway conservatism across the group...|$|R
40|$|Clusters of Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMP) {{are more}} commonplace {{than ever in}} {{achieving}} highperformance. Scientific applications running on clusters employ collective communications extensively. Using shared memory communication among colocated processes on SMP nodes as well as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) operations for internode communication <b>and</b> trying to <b>overlap</b> <b>them</b> is a proven technique in boosting the performance of collective operations. The effect is much more pronounced when efficient multi-port collectives on multi-rail networks are devised and implemented. In this work, we design and implement multi-port RDMA-based and SMP-aware all-gather algorithms with message striping over multi-rail QsNet II directly at the Elan level. We compare our algorithms against RDMA-only traditional algorithms and the native elan_gather(). Our performance {{results indicate that the}} proposed SMP-aware Bruck all-gather gains an improvement of up to 1. 96 for 4 KB messages over the native elan_gather(). Meanwhile, the Direct algorithm achieves up to 1. 49 improvement for 32 KB messages. 1...|$|R
