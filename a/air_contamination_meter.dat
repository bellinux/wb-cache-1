40|$|Summary: The {{standard}} {{index of}} microbial <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> (IMA) for {{the measurement of}} microbial <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> in environments at risk is described. The method quantifies the microbial flow {{directly related to the}} contamination of surfaces coming from microbes that reach critical points by falling on to them. The index of microbial <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> is based on the count of the microbial fallout on to Petri dishes left open to the air according to the 1 / 1 / 1 scheme (for 1 h, 1 m from the floor, at least 1 m away from walls or any obstacle). Classes of contamination and maximum acceptable levels have been established. The index of microbial <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> has been tested in many different places: in hospitals, in food indus-tries, in art galleries, aboard the MIR space station and also in the open air. It {{has proved to be a}} reliable and useful tool for monitoring the microbial surface contamination settling from the air in any environment...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{aerosols}} {{are generated}} during dental treatments and may represent {{an important source}} of infection. This study was designed to quantify bacterial <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> during dental treatments in both a closed dental operatory and a multichair dental clinic. Air was sampled by using a slit type of biological air sampler. Following air sampling, blood-supplemented Trypticase soy agar plates were incubated at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 7 days. The maximum levels of <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> in the closed dental operatory were observed while dental treatments were being performed (four trials; 216 +/- 75 CFU/m 3 for ultrasonic scaling treatments and 75 +/- 22 CFU/m 3 for operative treatments). At 2 h after completion of the treatments, the bacterial counts were about the same as the pretreatment levels (12 to 14 CFU/m 3). In {{the second part of the}} study, a multichair dental clinic was divided into four areas, and <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> was monitored at each site. Three sites were located in active dental treatment areas, whereas no dental treatments were performed within an 11 -m radius of the fourth site. At 3 h after the beginning of dental treatments, the highest bacterial counts were obtained in the three active dental treatment areas (76 to 114 CFU/m 3). However, there was noticeable contamination in the inactive dental treatment area (42 CFU/m 3). Thus, bacterial aerosols were able to spread into areas where there was no dental activity. My data show that dental treatments significantly increased the levels of bacterial <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> in both a closed dental operatory and a multichair dental clinic.

Legionella <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> was investigated in the bathrooms of 11 HF by active sampling (Surface Air System and Coriolis®) and passive sampling using settling plates. During the 8 -hour sampling, hot tap water was sampled three times. All air samples were evaluated using culture-based methods, whereas liquid samples collected using the Coriolis® were also analyzed by real-time PCR.

A total of 14 hospitals and 28 operating theatres were included in the study. During each operation, microbial <b>air</b> <b>contamination</b> was evaluated by means of passive and active samplings. The number of people and the number of door openings were also recorded. Surgical site infection surveillance was conducted according to the HELICS protocol. The preliminary results show that low microbial contamination is associated with a lower risk of surgical site infection, although no significant protective effect is evident. Despite the economic cost of equipping an operating theatre with a unidirectional air flow system, air microbial values in such theatres were often higher than expected, suggesting that such theatres were badly managed. Further studies on this controversial subject are thus needed as well as training interventions aimed at improving the behaviour of operators...|$|R
