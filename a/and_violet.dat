5|$|Gallium {{arsenide}} {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of optoelectronic infrared devices. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) is used in high-power infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are used in blue <b>and</b> <b>violet</b> optoelectronic devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, gallium nitride 405nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray Disc compact data disc drives.|$|E
5|$|Gallium is {{predominantly}} used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, {{is used in}} microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconductive gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue <b>and</b> <b>violet</b> light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers. Gallium is also used {{in the production of}} artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.|$|E

In the Sherpa language of Nepal the fungus is known as Eeshyamo ("mother-in-law"), as its imposing fruit body is reminiscent of a mother-in-law, who has a dominant role in the Sherpa family.|$|E

5000|$|Flowers were {{traditional}} {{symbols of}} rejuvenation, rebirth, and memory, {{with the red}} and purple of roses <b>and</b> <b>violets</b> felt to evoke the color of blood {{as a form of}} propitiation. Their blooming period framed the season of spring, with roses the last of the flowers to bloom <b>and</b> <b>violets</b> the earliest. As part of both festive and funerary banquets, roses adorned [...] "a strange repast ... of life and death together, considered as two aspects of the same endless, unknown process." [...] In some areas of the Empire, the Rosalia was assimilated to floral elements of spring festivals for Dionysus, Adonis and others, but rose-adornment as a practice was not strictly tied to the cultivation of particular deities, and thus lent itself to Jewish and Christian commemoration. Early Christian writers transferred the imagery of garlands and crowns of roses <b>and</b> <b>violets</b> to the cult of the saints.|$|R

5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Though the roles of the leading players are unknown, it is likely that numerous other character roles and persons appeared in the film. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. The cast includes both leading ladies of the company, Anna Rosemond <b>and</b> <b>Violet</b> Heming. The other known credit, Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} cast credits are for Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane, William Russell <b>and</b> <b>Violet</b> Heming.

The list included G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Bowers lists this as the first known credit of William Russell, formerly of the Biograph Company. Russell would {{become one of the most}} important actors of the company until his final departure in 1913. It is not the earliest known appearance by Russell, as he is shown in a film still of A Thanksgiving Surprise.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the two {{scenarios}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan.

5000|$|Bloodless {{sacrifice}} {{to the dead}} could include rose garlands <b>and</b> <b>violets</b> as well as libations of wine, and Latin purpureus expressed the red-to-purple color range of roses <b>and</b> <b>violets</b> particularly as flowers of death. In ancient etymology, purpureus was thought related to Greek porphyreos {{in the sense of}} suffusing the skin with purple blood in bruising or wounding. The Augustan epic poet Vergil uses the metaphor of a purple flower to describe the premature, bloody deaths of young men in battle: the death of Pallas evokes both the <b>violet</b> of Attis <b>and</b> the hyacinth generated from the dying blood of Apollo's beloved Hyacinthus. Claudian writes of the [...] "bloody splendor" [...] of roses in the meadow from which Proserpina will be abducted to the underworld, with hyacinths <b>and</b> <b>violets</b> contributing to the lush flora. Roses and the ominous presence of thorns may intimate bloodshed and mortality even in the discourse of love.|$|R
5000|$|In color theory, a [...] "purple" [...] {{is defined}} as any non-{{spectral}} color between <b>violet</b> <b>and</b> red (excluding <b>violet</b> <b>and</b> red themselves). The spectral colors <b>violet</b> <b>and</b> indigo are not purples according to color theory, but they are purples according to common English usage since they are between red and blue.|$|R
5|$|The trains {{operate at}} a {{frequency}} {{of one to}} two minutes to five to ten minutes between 05:00 and 00:00, depending upon the peak and off-peak hours. Trains operating within the network typically travel at speed up to , and stop for about 20 seconds at each station. Automated station announcements are recorded in Hindi and English. Many stations have services such as ATMs, food outlets, cafés, convenience stores and mobile recharge. Eating, drinking, smoking and chewing of gum are prohibited in the entire system. The Metro also has a sophisticated fire alarm system for advance warning in emergencies, and fire retardant material is used in trains {{as well as on}} the premises of stations. Navigation information is available on Google Transit. Since October 2010, the first coach of every train is reserved for women. However, last coaches are also reserved when the train changes tracks at the terminal stations in the Red, Green <b>and</b> <b>Violet</b> Lines. To make travelling by metro a smoother experience, Delhi Metro has launched its own official app for smartphone users,(iPhone and Android) that will provide information on various facilities like nearest metro station, fare, parking availability, tourist spots near metro stations, security and emergency helpline numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan.
