Honey, I’m so happy and so in a daze. Golly, (that word again) but golly anyway! That seems to express so much. Anyone who tries to utter anything intelligent to me will be wasting their time. Honestly, I’m just walking around in a complete fog. After I left you today there wasn’t a train until five twenty five and I just sat in Grand Central looking at a wall 2 ̆ 6 not even knowing what I was doing. Can you imagine what we’ll be like after we’re married. We’ll probably drive people nuts. I’ll just sit and stare at you. Everyone will have to just ignore us because I probably won’t even realize they’re around. Oh, Steve must think I’m crazy. I was telling him how everything was all wrong between us (this was after that little talk we [or you] had {{in the place where}} we stopped to eat). Now when he hears about what happened after we left him, and he doesn’t know what you had told me before, he’s going to wonder. Have you told anyone yet? What happened to Tom this weekend? Was his willpower strong? Honey, you didn’t have a chance to say much. About getting married, I mean. Is it <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> if we have a double ring ceremony? I would like that, but would you? It doesn’t seem real to me. Is it really happening? Are you sure you mean it? There are so many things to get settled but I never can think of them when I’m with you. Mother is going to write you a letter sometime. She’s really crazy about you but so am I. Don’t know where this paper ever came from but there’s a whole box of it. Please write soon, darling. I miss you already. As soon as you got on that train I got so lonesome. What {{are we going to do}} next weekend? Anything special? We have to have a real long talk, o. k. ? We really should start out earlier and then maybe the time wouldn’t go so fast. I love you, honey—Lots of love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins] December 27, 1944 Wednesday, 8 : 15 p. m. Sweetheart darling, Received an {{air mail}} letter from you dated 12 / 10 and three V-Mails dated 12 / 8, 12 / 10 and 12 / 14. I’m {{certainly}} not complaining! However, I feel badly that you went several days without mail from me! I know how very terrible that feels, having experienced it myself! Please do not blame me as I really have been writing, at least, once a day and sometimes even twice and three times! It really is the fault of Uncle Sam’s Postal System, but then, they usually do pretty good by us! I received a birthday card from Alice P today and two lovely white handmade hankerchiefs [sic]. It really was very sweet of her to remember. She also wrote me a few lines to tell me she got engaged Dec. 17 th, but she didn’t mention the fellow’s name. I take it that he is some Dayton boy! The Postal Dept. also sent me back some more mail that I had written to Tommy Kentes. The latest ones bears [sic] this stamp—“Missing from the 350 th Sq. since Oct. 3 rd. ” It certainly wasn’t pleasant news and made me feel very, very blue! My darling, I think “Doc” and Winnie have something very tangible to show for their 2 ½ years of married life! When you get back, however, we’ll show them—huh? Sometimes I’m sorry we didn’t go ahead and have a child, but sometimes, I think it is better that we didn’t. Well, that goes to show my usual indecesion [sic] on the subject! If {{we would have had}} a child, we would have loved it and probably thought that that {{was the best thing that}} could have happened to us; but since we didn’t I believe, in a way, that we rationalize and say, “Well, guess it’s bet that we didn’t. ” Glad you checked up on our bonds and my allotment. I was sure I was suppose[d] to receive $ 150 for Oct., so glad you are making your office check on it! Finally, we got our $ 50 bond for Oct. We were suppose[d] to skip the month of Sept. all together [sic]. Is that correct? I haven’t seen Lil Goldberg at all, and really haven’t got the necessary incentive to call her. She is a good kid, but I think she has already “gone to pot!” I really have been rather anxious about you since the Germans started going to town! Take care of yourself, Bubsie darling! I do hope that everything is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you!</b> Please Baby, give them “hell,” but come home safe and sound to me! I adore you so very much, my dearest one! I seem to just ache for you! If only you could put your arms around me and hold me very close—you are so virile! Gosh darling, just writing to you makes the shivers run up and down my back and makes me get all hot under the collar. You do things to me! I love you like I’ve never loved before—you are everything to me! Today was a miserable day at work since everything went wrong! Housekeeper and asst. teacher were ill; coal wasn’t delivered—ah nuts! Ukie came down, and finally my other asst. felt well enough to come in at 3 p. m. so I had a staff meeting then while Uk stayed with the children! Thank goodness that I got some of the things off my mind to my staff! Fred came around about 5 p. m. and gave me my happy birthday kiss. Honestly, the kid is adorable. I really can see why Ukie goes for him and vice versa. You should see those kids try to crowd a lifetime into 10 days. Honestly, they hardly sleep—out until 4 or 5, and then up at 9 to do or go some place else! Ukie is beginning to look like a wreck, but I know how they feel about wanting to make the most out of every minute he is here! Fred keeps saying that he’ll have plenty of time to sleep when he gets back to camp. Fred got a big kick out of seeing the school and the children—there were 4 there at 5 p. m. It seems he is crazy about children and he seems to know how to act with them! Gee honey, I sure hope we can celebrate our 3 rd anniversary together. Take it easy, and remember that I love you and always will. You are my everything! More love, Edith [Transcription ends...|$|E

[Transcription begins]:Monday Dearest Judson, Honey, I {{miss you}} so. Just woke {{up a few}} seconds ago and I’m still half asleep. Golly, honey, I hope that you got some sleep last night because you really seemed tired. Please try {{to get as much}} sleep this week as you can so that you won’t get too tired when we stay out late during Christmas. Oh, honey, I just thought of {{something}} last night on the train. Maybe Ace could use his family’s car a few times while he’s home. That would help us because I’m almost positive, honey, that daddy won’t let you use our car. He’d drive us almost anyplace but he’s funny about lending it to anyone. He’s often said he never would even to his best friend. Darling, Christmas is just a week from today. It just doesn’t seem possible that a week from today will really be Christmas. Well, hon, I’ve just about decided to wait until after Christmas before I go 2 ̆ 6 look for a job. I’ll sleep a lot, it says here, and do {{a lot of the things}} I’ve been putting off for so long like addressing my Christmas cards. That I’ll have to do today. Then tomorrow I’ll either go Christmas shopping or fix my clothes. Well, anyhow, I’ve got enough to keep me busy for quite a while so looks as though I’ll wait until after Christmas. Golly, honey, I love you so. Every time I see you I fall in love with you all over again and always twice as much as before. Darling, we really should wait until March I know that but, honestly, it seems so silly to waste all that time. We could be together for the next two months instead of not seeing each other at all. Honey, Ill miss you so. Don’t you think that I’ll be able to come down just once to see you? Darling, two months and a couple of weeks really doesn’t seem long but when I think of not seeing you for that length of time it seems like a few thousand years. It won’t be so bad for you because you’ll be at a new field and be busy all the time but I’ll be so lonesome. Guess that I’ll be pretty busy, too. Buying clothes and stuff. It just doesn’t seem as though March would ever get here. Do you get your wings on the eleventh or the fiftheenth (now that isn’t right—how do you spell 15 th?) Anyway when will you get them. Will it be on a weekday or weekend. It won’t make any difference to me because I’ll be able to come down at any time but if it’s on the weekend then maybe Woody can come too. Golly, hon, I hope that Maxwell Field comes through with your orders 2 ̆ 6 you get a delay. Before I forget, honey, ask Steve if he’d like to come to dinner on Sunday. After all if he isn’t going home, he certainly wouldn’t like to eat on the post or someplace like that. He probably won’t have too sharp a time but there will be quite a crowd 2 ̆ 6 we’re having turkey so tell him to be sure 2 ̆ 6 come if he’d like to. Woody won’t be here but there’ll be enough of your family here to keep him occupied. I hate to think of anyone spending Christmas away from their family 2 ̆ 6 friends. I’m so glad you’re going to be home darling. But to get back to Steve, be sure 2 ̆ 6 ask him to come down because my family would love to have him for dinner. Gee, honey, this weekend went to awfully fast. I love you so. It was awful to not be able to see you after ten. The Army certainly isn’t very thoughtful about things like that. Honey, are they going to let you come home Friday night? I sure hope so. Tell me as soon as you get the rest of your hours in. You have 27 : 35 now haven’t you? How did Steve get his in before you did? Can’t understand it—well, he’ll have to watch wheels. That sounds like a thrilling job. Honey do you realize that this time you get off Christmas will be the next to the last time we’ll be together before we’re married. Honey, let’s get married on the day you get home, huh? Let’s not waste any more time. That will be long enough. Is that <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> honey? Can you speak to your C. O. out there 2 ̆ 6 tell him that you’re getting married 2 ̆ 6 maybe he could tell you the date he’d let you come home so that we could have announcements or invitations made up. It takes quite a while to have them printed, I think but that’s a minor detail—we can always call people. Gee, honey, I miss you so. Please try to get a lot of sleep this week, honey. You were really tired yesterday. I love you so. You’re absolutely the most wonderful person in the world. Golly, hon, every once in a while I stop 2 ̆ 6 think how lucky I am. Besides being wonderful, you’re so sweet and thoughtful and handsome and I love you. They’re playing “Together” and just finished “Always. ” I love you so. I wonder what that waiter meant when he said we looked married. All four of us. Was that good or bad. It’s pretty bad if we look married already—or is it good? Anyway how will we look after we are married? That reminds me you’re not answering my questions again. Won’t it be wonderful when we’re married and can stop writing letters. I don’t mind writing them but it will be so nice when we’re together. Honey, what’s all this about your having to live for 90 days on the post? I wasn’t exactly paying attention to what whoever said it said but can I live on the post with you? You’ll have to teach me how to introduce officers to each other 2 ̆ 6 all that sort of stuff because I don’t know anything about military stuff. When you write Don tell him thanks for his best wishes 2 ̆ 6 stuff. Tell him too to take care of himself and wish him a very Merry Christmas 2 ̆ 6 Happy New Year. I’d like to read that letter he wrote you but knowing how boys write I guess I wouldn’t like to exactly. Did you write Dud Nash yet? If you haven’t, hon, try to soon because he’d probably like to hear about it from you. Golly, it’s almost eleven. Time sure went fast this morning. I woke up pretty early and was lying in bed thinking about you. I love you so. Honey, maybe later today I’ll write you again and send a note to Ruth. I have to thank her for the two dollars. I’ll send it to her in the next letter I write you. That will probably be tonight [...] -and you can give it to Steve to give to her or you can give it to her yourself. I love you so, my darling. It’s awful to be away from you. Honey, there’s only one reason why I won’t try to talk you into getting married now instead of March and that’s because of your flying. Well, more or less, but anyway, you have to work so hard in cadets and I don’t think it would be fair if you were married. That isn’t exactly what I mean but the general idea is that—oh I can’t explain it but you probably know what I mean—Don’t you? This turned out to be a nice short book-length letter. Golly, honey, I love you so. Honey, there was something you said about being jealous that I wanted to ask you about. Honey, I can’t remember exactly what it was you said (they’re playing “There Goes That Song Again[“]—That reminds me of you). Something about being jealous of Bill. I know you asked me not to say anything about him again but I want to tell you that you shouldn’t be jealous of him. You have all my love. I think you sorta dislike him from the things I’ve said. I feel badly about that because he really is a nice kid 2 ̆ 6 I’ve only told you everything bad about him 2 ̆ 6 it’s not fair exactly to him. I feel responsible for giving you the wrong impression of him. I’ll tell you what I mean when I see you. I never can explain what I mean in a letter. Anyway, just remember that you’re the only one I’ve ever loved or ever will, honey. Well, I’d better get up 2 ̆ 6 get started or I’ll be writing to you all day—nice thought but anyway I love you. Oh, I knew there was something I wanted to tell you. Remember last night Steve yelled something about don’t forget the potatoe [sic] chips 2 ̆ 6 you said they were in my bag 2 ̆ 6 Steve said he had them. At the time I didn’t realize what was happening. Probably because I was too busy kissing you goodbye. Well, Woody hands me this bag when we get in the taxi (by the way we caught the ferry 2 ̆ 6 train) that Steve had given her. I knew right away that it wasn’t the potatoe [sic] chips because they weren’t in a paper bag (If you’re walking tours now, this is the reason). It was someone’s lunch. There was a sandwich 2 ̆ 6 two fruit cakes in it. That was probably that Lt’s lunch. We sat there and ate it between laughing fits. Well, I hope that it wasn’t important. We were laughing all the way to the ferry about how you two would probably be walking tours for the rest of your lives. Whoever should have had it must have been pretty disappointed. It was very good except Woody ate it too fast 2 ̆ 6 felt sick all the way home. Did you ever hear “I’m a little on the Lonely Side tonight?” Gee, I love you so. Haven’t any more paper so I’ll have to stop. I’ll write more tonight. I love you so. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
