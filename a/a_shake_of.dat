5|$|In {{this highly}} sexualized {{environment}} a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened {{areas of the}} establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, caf√© areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. <b>A</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head, or pushing away the other's hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.|$|E

2500|$|The umpire's {{response}} is either {{to raise his}} index finger above his head {{to indicate that the}} batsman is out, or to clearly say [...] "not out", which is usually accompanied with <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> the head. (See [...] ). The 'out' signal is the only signal that if indicated by the striker's end umpire, does not require confirmation by the bowler's end umpire.|$|E
2500|$|Calling {{the game}} {{refers to the}} act of {{catchers}} to decide the type of pitch delivered to home plate. Catchers comprise {{a high percentage of}} baseball managers. [...] 15 of 30 Major League Baseball managers were former catchers. Because the catcher is considered a captain on the field (and some, such as Thurman Munson and Jason Varitek were in fact team captains), he is often in charge of planning defensive plays. The catcher will give signs to the pitcher for what pitch is to be thrown. The majority of the time it is done through a number system. Each number will represent a different pitch, and then the pitcher can either agree or disagree with <b>a</b> <b>shake</b> <b>of</b> his or her head. These signals get more complicated when a runner is on second base, because the runner's vantage point when he takes his lead gives him a direct view of the catcher's hand and a simple signal can be relayed by the runner to the batter. Signals are not always done by the number system. Varitek was known for giving signals by touching certain parts of his chest protector.|$|E
