5000|$|The Deacy Amp is an {{electric}} guitar amplifier created in 1972 by Queen's bass guitarist John Deacon. Using the <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> from a Supersonic PR80 portable radio {{found in a}} skip, it was fitted into a speaker cabinet and powered by a 9-volt battery. The amplifier had no volume or tone controls {{for most of its}} history and was never broken or repaired. It was used along with Brian May's Red Special electric guitar and treble-booster to produce sounds reminiscent of various orchestral instruments, such as violin, cello, trombone, clarinet, or even vocals, starting from the songs [...] "Procession" [...] and [...] "The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke" [...] from the 1974 album Queen II.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} a six degree of freedom micropositioning stage. It is a part of a research project on haptic tele?operation, applied to micromanipulation, at the TU Delft. The micropositioning stage will be used as the fine range positioning stage of a slave robot, in a haptic tele?operated control scheme. The technology used to build the stage is magnetic levitation. The stage has a movement range of 200 x 200 x 200 ?m and rotations of about ± 1 °. The stage MIM (Minimum Incremental Motion) is designed to be 40 – 100 nm. The focus of this thesis is mainly on the modelling and design of the system and its components, {{the design of a}}ctuator and sensor electronics, and the mechanical design of the stage. Control aspects have been taken into account since the stage is open?loop unstable, but do not constitute a main topic. The position sensors used in the micropositioning stage are infrared reflective sensors. These affordable sensors have previously been implemented in various projects at the TU Delft. Existing optical sensor readout electronics have been investigated; an improved version has been developed with lower noise levels. The achieved sensor noise is 14 – 28 nm, peak?to?peak over a measurement range of 200 ?m. A three?channel readout circuit board has been designed and tested. It can be used in other future applications as well as the current project. The actuators are a novel Lorentz type actuator. They consist of two fixed coils and a permanent magnet attached to the moving mass. One actuator can generate two independent force components, namely a vertical force and a horizontal force. The actuator characteristics have been extensively investigated using FEM modelling. These characteristics are position dependent, and exhibit crosstalk and parasitic forces. The overall system modelling and actuator FEM modelling has shown that these effects are manageable over the motion and force ranges of the stage. The actuator can generate an 80 mN vertical force and a 10 mN horizontal force, continuously. A threechannel current <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> has been designed and tested. It is used to drive the Lorentz actuators, but can also be used in other future applications. Simulation diagrams have been developed of the mechanical system and its controller. The mechanical system is essentially a rigid free?floating mass that has 6 degrees of freedom. The eigenmodes of this mass have been investigated using FEM based modal analysis. Its eigenfrequencies lie far above the closed?loop system bandwidth, and are therefore not considered further. The control system is implemented as six independent SISO PD?controllers. The closed loop system bandwidth is 100 Hz. Using the system model in a Monte Carlo?type simulation, the effect of manufacturing and assembly tolerances on stage performance have been investigated. The results showed that the stage can be built with standard manufacturing technology, provided that extra care is taken during assembly of the actuators to reduce misalignment of the actuator components. An alignment tool has been developed for this purpose. A mechanical design has been made of the micropositioning stage. In this design the conclusions of the modelling phase and sensor and actuator characterisation have been taken into account. Fabrication drawings have been made, and all mechanical parts have been manufactured. The fine stage and its associated electronics have been fully assembled; the stage is currently in the test and characterisation phase.

This data acquisition system has two parts: (1) portable anolog seismic recorders and related ``hand-held-testers`` (HHT) and (2) portable digitizing units. During the anolog recording process, ground motion is sensed by a 2 -Hz vertical-component seismometer. The voltage output from the seismometer is split without amplification and sent to three parallel <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> Each <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> <b>amplifiers</b> the seismic signal in three stages and then frequency modulates the signal.

40|$|A low-noise head {{amplifier}} {{has been developed}} for the extra low energy antiproton ring beam trajectory, orbit, and intensity measurement system at CERN. This system is based on 24 double-electrode electrostatic beam position monitors installed around the ring. A {{head amplifier}} is placed close to each beam position monitor to amplify the electrode signals and generate a difference and a sum signal. These signals are sent to the digital acquisition system, about 50 m away from the ring, where they are digitized and further processed. The beam position can be measured by dividing the difference signal by the sum signal while the sum signal gives information relative to the beam intensity. The head amplifier consists of two discrete charge preamplifiers with {{junction field effect transistor}} (JFET) inputs, a sum and a difference stage, and two cable drivers.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop, characterize, and demonstrate novel parametric architectures capable of wideband operation while maintaining high gain and stability. To begin the study, phase-incoherent upconverting parametric amplifiers will be explored by first developing a set of analytical models describing their achievable gain and efficiency. These models will provide a set of design tools to optimize and evaluate prototype <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> The prototype boards will then be used to demonstrate their achievable gain, bandwidth, efficiency, and stability. Further investigation of the analytical models and data collected from the prototype boards will conclude bandwidth and gain limitations and end the investigation into phase-incoherent upconverting parametric amplifiers in lieu of negative-resistance parametric amplifiers. Traditionally, there were two versions of negative-resistance parametric amplifiers available: degenerate and non-degenerate. Both modes of operation are considered single-frequency amplifiers because both the input and output frequencies occur at the source frequency. Degenerate parametric amplifiers offer more power gain than their non-degenerate counterpart and do not require additional circuitry for idler currents. As a result, a phase-coherent degenerate parametric <b>amplifier</b> printed <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> prototype will be built to investigate achievable gain, bandwidth, and stability. Analytical models will be developed to describe the gain and efficiency of phase-coherent degenerate parametric amplifiers. The presence of a negative resistance suggests the possibility of instability under certain operating conditions, therefore, an in-depth stability study of phase-coherent degenerate parametric amplifiers will be performed. The observation of upconversion gain in phase-coherent degenerate parametric amplifiers will spark investigation into a previously unknown parametric architecture: phase-coherent upconverting parametric amplifiers. Using the phase-coherent degenerate parametric amplifier prototype board, stable phase-coherent upconversion with gain will be demonstrated from the source input frequency to its third harmonic. An analytical model describing the large-signal transducer gain of phase-coherent upconverting parametric amplifiers from the first to the third harmonic of the source input will be derived and validated using the prototype board and simulations.

40|$|This project {{explores the}} design of the pre-amp stage of a typical {{electric}} guitar amplifier. It requires knowledge of the operation of operational <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuits</b> and RC circuits. A volume control, bass/treble equalizer, and variable distortion were all implemented in this pre-amp design using analog filters and op-amps. The design was formed after research on the Internet of how to design an analog equalizer and distortion circuitry. These features are very common and useful for amplifying guitars. The circuit was first tested using a Pspice simulation. Next, a function generator, DC power supply and oscilloscope were used to test it on a breadboard.

40|$|This {{research}} {{has examined the}} benefits of using the Robust Symmetrical Number System (RSNS) to resolve ambiguities in phase sampling interferometry. A compact, high resolution direction finding antenna architecture based on the RSNS was developed to demonstrate experimentally the elimination of phase errors using a minimum amount of hardware. Previous work has determined that phase errors in the system will degrade the system performance. Several improvements {{were made to the}} original RSNS prototype antenna to provide enhanced performance. Adding isolators and supplementing the ground plane with copper tape (between the antenna elements), a reduction in the mutual coupling effects was accomplished. Mounting the microwave components on a brass plate also reduced errors contributed by vibrations and temperature. Tailor cutting all semi-rigid coaxial lines also helped reduce the number of connectors required to assemble the microwave circuit, also a source of phase errors. Matching the front-end amplifiers in each amplification stage rather than matching the characteristics of two cascaded amplifiers in each signal line has reduced relative phase errors between channels as well as matching the power outputs of the <b>amplifiers.</b> Two printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> were designed and built for the RSNS signal processor. The printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> provide a decrease in the electrical noise floor over the original design (assembled on breadboards).
