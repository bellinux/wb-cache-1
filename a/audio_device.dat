5|$|HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a {{proprietary}} audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant source device, {{such as a}} display controller, to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital <b>audio</b> <b>device.</b> HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards.|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} USB device may {{consist of}} several logical sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as device functions. A single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (<b>audio</b> <b>device</b> function). This kind of device is called a composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each logical device a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista also {{includes}} {{the ability to use}} custom host-based digital signal processing effects as part of the <b>audio</b> <b>device</b> manufacturer-supplied driver's value-added features. These effects are packaged as user-mode System Effect Audio Processing Objects (sAPOs). These sAPOs are also reusable by third-party software.|$|E

25|$|The HDMI {{interface}} is {{a compact}} audio/video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed/uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant device to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital <b>audio</b> <b>device.</b> It is mainly {{used in the}} consumer area, but increasingly used in professional devices including uncompressed video, often called clean HDMI.|$|E
25|$|Applications {{communicate}} with the audio driver through Sessions, and these Sessions are programmed through the Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI). In general, WASAPI operates in two modes. In exclusive mode (also called DMA mode), unmixed audio streams are rendered directly to the audio adapter and no other application's audio will play and signal processing has no effect. Exclusive mode is useful for applications that demand {{the least amount of}} intermediate processing of the audio data or those that want to output compressed audio data such as Dolby Digital, DTS or WMA Pro over S/PDIF. WASAPI exclusive mode is similar to kernel streaming in function, but no kernel mode programming is required. In shared mode, audio streams are rendered by the application and optionally applied per-stream audio effects known as Local Effects (LFX) (such as per-session volume control). Then the streams are mixed by the global audio engine, where a set of global audio effects (GFX) may be applied. Finally, they're rendered on the <b>audio</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, William O'Neil {{constructed}} {{an electronic}} <b>audio</b> <b>device</b> called [...] "The Spiricom". O'Neil claimed {{the device was}} built to specifications which he received psychically from George Mueller, a scientist who had died six years previously. At a Washington, DC press conference on April 6, 1982, O'Neil stated {{that he was able}} to hold two-way conversations with spirits through the Spiricom device, and provided the design specifications to researchers for free. However, nobody is known to have replicated the results O'Neil claimed using their own Spiricom devices. O'Neil's partner, retired industrialist George Meek, attributed O'Neil's success, and the inability of others to replicate it, to O'Neil's mediumistic abilities forming part of the loop that made the system work.|$|E
2500|$|Smaller earbud type earpieces, which {{plugged into}} the user's ear canal, were first {{developed}} for hearing aids. They became widely used with transistor radios, which commercially appeared in 1954 {{with the introduction of}} the Regency TR-1. The most popular <b>audio</b> <b>device</b> in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere. [...] The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a piezoelectric crystal to produce sound. [...] The 3.5mm radio and phone connector, which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio which was released in 1964. Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the Walkman portable tape player in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|A {{potentiometer}} or pot is a three-terminal resistor with a {{continuously adjustable}} tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider. [...] It {{is called a}} potentiometer {{because it can be}} connected as an adjustable voltage divider to provide a variable potential at the terminal connected to the tapping point. A volume control for an <b>audio</b> <b>device</b> is a common use of a potentiometer. [...] A typical low power potentiometer (see drawing) is constructed of a flat resistance element (B) of carbon composition, metal film, or conductive plastic, with a springy phosphor bronze wiper contact (C) which moves along the surface. [...] An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil. [...] These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.|$|E

40|$|The {{transmission}} of realtime audio data across digital networks {{is subject to}} strict quality of service requirements. These networks {{need to be able}} to guarantee network resources (e. g., bandwidth), ensure timely and deterministic data delivery, and provide time synchronisation mechanisms to ensure successful {{transmission of}} this data. Two open standards-based networking technologies, namely IEEE 1394 and the recently standardised Ethernet AVB, provide distinct methods for achieving these goals. <b>Audio</b> <b>devices</b> that are compatible with IEEE 1394 networks exist, and <b>audio</b> <b>devices</b> that are compatible with Ethernet AVB networks are starting to come onto the market. There is a need for mechanisms to provide compatibility between the <b>audio</b> <b>devices</b> that reside on these disparate networks such that existing IEEE 1394 <b>audio</b> <b>devices</b> are able to communicate with Ethernet AVB <b>audio</b> <b>devices,</b> and vice versa. The <b>audio</b> <b>devices</b> that reside on these networks may be remotely controlled by a diverse set of incompatible command and control protocols. It is desirable to have a common network-neutral method of control over the various parameters of the devices that reside on these networks. As part of this study, two Ethernet AVB systems were developed. One system acts as an Ethernet AVB <b>audio</b> endpoint <b>device</b> and another system acts as an audio gateway between IEEE 1394 and Ethernet AVB networks. These systems, along with existing IEEE 1394 <b>audio</b> <b>devices,</b> were used to demonstrate the ability to transfer audio data between the networking technologies. Each of the devices is remotely controllable via a network neutral command and control protocol, XFN. The IEEE 1394 and Ethernet AVB devices are used to demonstrate the use of the XFN protocol to allow for network neutral connection management to take place between IEEE 1394 and Ethernet AVB networks. User control over these diverse devices is achieved via the use of a graphical patchbay application, which aims to provide a consistent user interface to a diverse range of devices. ...|$|R
