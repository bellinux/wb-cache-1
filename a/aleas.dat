40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} learning programming by novice programmers through a web-based adaptive educational system called <b>ALEA</b> (Adaptive LEArning). <b>ALEA</b> supports learning programming by generating sequences of program examples that serve as exercises for a learner. The sequence is adapted {{to the needs of}} individual learners. At present, <b>ALEA</b> contains more than a hundred Lisp and Prolog program examples. The program examples are presented as specific instances of program schemata which facilitate understanding of basic programming principles. We have been using the program schemata in teaching an introductory course on functional and logic programming for nearly ten years. Until the <b>ALEA</b> system was developed, the program schemata constituted {{an important part of the}} lectures. At present <b>ALEA</b> enables effective acquisition of basic programming skills through usage of program schemata and adapted sequences of program examples. We also discuss our experience in using web-based support for teaching programming...|$|R

[...] Ardai's writing has appeared in mystery magazines such as Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, gaming magazines such as Computer Gaming World and Electronic Games, and anthologies such as Best Mysteries of the Year and The Year's Best Horror Stories. Ardai has also edited numerous short story collections such as The Return of the Black Widowers, Great Tales of Madness and the Macabre, and Futurecrime. His first novel, Little Girl Lost, was published in 2004 and was nominated for both the Edgar Allan Poe Award by the Mystery Writers of America and the Shamus Award by the Private Eye Writers of America; his second, Songs of Innocence, was called [...] "an instant classic" [...] by the Washington Post, selected {{as one of the best}} books of the year by Publishers Weekly, and won the Shamus Award. Both books were written under the alias Richard <b>Aleas</b> and were optioned for the movies by Universal Pictures. Ardai previously received a Shamus nomination for the short story [...] "Nobody Wins" [...] and he received the Edgar Award in 2007 for the short story [...] "The Home Front". In 2015, he received the Ellery Queen Award for his work on Hard Case Crime. Ardai's third novel, Fifty-to-One, was published in November 2008. It was the fiftieth book in the Hard Case Crime series and the first to be published under Ardai's real name. His fourth novel, Hunt Through the Cradle of Fear, is part of a pulp adventure series he created in 2009, describing the globetrotting exploits of a modern-day explorer named Gabriel Hunt. Authorship of all the books in this series were originally credited to Gabriel Hunt himself. In 2010, he began working as a writer and producer on the SyFy television series Haven, inspired by the Hard Case Crime novel The Colorado Kid by Stephen King.

Twenty Wistar rats (125 – 127 g) were randomly assigned into four experimental groups: A, B, C and D, (n = 5 / group). Animals in group A served as control and was administered distilled water, while animals in groups B, C, and D were given 100 mg/kg body weight (bw), 200 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw of aqueous leaf extract of Annona senegalensis (<b>ALEAS)</b> respectively by oral gavage for 21 days. Data revealed a significant decrease (P < 0. 05) in the testis-body weight ratio and total protein content in the testes of rats administered <b>ALEAS</b> compared to the control.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{present a}} new {{approach}} to the multisensor Bearing-Only Tracking applications (BOT). Usually, a centralized data fusion scheme which involves a stacked vector of all the sensor measurements is applied using a single estimation ﬁlter which copes with the non-linear relation between the states and the measurements. The aforementioned approach is asymptotically optimal but suffers from the computational burden due to the augmented measurement vector and transmission <b>aleas</b> like delays generated by the bottleneck that occurs at the fusion center. Alternatively, since the Cartesian target positions can be determined by fusing at least 2 infrared sensor measurements in 2 D case, one can use a local linear ﬁlter to estimate the target motion parameters, then a state fusion formula based on the Likelihood of the expected overall local measurements is applied to obtain the global estimate. The simulation results show that the proposed approach performance is equivalent to the centralized fusion schema in terms of tracking accuracy but exhibits the advantages of the decentralized fusion schema like parallel processing architecture and robustness against transmission delays. In addition, the low complexity of the obtained algorithm is well suited for real-time applications...|$|E

40|$|The STRAP (Synergie Transdisciplinaire pour Répondre aux <b>Aléas</b> liés aux Panaches volcaniques) {{campaign}} {{was conducted in}} 2015 to investigate the volcanic plumes of Piton de La Fournaise (La Réunion, France). For the first time, measurements at the local (near the vent) and at the regional scales around the island were conducted. The STRAP 2015 campaign has become possible thanks to a strong cross-disciplinary collaboration between volcanologists and meteorologists. The main observations during four eruptive periods (85 days) are summarized. They include the estimates of SO 2, CO 2 and H 2 O emissions, the altitude of the plume at the vent and over different areas of La Réunion Island, {{the evolution of the}} SO 2 concentration, the aerosol size distribution, and the aerosol extinction profile. A climatology of the volcanic plume dispersion is also reported. Simulations and measurements showed that the plume formed by weak eruption has a stronger interaction with the surface of the island. Strong SO 2 and particles concentrations above 1000 [*]ppb and 50 [*] 000 [*]cm− 3, respectively, are frequently measured over 20 [*]km of distance from the Piton de la Fournaise. The measured aerosol size distribution shows the predominance of small particles in the volcanic plume. A particular emphasis is placed on the gas-particle conversion with several cases of strong nucleation of sulfuric acid observed within the plume and at the distal site of the Maïdo observatory. The STRAP 2015 campaign gave a unique set of multi-disciplinary data that can now be used by modellers to improve the numerical paramameterizations of the physical and chemical evolution of the volcanic plumes...|$|E
