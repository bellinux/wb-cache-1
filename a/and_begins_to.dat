5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms <b>and</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E
