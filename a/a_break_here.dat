50|$|The K.D.St.V. Saarland was {{established}} on June 18, 1961 as a spin-off of the fraternity K.D.St.V. Carolus Magnus Cartellverband at the University of the Saarland. Final {{act of the}} foundation was the publication on June 30. 1962. The K.D.St.V. Saarland was separated from Carolus Magnus because of the significant effects of the referendum of 1955, concerning the Saarstatut. With this referendum {{the citizens of the}} Saarland had to decide whether to reunite the Saarland with Germany or to be an independent territory, governed by an elected government, in matters of foreign policy represented by a commissar of the Western European Union and with an economy connected to France. There were heavy arguments between the supporters of both solutions. The break ran through Families, clubs and friendships and continued to exert an influence even after the conclusion of the referendum and the reunion to Germany. The new founded K.D.St.V. Saarland was the result of such <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> <b>Here</b> mainly the supporters of the Europastatut tried to form a new fraternity, separated from the supporters of the reunion to Germany, who mainly stayed in the Carolus Magnus fraternity.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{materials}} are often stronger than their constituents. We demonstrate this through a spring network model on a square lattice. Two {{different types of}} sites (A and B) are distributed randomly on the lattice, representing two different constituents. There are springs of three types connecting them (A-A, B-B and A-B). We assign two spring parameters {{for each type of}} spring. these are a spring constant and <b>a</b> <b>breaking</b> threshold. <b>Here</b> we show that intermediate compositions may require higher energy to induce the first sample-spanning break than either pure A or pure B. So the breaking energy goes through a maximum as the concentration of one component varies from 0 to 100 %. The position and height of the peak depend on the spring parameters. Moreover, certain combinations of spring parameters can produce composites, which do not <b>break</b> upto <b>a</b> specified strain limit. Thus a fracture 'percolation threshold' may be defined...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} {{described a}} yeast assay suitable for genetic screening in which simple religation nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and single-strand annealing (SSA) compete for repair of <b>an</b> I-SceI-created double-strand <b>break.</b> <b>Here,</b> the required allele {{has been introduced}} into an array of 4781 MATa deletion mutants and each strain screened individually. Two mutants (rad 52 and srs 2) showed a clear increase in the NHEJ/SSA ratio due to preferential impairment of SSA, but no mutant increased the absolute frequency of NHEJ significantly above the wild-type level. Seven mutants showed a decreased NHEJ/SSA ratio due to frank loss of NHEJ, which corresponded to all known structural/catalytic NHEJ components (yku 70, yku 80, dnl 4, lif 1, rad 50, mre 11, and xrs 2); no new mutants in this category were identified. A clearly separable and surprisingly large set of 16 other mutants showed partial defects in NHEJ. Further examination of these revealed that NEJ 1 can entirely account for the mating-type regulation of NHEJ, but that this regulatory role was distinct from the postdiauxic/stationary-phase induction of NHEJ that was deficient in other mutants (especially doa 1, fyv 6, and mck 1). These results {{are discussed in the}} context of the minimal set of required proteins and regulatory inputs for NHEJ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} confinement and the fermion doubling problem in Dirac-like Hamiltonians. Individually, both features are well known. First, simple electrostatic gates do not confine electrons due to the Klein tunneling. Second, a typical lattice discretization of the first-order derivative k → -i∂_x skips the central point and allow spurious low-energy, highly oscillating solutions known as fermion doublers. While a no-go theorem states that the doublers cannot be eliminated without artificially <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> symmetry, <b>here</b> we show that the symmetry broken by the Wilson's mass approach {{is equivalent to the}} enforcement of hard-wall boundary conditions, thus making the no-go theorem irrelevant when confinement is foreseen. We illustrate our arguments by calculating the following: (i) the band structure and transport properties across thin films of the topological insulator Bi_ 2 Se_ 3, for which we use ab-initio density functional theory calculations to justify the model; and (ii) the band structure of zigzag graphene nanoribbons.

60|$|The bells {{were still}} ringing {{when he got}} to Lowick, and he went into the curate's pew before any one else arrived there. But he was still left alone in it when the {{congregation}} had assembled. The curate's pew was opposite the rector's at the entrance of the small chancel, and Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked round at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year to year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with more change than we see in the boughs of <b>a</b> tree which <b>breaks</b> <b>here</b> and there with age, but yet has young shoots. Mr. Rigg's frog-face was something alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to the order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of the Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel's cheek had the same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent cottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters generally--the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the black gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all betters, and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was at peace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the Sunday sermon. The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church in former days, and no one took much note of him except the choir, who expected him to make a figure in the singing.|$|R

50|$|According to 19th century textual {{scholars}} {{these rules}} originate {{from two different}} layers in the priestly source, thought by scholars {{to be one of}} the source texts of the Torah; the priestly code within the priestly source is believed to be a series of additions to the text, from Aaronid editors, over a long period. The earlier source is thought to be the one referring to the flesh being consumed by the priests, the latter part of Leviticus 6 falls into this source, while the later source, which Leviticus 4 falls within, reflects a development where the flesh from sin offerings was seen as insufficiently holy and thus needing to be disposed of elsewhere. In the Book of Hosea, a reference to the earlier form (Hosea 4:7-8) suggests a possible reason for the change - the priests were accused of rejoicing in the people's wickedness as they were living off the sin offerings. Although known as sin offerings, it is more likely that such offerings began as offerings made for unintentionally <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> taboo (<b>here</b> meaning something which is seen as sacred but simultaneously prohibited).|$|R

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that {{fluorescence}} telescopes with a large field of view can indirectly probe the scale of supersymmetry <b>breaking.</b> <b>Here</b> we show that depending on their ability to fight a large background, multi-Km 3 volume neutrino telescopes might independently probe <b>a</b> similar <b>breaking</b> scale region, which lies between ∼ 10 ^ 5 and ∼ 5 x 10 ^ 6 GeV. The scenarios we consider have the gravitino as the lightest supersymmetric particle, and the next to lightest (NLSP) is a long lived slepton. Indirect probes complement a proposal that demonstrates that 1 Km 3 telescopes can directly probe this <b>breaking</b> scale. <b>A</b> high energy flux of neutrinos might interact in the Earth producing NLSPs which decay into taus. We estimate the rate of taus, taking into account the regeneration process, and the rate of secondary muons, which are produced in tau decays, in multi-km 3 detectors.
