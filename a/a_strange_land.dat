5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely {{seemed to}} the participants <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>land</b> (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact {{they were still in}} Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Showalter, {{writing in}} 1975, defended Starship Troopers, {{stating that the}} society {{depicted}} in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument {{is based on a}} literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, Starship Troopers being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as Stranger in <b>a</b> <b>Strange</b> <b>Land</b> (1961) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical attention than any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Asimov {{noted that}} the Second Revolution was far less clear cut than the first, {{attributing}} this {{to the development of}} the anthology, which made older stories more prominent. But a number of Golden Age writers changed their style as the New Wave hit. Robert A. Heinlein switched from his Campbellian Future History stories to stylistically adventuresome, sexually open works of fiction, notably Stranger in <b>a</b> <b>Strange</b> <b>Land</b> and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. Isaac Asimov wrote the New Wave-ish The Gods Themselves. Many others also continued successfully as styles changed.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} other {{unconfirmed}} accounts of European discovery and exploration, one tale by {{men from the}} Channel Islands being blown off course in the late 15th century into <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>land</b> full of fish, and another from Portuguese maps that depict the Terra do Bacalhau, or land of codfish, west of the Azores. The earliest, though, is the Voyage of Saint Brendan, the fantastical account of an Irish monk who made a sea voyage in the early 6th century. While the story itself {{became a part of}} myth and legend, some historians believe it is based on fact.|$|E

500|$|According to Rodgers' biographer William Hyland, {{the score}} for The King and I {{is much more}} {{closely tied to the}} action than that of South Pacific, [...] "which had its share of purely {{entertaining}} songs". [...] For example, the opening song, [...] "I Whistle a Happy Tune", establishes Anna's fear upon entering <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>land</b> with her small son, but the merry melody also expresses her determination to keep a stiff upper lip.

500|$|Verne Gay of Newsday {{called it}} a good, but difficult, episode, saying, [...] "the story lines were all {{parallel}} – it was even an anthology, with each story mirroring the next (bringing to mind that memorable scene when Roger, under the influence, is {{looking in the mirror}} and told to look away) ... the themes of male-female entanglement, and disentangle (and yes, hair, once again is a predominant metaphor.)

500|$|Chekhov's posthumous {{reputation}} greatly exceeded his expectations. The ovations for {{the play}} The Cherry Orchard {{in the year}} of his death served to demonstrate the Russian public's acclaim for the writer, which placed him second in literary celebrity only to Tolstoy, who outlived him by six years. Tolstoy was an early admirer of Chekhov's short stories and had a series that he deemed [...] "first quality" [...] and [...] "second quality" [...] bound into a book. In the first category were: Children, The Chorus Girl, A Play, Home, Misery, The Runaway, In Court, Vanka, Ladies, A Malefactor, The Boys, Darkness, Sleepy, The Helpmate, and The Darling"; in the second: A Transgression, Sorrow, The Witch, Verochka, In <b>a</b> <b>Strange</b> <b>Land,</b> The Cook's Wedding, A Tedious Business, An Upheaval, Oh!

500|$|Other {{big name}} SF authors {{approached}} LGBT themes in individual works: In Time Enough for Love (1973) by Robert A. Heinlein, {{the main character}} argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex, but sex {{for the purpose of}} procreation remains held as the ideal. The female bisexuality in Stranger in <b>a</b> <b>Strange</b> <b>Land</b> (1961) has been described as mere titillation and male homosexuality in the same work was a [...] "wrongness" [...] deserving pity. Heinlein's use of sexuality is discussed in an essay entitled [...] "The Embarrassments of Science Fiction" [...] by SF writer Thomas Disch. Disch was publicly gay from 1968; this came out occasionally in his poetry and particularly in his novel On Wings of Song (1979). His other major SF novels also contained bisexual characters: in his mosaic novel 334, gay people are referred to as [...] "republicans" [...] in contrast to the straight [...] "democrats". However, he did not try to write to a particular community: [...] "I'm gay myself, but I don't write 'gay' literature." ...|$|E
500|$|Starship Troopers {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the best-known and most influential works of science fiction. It is considered a landmark for the genre, having been described by a 1960 review {{as one of the}} ten best genre books of 1959, in a 2009 review as a key science fiction novel of the 1950s, and as the best-known example of military science fiction. It was also a personal landmark for Heinlein; it was one of his best-selling books, and is his best-known novel. The novel has been described as marking Heinlein's transition from writing juvenile fiction to a [...] "more mature phase" [...] as an author. Conversely, Michael Moorcock described it as Heinlein's last [...] "straight" [...] science fiction, before he turned to more serious writing such as Stranger in <b>a</b> <b>Strange</b> <b>Land.</b> To Heinlein's surprise, Starship Troopers won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960. By 1980, twenty years after its release, it had been translated into eleven languages and was still selling strongly. Heinlein nevertheless complained that, despite this success, almost all the mail he received about it was negative and he only heard about it [...] "when someone wants to chew me out".|$|E

500|$|Robert Heinlein {{was among}} the best-selling science fiction authors of the 1940s and 1950s; along with Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke; they were known as the [...] "big three" [...] that {{dominated}} U.S. science fiction. In contrast to the others, Heinlein firmly endorsed the anti-communist sentiment of the Cold War era in his writing. Heinlein served in the U.S. navy for five years {{after graduating from the}} United States Naval Academy in 1929. His experience in the military profoundly influenced his fiction. At some point between 1958 and 1959, Heinlein put aside the novel that would become Stranger in <b>a</b> <b>Strange</b> <b>Land</b> and wrote Starship Troopers. His motivation arose partially from his anger at U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower's decision to suspend U.S. nuclear tests, and the Soviet tests that occurred soon afterward. Writing in his 1980 volume Expanded Universe, Heinlein would say that the publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy on April 5, 1958, calling for a unilateral suspension of nuclear weapons testing by the United States sparked his desire to write Starship Troopers. Heinlein and his wife Virginia created the [...] "Patrick Henry League" [...] in an attempt to create support for the U.S. nuclear testing program. Heinlein stated that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views.|$|E
