5|$|In October 2010, her {{government}} {{announced that it}} would open two detention centres for 2000 immigrants, due to the pressures in allowing women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> be released into the community.

5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship.

5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked their boats and let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry {{charging}} at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E

5|$|At night, A Syrian force {{attempted}} to surround the Israelis by crossing the Jordan River {{to the north}} of the Sea of Galilee, but encountered a minefield in which a senior Syrian officer was wounded. This was spotted and reported by the Israelis at Tabgha, and the additional reprieve allowed the Kinarot Valley villages to evacuate the children, elderly and sick, as well as conduct maneuvers which feigned massive reinforcements in the Poria-Alumot region. In the panic of surprise, many men also tried to flee the frontal villages, but blockposts were set up near Afula and Yavne'el by the Military Police Service's northern command, under Yosef Pressman, who personally stopped buses and allowed only the women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> proceed to safety.|$|E
5|$|Auschwitz was {{considered}} a comfortable posting by many SS members, due to its many amenities and the abundance of slave labor. Of the various prisoner groups, SS officers preferred Jehovah's Witnesses for household slaves because of their nonviolent behavior. Höss lived {{with his wife and}} children in a villa just outside the camp grounds. Other SS personnel were also initially allowed to bring fiancees, wives, <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> live at the camp, but when the SS camp grew more crowded, Höss restricted further arrivals. Facilities for the SS personnel and their families included a library, swimming pool, coffee house, and a theater that hosted regular performances.|$|E
5|$|In 304, {{the fourth}} edict ordered all persons, men, women, <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> <b>to</b> gather {{in a public}} space and offer a {{collective}} sacrifice. If they refused, {{they were to be}} executed. The precise date of the edict is unknown, but it was probably issued in either January or February 304, and was being applied in the Balkans in March. The edict was in use in Thessalonica (Thessaloniki, Greece) in April 304, and in Palestine soon after. This last edict was not enforced at all in the domains of Maximian and Constantius. In the East, it remained applicable until the issue of the Edict of Milan by Constantine and Licinius in 313.|$|E

5|$|Janey's {{relationship}} with Rossetti had continued, {{and by the}} late 1860s gossip regarding their affair had spread about London, where they were regularly seen spending time together. Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy {{argued that it was}} likely that Morris had learned of and accepted the existence of their affair by 1870. In this year he developed an affectionate friendship with Aglaia Coronie, the daughter of wealthy Greek refugees, although {{there is no evidence that}} they had an affair. Meanwhile, Morris's {{relationship with}} his mother had improved, and he would regularly take his wife <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> visit her at her house in Leyton. He also went on various holidays; in the summer of 1866 he, Webb, and Taylor toured the churches of northern France.|$|E
5|$|John Milton Hay {{was born}} in Salem, Indiana, on October 8, 1838. He was the third son of Dr. Charles Hay and the former Helen Leonard. Charles Hay, born in Lexington, Kentucky, hated slavery {{and moved to the}} North in the early 1830s. A doctor, he practiced in Salem. Helen's father, David Leonard, had moved his family west from Assonet, Massachusetts, in 1818, but died en route to Vincennes, Indiana, and Helen {{relocated}} to Salem in 1830 to teach school. They married there in 1831. Charles was not successful in Salem, and moved, with his wife <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> <b>to</b> Warsaw, Illinois, in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Like the extravaganza and the burlesque, {{the variety}} {{show was a}} comic and ribald production, popular from the middle {{to the end of}} the 19th century, at which time it had evolved into vaudeville. This form was innovated by {{producers}} like Tony Pastor who tried to encourage women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> attend his shows; they were hesitant because the theater had long been the domain of a rough and disorderly crowd. By the early 20th century, vaudeville was a respected entertainment for women and children, and songwriters like Gus Edwards wrote songs that were popular across the country. The most popular vaudeville shows were, like the Ziegfeld Follies, a series of songs and skits that had a profound effect on the subsequent development of Broadway musical theater and the songs of Tin Pan Alley.|$|E

5|$|On July 21, 1832, the militiamen {{caught up}} with the British Band near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. To buy time for the noncombatants to cross the Wisconsin River, Black Hawk and Neapope confronted the Americans in a rear guard action that became known as the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Black Hawk was desperately outnumbered, leading about 50 Sauks and 60 to 70 Kickapoos against 750 militiamen. The battle was a {{lopsided}} victory for the militiamen, who lost only one man while killing as many as 68 of Black Hawk's warriors. Despite the high casualties, the battle allowed much of the British Band, including many women <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> <b>to</b> escape across the river. Black Hawk had managed to hold off a much larger force while allowing most of his people to escape, a difficult military operation that impressed some U.S. Army officers when they learned of it.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured {{a job as a}} law clerk with the Baltimore firm of Smith and Barrett. Until now, Agnew had been largely apolitical; his nominal allegiance had been to the Democratic Party, following his father's beliefs. The firm's senior partner, Lester Barrett, advised Agnew that if he wanted a career in politics he should become a Republican. There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.|$|E
