5|$|The Department for Transport (DfT) is {{currently}} investigating {{the possibility of}} extending the M54 westward to Shrewsbury, thereby placing the county town on the UK motorway map for the first time. Currently traffic has to continue onto the dual carriageway A5 when the M54 ends at Wellington although the road surface or speed limits do not change at all but the road. It is not motorway standard from the M54 J7 to the Shrewsbury ring road, because laybys {{would need to be}} removed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> shoulder would also need to be built which could cause delays to traffic.|$|E
5|$|Upheaval {{within the}} band {{occurred}} from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left. Their 1985 release Between a Rock <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> Place was expensive but sales were disappointing; and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's {{status as an}} icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, Between a Rock <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hard</b> Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E
5|$|Bathymetry is {{the mapping}} and {{study of the}} {{topography}} of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring {{the depth of the}} sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called oceanic. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes. Heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. Near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.|$|E

25|$|The A40 is a dual {{carriageway}} from the Inner Ring Road in Central London, {{and is one}} of the two busiest western radials. Much of the traffic using the A40 joins the M40. At J1 (the Denham Roundabout) outbound there is a lane drop to accommodate the non-motorway traffic. The A40 carries on to become the M40 with two lanes <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> shoulder outbound, three lanes <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> shoulder London bound. The motorway is carried over the top of the roundabout, which interchanges with the A40 (A413, A412) (outbound), the A4020 (original route of the A40) and the A412 southbound. The original line of the A40 can be seen going straight through the roundabout.|$|E

Although not a complete success, the stage was able to change direction and make a controlled entry into the atmosphere. During the final landing burn, the ACS thrusters could not overcome an aerodynamically induced spin, and centrifugal force deprived the landing engine of fuel leading to early engine shutdown <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> splashdown which destroyed the first stage. Pieces of wreckage were recovered for further study.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain. It {{has been placed}} loosely in the divisions Spermatophyta and Pinophyta, but no consensus has been reached. Since its seeds are not protected by an ovary wall, it can morphologically be considered a gymnosperm. The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically not fruits, but are seeds that have a shell consisting of a soft and fleshy section (the sarcotesta), <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> section (the sclerotesta).

25|$|Kilmer {{was married}} to actress Joanne Whalley from March 1988 to February 1996. The two met while working {{together}} on the film Willow. The couple had two children: a daughter, Mercedes (b. October 29, 1991), and a son, Jack (b. June 6, 1995). Warwick Davis, Kilmer's co-star from the 1988 fantasy Willow, in his audio commentary for the film said that the question he is most asked is {{what it was like}} working with Kilmer. Though Kilmer has a reputation of being difficult, Davis describes him as a very funny man <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> working, dedicated actor. Kilmer reunited with Davis in the 2013 Easter special of the sitcom Life's Too Short, in which he plays a fictionalized version of himself as a mooching, arrogant eccentric.|$|E

On March 16, 2002, Margarito crowned himself world champion, beating Diaz by knockout in round ten. He defended that crown with a decision in twelve over Danny Perez Ramírez and a knockout in two over former WBA title holder Andrew Lewis. Lewis was a southpaw <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> puncher, but had been exposed as having a weak chin, while Margarito proved that he has a world class chin.

25|$|Staal is an {{excellent}} skater, adept shot blocker and regular penalty killer with the Rangers. Offensively, he is a smart passer who makes the intelligent plays to his teammates and generally plays positionally. Due to his skating ability, he periodically joins the offensive rush despite being a defenceman. He has a very accurate wrist shot <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> slapshot that has improved in accuracy since his NHL debut. His improving offence led him to see more ice time on the power play beginning in the 2010–11 season, where he can apply those offensive skills more directly in the scoring effort. Upon entering the NHL, the Rangers coaching staff have primarily used him in a defensive role. However his point totals improved steadily his first few years in the NHL, and each year from 2007–08 to 2009–10, he established new career highs in goals, assists and points.|$|E
