5|$|Another account, {{involving}} seafaring, {{holds that}} the name <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> misfortune of a mariner afloat. In this version the clan’s founder, sometimes identified as son {{of one of the}} Lords of the Isles, cuts off his thumb in order to plug a leak in his sinking vessel.|$|E
5|$|Decades, and in {{some cases}} centuries, of British rule and {{emigration}} have left their mark on the independent nations that <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Empire. The empire established the use of English in regions around the world. Today it is the primary language of up to 400 million people and is spoken by about one and a half billion as a first, second or foreign language.|$|E
50|$|The {{obturator}} artery sometimes <b>arises</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main stem or <b>from</b> <b>the</b> posterior {{trunk of}} the internal iliac artery, or it may <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> superior gluteal artery; occasionally it <b>arises</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> external iliac.|$|R
50|$|Malignant {{peripheral}} nerve sheath tumors are a rare type of cancer that <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> soft tissue that surrounds nerves. They are {{a type of}} sarcoma. Most malignant {{peripheral nerve}} sheath tumors <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nerve plexuses that distribute nerves into the limbs - the brachial and lumbar plexuses - or from nerves as they <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trunk.|$|R

5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disagreements {{that occurred}} between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began {{during the battle}} and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at the last minute, and for these reasons was despised by Orozco.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film {{when the}} Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball teams {{of the late}} 1980s with Kendall Gill and Stephen Bardo {{claimed to be the}} originators of baggy shorts in basketball. All of the Wolverines {{who took part in the}} production of the film described how they felt they originated the baggy shorts as a result of Rose's request. Even rapper Ice Cube described his recollection of them as the originators.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E
50|$|The {{right and}} left {{posterior}} cerebral arteries <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> basilar artery, which is formed by {{the left and right}} vertebral arteries. <b>The</b> vertebral arteries <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> subclavian arteries.|$|R
50|$|Nasal polyps {{are usually}} {{classified}} into antrochoanal polyps and ethmoidal polyps. Antrochoanal polyps <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> maxillary sinuses {{and are the}} much less common; ethmoidal polyps <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ethmoidal sinuses.|$|R

5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should {{have nothing to do with}} it. On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that {{the ancestors of}} snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|During 1548, England {{was subject}} to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various {{religious}} and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.|$|E
40|$|Atrial myxomas are {{the most}} common primary cardiac tumors. In 20 % of cases, they <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right atrium. Only a few such tumors are {{reported}} to have <b>arisen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inferior vena cava. We report a case in which we discovered, in a young, asymptomatic woman, an atrial myxoma <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> anterior–superior junction of the inferior vena cava with the right atrium...|$|R
40|$|Venous aneurysms <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mediastinal {{systemic}} veins are rare. There {{are only}} 27 {{reported cases of}} such aneurysms. Majority <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> superior vena cava. We are reporting a saccular aneurysm of superior vena cava in a 58 -year-old male. The chest radiogram suggested superior mediastinal mass and the computed tomogram was suggestive of aortic arch aneurysm. Aortography and venography confirmed the diagnosis as saccular aneurysm <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> superior vena cava. A 7 cm saccular aneurysm <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> distal half of superior vena cava was resected through median sternotomy.

5|$|In Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg {{developed}} his uncertainty principle, which Bohr embraced. In a paper he {{presented at the}} Volta Conference at Como in September 1927, he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices. Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had good-natured arguments over such issues throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|More <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same Federalist/Jeffersonian {{political}} {{dispute over the}} judiciary {{that gave rise to}} Marbury v. Madison (1803) and Stuart v. Laird (1803). Benjamin More, a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia, argued that the repeal of statutory provisions authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary-protection guarantees for federal judges in Article Three of the United States Constitution. Below, a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More, interpreted the repeal act prospectively, and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Tribunal in 1994, only one constitutional reference has been made to it. Constitutional Reference No. 1 of 1995 <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> issue of the application of Article 22H(1) of the Constitution in relation to Article 5(2A), which was and is still not yet in force. The matter was referred by President Ong Teng Cheong to clarify the scope of the application of both Articles. The Government was represented by Chan Sek Keong and Soh Tze Bian of the Attorney-General's Chambers, and the Presidency by Joseph Grimberg and Walter Woon.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} threat the Roman Empire faced {{during the reign}} of Domitian <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King Decebalus, crossed the Danube into the province of Moesia, wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor Oppius Sabinus.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E

50|$|The most {{conspicuous}} appendages <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> head are the antennae. The first pair are biramous (having two flagella), except in Luciferidae, and are relatively small. The second pair can be 2-3 times {{the length of}} the body and are always uniramous (having a single flagellum). The mouthparts comprise pairs of mandibles, maxillules and maxillae, <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> head, and three pairs of maxillipeds, <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> thorax. A pair of stalked eyes points forwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} a number of cases of arrests, charges and civil {{lawsuits}} <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> domestic discipline of washing another's mouth out with soap; often <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> perception of abuse of parental authority by an outside figure.|$|R
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore, punk, and garage rock {{were the}} roots of {{alternative}} rock, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle. Seattle's local scene produced grunge music, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative rock. With {{the addition of a}} more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became wildly popular across the United States in 1991. Three years later, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums Dookie, Smash, Let's Go, Stranger than Fiction and Punk in Drublic) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Leopoldii hybrids <b>arose</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{work of the}} British {{explorer}} and botanist Richard Pearce, {{an employee}} of James Veitch & Sons, a plant nursery. Pearce brought back specimens of Hippeastrum leopoldii and Hippeastrum pardinum from the Andes. These two species were notable for large flowers that were wide open and relatively symmetrical. Crossing these two species {{with the best of}} the Reginae strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens, with up to 4-6 flowers on each scape. The Veitch nursery dominated the commercial development of Hippeastrum leopoldii and other varieties up to {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, the best of their hybrids setting the standard for modern commercial development.|$|E
