5|$|Alongside the {{twinning}} of the skyway, the QEW was widened {{to eight}} lanes between Burlington Street in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway2) in Burlington, and to six lanes {{north to the}} Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway.

Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E

Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
5|$|Hammer {{pointed out}} that Edison {{was not the first}} to make an {{electric}} light bulb. He claims instead that Edison made the first commercial electric light bulb that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, the National Liberation Front's Military Region 2 {{ordered the}} Viet Cong 261st Battalion and the 514th Battalion, the home {{battalion}} of Dinh Tuong Province, {{to destroy the}} strategic hamlets in their region and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attack South Vietnamese sweeping operations. Between 28–30 December 1962, an American aircraft equipped with eavesdropping equipment located a Viet Cong radio transmitter. It intercepted radio signals in the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province where the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was headquartered. The radio intercept and other information obtained by Jim Drummond, Vann's intelligence officer, indicated that the Viet Cong were using Ap Tan Thoi as a headquarters location. Furthermore, South Vietnamese and American intelligence personnel believed the Viet Cong had deployed a reinforced company of about 120 men to protect the transmitter. Certain that the Viet Cong unit was no larger than the reported number, the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was instructed to attack Ap Tan Thoi.|$|E

5|$|Many castles were {{originally}} built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking {{features such as}} towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. In the late 12thand early 13thcenturies, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, {{with an emphasis on}} flanking fire. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence– several stages of defence within each other that could all function <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> maximise the castle's firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, 1864, Lincoln {{promoted}} Grant to lieutenant general, {{giving him}} command of all Union Armies, answering {{only to the}} President. Grant assigned Sherman the Division of the Mississippi and traveled to Washington to meet with Lincoln to devise a strategy of total war against the Confederacy. Grant established his headquarters with General George Meade's Army of the Potomac in Culpeper, Virginia. Grant developed an overall master plan of five coordinated Union offensives, attacking the rebel armies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> keep the Confederates from shifting reinforcements within their interior lines. Sherman was to pursue Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee, while Meade would lead the Army of the Potomac, with Grant in the field, to attack and destroy Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Major General Benjamin Butler was to advance towards Richmond from the south, up the James River, while a joint army-navy operation was to be launched against Mobile, Alabama. If Lee was forced south as expected, Grant would join forces with Butler's armies and be fed supplies from the James. Major General Franz Sigel was to capture the railroad line at Lynchburg, move east, and attack from the Blue Ridge Mountains. Grant knew that Lee had limited manpower and that a war of attrition fought on a battlefield without entrenchments would lead to Lee's defeat.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passing}} of the Land Drainage Act 1930, the Welland Catchment Board was created. They had spent £91,537 on the outfall by 1937. Towards the end of the Second World War, E. G. Taverner, the chief {{engineer}} for the drainage board, devised a plan to relieve flooding in Spalding by creating a bypass channel, and building the Greatford Cut to divert the waters of the West Glen river into the Welland upstream of Market Deeping. The scheme cost £723,000, with much of the work being carried out by W. & C. French, and the Coronation Channel around Spalding was opened in September 1953. Fulney lock was constructed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> exclude the tide from the upper river, as was the Maxey Cut, an embanked channel that bypasses the villages of Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James. During the 1960s and 1970s, several sections of the river above Stamford were made straighter and deeper, {{to reduce the risk of}} flooding of agricultural land. To address the habitat and environmental issues causes by such engineering work, the Welland Rivers Trust, a limited company and charitable trust, was set up in 2010. They are seeking to direct regeneration of the river by co-ordinating various organisations, which are known collectively as the Welland Valley Partnership. They published a major document outlining their proposals in February 2013.|$|E
