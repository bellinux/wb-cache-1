5|$|The {{results of}} {{prospective}} cohort {{studies on the}} relationship between abortion <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> cancer have been consistently negative.

5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Counseling and {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of genetic testing for HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias.

The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.|$|E

40|$|History and Objectives: Gynecomasty <b>and</b> ectopic <b>breast</b> are {{disorders}} of breast. Due to {{difficulties in}} the biopsy diagnosis and different reports on sensitivity of FNA test for diagnosis of gynecomasty <b>and</b> ectopic <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> {{in order to identify}} the sensitivity of FNA test, the present study was carried out on patients referred to surgical clinic of Kashan Shaheed Beheshti hospital for clinical diagnosis of gynecomasty <b>and</b> ectopic <b>breast.</b> Materials <b>and</b> Methods: A descriptive study was conducted on patients with clinical diagnosis of gynecomasty <b>and</b> ectopic <b>breast.</b> FNA test was performed before the surgical operation to remove the mass (Biopsy). The outcome of the 2 tests was compared and the positive cases of FNA in gynecomasty <b>and</b> ectopic <b>breast</b> were identified. Results: From total of 20 patients, 9 with the mean age of 27. 1 Â± 11 years had axillary mass with ectopic <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> 11 cases (Mean age of 28. 9 Â± 9. 5 years) had gynecomasty. The rate of positive FNA test was 33. 3 for ectopic <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> 54. 5 for gynecomasty. Conclusion: It seems that FNA test for the positive diagnosis of gynecomasty <b>and</b> ectopic <b>breast</b> is less sensitive therefore further research is need...|$|R

5|$|The female is {{very similar}} to the male but the upper parts are {{somewhat}} more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male's winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult.

The bill is dark brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive dark brown throat.

We report here on a case of BML from the uterine leiomyoma in a 39 -year-old woman that involved the soft tissues, skeletal muscles, lungs <b>and</b> <b>breasts.</b> She underwent a hysterectomy for the uterine leiomyoma, double oophorectomy for hormonal ablation and lung wedge resection to confirm the diagnosis. The microscopic findings of the <b>breast</b> <b>and</b> lung tumor were {{similar to those of the}} benign uterine leiomyoma.

5|$|There are few {{variations}} in plumage {{between the three}} subspecies. Anairetes parulus aequatorialis tends to be browner than the nominate subspecies in its upperparts, with broader and more extensive breast streaks and broader and more distinct white wingbars. A. p. patagonicus has more variation from the nominate subspecies as it is paler gray overall, particularly on the crown, and the wingbars <b>and</b> <b>breast</b> streaks are broader and more distinct. A. p. patagonicus underbelly is also a paler yellow to white.|$|E
