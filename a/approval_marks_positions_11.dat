500|$|The war {{remained}} a frustrating stalemate for two years, with over 30,000 Americans killed, until an armistice ended {{the fighting in}} 1953. [...] In February 1952, Truman's <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> stood at 22% according to Gallup polls, which is the all-time lowest <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> for an active American president, though it was matched by Richard Nixon in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dismissal}} of General Douglas MacArthur ignited {{a firestorm of}} outrage against Truman and support for MacArthur. Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, supported and applauded Truman's decision. MacArthur meanwhile returned to the U.S. to a hero's welcome, and addressed {{a joint session of}} Congress. In part due to the {{dismissal of}} MacArthur, Truman's <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> in February 1952 stood at 22% according to Gallup polls, which was, until George W. Bush in 2008, the all-time lowest <b>approval</b> <b>mark</b> for an active American president.|$|R

40|$|Influenza virus {{neuraminidase}} (NA; EC 3. 2. 1. 18) {{possesses a}} signal-anchor hydrophobic domain at the amino terminus. To characterize {{the nature of}} this signal-anchor domain we have introduced single amino acid changes in this domain by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Three mutant NA proteins that were synthesized contained a single charged amino acid residue in place of a hydrophobic amino acid residue at <b>position</b> <b>11,</b> 17, or 26 of the signal-anchor domain. When the altered NA proteins were expressed in CV- 1 cells, two phenotypes were observed: substitution of arginine in place of glycine at <b>position</b> <b>11</b> and substitution of aspartic acid for valine at position 17 did not abolish the signal, the anchor, or the transport functions. On the other hand, substitution of arginine for isoleucine at position 26 blocked the migration of the NA protein from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. Double mutants were constructed from these single point mutations and they exhibited two phenotypes: one double mutant (aspartic acid at position 17 and arginine at position 26) was present mostly in the cytoplasm and the other (arginine at <b>positions</b> <b>11</b> and 26) was present mostly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the hydrophobic amino acids at <b>positions</b> <b>11,</b> 17, and 26 are required for intracellular transport. Furthermore, the accumulation of the mutant proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus suggests the existence of putative intracellular transport (or traffic) signals in the signal-anchor domain of NA...|$|R
