The Gyrodyne possessed the hovering capability of a helicopter, while its propeller provided the necessary thrust for forward flight to enable its rotor, driven at low torque in cruise flight, to operate at low collective pitch with the tip-path plane parallel to the flight path to minimise vibration at high airspeed. Collective pitch was an <b>automatic</b> <b>function</b> of throttle setting and profile drag of the propeller, which to maintain rpm diverted torque away from the rotor as airspeed increased.|$|E

Having little in common with the later Rotodyne, it was characterised by its inventor, Dr. J.A.J. Bennett, formerly Chief Technical Officer of the pre-Second World War Cierva Autogiro Company as an intermediate aircraft designed to combine the safety and simplicity of the autogyro with hovering performance. Its rotor was driven in all phases of flight with collective pitch being an <b>automatic</b> <b>function</b> of shaft torque, with a side-mounted propeller providing both thrust for forward flight and rotor torque correction. On 28 June 1948, the FB-1 proved its potential during test flights when it achieved a world airspeed record, having attaining a recorded speed of 124.3 mph [...] The programme was not trouble-free however, a fatal accident involving one of the prototypes occurring in April 1949 due to poor machining of a rotor blade flapping link retaining nut. The second FB-1 was modified to investigate a tip-jet driven rotor with propulsion provided by propellers mounted at the tip of each stub wing, being renamed the Jet Gyrodyne.|$|E

40|$|A method using {{optimal control}} results as input to {{operator}} assist systems, <b>automatic</b> <b>functions</b> and autonomous construction machine control is presented. This method complements the vast research within autonomy {{to achieve the}} most fuel efficient solution from results that are already available from concept evaluation and system optimization in early development. The optimal control results are validated and compared to an extensive empirical study to ensure realization in real applications. The optimal control method is based on dynamic programming and finds the global optimum in regards to fuel efficiency [ton/l] at a given productivity [ton/h]. The wheel loader is used as an example due to the complex nature of the system, where the driveline and working hydraulics must work together throughout the work cycle.
