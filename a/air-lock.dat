As it was, however, I was able, thanks to our excellent charts, to keep the channel and so to gain the open straits. There we rose about midday, but, observing a hydroplane at no great distance, we sank again for half an hour. When we came up for the second time, all was peaceful around us, and the English coast was lining the whole western horizon. We kept outside the Goodwins and straight down Channel until we saw a line of black dots in front of us, which I knew to be the Dover-Calais torpedo- boat cordon.

40|$|When {{water was}} sucked through healthy, single-node {{cuttings}} {{of a number}} of sugar-cane clones, a slow flow rate generally indicated resistance to ratoon stunting disease (RSD) while a fast flow rate indicated susceptibility. The differences in flow rate between clones were maximized by sucking air for a few seconds before testing, presumably because resistant clones formed more <b>air-locks</b> in the nodes than susceptible clones. Microscopic studies showed that resistant clones with slow flow rates had more profuse branching of the large metaxylem vessels in the nodes than susceptible clones. Cuttings affected by ratoon stunting disease of red-rot disease, or taken from very thin stalks, had much reduced flow rates and should be avoided in flow-rate tests...|$|R

40|$|Worker {{exposure}} to coal dust in underground mines remains a major health hazard. This research has: 1) Analyzed the wetting characteristics {{of less than}} 10 micron dust particles using a novel micro-emulsion technology (MET) at bench scale and prototype scale with emphasis on agglomeration of dust particles, and 2) Simulate airflow and dust dispersion patterns on a longwall mining face using CFD modeling techniques to compare the current and proposed spatial distributions of water sprays around a longwall shearer. With the “Final Dust Rule” adopted by MSHA in 2014 and slated to go into full effect August 16, 2016, this research is {{a significant contribution to}} the coal industry. A suitable micro-emulsion containing 0. 2 % oil and 0. 0125 % didodecyl-dimethyl-ammonium bromide (DDAB) was identified. For assessing the wettability of coal dusts, a slightly modified version of “Fixed Time Wettability” or FTW (Chugh et al., 2004) was employed. These wettability tests however, did not yeild true wettability using the MET. An analysis for both unwetted and wetted portions of coal dust using particle size distribution curves (PSD) confirmed agglomeration when treated with the emulsion. For the unwetted portion, 96. 6 % of the particles had sizes greater than 25 μm after treatment with MET. Similar data for wetted dust was 100 %. Experiemental studies in a 4 ft x 4 ft x 10 ft chamber showed 12 - 15 % improvement in respirable dust when using MET as compared to water alone [...] Validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were used to study airflow patterns and the interaction between sprays and airflow for designing both engineering and administrative controls around a longwall face. Two important zones – low air velocity (LAV) and recirculation (RC) – were identified around the model of a longwall face. These zones were located: 1) Behind the headgate drum and 2) Above the shearer chassis. Analysis of a modified geometric configuration of sprays on the shearer chassis showed improved coverage for wetting the dust on the longwall face. Numerical modeling comparisons were made between current spray systems and spray systems proposed by Dr. Y. P. Chugh using the concepts of “Continuous and Discrete Phase Modeling”. Analyses included changes in airflow patterns caused by spray systems and dust dispersion tracks generated from the cutting face. Chugh’s spray system was able to effectively eliminate RC zones existing above the shearer body, thereby minimizing the extent to which coal dust enters the walkway of the longwall face where workers are located. The proposed spray system used concepts of multiple wetting points for dust, <b>air-locks,</b> and venturi to wet the dust and direct the dust-laden air from mine workers. These improvements can be used in longwall mines as engineering controls for meeting new dust control standards...|$|R

50|$|The Sand Island is an {{artificial}} island constructed by placing sand within a closed ring of sheet piles {{driven into the}} bed of the river. Two islands were constructed for each pier (one for each of the cylindrical caissons) with the caissons being 28 ft in diameter at the base. The pier on the sloping mud bank also used this method with rectangular caissons. Hornibrook is quoted as stating:"...as far as I am concerned the idea is an original one....The idea came to me one morning about 3 o'clock. I was so much taken up with it that I {{got out of bed and}} commenced to design a scheme to carry out the piers for the Grey Street Bridge."The use of Sand Islands was highly successful and very accurate, and overcame the problem of requiring the cutting edge to be placed directly on dry ground. The material was dredged out of the centre of the caisson and the cylinder progressively sank; however it was necessary to ensure that the caisson was fixed securely to rock and it was therefore essential to ensure man-access into the cylinder. This was achieved by using an <b>air-lock</b> system, but as the men worked under high pressure they could possibly suffer from the bends and an hospital <b>air-lock</b> was located at the surface for repressurisation if required. The foundations for the bridge were very deep, and the experience gained in the construction of this bridge, and later the Story Bridge, was considered of great value and to be a major achievement.|$|E

50|$|Venous or {{pulmonary}} {{air embolism}} occurs when air enters the systemic veins and is {{transported to the}} right side of the heart and from there into the pulmonary arteries, where it may lodge, blocking or reducing blood flow. Gas in the venous circulation can cause cardiac problems by obstructing the pulmonary circulation or forming an <b>air-lock</b> which raises central venous pressure and reduces pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures. Experiments on animals show that the amount of gas necessary for this to happen is quite variable. Human case reports suggest that injecting more than 100 mL of air into the venous system at rates greater than 100 mL/s can be fatal. Very large and symptomatic amounts of venous air emboli may also occur in rapid decompression in severe diving or decompression accidents, where they may interfere with circulation in the lungs and result in respiratory distress and hypoxia.|$|E
50|$|Structurally, carboxysomes are icosahedral, or quasi-icosahedral. Electron cryo-tomography {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} the approximately icosahedral {{geometry of the}} carboxysome, and have imaged protein molecules inside (presumed to be RuBisCO), arranged in a few concentric layers. The non-icosahedral faceted shapes of some carboxysomes can naturally be explained within the elastic theory of heterogeneous thin shells. The carboxysome has an outer shell composed of a few thousand protein subunits, which encapsulates a CO2-producing enzyme (carbonic anhydrase) and a carbon-fixing enzyme (RuBisCO). Proteins known to form the shell have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. The protein that constitutes {{the majority of the}} shell forms a cyclical hexamer and belongs to BMC protein family. These hexamers, BMC-H proteins, are the basic building blocks of the shell. In some crystal forms the hexamers assemble further in a side-by-side fashion to form a tightly packed molecular layer, which presumably is how the facets of the shell are assembled. Small pores perforate many different types of BMC-H hexamers, and may serve as the route for diffusion of small substrates (e.g. bicarbonate) {{into and out of the}} carboxysome. Positively charged amino acids in the pores presumably help promote the diffusion of the negatively charged substrates and products. Other minor structural components of the shell that have been characterized include pentameric proteins (BMC-P proteins), which have been proposed to occupy the vertices of the icosahedral shell. A third building block of the carboxysome shell is a protein composed of two BMC domains in tandem (BMC-T proteins). Structurally, many of these are known to form trimers which are pseudohexameric. Some members of the BMC-T protein family stack in a face-to-face fashion and form tiny cages. Based on crystal structures, these protein cages have relatively large gated pores on both sides, and it has been proposed that the opening and closing of the pore could be controlled in a manner similar to an <b>air-lock.</b> Such an <b>air-lock,</b> in contrast to BMC-H proteins with constitutively open pores, has been suggested to serve as a route for larger substrates (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) and products (3-phosphoglycerate) that must cross the shell.|$|E

50|$|The caverns were {{discovered}} in 1974, when cavers Gary Tenen and Randy Tufts found a narrow crack {{in the bottom of}} a sinkhole, and followed the source of warm, moist air toward what ended up being more than 2.5 mi of pristine cave passages with the help of Erick Campbell - a local state biologist. Hoping to protect the cave from vandalism, they kept the location a secret for fourteen years, deciding that the best way to preserve the cavern — which was near a freeway — was to develop it as a tour cave. After gaining the cooperation of the Kartchner family and working with them for ten years, together they decided that the best way to achieve the goal of protection through development as a tour cave was to approach Arizona State Parks. In 1985, The Nature Conservancy acquired an option to purchase the land. The discovery of the cave was finally made public in 1988 when the landowners sold the area to the state for development as a park and show cavern.

From their home in Clonmel in Ireland, he, his wife Mairi, and their two children, Sorka and Brian, travel to Pern in deep sleep on the colony ship Yokohama. Red is one of the founding fathers of Pern society and, along with his extended family, reflects much of McCaffrey's own Irish origins in the multicultural mix of early Pern. As one of the senior vets, Red is a vital staff member in Kitti Ping's dragon engineering project and a source of guidance to the dragonriders of the First Hatching. His own daughter Sorka Hanrahan, along with fellow Irish colonist, Sean Connell, makes first Impression of the native firelizards who provide the genetic material for the dragons. Sorka and Sean later become riders of the First Dragons and founders of Fort Weyr. Throughout this phase, Red provides guidance and support. It is to Red and Mairi that Sean turns in times of stress such as at the death of queen rider Alianne, whose dragon, Chereth, was the first to go between on the death of her rider. Red and Mairi help to raise Sorka and Sean's five children along with their own seven younger children born after their arrival on Pern. When the original northern hemisphere settlement at Fort became over-crowded during the First Pass, Red and Mairi apply to Paul Benden to begin a third settlement in a cave system to the north. They take a hundred and forty-one people representing a range of families, ages and skills, along with the horses and other livestock Red has been carefully breeding to begin the new Hold. On the journey from Fort to the new place, Red's paternal care of his people and his skill with horse-flesh is clearly demonstrated. The key point to the journey is the crossing of a swollen river which marks the boundary of their lands. Red works tirelessly to bring his caravan across the ford. While crossing the ford, Sean arrives to check on their progress and to seek their comfort after the death of Alianne. Eventually, Red's caravan arrives safely and they begin to make their cave system into a new home.

40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{evaluated}} {{a multidisciplinary}} strategy {{to decrease the}} rate of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) among adult patients hospitalised in two haematology wards in a single 560 -bed building at the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne. Upgrading of the air filtration system and construction of an <b>air-lock</b> chamber {{at the entrance to}} the unit were completed during 1994. In 1995, specific hygienic measures were introduced during hospital building work, including the use of plastic barriers, watering during demolition work, reduction of pedestrian traffic in construction areas, and the wearing of high-efficiency filtration masks by immunosuppressed patients when outside the protected unit. This strategy was evaluated by a prospective survey of IPA cases between 1993 and 2001, coupled with environmental surveillance. The number and risk-level of hospital renovation projects increased between 1995 and 2001 (p < 0. 01).

40|$|While the {{microbial}} diversity of a spacecraft assembly facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Pasadena, CA) was being monitored, H 2 O 2 -resistant bacterial strains were repeatedly isolated from various surface locations. H 2 O 2 {{is a possible}} sterilant for spacecraft hardware {{because it is a}} low-temperature process and compatible with various modern-day spacecraft materials, electronics, and components. Both conventional biochemical testing and molecular analyses identified these strains as Bacillus pumilus.

Both vegetative cells and spores of several B. pumilus isolates were exposed to 5 % liquid H 2 O 2 for 60 min. Spores of each strain exhibited higher resistance than their respective vegetative cells to liquid H 2 O 2. Results indicate that the H 2 O 2 resistance observed in both vegetative cells and spores is strain-specific, as certain B. pumilus strains were two to three times more resistant than a standard Bacillus subtilis dosimetry strain. An example of this trend was observed when the type strain of B. pumilus, ATCC 7061, proved sensitive, whereas several environmental strains exhibited varying degrees of resistance, to H 2 O 2. Repeated isolation of H 2 O 2 -resistant strains of B. pumilus in a clean-room is a concern because their persistence might potentially compromise life-detection missions, which have very strict cleanliness and sterility requirements for spacecraft hardware...|$|E
40|$|To study {{aluminum}} {{species in}} dealuminated zeolites, {{a series of}} dealuminated zeolites Y with framework nSi/nAl ratios of 2. 8 to 6. 0 was prepared by steaming. The steaming of zeolite H,Na-Y was performed under water vapor pressures of 3. 4 to 81. 5 kPa and at a temperature of 748 K. As determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the crystallinity of zeolites was well preserved after the above-mentioned treatments. The hydrated materials were investigated by 29 Si MAS NMR, 27 Al MQMAS NMR, high-field 27 Al MAS NMR, and 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy. Upon adsorption of ammonia on the steamed zeolites H,Na-Y, a reversible change of octahedrally coordinated to tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum atoms was found. Quantitative 29 Si, 27 Al, and 1 H MAS NMR measurements indicated that this coordination change is accompanied by the formation of bridging OH groups (SiOHAl) in the dehydrated materials, while only a weak decrease {{in the amount of}} silanol (SiOH) groups and no systematic change of AlOH groups occurred. Based on these results, a model for the reversible coordination change of aluminum atoms in the framework of hydrothermally treated zeolites H-Y is proposed assuming local structures consisting of threefold-coordinated framework aluminum atoms with SiO- defect sites in their vicinity, which are coordinated to extra-framework aluminum species. After adsorption of ammonia at the threefold-coordinated framework aluminum atoms, the SiO- defect sites are healed to Si-O-Al- bridges leading to a transformation of the threefold-coordinated aluminum atoms to tetrahedrally coordinated atoms. Upon thermal decomposition of the ammonium ions formed at these Si-O-Al- bridges, SiOHAl groups occur. It is also found that framework and extra-framework aluminum species in zeolite Y were strongly influenced upon rehydration. Therefore, the investigations of these materials in non-hydrated state, i. e., without hydration after the dealumination, are required. To obtain dealuminated zeolites in non-hydrated state, these dealuminated materials were immediately filled into glass containers under dry nitrogen in an <b>air-lock</b> after steaming. By 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy, a strong high-field shift of the signals of Si(3 Al) and Si(2 Al) sites in the spectra of non-hydrated zeolites Y in comparison with those of the hydrated samples was observed. These high-field shifts of the Si(nAl) signals of 2 to 5 ppm occurring in the 29 Si MAS NMR spectra of non-hydrated zeolites Y were discussed to be caused by i) a variation of the local structure of neighboring AlO 4 tetrahedra or ii) the presence of multivalent extra-framework aluminum cations. To clarify the reasons for these resonance shifts, zeolites Y with different H- and Al-exchange degrees were investigated by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The experimental results indicate that the primary reason for the high-field shift of 29 Si MAS NMR signals of silicon atoms in non-hydrated state is the change of O-Al-O bond angles and Al-O bond lengths during the dehydration of AlO 4 tetrahedra in the framework. In contrast, the presence of extra-framework aluminum cations leads only to a strong broadening of the Si(nAl) signals, probably due to 29 Si- 27 Al couplings, and a weak high-field shift of ca. 1 ppm. With increasing water vapor pressure during the steaming of zeolite Y, a systematic decrease of the total amounts of framework aluminum atoms in the non-hydrated materials was found by 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. The amounts of threefold coordinated framework aluminum atoms in non-hydrated zeolites Y were determined by the increase of the concentrations of bridging OH groups after an ammonia adsorption/desorption treatment and by application of 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy. By a quantitative comparison of the amounts of tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum atoms, responsible for the occurrence of negative framework charges, and the amounts of charge-compensating residual sodium cations and bridging hydroxyl protons, the mean cationic charge of extra-framework aluminum atoms was calculated. This means that the cationic charge per extra-framework aluminum atom was found to vary from ca. + 2 to ca. + 0. 5 for weakly and strongly dealuminated zeolites Y samples, respectively. Solid-state NMR characterization of zeolite catalysts in the hydrated state is often accompanied by an uncontrolled hydrolysis of the framework and a variation in the coordination of aluminum species. It is demonstrated that the limitations occurring for 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy of non-hydrated zeolites Y, such as strong decrease of resolution and significant line broadening, can be overcome by loading these materials with ammonia. In the 29 Si MAS NMR spectra of non-hydrated and ammonia-loaded zeolites Y, no dehydration-induced high-field shift of Si(nAl) signals (n = 3, 2, 1) occurs, which is generally responsible for the loss of resolution in the spectra of non-hydrated materials. The 27 Al MAS NMR spectra of the non-hydrated and ammonia-loaded zeolites Y consist exclusively of signals of the tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum atoms with spectroscopic parameters similar to those of framework aluminum atoms in hydrated samples. The framework nSi/nAl ratios obtained by quantitative evaluation of both 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR spectra of the non-hydrated and ammonia-loaded zeolites Y agree well with each other. Beside adsorption of ammonia, the adsorption of other probe molecules, such as pyridine, acetone, and acetonitrile, was utilized to conquer the above-mentioned limitations occurring for 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy of non-hydrated zeolites Y. It is interestingly to note that the base strength of probe molecules is reflected by the variation of the second-order quadrupolar effect (SOQE) value of the framework aluminum atoms in the non-hydrated zeolites. The occurrence of a proton transfer from the catalyst to the probe molecules is necessary to detect the framework aluminum by 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy in moderate magnetic fields (ca. 9. 4 T). It is demonstrated that a proton affinity (PA) of the adsorbate molecules of ca. 850 kJ/mol is required to induce a proton transfer from the zeolite framework to the adsorbate compounds. In addition, other effects could influence the observation of framework aluminum by 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy, such as, the size of probe molecules. The quantitative evaluation shows that the adsorption capacity of pyridine is hindering the detection of all framework aluminum atoms by both 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy in moderate magnetic fields. 27 Al spin-echo, high-speed MAS (nrot = 30 kHz), and MQMAS NMR spectroscopy in magnetic fields of B 0 = 9. 4, 14. 1, and 17. 6 T were applied for the study of aluminum species at extra-framework positions in non-hydrated zeolites Y. Non-hydrated g-Al 2 O 3, aluminum-exchanged zeolite Y (Al,Na-Y) and parent zeolite H,Na-Y were utilized as reference materials. The solid-state 27 Al NMR spectra of steamed zeolite deH,Na-Y/ 81. 5 were found to consist of four signals. The broad low-field signal is caused by a superposition of the signals of tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum atoms in the vicinity of bridging hydroxyl protons and framework aluminum atoms compensated in their negative charge by aluminium cations (diso = 70 ± 10 ppm, CQCC = 15. 0 ± 1. 0 MHz). The second signal is due to a superposition of the signals of framework aluminum atoms compensated by sodium cations and tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum atoms in neutral extra-framework aluminum oxide clusters (diso = 65 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 8. 0 ± 0. 5 MHz). The residual two signals were attributed to aluminum cations (diso = 35 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 7. 5 ± 0. 5 MHz) and octahedrally coordinated aluminum atoms in neutral extra-framework aluminum oxide clusters (diso = 10 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 5. 0 ± 0. 5 MHz). By chemical analysis and evaluating the relative solid-state 27 Al NMR intensities of the different signals of aluminum species occurring in non-hydrated zeolite deH,Na-Y/ 81. 5, the aluminum distribution in this material could be determined. Die Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie ist eine sehr empfindliche Methode für die Untersuchung der lokalen Struktur von kristallinen Alumosilicaten, wie z. B. von mikroporösen Zeolithen, die sowohl in der heterogenen Katalyse, als auch und in Adsorptionsprozessen breite Anwendungen finden. Daher wird die Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie der atomaren Bausteine der Zeolithe, wie z. B. von 1 H, 23 Na, 29 Si, 27 Al und 17 O, häufig für die Charakterisierung des Gerüstes und der Oberflächenzentren dieser Materialien verwendet [1 - 8]. Außerdem können durch Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie, neben der chemischen Natur von Adsorbaten, auch Wechselwirkungen dieser Moleküle mit Gerüstatomen und aktiven Zentren aufgeklärt werden [9 - 11]. Aluminiumatome in dealuminierten Zeolithen können in verschiedenen chemischen Umgebungen vorliegen, u. a. als tetraedrisch koordinierte Gerüstaluminiumatome, als verzerrt tetraedrisch koordiniertes Gerüst- oder Extragerüstaluminium, als fünffach koordinierte Extragerüstaluminiumspezies und als oktaedrisch koordinierte Aluminiumatome außerhalb des Gerüstes oder als flexibel koordinierte Gerüstaluminiumatome an Defektstellen. Bis jetzt wurden die meisten Festkörper-NMR-Untersuchungen von Zeolithen an hydratisierten Proben durchgeführt [11 - 16]. Die Charakterisierung fester Katalysatoren in einem Zustand, der mit ihrer Anwendung in katalytischen Prozessen vergleichbar ist, erfordert jedoch die Untersuchung calcinierter und nicht hydratisierter Materialien. 27 Al-Spin-Echo-NMR-Untersuchungen an dehydratisierten Zeolithen mit FAU- und MFI-Struktur lieferten Quadrupolkopplungskonstanten CQCC der Gerüstaluminiumatome von bis zu 16 MHz [1]. Diese hohen CQCC-Werte resultieren aus einer Abnahme der lokalen Symmetrie der AlO 4 -Tetraeder aufgrund unterschiedlicher A-O-Bindungsabstände. Bei mittleren magnetischen Feldstärken, z. B. von B 0 = 9, 4 T, können die 27 Al-NMR-Signale der oben erwähnten Gerüstaluminiumatome wegen ihrer starken Verbreiterung nicht mit der MAS-Technik detektiert werden. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Möglichkeiten und Grenzen der Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie für die Charakterisierung dealuminierter Zeolithe im dehydratisierten Zustand untersucht und diskutiert. In einem ersten Schritt wurden die Zeolithe zunächst auf klassische Weise, d. h. im hydratisierten Zustand charakterisiert. In einem zweiten Schritt wurden anschließend NMR-Experimente an dehydratisierten Proben mit verschiedenen Festkörper-NMR-Techniken und bei unterschiedlichen NMR-Feldstärken durchgeführt. Zur Untersuchung der Aluminiumspezies in Zeolithen wurde eine Reihe von dealuminierten Y-Zeolithen mit 2, 8 &# 8804; nSi/nAl &# 8804; 60 durch Behandlung mit Wasserdampf präpariert. Dazu wurde der Zeolith H,Na-Y mit Wasserdampfpartialdrücken zwischen 3, 4 und 81, 5 kPa bei einer Temperatur von 748 K behandelt. Durch Röntgenpulverdiffraktometrie (XRD) wurde festgestellt, dass die Kristallinität der Materialien unter den oben erwähnten Bedingungen erhalten bleibt. i) 	Charakterisierung von Aluminiumspezies auf Gerüst- und Extragerüstpositionen in hydratisiertem Zeolith Y durch Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie Die hydratisierten Materialien wurden durch 29 Si-MAS-NMR-, 27 Al-MAS-NMR-, Hochfeld- 27 Al-MQMAS- und 1 H-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie charakterisiert. Nach Adsorption von Ammoniak wurde an dem dealuminierten Zeolith in der H-Form ein Koordinationswechsel von oktaedrisch zu tetraedrisch koordinierten Aluminiumatomen gefunden. Quantitative 29 Si-, 27 Al- und 1 H-MAS-NMR-Untersuchungen zeigten, dass dieser Koordinationswechsel mit der Bildung Brønsted-saurer Zentren (SiOHAl-Gruppen) in den dehydratisierten Materialien gekoppelt ist, während nur eine geringe Abnahme der Anzahl der Silanolgruppen (SiOH) und keine systematische Änderung der Anzahl der AlOH-Gruppen beobachtet wurde. Anhand dieser Resultate wurde ein Modell für den Koordinationswechsel von Gerüstaluminiumatomen in dealuminierten Zeolithen H-Y vorgeschlagen, nach dem dreifach koordinierte Gerüstaluminiumatome in der Nähe von Si-O-Defektstellen auftreten. Diese Aluminiumatome liegen in der hydratisierten Form in einer oktaedrischen Koordination vor. Nach Adsorption von Ammoniak auf dem dehydratisierten Material kommt es zur Ausbildung von Si-O-Al-Brücken unter Ausheilung der vorherigen Si-O-Defektstellen. Dreifach koordinierte Gerüstaluminiumatome vollziehen hierbei einen Koordinationswechsel zu vierfach koordinierten Gerüstaluminiumatomen und liegen in dieser Form auch nach der Hydratisierung vor. Nach der thermischen Zersetzung der an den Si-O-Al-Brücken vorhandenen Ammoniumionen wurde die Bildung zusätzlicher Brønsted-Säurezentren festgestellt. Weiterhin ergaben die NMR-Untersuchungen der Säurezentren in dealuminierten Zeolithen, dass eine Rehydratisierung des Probenmaterials direkt nach der Dealuminierung zu einer starken Veränderung der Hydroxylbedeckung führt, evtl. gekoppelt mit einer Veränderung der Natur der Extragerüstaluminiumspezies. Daher waren Untersuchungen an dehydratisierten Zeolithen wünschenswert. Dieser Zustand der Proben entspricht auch eher dem Zustand von Zeolithkatalysatoren in ihrem industriellen Einsatz. ii) 	Untersuchung der Ladungsbilanz zwischen Gerüst- und Extragerüstaluminiumspezies im dehydratisierten Zeolith Y durch Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie Um die dealuminierten Zeolithe im dehydratisierten Zustand charakterisieren zu können, wurden die Proben sofort nach der Dealuminierung unter trockenem Stickstoff luftdicht abgefüllt. Hierzu wurde die Dealuminierungsapparatur mit einer Luftschleuse verbunden. Durch 29 Si-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie wurde in den Spektren der dehydratisierten Proben im Vergleich zu denen der hydratisierten Materialien eine starke Hochfeldverschiebung der Si(3 Al) - und Si(2 Al) -Signale beobachtet. Als Erklärung dafür kommt Folgendes in Betracht: i) Eine durch die Dehydratisierung verursachte Veränderung der Nahstruktur der Gerüst-AlO 4 -Tetraeder oder ii) der Einfluss hochgeladener Extragerüstkationen. Für die eindeutige Zuordnung der Signalverschiebungen zu einer dieser Erklärungen wurde Zeolith Y mit unterschiedlichen H+- bzw. Al 3 +-Austauschgraden mit der Festkörper- NMR-Spektroskopie untersucht. Die experimentellen Daten wiesen eindeutig darauf hin, dass der Hauptgrund für die Hochfeldverschiebungen der 29 Si-MAS-NMR-Signale der dehydratisierten Proben die Veränderung der Nahstruktur der Gerüst-AlO 4 -Tetrader aufgrund von Veränderungen der Al-O-Bindungslängen während der Dehydratisierung ist. Im Gegensatz dazu resultieren aus der Anwesenheit von Extragerüstaluminiumkationen lediglich eine geringe Hochfeldverschiebung von ca. 1 ppm sowie eine Verbreiterung der Si(nAl) -Signale, wahrscheinlich aufgrund von 29 Si- 27 Al-Kopplungen. Mit der 29 Si-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie wurde für dealuminierte Zeolithe, die mit zunehmend höheren Wasserdampfpartialdrücken behandelt worden waren, eine systematische Abnahme der Anzahl der Gerüstaluminiumatome in den dehydratisierten Materialien beobachtet. Die Anzahl der dreifach koordinierten Gerüstaluminiumatome in den dehydratisierten Zeolithen wurde anhand der Zunahme der Konzentration an Si-O-Al-Brücken nach Adsorption von Ammoniak per 1 H-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie bestimmt. Durch einen quantitativen Vergleich der Anzahl an tetraedrisch koordinierten Gerüstaluminiumatomen, aufgrund derer die Gerüstladung zustande kommt, mit der Anzahl an ladungskompensierenden Natriumkationen und SiOHAl-Gruppen wurde die durchschnittliche Ladung der Extragerüstaluminiumkationen berechnet. Dieser durchschnittliche Wert pro Extragerüstaluminiumatom variierte zwischen ca. + 2 für schwach dealuminierte Zeolithe und ca. + 0, 5 für stark dealuminierte Proben. iii) 	Bestimmung der Anzahl und Natur von Gerüstaluminiumatomen in dehydratisiertem Zeolith Y durch Adsorption von Sondenmolekülen Die Charakterisierung von Zeolithkatalysatoren durch Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie an Proben im hydratisierten Zustand ist oft von einer unkontrollierten Hydrolyse des Zeolithgerüsts sowie einer Veränderung der Natur von Extragerüstaluminiumspezies verbunden. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird gezeigt, dass die Limitierungen der 29 Si- und 27 Al-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie an dehydratisierten Zeolithen mit FAU-Struktur, wie z. B. eine deutlich schlechtere Auflösung und eine signifikante Verbreiterung von Signalen, durch Adsorption von Ammoniak überwunden werden können. Die 29 Si-MAS-NMR-Spektren von dehydratisierten und mit Ammoniak beladenen Zeolithen weisen keine durch die Dehydratisierung verursachten Hochfeldverschiebungen der Si(nAl) -Signale (mit n = 3, 2, 1) auf, die im Allgemeinen für eine Verschlechterung der Auflösung der Spektren im dehydratisierten Zustand verantwortlich sind. Die 27 Al-MAS-NMR-Spektren von dehydratisierten und mit Ammoniak beladenen Zeolithen bestehen ausschließlich aus Signalen, die tetraedrisch koordinierten Gerüstaluminiumatomen zuzuordnen sind. Diese Signale weisen spektroskopische Parameter auf, die denen von hydratisierten Proben entsprechen. Die Gerüstaluminiumgehalte, die durch die quantitative Auswertung der 29 Si- und 27 Al-MAS-NMR-Spektren dehydratisierter Proben erhalten wurden, stimmen gut überein. Neben der Adsorption von Ammoniak wurde auch die Adsorption von Pyridin, Aceton und Acetonitril an dehydratisierten Zeolithen mittels Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie untersucht. Interessanterweise spiegelt sich dabei die Protonenaffinität der Sondenmoleküle in einer Veränderung der Quadrupolkopplungskonstante der Gerüstaluminiumatome in den dehydratisierten Proben wider. Um Gerüstaluminiumatome mit Hilfe der 27 Al-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie bei mittleren magnetischen Feldstärken (z. B. B 0 = 9, 4 T) detektieren zu können, muss ein Protonentransfer von den Brücken-OH-Gruppen zu den Sondenmolekülen erfolgen. Weiterhin kann die Größe der Sondenmoleküle die Beobachtbarkeit von Gerüstaluminiumatomen in den 27 Al-MAS-NMR-Spektren beeinflussen. Quantitative Auswertungen zeigten, dass aufgrund der begrenzten Adsorptionskapazität der starken Base Pyridin nicht alle Gerüstaluminiumatome in den bei mittleren magnetischen Feldstärken aufgenommenen 29 Si- und 27 Al-MAS-NMR-Spektren beobachtet werden können. Aus dem Einfluss der verschiedenen Sondenmoleküle auf die Quadrupolkopplungskonstanten der Gerüstaluminiumatome im dehydratisierten Zeolith Y konnte abgeleitet werden, dass eine Protonenaffinität der Sondenmoleküle von ca. 850 kJ/mol notwendig ist, um den o. g. Protonentransfer von den Brücken-OH-Gruppen zu den Sondenmolekülen zu bewirken. iv) 	Untersuchung der Extragerüstaluminiumspezies im dehydratisierten Zeolith Y mittels 27 Al-Spin-Echo-NMR-Spektroskopie, 27 Al-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie mit schneller Probenrotation und 27 Al-MQMAS-NMR-Spektroskopie bei magnetischen Flussdichten von 9, 4 bis 17, 6 T Für diese erstmalig durchgeführten Untersuchungen an deluminierten Zeolithen im dehydratisierten Zustand wurden dehydratisiertes g-Al 2 O 3 sowie ein mit Aluminiumkationen ausgetauschter Zeolith Al,Na-Y und ein Zeolith H,Na-Y als Referenzmaterialien verwendet. Die Festkörper- 27 Al-NMR-Spektren des dealuminierten Zeoliths deH,Na-Y/ 81, 5 wiesen vier verschiedene Signale auf. Ein breites Signal bei niedrigem Feld (diso = 70 ± 10 ppm, CQCC = 15. 0 ± 1. 0 MHz) wird durch eine Überlagerung der Signale von Gerüstaluminiumatomen in der Nahstruktur von Brücken-OH-Gruppen und von Gerüstaluminiumatomen verursacht, deren negative Ladung durch Extragerüstaluminiumkationen kompensiert wird. Ein schmales Signal bei niederem Feld (diso = 65 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 8. 0 ± 0. 5 MHz) kann Gerüstaluminiumatomen zugeordnet werden, deren Ladung von Natriumkationen kompensiert wird, als auch tetraedrisch koordinierten Aluminiumatomen in Extragerüstaluminiumoxidclustern. Weitere zwei Signale werden durch Aluminiumkationen (diso = 35 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 7. 5 ± 0. 5 MHz) und oktaedrisch koordinierte Aluminiumatomen in Extragerüstaluminiumoxidclustern (diso = 10 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 5. 0 ± 0. 5 MHz) erkärt. Durch Elementaranalyse und Auswertung der relativen Signalintensitäten der verschiedenen Aluminiumspezies in den 27 Al-Spin-Echo- und MAS-NMR-Spektren des dehydratisierten Zeoliths konnte die Aluminiumverteilung in dieser Probe bestimmt werden...|$|E
