40|$|Nose art is an {{important}} component of any combat aircraft’s markings. Nose art not only helps to boost crew morale, esprit de corps and instill pride in the service, but it also adds a distinct character to the aircraft. Although the subject of current nose art has changed since the classic “pin up” girls of the 1940 s, today’s artowrk is just as interesting and worthy of study.

Each child has a unique history—a story that gives us insights when we interact, plan our classroom community, and design our instruction. Children who have a primary language other than English have stories that they can communicate to others {{in a variety of}} ways. By becoming aware of children's histories, we focus on them as people first and language learners second.

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>article</b> explores artistic {{representations}} of Australian seas and coasts, {{and the power}} of art to sustain seas and coasts. Research into artworks at the National Gallery of Australia was supplemented with a study of other local public and private works. A number of substantive themes emerged in viewing the paintings; the sea and coast has been represented as: sea country, sovereign territory, sublime spaces, a Romantic space of yearning, a psychological journey, a literal journey, a site of social and political comment, social places, ecological places and a site for industry. We discuss these themes, reflecting on the various expressions of human-sea relations and the cultural, political and ideological values that inform the <b>artworks.</b> <b>This</b> <b>article</b> points to possible artistic {{representations of}} sustainable seas and coasts. In turning to the power of art in sea and coastal sustainability, we discuss the potential of art to create shifts in consciousness and relationships by challenging humans to imagine the sea differently...|$|R
40|$|Aboriginal art {{has been}} the source of much {{contention}} between art curators, gallery owners, art critics and Aboriginal artists themselves. Early aesthetic debates about whether so-called traditional works should be considered ethnographic or artistic have led, at times, to conflicts over the rights of Aboriginal people to have their works exhibited according to the criteria applied to other kinds of Western <b>artworks.</b> <b>This</b> <b>article</b> explores how the dilemmas of troubled ethno-histories are critically embodied and reconfigured in texture and colour. It considers the problems that silenced histories pose for those responsible for their display to the public. As Aboriginal images often conceal troubled intercultural encounters it asks how artworks can be used to provide a counter-polemic to national rhetoric as artists seek to reshape and improve intergenerational futures. This text is published as a counterpart to the contribution to Disturbing Pasts from the artist Heather Kamarra Shearer...|$|R
40|$|Nicholas Bourriaud’s (2002) {{relational}} aesthetics interprets art {{as social}} or political in nature, underemphasising aesthetic concerns {{such as the}} creating of objects as <b>artworks.</b> <b>This</b> <b>article</b> aims to problematise the relational model from a material point of view, based on a “new aesthetics” which Jacques Ranciére discusses {{as a mode of}} art-making which he titles “inventory”. In order to do so the article addresses a spectator-orientated artwork entitled Secret/Wish, conceived along with artist Paul Cooper, and installed at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa in 2011. In previous publications on the work I questioned its significance as relational and site-specific according to Nicholas Bourriaud and Miwon Kwon’s theories. I would like to further interrogate their ideas here by investigating Secret/Wish as rooted in the production of authored objects despite its affinity with Bourriaud and Kwon’s perspectives, which denounce the art object as pivotal to artistic production...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s and early 1990 s I was privileged {{to work with}} the {{computer}} animation pioneer John Whitney Sr. and was profoundly influenced by his ideas on how to apply musical concepts of harmony to visual arts of motion. {{at the time of his}} death in 1995, he and I were planning composition software in which an artist could apply these concepts to create harmonic patterns simultaneously in sound and animation. Though this idea was never realized beyond certain tests, I have taken this step in my subsequent work in computer-generated music and video in ways inspired by, if distinct from, Whitney 2 ̆ 7 s early <b>artworks.</b> <b>This</b> <b>article</b> examines ways in which Whitney 2 ̆ 7 s ideas can be applied to musical composition, and in particular to ways in which I have extrapolated principles from these ideas to create an artistic correspondence between abstract animation and computer music...|$|R

40|$|Migration generations play {{a central}} role in {{structuring}} and mediating relations in immigrant-background groups and are important conceptual categories for understanding how these groups change over time. Yet, in both research and practice, communicating the complexities of intergenerational relations and generational change can be challenging. Tacit, sensuous, affective and embodied aspects of generations frequently evade capture in conventional research approaches, while generational differences can impede understanding within immigrant-background families and communities. Arts-based research, through its engagement with alternative modes of knowing and understanding, and its capacity to reach beyond the academy and across generations, offers possibilities for addressing both of these challenges. Via an account of a collaborative arts-based research project exploring Vietnamese Australian generations, and focusing on two of the <b>artworks</b> produced, <b>this</b> <b>article</b> demonstrates the potential of arts-based research to contribute to producing and sharing knowledge about intergenerational relations and generational change in immigrant-background communities...|$|R

In November 2008, the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), Toronto, Canada, opened new Canadian art gallery halls, with 2, 000 new acquisitions donated by Ken Thomson.

40|$|The ArtWorks {{programme}} {{has succeeded}} in generating deeper insights into the realities of participatory arts practice in the United Kingdom, in particular the conditions needed to achieve quality {{and the extent to}} which these are enabled. In parallel with ArtWorks research, in 2014 Creative Scotland commissioned a detailed analysis of the extant ‘body of knowledge’ concerning quality, which uncovered a number of generic concepts of quality held in the commercial world, which are of profound relevance to the participatory arts and the questions currently being explored by the sector. When such ‘global’ perspectives – about the inherent nature of quality, how to ‘build it in’ to a product and how to manage quality outputs – are considered alongside evidence and testimony from the sector captured by ArtWorks, several important learning points emerge: One, that quality does not reside just in the art or work undertaken with participants ‘on the day’ but stems from a holistic process consisting of several preceding phases including conception, design and planning, each of which contain quality components. Two: quality in the participatory arts is not solely determined by the artist and what they deliver ‘in the room’, but is directly affected by a range of key decision makers some of whom may be far removed from the project itself, but who nonetheless influence whether the experience of the participants is a quality one. Three: there are recognizable essential preconditions for quality that appear to be common across participatory arts practice. Many of these are outside the artist’s direct control and are often missing from projects, undermining the chances of quality experiences for participants. The seminal theory of US researchers Seidel et al. constructing the interconnectedness of decision makers provides vital context for appreciating the roles and responsibilities of a wider group of stakeholders (including commissioners, employers and funders) in the achievement of quality experiences for participants. These observations lead to important recommendations for greater stakeholder engagement and responsibility; again gaining especial pertinence in light of evidence generated by <b>ArtWorks.</b> <b>This</b> <b>article</b> outlines each of these points in detail, reconstructing the logical development of key insights contained in the Creative Scotland report, which was researched and written by this author. The core components of an optimum quality system are proposed and represented as features of a holistic framework...|$|R
40|$|In <b>this</b> <b>article</b> {{the author}} {{considers}} psychoanalytic transference {{in the context}} of contemporary art. The author focuses on the work of artists who have been in psychoanalysis and have put this personal material to use within their creative practice, and argues that these artworks enact the experience of being in analysis. Using an expanded understanding of transference wherein the fantasy and reality experienced in the ‘here and now’ of the consulting room is transposed onto sites of cultural production, the author considers the very real and often disruptive emotional and psychological affects that {{are a part of the}} viewer’s experience of these <b>artworks.</b> In <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> the author asks: When we are with such work, what do we experience? How might we respond and engage with such intimate work? What is being required of us as viewers? Are we being invited to participate in a form of psychoanalytic therapy? Who is the analyst? Who is the patient? If psychoanalysis is a process of transformation, what do these practices and our engagement with them encourage us to risk personally, socially, and politically? It is in considering these questions that we are able to move from the intimate life of the consulting room to an intimately complex psychic, social, and political world. Ultimately, the author aims to find a space in which the individual affects (such as anxiety and crying) experienced while fully engaging with an artwork (through transference) can be dissipated or released, as a form of subjective transformation, and ultimately be mobilized as a form of political and collective action...|$|R
40|$|Children's artwork {{displays}} are {{a distinct}} and key feature {{of early childhood}} classrooms. The artwork produced by young children {{in the classroom is}} often linked to the educational program. After the completion of the art projects, early childhood educators face the challenge of displaying the children's artwork. With minimal research available on the 'how to' aspects of displaying children's art, educators rely on traditional methods of display, such as fair and equitable representation. Based on a selection of findings from a doctoral research conducted with {{children between the ages of}} four and six, <b>this</b> <b>article</b> offers early childhood educators (and adults, generally) insight into young children's lived experiences of the display of their own visual <b>artwork.</b> Discussed in <b>this</b> <b>article</b> are three key themes that were identified in the doctoral study that offer guidance towards a new method for displaying children's artwork. These include: (1) the practices of making and displaying art cannot be separated; (2) decisions about the display of children's visual artwork are made by adults; and (3) art experiences directly impact the lives of young children. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> asserts that adult sensitivity and acknowledgement of children's rights are essential aspects of the decision-making process associated with displaying children's artwork.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show how Japonisme was {{introduced}} to Europe in the late 19 th century and how it influenced artists in major cities. Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e), especially those of Hokusai and Hiroshige, fascinated the Impressionists and other contemporaries such as Claude Monet (1840 - 1926), Vincent van Gogh (1853 - 1890), and James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834 - 1903). Many of them adopted japonaiserie motifs in their paintings or sculptures, and it formed a major artistic trend called Japonisme. The Lithuanian composer and painter Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (1875 - 1911) was also influenced by the trend of Japonisme, especially from the paintings of the Impressionists or through artists in Poland. In Poland and Russia, Japanese artworks were imported by artists who had studied abroad, or by wealthy bourgeoisie such as Feliks “Manggha” Jasieński (1861 - 1929), a Polish collector whose nickname was directly associated with Japonisme, and Sergey Kitaev (1864 - 1927), an ardent Russian collector of Japanese <b>artworks.</b> In <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> Japonisme in European art in general will be outlined, together with similar tendencies in Čiurlionis’ paintings, and then, examples of Japonisme-influenced paintings in Poland and Russia will be briefly shown. Finally, by focusing on Čiurlionis’ paintings, it will be shown how he adopted Japonisme in three stages. In the first stage japonaiserie motifs were only partially borrowed. In the second stage ukiyo-e’s motifs and pictorial schemes were applied to his paintings, and finally, in the third stage of borrowing, expressions of Japanese motifs in his most sublime style will be shown...|$|R

Ossify (2009), a glass sculpture, was commissioned by Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens for its permanent collection and exhibited in Collected Fragments (2009 - 10), an international group exhibition focused on artists working creatively with taxonomy and collection. The paper describes the development of an 'ethno/graphic' method, to provide an example of an artistic interpretation of museum ethnography, and to make explicit a technique that embeds graphic images in glass.

40|$|Biblical wisdom {{literature}} is a treasure-trove of powerful metaphors. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> presents {{a sample of}} these metaphors and their significant impact on contemporary artwork. The impact is characterized by both appropriation and adaptation, similitude and analogy, respectively. The highlighted metaphors are not merely catalogued but, more or less, analyzed with regard to relevant contemporary <b>artwork.</b> <b>This</b> augments the importance of contemporary biblical literacy analysis and uses {{it as one of}} the tools by which it is possible to gauge the impact and interaction, in this case, of the metaphor-world of the wisdom tradition on contemporary art. More importantly, however, this study underscores the relevance of these metaphors for biblical exegesis, hermeneutics, and theology. The analysis of the reception of these metaphors in contemporary artworks undergirds and informs the process of interpretation. The reception of these metaphors in their contemporary art contexts is best understood within the framework of imagery and imagistic language. Metaphor, as a subset of imagery and imagistic language, is foundational for the examined wisdom books, Proverbs, Job, and Qoheleth, and for the relevant contemporary artwork, alike. Moreover, metaphor also constitutes a bridge between the ancient and contemporary context. With this backdrop in mind, <b>this</b> <b>article</b> argues for the necessity of exploring the connections between these wisdom books, metaphor studies, and contemporary artwork...|$|R

It demonstrates how the artwork created opportunities for exploration and discovery involving playfulness, mutual engagement and the creation of a collaborative aesthetic response. The analysis served to inform the design of other interactive installations and exhibits and helped to reveal the highly variable and contingent forms of participation that can be provoked by particular <b>artworks.</b> <b>This</b> work continues the collaboration between the artist and social scientists at the Work Interaction and Technology Research Centre, King’s College London. Jason Cleverly provided the background and identified a number of the key themes that inform the structure of the paper. He drew out the relevance of the arguments for design, communication and aesthetics. The article examines the growing interest amongst artists and curators in designing art works which create new forms of visual communication and enhance interaction in museums and galleries. Despite extraordinary advances in the analysis of talk and discourse, there is relatively little research concerned with conduct and collaboration with and around aesthetic objects and artefacts.
