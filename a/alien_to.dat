Although Johner unsuccessfully attempts to dominate her sexually, Wren dominates her with physical force and a dehumanizing attitude. In a 2013 Total Film interview, writer Joss Whedon expressed discontent with the casting of J. E. Freeman; the character was intended to have a mysterious element in his unscrupulous activities, which was overshadowed by typecasting.|$|E

5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} saucers positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> Area 51, where Thomas' group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.|$|E

The piece employed techniques like scenes, dialogue and third-person narrative that were common in fiction, but still rare in journalism.|$|E

5|$|By {{this stage}} McCudden was {{suffering}} from combat fatigue. It manifested itself in his decisions, of late, to seek a victory at any price, which was <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> his normal, calculated approach to combat. Knowing he was to soon be sent home, he was obsessed with catching up to von Richthofen's score. His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured. As Flight Commander, B Flight, McCudden's pilots had shot down 77–52 of which were his—while losing four pilots. To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier General John Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng, General Officer Commanding the British Third Army, to be personally congratulated.|$|E
5|$|In From <b>Alien</b> <b>to</b> The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney {{writes that}} Harold Andrews bullies Ellen Ripley, who is {{demoralized}} {{after the events}} of the first two Alien films. According to Kaveney, Andrews' method of directing the prison from monitors is ironic because David Fincher directed the film the same way (which Sigourney Weaver disliked). In David Fincher: Films That Scar, a literary analysis of the director, Mark Browning writes that Harold Andrews' totalitarian control of Fury 161 exempts Dillon's religiosity because Andrews views religion as a tool to prevent violence and provide control. Film critic Malcolm Johnson wrote in a Hartford Courant review that Andrews was a petty but potent dictator, similar to Benito Mussolini.|$|E

The bird observed in Dzeng was in an environment <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> the species' normal coniferous forest environs, and both the Dzeng and Tse individuals had atypically pale underparts, indicating they may have been nominate S. leucopsis, but with genetic introgression traits from Przevalski's nuthatch.|$|E

5|$|Perlman, a {{frequent}} collaborator with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, {{said in a}} 2009 AMC Networks featurette that Alien Resurrection was his only film in which he feared for his life. During the filming of the underwater scene, Perlman struggled with the aquatic set and nearly drowned {{because he could not}} reach its openings. In a character-breaking occurrence, Perlman nearly compromised a shot of Sigourney Weaver making a basket from behind but editor Hervé Schneid was able to remove Perlman's reaction from the scene. In From <b>Alien</b> <b>to</b> The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney interprets Johner and Number 8 as monogamous animals, with a weaker, aggressive male unsuccessfully attempting to seduce a stronger female.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into six environments, each {{representing}} a different setting from the film. To accomplish {{the objective of the}} game, the player must guide E.T. into the wells. Once all items found in a well are collected, the player must levitate E.T. out of them. An icon at the top of each screen represents the current area, each area enabling the player to perform different actions. Antagonists include a scientist who takes E.T. for observation and an FBI agent who chases the <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> confiscate one of the collected telephone pieces, or candy. The game offers diverse difficulty settings that affect the number and speed of humans present, and the conditions needed to accomplish the objective.|$|E

5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott {{he was not}} a fan of science-fiction or horror films; Scott replied that he was not either, but {{expected}} <b>Alien</b> <b>to</b> do well. According to Stanton, he was pleased with the film and said it and Pretty in Pink are the films for which he is best recognized. Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene hinted that Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E
5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> the late-Medieval painter.|$|E
5|$|Henriksen {{was one of}} {{the several}} actors, {{including}} Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, cast in Aliens who had collaborated with James Cameron on The Terminator. Roz Kaveney, in her analysis of Ash in From <b>Alien</b> <b>to</b> The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, draws parallels to Bishop as a representation of the Three Laws of Robotics. Although Ash's programming allows (and encourages) harming humans, Bishop puts human life above all else in accordance with the First Law of Robotics. Bishop was studied by LeiLani Nishime of the University of Texas Press in 2005 as a theoretical dramatization of how humans would deal with the presence of an Other, concerning Ripley's initial apprehension about being near a synthetic after her life-threatening encounter with Ash. According to an article by Anton Karl Kozlovic of the University of Nebraska Omaha, Bishop's altruistic actions (which include rescuing Newt and Ripley) contradict a trend towards technophobia in pre-1990 films.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} many {{religions}} are interpreted by von Däniken as reactions to encounters with an <b>alien</b> race.

Von Däniken claims that the oral and written traditions of most religions contain references <b>to</b> <b>alien</b> visitors {{in the way of}} descriptions of stars and vehicular objects travelling through air and space. One such is Ezekiel's revelation in the Old Testament, which Däniken interprets as a detailed description of a landing spacecraft (The Spaceships of Ezekiel).|$|R

5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E
5|$|In the Grolier Codex captives {{are shown}} bound with cords leading to their necks, however {{the most common}} {{convention}} in Mesoamerican art is the depiction of captives bound by the arms or wrists. Some of the figures in the codex represent deities (on pages 1–2, 4–6 and 9) and some represent mortal warriors without supernatural attributes (on pages 3, 7 and 8). Both the deities and the mortals are performing the same actions such as the capture of a prisoner, or conquest symbolised by a spear passing through a temple. Although the codex depicts the stations of Venus, none of the warlike figures is identified with attributes normally associated with the planet in Maya or central Mexican art. On page 9, a bound captive is depicted from a high point of view {{with a sense of}} perspective that French Mesoamericanist and iconographer Claude-François Baudez considers <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> Mesoamerican art. God K (K'awiil) is depicted twice in the codex. However, his attributes are inconsistent with other pre-Columbian depictions, as he is shown with human incisors instead of snake fangs.|$|E
5|$|When Leo IV died in October 780, his {{sole heir}} {{was the young}} Constantine VI, his son by the Empress Irene of Athens. Due to Constantine's being underage, a regency was instituted under Irene, {{but this was not}} well {{received}} among leading officials. Not only was rule by a woman <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> the military-dominated establishment of the time, but Irene was also a confirmed iconophile, an adherent of the veneration of holy images. This was regarded as heresy by the state-sponsored doctrine of Iconoclasm, which was especially popular with the army and the officials loyal to Constantine V's memory. A number of them, including the Postal Logothete (foreign minister) Gregory, the former strategos (governor) of the Anatolic Theme Bardas and Constantine, the commander of the Excubitors guard regiment, consequently favoured the rise of Nikephoros to the imperial throne. Barely {{a month and a half}} after Leo's death, the plot was discovered. Irene had the conspirators exiled, and Nikephoros and his younger brothers were ordained as priests, removing them from the line of succession. To confirm this before the people, on Christmas Day 780, Nikephoros and his brothers were forced to perform the communion service in the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
