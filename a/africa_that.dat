The resulting furore nearly caused him to lose the captaincy, and threatened the unity of the West Indies team itself.|$|E

5|$|After the 4–0 series {{win over}} England, which was Bradman's {{farewell}} series, Morris became Australia's vice-captain and {{was expected to}} be its leading batsman. He started well, scoring two centuries during Australia's first series in the post-Bradman era, a tour to South <b>Africa</b> <b>that</b> saw Australia win the Test series 4–0. By the end of the South African tour, Morris had amassed nine Test centuries and his batting average was over 65, but thereafter his form declined. Australia increasingly fell on hard times as the core of Bradman's team aged and retired. Morris was overlooked for the captaincy and then briefly dropped as his cricketing prowess waned. His career ended after his first wife became terminally ill. Later in his life, Morris served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{apartheid}}, when apartheid legislation {{had been}} repealed, Springbok colours started to be issued to non-whites again. In 1994, following the election of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress, the National Colours Board {{was set up to}} control the distribution of Springbok colours. Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours following the replacement of the Springbok by the Protea following a government demand. The only sporting body in South <b>Africa</b> <b>that</b> was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E

5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern <b>Africa</b> <b>that</b> had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
5|$|In ODI cricket, Chanderpaul's debut came {{seven months}} after his first Test appearance, {{but he was not}} {{required}} to bat as the West Indies reached the target to beat India. He scored his maiden ODI century shortly after his first Test century, in May 1997 against India, scoring 109 runs. He reached his highest ODI score in 1999, making 150 runs during a West Indian record partnership of 226 with Carl Hooper, against South <b>Africa.</b> <b>That</b> innings, along with his score of 149 not out against India in 2007 are the only times he has finished a century innings with a strike rate of quicker than a-run-a-ball in ODI cricket.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes do {{not occur}} in the Atlantic Ocean.

Sea snakes {{do not occur}} in the Red Sea, believed to be due to its increased salinity, so no danger exists of them crossing through the Suez Canal.

5|$|The Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) was a {{statement}} adopted by the Cabinet of Rhodesia on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia, a British territory in southern <b>Africa</b> <b>that</b> had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, {{it was the first}} unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the United States Declaration of Independence nearly two centuries before. Britain, the Commonwealth and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an unrecognised state with the assistance of South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} {{carnivorous}} member of the Hyaenidae. Unlike its brown and striped cousins, the spotted hyena is a predator, not a scavenger; this has been shown since the 1960s. One of the earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by Hans Kruuk, an African wildlife ecologist, and he showed through a 7-year study of hyena populations in <b>Africa</b> <b>that</b> spotted hyenas hunt as much as lions, and with later studies this {{has been shown to}} be the average in all areas of Africa. However spotted hyenas remain being mislabeled as scavengers, often even by ecologists and wildlife documentary channels.|$|E
5|$|While the {{persecution}} under Constantius was relatively light, {{there is no}} doubt about the force of {{the persecution}} in Maximian's domain. Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity.

5|$|Although {{hampered}} by injuries during the 1905 season for Repton, his last at the school, Crawford scored 766 runs with a batting average of 85. In the five matches {{in which he}} was fit to bowl he took 55 wickets at an average under 13. In the August holidays, he returned to play for Surrey. In his second game, he took seven for 90 against Yorkshire and in his third, he scored his maiden first-class century—119 not out against Derbyshire—to become the youngest centurion for the county, a record that was not broken until 2013. Later, he took eight for 24 against Northamptonshire and scored 142 not out against Leicestershire. At the end of the season, he played in the Hastings Festival, appearing in several representative games for teams representing the South of England and played for the Rest of England against the County Champions Yorkshire. Crawford finished second in Surrey's batting averages for 1905; in all first-class games he scored 543 runs at an average of 33.93 and took 47 wickets at an average of 18.46. As the season ended, he was invited by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to join their tour of South <b>Africa</b> <b>that</b> winter.|$|E
5|$|An earlier fleet {{had been}} the first to reach India by circumnavigating <b>Africa.</b> <b>That</b> {{expedition}} had been led by Vasco da Gama and returned to Portugal in 1499. For decades Portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the East, in order to bypass the Mediterranean Sea which was {{under the control of the}} Italian Maritime Republics and the Ottoman Empire. Portugal's expansionism would lead first to a route to India, and later to worldwide colonization. A desire to spread Catholic Christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration. There also was a long tradition of pushing back Muslims, which stemmed from Portugal's fight for nationhood against the Moors. The fight expanded first to North Africa and eventually to the Indian subcontinent. An additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical Prester John—a powerful Christian king with whom an alliance against Islam could be forged. Finally, the Portuguese Crown sought a share in the lucrative West African trade in slaves and gold, and India's spice trade.|$|E
5|$|Benbow {{entered the}} Royal Navy on 30 April 1678, aged 25 years. He became master's mate aboard the 64-gun HMS Rupert {{under the command}} of Captain Arthur Herbert, whilst she was fitting out at Portsmouth. He sailed with her to the Mediterranean, where Herbert was {{promoted}} to the rank of vice-admiral whilst serving under the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, Admiral Sir John Narborough. During this period the English fleet was often in action against the Barbary pirates of North <b>Africa</b> <b>that</b> were actively preying upon European shipping. The Rupert herself captured an Algerine warship in 1678, which was later commissioned in the Royal Navy as the HMS Tiger Prize. Benbow distinguished himself well in a number of actions against the Algerine vessels, and won Herbert's approval. On Narborough's return to England, Herbert was appointed acting commander-in-chief, and made Benbow master aboard HMS Nonsuch on 15 June 1679. The Nonsuch would remain at Tangiers and off the African coast and had a number of successive captains who would go on to achieve flag rank, including George Rooke, Cloudesley Shovell and Francis Wheler. All were impressed by Benbow, and would afterwards help to advance his career.|$|E
