40|$|Field pea is {{the most}} {{produced}} and exported pulse crop in Canada, and makes a major contribution to Western Canadian agricultural diversification programs. Canada is now the world largest exporter of pea, lentil and chickpea and is fourth in dry bean. The demand for Canadian pulse products is steadily rising and the export market would continue to rise with the expected increased in production. Field pea exported to countries with tropical climates is at particular risk due to rapid loss of quality. It is therefore important to develop practical strategies for safe storage of feed pea. Knowledge on the moisture adsorption and spoilage characteristics of pea stored in adverse storage conditions {{is important in the}} transportation and storage of this export commodity. This study was initiated to examine the conditions that lead to quality losses in storage and transport of pea. Tropical and subtropical conditions were simulated in <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers.</b> Relative humidities (RH) of 60, 70, 80 and 90 % were created by saturated salt solutions in <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers</b> at temperatures of 10, 20 and 30 °C, while the same range of humidity was provided by dilute sulphuric acid in <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers</b> at 40 °C in environmental cabinets. The four RH levels at each temperature for both whole and feed-grade pea were tested in duplicate. The samples were observed for changes in moisture content (MC), mold appearance and RH in specific time intervals. The amount of produced carbon dioxide (CO 2) was measured in <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers</b> during storage to control the condition existing in sealed <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers.</b> Also, all components of feed-grade pea were exposed to RH of 90 % and temperature of 40 °C in separate <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers</b> to find the effect of each component on mold appearance. Molds were identified after appearance on the samples in order to pinpoint potential toxicity. Both feed and whole sound peas became molded after a short time of storage at high temperatures and high RH, but those stored at 70 % and below did not develop mold after 175 days at 30 and 40 °C (experiment duration) and 216 days at 10 and 20 °C (experiment duration). Molds were identified mostly as species of Aspergillus and Penicillium. The amount of CO 2 in the <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers</b> showed almost no difference from the ambient CO 2 except at high temperature and high RH when samples had gone molded. Moisture adsorption equations were developed based on the moisture adsorption data in dynamic environment. Although the Page model showed to fit the data better, the exponential model was chosen to fit the data because its parameters can be better expressed as a function of temperature and RH of the storage environment. The mold-free days for both feed pea and clean pea were modeled at temperatures of 10, 20, 30 and 40 °C and RH of 80 and 90 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Air {{inflated}} cushion using pre-sealed two-layer plastic films forms air filled structural cushion when {{compressed air}} is charged to pre-sealed <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers</b> during packaging operation. The plastic films {{are made by}} co-extrusion of polyethylene/polyamide/polyethylene (PE/PA/PE) to keep required strength, permeability of the cushioning materials and easy production of the cushion. The air filled cushion structure is designed into column chambers with five different selective widths which form five different–cushion thick-ness when regulated compressed air is charged into the chambers using controlled pressure gauge during packaging performance. Uniquely designed charge port to each chamber provides individual chamber {{with the ability to}} work independently, hence ensures the protective function of packaging and allows the air cush-ions to be easily manipulated to a given product to be packaged. Static cushioning performance tests to air filled cushion materials at desirable air pressures showed that minimum cushion factor was about 4, and ap-peared at compressive strain of the materials from 55 - 80 %.

The carbohydrate content of petals from each cultivar can be a decisive factor to vase life of gladiolus flowers. Despite exposure to ethylene does not affect the life of open florets of gladiolus flowers, it may reduce the flower’s commercial life due the occurrence of flower buds abortion. This study thus aimed to evaluate the flower opening and the vase life of gladiolus flowers according to ethylene sensitivity and carbohydrate content of each cultivar. The gladiolus cultivars used in Experiment I were  ‘Amsterdam’, ‘Blue Frost’, ‘Gold Field’, ‘Green Star’, ‘Jester’, ‘Lavender’, ‘Red Beauty’, ‘Rose Supreme’, ‘Traderhorn’, and ‘Verônica’. Stems were stored in <b>airtight</b> <b>chambers</b> and exposed to the ethylene concentrations of 0, 0. 1, 1. 0, 10, 100, and 1000 μL L− 1 for 24 h.

In Experiment II, three cultivars (‘Amsterdam’, ‘Red Beauty’, and ‘Verônica’) were chosen based on the lowest, medium, and highest vase life in Experiment I, respectively. Total soluble sugars, reducing sugars, and starch contents were evaluated in five flower developmental stages. No effect of ethylene on the flower opening or alterations in flower opening between cultivars. The vase life of gladiolus flowers differed between cultivars regardless of ethylene action. ‘Verônica’ and ‘Amsterdam’, which had the highest and lowest vase life, respectively, differed as to the total soluble sugar content. Ethylene does not influence the flower opening or vase life of the gladiolus cultivars studied. In these cultivars, the maintenance of flower opening is attributed to total soluble sugars content, which, in turn, is a major determinant of the vase life...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{turbulence}} on particles in a particulate two-phase flow, {{it is important to}} be able to measure the three-dimensional (3 D) positions and velocities of particles. While such experimental capability has been lacking in the past, Holographic PIV (HPIV) is emerging as a 3 D measurement technique to fill in this blank. The development of HPIV was originally motivated from the need to map out turbulent flow fields. We demonstrate that besides giving flow velocity field on 3 D grids as a result of correlation (spatial averaging), our off-axis HPIV technique can further provide positions and velocities of individual particles, whether seeded or inherent in the flow. Such information on individual particles opens a new arena for the utility of the HPIV technique – a 3 D diagnostics tool for the disperse phase. In the present experiment, an isotropic turbulent flow was generated using eight identical fans in an <b>airtight</b> turbulent <b>chamber,</b> and aluminum powder of 20 microns was added in the chamber as particles. A fully automated off-axis HPIV system based on an injection-seeded dual-pulsed YAG laser and 3 D data processing software was used to measure the particulate phase in the chamber. The validity of particle centroid finding and velocity extraction was established via computer-generated particle images dispersed in a rotating flow. Results show that the holographic system is capable of processing a huge number of particles with high accuracy. In the actual holographic measurement of the turbulence chamber, 3 D individual particle positions, shapes, and velocities were obtained by analyzing a pair of instantaneous holographic images recorded in rapid succession.
