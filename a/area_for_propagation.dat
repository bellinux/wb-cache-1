40|$|Proshika (pro = training; shi = education; ka = action) is a {{national}} NGO working in Bangladesh with the poor and hardcore poor of different categories, farmers, fishermen and petty traders of both sexes. Poor farmers have limited agricultural land for cultivation. We organize them to make them aware {{of the social and}} economic implications of their situation. As vetiver is an economic grass which needs a small <b>area</b> <b>for</b> <b>propagation,</b> Proshika has the opportunity to develop vetiver cultivation in Bangladesh. This paper will show how familiar poor farmers are with vetiver, the genetic characteristics of vetiver for various agro-ecological zones, soil and land types, the purpose of vetiver cultivation, the economic uses of vetiver for agriculture and industry and the environmental aspect. Vetiver is an economic crop for housing material for poor farmers in Bangladesh. As vetiver needs special care for development, researchers and extension and social development workers should promote its extensive cultivation. Some social and motivational works will be initiated in Bangladesh as in Thailand and India. Zonal, national and international networks are needed for vetiver cultivation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUWB {{communication}} {{is a recent}} research <b>area</b> <b>for</b> indoor <b>propagation</b> channels. Time Reversal (TR) communication in UWB has shown promising results for improving the system performance. In multiuser environment, the system performance is significantly degraded due to the interference among different users. TR reduces the interference caused by multiusers due to its spatial focusing property. The performance of a multiuser TR communication system is further improved if the TR filter is modified. In this paper, multiuser TR in UWB {{communication is}} investigated using simple TR filter and a modified TR filter with circular shift operation. The concept of circular shift in TR is analytically studied. Thereafter, the channel impulse responses (CIR) of a typical indoor laboratory environment are measured. The measured CIRs are {{used to analyze the}} received signal peak power and signal to interference ratio (SIR) with and without performing the circular shift operation in a multiuser environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the multiply-detected macrodiversity (MDM) {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} for wireless cellular systems. As {{opposed to the}} traditional macrodiversity schemes, in which at any time a signal from only one base station is selected, in the MDM scheme there is no selection, but all the received signals are detected, and a maximum-likelihood decision algorithm is employed to maximize the probability of correct decision. We study {{the performance of the}} MDM scheme and compare it with the performance of the traditional selection-based macrodiversity schemes. Depending on the propagation parameters, our results show that through the use of the MDM scheme, significant improvement in the bit-error rate (BER) can be achieved. For instance, if the outage probability is defined as BER above 100 R, the outage is eliminated at least 45 % of the time as compared with signal-to-interference (S/I) diversity, <b>for</b> a <b>propagation</b> attenuation exponent of 4. 0 and shadowing standard deviation of 4. 0 dB. Furthermore, as compared with the (S/I) diversity, the MDM scheme reduces, on the average, the BER at least two orders of magnitude throughout more than 60 % of the cell <b>area</b> <b>for</b> a <b>propagation</b> attenuation exponent of 3. 5, shadowing standard deviation of 4. 0 dB, and system loading of less than 50 %.

40|$|Acoustic data {{measured}} in the ocean fluctuate due to the complex time-varying properties of the channel. When measured data are used for model-based, geo-acoustic inversion, how do acoustic fluctuations impact estimates for the seabed properties? In May 1999 SACLANT Undersea Research Center and TNO-Physics and Electronics Laboratory ~FEL!, conducted a shallow-water experiment on the Adventure Bank off the southwest coast of Sicily, Italy to assess {{the effects of a}} time-varying ocean on acoustic propagation and geo-acoustic inversion. A favorable <b>area</b> <b>for</b> acoustic <b>propagation</b> was identified which had slight internal wave activity and a weakly range-dependent bathymetry with sand-like bottom properties. Oceanographic and acoustic measurements were performed continuously over a 3 -day period. Broadband ~ 0. 2 – 3. 8 kHz! acoustic signals from a bottom-moored source were transmitted over fixed paths and received on a moored vertical hydrophone array. During the transmissions extensive environmental measurements ~e. g., sound speed, current, sea-surface waveheight, etc. ! were made to correlate the time-varying environmental and acoustic data. Modeled acoustic data show time variability which agrees with the measurements. Results illustrate severe problems when modeling shallow-water acoustic propagation at ranges beyond a few kilometers in the frequency band considered. Further, the acoustic fluctuations in time caused erroneous time variability in inverted seabed properties...|$|R
40|$|It is a truism that {{simulations}} of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are not realistic. Today, simulations typically model propagation {{with either the}} freespace model or a "two-ray " model. Such models are valid only in open space {{where there are no}} hills and buildings. Since wireless signal at the frequencies used for MANETs is partly reflected off of buildings and is partly transmitted into the building, the presence of buildings greatly influences propagation. Consequently, these open-space propagation models are not accurate in outdoor urban <b>areas.</b> When <b>propagation</b> <b>for</b> Indoors is considered, the open-space models are not even applicable. There has been little effort in developing realistic mobility models. In urban areas, the mobility of vehicles and pedestrians is greatly influenced by node interaction. Furthermore, the location of streets, sidewalks, hallways, etc. restricts the position of nodes. Traffic lights also have a direct impact on the flow of nodes. We discuss the models and methodologies for realistically modeling the propagation and mobility of MANETs in urban environment. The techniques of simulation, models, model parameters and accuracy are all examined. The techniques <b>for</b> <b>propagation</b> are validated against propagation measurements. ...|$|R
