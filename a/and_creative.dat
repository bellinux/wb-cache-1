5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying less on {{the opposition}} of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{an important}} task teachers face in class: the identification <b>and</b> support of <b>creative</b> <b>and</b> high-achieving students. In particular, we examine whether primary teachers (1) have acquired professional knowledge during teacher education {{that is necessary}} to foster creativity and to teach high-achieving students, and whether they (2) possess the situation-specific skills necessary to do so. For this purpose, (1) the knowledge of German primary school teachers who participated in the TEDS-M study at the end of teacher education is analyzed. (2), a subset of these teachers interpreted classroom video scenes that require identifying <b>and</b> supporting <b>creative</b> <b>and</b> high-achieving students in the longitudinal follow-up study to TEDS-M (TEDS-FU) after 3 years of work experience. Contingency analyses between teachers’ professional knowledge and their skills in identifying <b>and</b> supporting mathematically <b>creative</b> <b>and</b> high-achieving students were carried out. The analyses revealed that those teachers who have difficulties in logical reasoning and understanding structural aspects of mathematics also have difficulties in identifying <b>and</b> supporting <b>creative</b> <b>and</b> high-achieving students. It was difficult for them to identify students’ thinking processes based on structural reflections and pattern recognition; moreover, they had difficulty in further developing mathematically rich answers by students. In line with these results, teachers with strong professional knowledge were able to identify <b>and</b> support mathematically <b>creative</b> <b>and</b> high-achieving students. Thus, the study reveals that a connection between teachers’ professional knowledge and their skills in identifying <b>and</b> supporting mathematically <b>creative</b> <b>and</b> high-achieving students exists but that many future and early career teachers seem to have deficiencies in these respects.
