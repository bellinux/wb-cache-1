2500|$|In New Zealand and Australia, GHB, 1,4-B and GBL are all Class B illegal drugs, {{along with}} any {{possible}} esters, ethers and aldehydes.

Attempts to circumvent the illegal status of GHB have led to the sale of derivatives such as 4-methyl-GHB (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and its prodrug form γ-valerolactone (GVL), but these are also covered under the law by virtue of their being [...] "substantially similar" [...] to GHB or GBL and; so importation, sale, possession and use of these compounds is also considered to be illegal.|$|E

2500|$|More seriously, many Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{officers}} were also against the treaty, and in March 1922 {{an ad hoc}} Army Convention repudiated {{the authority of the}} Dáil to accept the treaty.

MULCAHY:...(h) It was proposed to submit the proposed Constitution to a specially summoned Convention of the Irish Volunteers. That Convention was not held because no single member of the Volunteer Executive of the time would recommend the holding of that Convention in the circumstances that then existed in Dublin. Delegates for this Convention were actually selected but the Convention was not held. Ballot papers were circulated to the delegates and a vote was taken as far as the question of the Oath was concerned. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>this</b> question was concerned, the amendment to the constitution was accepted.

On 26 April, the Minister of Defence, Richard Mulcahy, summarised alleged illegal activities by many IRA men over the previous three months, whom he described as 'seceding volunteers', including hundreds of robberies.
