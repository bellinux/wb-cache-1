[...] It only requires that hardware and a software layer exists that {{is capable of}} sending and receiving packets on a computer network. As a result, the suite has been implemented on essentially every computing platform. A minimal implementation of TCP/IP includes the following: Internet Protocol (IP), <b>Address</b> <b>Resolution</b> Protocol (ARP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). In addition to IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Internet Protocol version 6 requires Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), ICMPv6, and IGMPv6 and is often accompanied by an integrated IPSec security layer.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} single-site {{addressing}} implementation {{based on the}} subwavelength localization via adiabatic passage (SLAP) technique. We consider a sample of ultracold neutral atoms loaded into a two-dimensional optical lattice with one atom per site. Each atom is modeled by a three-level Λ system in interaction with a pump and a Stokes laser pulse. Using a pump field with a node in its spatial profile, the atoms at all sites are transferred from one ground state of the system to the other via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, except {{the one at the}} position of the node that remains in the initial ground state. This technique allows for the preparation, manipulation, and detection of atoms with a spatial resolution better than the diffraction limit, which either relaxes the requirements on the optical setup used or extends the achievable spatial resolution to lattice spacings smaller than accessible to date. In comparison to techniques based on coherent population trapping, SLAP gives a higher <b>addressing</b> <b>resolution</b> and has additional advantages such as robustness against parameter variations, coherence of the transfer process, and the absence of photon induced recoil. Additionally, the advantages of our proposal with respect to adiabatic spin-flip techniques are highlighted. Analytic expressions for the achievable <b>addressing</b> <b>resolution</b> and efficiency are derived and compared to numerical simulations for 87 Rb atoms in state-of-the-art optical lattices...|$|R

The solution we propose {{is similar to}} the past approaches [4], in that we also resort to the implementation of a certain priority in order to resolve actual contradiction. At the core of the processing conflicts lies text-meaningrepresentation (TMR) module. Conflict detection explores modalities as well as OPPOSITE/NOT relation of corresponding principal heads of the TMR(s). Additionally, we claim that unlike purely axiomatic frameworks used [2], ontological semantics accounts for semantic heterogeneity and does not place a restriction on the type of regulation that can be processed. ...|$|R
