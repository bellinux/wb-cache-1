5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is {{the most}} widely accepted form of <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> classification. <b>Air</b> <b>mass</b> classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate {{the stability of the}} atmosphere. If the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w. While <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{under the}} {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity of the <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> The strongest winds {{are in the}} mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the tropics.|$|E

Likewise, tropical hot <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> (subtropical anticyclone and southern cyclones), as well as Central Asian anticyclones and local weather conditions, have influence. These <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> enter the country in different ways thanks to its varied geography. Thus, although they do not prevent the hot masses entering Azerbaijan from the south, cold continental and maritime <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> cause changes in properties of those hot <b>air</b> <b>masses,</b> and influence {{the dynamics of the}} atmosphere [...]|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the kind of <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> and snow cover occurrence in two stations: Legnica and Zamość were investigated, using daily snow cover depths and daily calendar of <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> for the years 1971 - 2000. The frequency of the days with snow cover in the different <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> was counted and furthermore, <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> favourable to increases and decreases in snow cover depth were singled out. Snow cover appears most often in arctic and polar-continental <b>air</b> <b>masses.</b> Arctic <b>air</b> is favourable to snowfalls, which lead to increases in the snow cover depth, while polar-continental air guaranties snow sustainment. Polarmaritime air {{which is the most}} frequent in Poland during the wintertime can also bring snowfalls, but in this <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> snow does not last long, because polar-maritime air is the most favourable to decreases in snow cover depth...|$|R
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises {{up through the}} colder air above, freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> is trapped underneath a warm <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E

40|$|Dehydration in the Antarctic winter {{stratosphere}} {{is a well-known}} phenomenon that is annually observed by satellites and occasionally observed by balloon-borne measurements. However, in situ measurements of dehydrated <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> in the Antarctic vortex are very rare. Here, we present detailed observations with the in situ and GLORIA remote sensing instrument payload aboard the German aircraft HALO. Strongly dehydrated <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> down to 1. 6 ppmv of water vapor were observed {{as far north as}} 47 ° S in an altitude between 12 and 13 km in the lowermost stratosphere. The dehydration {{can be traced back to}} individual ice formation events above the Antarctic Peninsula and Plateau, where ice crystals sedimented out and water vapor was irreversibly removed. Within these dehydrated stratospheric <b>air</b> <b>masses,</b> filaments of moister air reaching down to the tropopause are detected with the high-resolution limb sounder, GLORIA. Furthermore, dehydrated <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> are observed with GLORIA in the Antarctic lowermost stratosphere down to 7 km. With the help of a backward trajectory analysis, a midlatitude origin of the moist filaments in the vortex can be identified, while the dry <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> down to 7 km have stratospheric origins. Antarctic stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) and transport of dehydrated <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> into the troposphere are investigated. Further, it is shown that the exchange process can be attributed to several successive Rossby wave events in combination with an isentropic exchange of <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> across the thermal tropopause. The transport into the troposphere is caused by <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> that are detached from the potential vorticity (PV) structure by Rossby wave breaking events and subsequently transported diabatically across the dynamical tropopause. Once transported to the troposphere, <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> with stratospheric origin can reach near-surface levels within several days...|$|R
5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} edge of a {{homogeneous}} warm <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a {{third time}} as it moved over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western Gulf of Mexico. Shortly before landfall, a dry <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> in the western Gulf of Mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of June23, Andres {{weakened}} to a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear, decreasing sea surface temperatures as it entered a more stable <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> The system began to rapidly degenerate, as convection became dislocated from {{the center and the}} overall structure of Andres degraded. By 1200UTC on June24, the storm weakened into a tropical depression while situated roughly 100mi (155km) west of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Shortly after, the depression sharply turned north and degenerated into a trough of low pressure, no longer a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms.

50|$|The {{formation}} of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold arctic <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> of Scandinavian anticyclone, temperate of Siberian anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone.

5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E

Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas.

At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed on them and injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before it struck. There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. The campers were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E

5000|$|Arctic, Antarctic, and polar <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> are cold. The {{qualities of}} arctic air are {{developed}} over ice and snow-covered ground.

25|$|Even if air columns are {{homogeneous}} with height, {{the density}} of each column can change from location to location, firstly since <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> have different temperatures and moisture content depending on their origin; and then since <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> modify their properties as they flow over Earth’s surface.|$|R
5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> slipping under the hotter and less dense <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.|$|E
50|$|Climatic general {{features}} consist of various and irregular weather conditions. The dominating temperate <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> during {{spring and summer}} are of oceanic origin and come with great precipitations.

50|$|Wind and <b>Air</b> <b>masses.</b> Heated ground causes air to rise {{which results}} in lower air pressure. As it rises it cools and descends to the ground {{resulting}} in high air pressure.
