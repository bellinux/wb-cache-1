25|$|The {{discovery}} by Hertz in 1887 {{that the}} incidence of ultra-violet light on a spark gap facilitated the passage of the spark, led immediately to a series of investigations by Hallwachs, Hoor, Righi and Stoletow on the effect of light, and especially of ultra-violet light, on charged bodies. It was proved by these investigations that a newly cleaned surface of zinc, if charged with negative electricity, rapidly loses this charge however small it may be when ultra-violet light falls upon the surface; while if the surface is uncharged to begin with, it acquires a positive charge when exposed to the light, the negative electrification going out into the gas by which the metal is surrounded; this positive electrification can be much increased by directing a strong <b>airblast</b> against the surface. If however the zinc surface is positively electrified it suffers no loss of charge when exposed to the light: this result has been questioned, but a very careful examination of the phenomenon by Elster and Geitel has shown that the loss observed under certain circumstances is due to the discharge by the light reflected from the zinc surface of negative electrification on neighbouring conductors induced by the positive charge, the negative electricity {{under the influence of the}} electric field moving up to the positively electrified surface.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe better {{understanding}} of airburst processes from geological data and simulation suggests that the high-temperature jet of expanding gas formed from the projectile explosion in the Earth atmosphere would generate a descending fireball. The hypothesis of frequent low altitude airbursts {{in the recent past}} thus incites to question the possible occurrence in the Quaternary records of airblast-linked firing events. Here we compare the field/analytical characteristics of undisputable <b>airblasts</b> and impact craters to anomalous firing records. The reference impact situations comprise (1) the peat layer of the 1908 Tunguska explosion; (2) the Henbury crater field, Australia; (3) the early mid-Pleistocene tektite layers at Bose (south China); (3) the Darwin glass strewnfield, Tasmania. The debated impact-linked combustion records comprise in situ fired soil surfaces from the mid to late Holocene framed by AMS C 14 dates, and distinctive dark-brown humic layers with charred fragments from continental deposits of West Europe dated at 0. 8, 1. 2 - 1. 4, 2. 4 Ma on the basis of magnetostratigraphy. All the situations display a similar assemblage of exogenous intact rock clasts, partly melted brecciated debris, and rapidly quenched heterogeneous glass, fluidal glass in the form of shards, spherules, beads, and vesicular blocks. The exotic mineral phases occur with native metals and carbonaceous components, all of terrestrial origin. The polymer films, vitreous carbon, carbonaceous fibres, graphite and the associated diamond polymorphs are shown to derive from high temperature pyrogenesis of biomass precursors and fossil combustible. The moderate heating under oxidised conditions of the host soil surface contrasts from the high temperature heating under reduced conditions of the melted debris. The coherent spatial pattern at small scales of the carbon-rich glassy debris within the burnt surface suggests local ignition by pulverisation of a hot debris-jet. The fine association of carbonaceous films with metal and glass droplets within the carbonized vegetation showing CO 2 degassing demonstrates the great volatility of the pyrogenic components transported in the debris-jet. Local strewnfields of impact-ejecta debris lying on a heated soil surface are suggested to trace <b>airblasts</b> from isolated projectiles with local and short-term damage. The mosaic of impact-ejecta strewnfields at all spatial scales with local firing would express short periods of serial <b>airblasts</b> associated to subtle climate effects due to the production of carbonaceous aerosols. The early Pleistocene peaty dark layers would match exceptional long periods of high frequency <b>airblasts</b> with severe atmospheric disturbances triggered by the repeated biomass burning and carbon-delivery from the projectiles...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{demonstrates the}} use of a compact high repetition rate pulsed high power LED light source in combination with a high speed camera to obtain high speed shadowgraphs of an <b>airblasted</b> spray in a fired research combustor at medium pressures. The temporally resolved structures are subjected to conventional spectral analysis and exhibit very dominant fundamental frequencies throughout the visualized spray structures. The image data is further compared to time series of drop-sizing measurements made by a phase Doppler instrument. The periodicity is attributed to a spiraling spray release from the nozzle lip that is believed to be induced by a precessing vortex or vortices orbiting around the burner axis. The logical extension of the technique is to use multiple views to obtain different views of the spray simultaneously.

40|$|Air blast-induced {{traumatic}} brain injuries (TBIs) represent {{a significant percentage}} of military personnel injuries observed in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Prevalence of blast-induced TBIs is attributed to several factors, including improved body armor, improved diagnostic techniques, greater awareness, and the increased threat of attack by improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Though the mechanisms of blast-induced TBIs are not fully understood, this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. The overall goal of the work presented in this report is to explore a possible improvement to the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) liner increasing the protection against blast-induced TBIs. The essential new element is the inclusion of moveable or deformable materials sandwiched within foam to dissipate the blast energy, reduce the peak transmitted pressure, and stretch the blast waveform before it reaches the brain. Filler materials explored in this work include glass beads, aerogel, glycerin, and water. To contribute to this goal, the description and validation of a model of the dynamic response of a (modified) helmet and head surrogate to an air blast event is presented in this report. An initial prototype for a liner incorporating the filler material technology is designed and manufactured. The response characteristics of this prototype are then assessed experimentally by collecting pressure data during air blast loading provided by an explosive drive shock tube. Experimental work is carried out at Purdue University. A nonlinear finite element model is then developed using the commercial code ABAQUS* to describe the response observed experimentally. Consistency between results obtained numerically and results obtained experimentally indicates the model accurately describes the physics of a blast event impinging on a helmet and head. Several suggestions are then provided for how the model may be used to optimize the design of a helmet liner providing the maximum protection against <b>airblasts.</b> by Andrew Vechart. Thesis (S.

Participants included Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and United States under the Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program. Detonable gas balloons were used in this operation in an attempt to find an economical substitute for TNT {{as well as for the}} fact that they could be placed at desired heights without a heavy support structure or towers. In addition, they were more adaptable to <b>airblast</b> phenomena and produced a well defined blast wave without perturbation or ejecta; they also produced no crater. However, it was found that they lacked the high pressure associated with high explosives, and difficulties were encountered as the 20-ton gas balloon ruptured and another detonated unexpectedly during inflation. Ultimately ANFO was elected as a lower cost alternative to TNT for non-nuclear explosives tests.|$|E

In addition, it generally causes low damage to nontarget species, which is one of the advantages of amitraz. Furthermore, amitraz is especially effective against insects such as spider mites and ticks in their juvenile and resistant forms.For agricultural purposes amitraz is primarily used to control the pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyricola) on Oregon pear crops and whiteflies and mites on cotton or pear crops.It's also applied to pome fruit, citrus fruit, cotton, stone fruit, bush fruit, strawberries, hops, cucurbits, aubergines, capsicums, tomatoes and ornamental plants to control all stages of tetranychid and eriophyid mites, pear suckers, scale insects, mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids and eggs and first instar larvae of lepidoptera.To apply amitraz, various techniques can be used such as an <b>airblast</b> and concentrate spray to pears or by ground boom and aircraft to cotton.Territorial differences in amitraz use depend on the species of mites that infest the crops/trees/etc., the local practice, and the number and size of the pear trees. An infestation e.g. by Tetranychus spp requires higher rates of amitraz. Taking those factors into consideration the application volumes of amitraz have been standardized in terms of maximum spray concentration and in the rate of amitraz per hectare.|$|E
50|$|This {{plane is}} also remembered for a tragedy on May 4, 1919, which killed the French General Dr. Milan Rastislav Stefanik, {{who was the}} {{minister}} {{of war in the}} Czechoslovak Republic at the time. The accident occurred at the conclusion of a flight from Campoformido near Udine to Bratislava (capital of Slovakia). On his initial approach, the pilot determined that the ground was too wet to land on, so he increased power to the engines and began to aim the plane to a landing patch further afield which appeared to be dry. While doing so, one of the engines exploded, causing the aircraft to nosedive. General Stefanik and the three Italian crew members were pronounced dead at the scene. A subsequent investigation determined that the most likely cause of engine failure was a failure of the <b>airblast</b> cooling of the engine, probably induced by the increased strain cause by the pilot's sudden demands on the engine after the aborted landing. There were allegations that a Czech anti-aircraft artillery company had fired on the aircraft, either because they mistook the Italian for Hungarian markings or that they had done so as part of a conspiracy to see Gen. Stefanik killed, to prevent him from instigating proposed changes in the Czech government. These allegations were never proven and the failure of the engine's blast cooling is widely accepted as the best explanation for the accident.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the goals}} of this test was to study the {{physical}} characteristics of the crater and the surrounding area pre- and post-detonation associated with Project 1.4. A camera was mounted to a RB-50 aircraft and the resultant crater was mapped using photogrammetry. Measurements were taken from 500 feet (152 meters) down to ground zero for both pre- and post detonation. Survey measurements of the Cactus test could not be made until the resultant radiation amounts had lowered to safer levels. Along with photogrammetric radial measurements, <b>Airblast</b> measurements were also recorded near surface zero for Cactus in accordance with Project 1.7. Similar to Project 1.8, Project 1.9 sought to determine transmission of blast pressure through the ground soil. Forty-three drums were buried at varying depths 600 feet (183 meters) from ground zero of the Cactus detonation. Individuals from the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division - TRW Space Technologies Laboratory sought to the Shock Spectra Studies of Project 1.12. Measurement gauges were located between 625 and 965 feet (191 to 294 meters) from the blast site. Fallout measurements and samples were taken by aircraft {{in the aftermath of the}} detonation, as part of Project 2.8. These surveys were designed in part to determine the impact of specific radionuclides to overall nuclear fallout. Samples were taken early post-blast using a new rocket sampler, the UCRL, which were then followed by B-57D and WB-50 aircraft. Between four and twenty-four hours post-detonation, the WB-50 collected several samples at 1,000 feet (305 meters) in altitude. Project 3.2 involved structural tests of corrugated steel arches. One of these arches was placed 980 feet (299 meters) away from the Cactus blast site. Eight days after the test, a crew of 13 men were allowed near the surface zero in order to extract the arch. The extraction took around twelve hours, and the radioactivity levels reached a maximum at 0.420 R/h during this time. Project 5.2 sought to determine the effects of the blast on two A4D-1 aircraft, both in thermal radiation and pressure. Nine film badges were placed throughout each aircraft in order to measure radiation. The Gamma dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 827 indicated a neutron exposure level of 0.105 rem. There is not information available for the dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 831. Radiation recorded by six of the nine film badges ranged from 0.49-1.74R. Information from the remaining three film badges, located at the Pilot’s right leg, left sleeve, and left vest is not available. The pilot’s exposures were both greater than 3R. Project 5.3 was very similar to 5.2, focusing on the effects of the blast on the structure of two test FJ-4 aircraft. Radiation from film badges on aircraft 467 ranged from 0.52-3.71 R, and 1.23-5.06 R for aircraft number 310. In Project 6.4, the Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) investigated the electromagnetic pulses post-detonation, utilizing two instruments, one at Wotho (roughly 240 nautical miles from Enewetak) and one at Kusaie (around 440 nautical miles from Enewetak). Though Cactus is mentioned in Project 6.5, whose goal was to study the radar echoes from the fireball, it is not clear what destroyers were involved if any. Destroyers for the Teak, Fir and Yucca tests are explicitly stated. Project 6.6, the lasts of the projects that involved the Cactus test, sought to measure the physical properties of the stabilized radioactive cloud following the blast.|$|E
40|$|Current {{practice}} in analysis {{and design of}} structures to withhold surface explosions considers only <b>airblast</b> forces on structures. A surface explosion, in fact, generates both ground shock and <b>airblast</b> pressure on a nearby structure. In this paper, the influences of simultaneous ground shock and <b>airblast</b> forces on structural responses are investigated. Blast-induced surface ground motions and <b>airblast</b> pressures estimated in a previous study are employed as input in the analysis. A previously developed three-dimensional homogenized material model for a masonry wall including the equivalent elastic properties, strength envelope and damage threshold is used to model masonry wall. Another material damage model developed for reinforced concrete structures is used for modelling RC behavior due to explosive loads. These material models are programmed and linked to an available computer program LS-DYNA 3 D through its user subroutine capability. A one-story masonry infilled RC frame is used as an example in the study. Dynamic response and damage of the example structure to simultaneous ground shock and <b>airblast</b> forces, or separately to ground shock only or <b>airblast</b> forces only are calculated. It is found that in general, <b>airblast</b> load governs structural response and damage when the scaled distance is small. However, under certain conditions, structural damage will be critically underestimated if ground shock is neglected. When the scale distance increases, {{the relative importance of}} the ground shock on structure response increases, and ground shock will dominate the surface explosion effects on structures at large scaled distance. At large scaled distance, the ground shock and <b>airblast</b> force effects on structures decoupled and structure response and damage to ground shock and <b>airblast</b> force can be analyzed separately...|$|E
