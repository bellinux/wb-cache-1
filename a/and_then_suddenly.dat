5|$|Mauretania was {{a client}} kingdom of Rome ruled by Ptolemy of Mauretania. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> had him executed. Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and {{subsequently}} {{divided into two}} provinces, Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis, separated by the river Malua. Pliny claims that division {{was the work of}} Caligula, but Dio states that in AD 42 an uprising took place, which was subdued by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, and the division only took place after this. This confusion might mean that Caligula decided to divide the province, but the division was postponed because of the rebellion. The first known equestrian governor of the two provinces was Marcus Fadius Celer Flavianus, in office in AD 44.|$|E
5|$|So far {{some success}} has been {{achieved}} in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase {{the intensity of the}} lasers, they become less mobile <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.|$|E
5|$|Del Piero {{was a free}} {{kick and}} penalty kick (62 goals from {{penalties}}) specialist. He is the third highest scorer of penalties in Serie A history, scoring 50 times out of 61 attempts, behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio. Del Piero's unique free kick technique was usually characterised by a curling strike which rose high over the wall, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> dropped into the top corner of the goal; he attributes his ability on set pieces to the time spent studying Roberto Baggio in training during their time together at Juventus, and was also influenced by the free kick technique {{of one of his}} idols, Platini. Indeed, in his early years with the Turin club, Del Piero's free kick technique was compared to that of the Frenchman, as he preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick, rather than having it touched by a teammate first. Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer from free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals at club level, 6 goals with the Italy national team). He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović. In addition to his talent and footballing abilities, Del Piero also drew praise throughout his career for his leadership with Juventus, and for his fair play and correct behaviour on the pitch.|$|E

25|$|He {{follows the}} {{experiences}} of doctors who had emerged from the rubble of their hospitals only to find themselves with little of the medical equipment and supplies that were so desperately needed. Some patients who had initially appeared to have survived the bomb without a scratch suffered no ill effects {{for a few days}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> started vomiting, losing their hair, and bleeding to death {{as a result of the}} effects of the then-unknown condition of radiation poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Multistability (or multistable perception) is the {{tendency}} of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the Necker cube and Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion shown here. Other examples include the three-legged blivet and artist M. C. Escher's artwork {{and the appearance of}} flashing marquee lights moving first one direction <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> the other. Again, gestalt does not explain how images appear multistable, only that they do.|$|E
25|$|Another {{widely used}} tactic {{was to make}} a false retreat <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> attack the enemy— {{breaking}} the lines when in pursuit. This trick won many victories, most notably at the battle of Adrianople in 1205 against the Crusaders. Sometimes the Bulgarians left a strong cavalry force in reserve which attacked in the sublime moment and tipped the balance in Bulgarians' favour, for instance in the battle of Anchialus in 917. Ambush was another widely used and very successful strategy especially during the Cometopuli dynasty.|$|E

25|$|Sedona is a {{very popular}} {{destination}} among Arizona tourists, especially {{with those who are}} interested in the New Age movement or those seeking to be close to nature. The airport is located on top of a high mesa overlooking a major portion of the city; {{it is not uncommon for}} tourists or locals driving around downtown Sedona to see an approaching airplane fly overhead <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> disappear into the mountains without ever appearing to land. The airport is also located very close to the Red Rocks of Sedona.|$|E
25|$|The way to Constantinople {{was clear}} and the Bulgarian army headed {{straight}} to the city without facing any resistance. There were still several fortresses in Thrace which remained in Byzantine hands, particularly Adrianople which was besieged by Krum's brother. On 17 July 813 Krum himself reached the walls of Constantinople and set his camp without hindrance. Within {{the sight of the}} citizens of Constantinople, Krum who was also the high priest made a sacrifice to the Bulgar god Tangra, performed some pagan rituals, then the Bulgarians built trenches along the whole length of the city's walls <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> Krum offered peace.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2013, law {{enforcement}} officers, including an FBI special agent from the Boston field office, and two Massachusetts State Police troopers, interviewed a Chechen immigrant named Ibragim Todashev for approximately eight hours {{at his apartment}} in Orlando, Florida, regarding the Waltham triple murder and his connections to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and other extremists. They said that he implicated both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the murders during the questioning and was beginning to write a formal statement when he asked {{to take a break}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> attacked the FBI agent. Todashev was shot multiple times and killed by the officers.|$|E

25|$|Early in the {{following}} morning the Spaniards assaulted the position; De Jong and his men waited until they were inside the fort <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> opened fire with five or six guns. The foot soldiers fired a volley and then advanced with the pike, {{in a short time}} they were among the attackers and drove them back inflicting more than two hundred casualties including some senior officers killed. The attack was eventually repulsed with only three guns being damaged or made unusable. Maurice had meanwhile approached the Rhine and then set up camp later that day. The following day Parma planned to move forward but because of heavy rainfall he decided to entrench his positions.|$|E
25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the {{engagement}} are not clear. The Genoese Annales Ianuenses claims that when the signal to attack was given, only fourteen Genoese ships advanced, while the rest stood back <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> fled. The Venetian chronicler Canale, however, records that the Venetian ships attacked first, while the Genoese were trying to ambush them. The battle ended in a clear Venetian victory: the Genoese fleet, half of which failed to engage at all, lost many men, including an admiral and two of their flagships, before breaking off and fleeing. Canale claimed 1,000 Genoese losses as compared to 420 Venetian casualties. At any rate, the outcome was clearly the result of both the divided command of the Genoese fleet, and the reluctance, consistently displayed in earlier and later engagements, of the Genoese admirals to risk their ships: this was because the Genoese ships were fitted by private contractors, usually the rich noble merchants who ran the city, and thus constituted valuable assets for which the admirals were answerable.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{required}} {{the crew of}} The X-Files to create a UFO chase. In order to do this, the scene was filmed entirely in a mountainous area that was lit up to give the shot a more alien-like feel. The UFO seen flying {{at the opening of}} the scene was actually a helicopter, disguised using various techniques. A so-called [...] "cloaking-effect", created on a computer and consisting mostly of digital fog and [...] "wiggled lights", was used to make the [...] "spaceship" [...] appear <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>suddenly</b> disappear.|$|E
500|$|Poe also {{presents}} {{the effects of}} alcohol in the novel.

Such a depiction is a small version of a larger focus in the novel on contradictions between chaos and order. Even nature seems unnatural. Water, for example, is very different {{at the end of}} the novel, appearing either colorful or [...] "unnaturally clear." [...] The sun by the end shines [...] "with a sickly yellow lustre emitting no decisive light" [...] before seemingly being extinguished.|$|E

Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected.

500|$|From 2006 to 2008, M.I.A. {{lived in}} the Bedford-Stuyvesant {{neighbourhood}} of Brooklyn, New York, where she met Benjamin Bronfman (a.k.a.

They became engaged and she gave birth to their son, Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman, on 13 February 2009, just three days after performing at the Grammy Awards. In February 2012, it was announced that she and Bronfman had split. In a 2013 interview with Ferrari Sheppard, M.I.A. commented on her relationship with Bronfman and his family's wealth: [...] "I think it’s weird.

I got with Ben, and I realised that we do come from different worlds, but it’s interesting that it is more about the concepts of, again, elitism and power. Who Ben is on paper sounds way more powerful than who I am because of where he comes from." ...|$|E
