5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this score to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|A rugged, sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, <b>and</b> <b>dense.</b> It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E

5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} (G2V) {{based on its}} {{spectral}} class. As such, it is informally {{referred to as a}} yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.6 billion, or 1,000,000,000. years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is {{primarily}} terrestrial, but occasionally arboreal, especially where {{it occurs in}} forest. Typically it inhabits neglected areas of scrub, termite mounds, abandoned burrows and rock crevices. It is adapted to terrain ranging from savannah and woodland to rocky slopes <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> forests. The black mamba prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid dry savannah, to dense forest or arid desert.|$|E

The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} is a habitat generalist; it inhabits places with {{adequate}} water <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands and riparian areas. Despite its name, the jungle cat shuns rainforests and woodlands. The jungle cat {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and is mainly threatened by destruction of wetlands, trapping and poisoning. The status of the cat in the wild needs further study, though populations {{are thought to be}} declining.|$|E
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in moist <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> subtropical forests. More rarely, {{it is found}} on rocks or on leaves. In the USA it occurs in hammocks (hardwood forests) and swamps which have standing water, {{at least part of}} the year. It is also common in oak or oak-pine scrub vegetation. The species is often associated with Cryptothecia striata in the USA.|$|E

5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} the polar bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> vegetation for shelter.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{antelope}} prefers {{areas with}} fresh <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests prevalent in western African {{countries such as}} Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The animal's habitat also includes forest fringes and secondary forests. Its geographic range extends eastward from the Kounounkan Massif in southwestern Guinea through Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire to the Volta River in Ghana. The royal antelope may {{also be found in}} the region north to the forested areas of western Africa, which is marked by the interface of forest and savannah habitats.|$|E

5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E
5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter <b>and</b> <b>dense</b> vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
