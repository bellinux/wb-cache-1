50|$|After demodulating, a CIRC error {{corrector}} takes each {{audio data}} frame, stores it in a SRAM memory and verifies {{that it has}} been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a DAC to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability so if enough data frames are missing or unrecoverable, it may be impossible to fix by interpolation so an <b>audio</b> <b>mute</b> flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.The Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the audio and transmitter controllers to switch the broadcasting {{programs in the}} automatic radio broadcast network. The <b>audio</b> <b>mute</b> clock is used to control the controllers to switch the relays on and off via Programmable Logic Control. In addition, the controllers is used to turn {{on and off the}} transmitter when it is used as unmanned operation. From the result, it is shown that the proposed controllers can be accurately used to switch the automatic broadcast program. In addition, this controllers using <b>audio</b> <b>mute</b> clock can be used without the needed of computer, master clock and human intervention. In addition, {{it can be used to}} automatically turn the transmitter on and off when it is used as unmanned operation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to measure the {{perceived}} pleasantness during the observation of a musical video clip in a group of cochlear implanted adult patients when compared to a group of normal hearing subjects. This comparison was performed by using the imbalance of the EEG power spectra in alpha band over frontal areas as a metric for the perceived pleasantness. Subjects were asked to watch a musical video clip in three different experimental conditions: with the original audio included (Norm), with a distorted version of the audio (Dist), and without the <b>audio</b> (<b>Mute).</b> The frontal EEG imbalance between the estimated power spectra for the left and right prefrontal areas has been calculated to investigate the differences among the two populations. Results suggested that the perceived pleasantness of the musical video clip in the normal hearing population and in the bilateral cochlear implanted populations has similar range of variation across the different stimulations (Norm, Dist, and Mute), when compared to the range of variation of video clip’s pleasantness for the monolateral cochlear implanted population. A similarity exists in the trends of the perceived pleasantness across the different experimental conditions in the mono- and bilaterally cochlear implanted patients...|$|E

40|$|The mono-stereo {{controller}} using <b>audio</b> <b>mute</b> {{clock is}} {{used at the}} International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) FM 106. 6 MHz transmitter in Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia since 2010. The major problem of the FM broadcast station was from the frozen Programmable Logic Controller, PLC, which must be manually reset and the report by the VOA listeners. Then, the PLC auto power reset circuit is proposed and built in mono-stereo controller to monitor {{the operation of the}} PLC. The circuit is also used to restart the PLC whenever, it is frozen. The cloud router and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to Recommended Standard number 232 (RS- 232) converter are used to synchronize the PLC time. From the results, this circuit can improve the transmitter availability and quality of the 24 hours/day broadcast program without affection to the listeners. The reliability of the cloud router is acceptable with low delay of data transfer via the internet connection between Thailand to Mongolia. The cloud router which the IBB leases cloud service from the provider that offers high speed internet up to 1000 Mb/s, via the remote terminal is used for the schedule program and the time synchronization of the PLC correctly. The proposed system is very stable and there is no problem of the frozen PLC whether it connects to the internet or not. Hence, the designed PLC auto power reset circuit can be used to eliminate the frozen PLC problem...|$|E

5000|$|A typical FM {{two-way radio}} carrier squelch circuit is noise operated. It {{takes out the}} voice {{components}} of the receive audio by passing the detected audio through a high-pass filter. A typical filter might pass frequencies over 4,000 Hz (4 kHz). The squelch control adjusts the gain of an amplifier which varies the level of noise {{coming out of the}} filter. The audio output of the filter and amplifier is rectified and produces a DC voltage when noise is present. The presence of continuous noise on an idle channel creates a DC voltage which turns the receiver audio off. When a signal with little or no noise is received, the noise-derived voltage goes away and the receiver audio is unmuted. Some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the <b>audio</b> <b>muting</b> control voltage as a [...] "signal present" [...] indication, for example in a repeater the act of the receiver unmuting will switch on the transmitter.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{professional}} systems use a phase-reversal of the CTCSS tone {{at the end}} of {{a transmission}} to eliminate the squelch crash or squelch tail. This is common with General Electric Mobile Radio and Motorola systems. When the user releases his push-to-talk button the CTCSS tone does a phase shift for about 200 milliseconds. In older systems, the tone decoders used mechanical reeds to decode CTCSS tones. When audio at a resonant pitch was fed into the reed, it would resonate / vibrate, which would turn on the speaker audio. The end-of-transmission phase reversal (called [...] "reverse burst" [...] by Motorola and [...] "squelch tail elimination" [...] or [...] "STE" [...] by GE [...] ) caused the reed to abruptly stop vibrating which would cause the receive <b>audio</b> to instantly <b>mute.</b> Initially, a phase shift of 180 degrees was used, but experience showed that a shift of ±120 to 135 degrees was optimal in halting the mechanical reeds. These systems often have <b>audio</b> <b>muting</b> logic set for CTCSS only. If a transmitter without the phase reversal feature is used, the squelch can remain unmuted for as long as the reed continues to vibrate—up to 1.5 seconds {{at the end of}} a transmission as it coasts to a stop (sometimes referred to as the [...] "flywheel effect" [...] or called [...] "freewheeling"). Thus, there is one caveat about all CTCSS being interchangeable—if the phase changing system exists then the shift angle must match. Note that the hardware used to implement the [...] "reverse burst" [...] / [...] "squelch tail elimination" [...] system is all contained in the transmitter.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To date, no {{objective}} {{measure of}} the pleasantness of music perception by children with cochlear implants has been reported. The EEG alpha asymmetries of pre-frontal cortex activation are known to relate to emotional/affective engagement in a perceived stimulus. More specifically, according to the "withdrawal/approach" model, an unbalanced de-synchronization of the alpha activity in the left prefrontal cortex {{has been associated with}} a positive affective state/approach toward a stimulus, and an unbalanced de-synchronization of the same activity in the right prefrontal cortex with a negative affective state/withdrawal from a stimulus. In the present study, High-Resolution EEG with Source Reconstruction was used to compare the music-induced alpha asymmetries of the prefrontal cortex in a group of prelingually deaf implanted children and in a control group of normal-hearing children. Methods: Six normal-hearing and six age-matched deaf children using a unilateral cochlear implants underwent High-Resolution EEG recordings as they were listening to a musical cartoon. Musical stimuli were delivered in three versions: Normal, Distort (reverse <b>audio</b> flow) and <b>Mute.</b> The EEG alpha rhythm asymmetry was analyzed: Power Spectral Density was calculated for each Region of Interest, together with a right-left imbalance index. A map of cortical activation was then reconstructed on a realistic cortical model. Results: Asymmetries of EEG alpha rhythm in the prefrontal cortices were observed in both groups. In the normal-hearing children, the asymmetries were consistent with the withdrawal/approach model, whereas in cochlear implant users they were not. Moreover, in implanted children a different pattern of alpha asymmetries in extrafrontal cortical areas was noticed as compared to normal-hearing subjects. Conclusions: The peculiar pattern of alpha asymmetries in implanted children's prefrontal cortex in response to musical stimuli suggests an inability by these subjects to discriminate normal from dissonant music and to appreciate the pleasantness of normal music. High-Resolution EEG may prove to be a promising tool for objectively measuring prefrontal cortex alpha asymmetries in child cochlear implant users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
