2500|$|Harrison's {{favourite}} {{scenes were}} {{shot at the}} coast. She [...] "thought {{that was kind of}} neat. And then jumping on his horse and riding with him and he turned around and I smiled. And we were going off to wherever – was out there. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a great way to start – well, they sort of started the next one that way." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{it might}} have aroused his curiosity, if not his suspicion, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{sufficient}} to prevent a serious loss.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you, Louise," [...] said Harry, who had {{now come}} up, [...] "how {{did you get}} away? I have been terribly anxious, {{thinking}} that they might seize you too, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dreadful." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{which his}} {{companion}} visibly brightened. [...] "I told you so," [...] he said cheerfully; [...] "I knew you'd {{be able to}} take it--and the old man--in <b>THAT</b> WAY, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fetched him round." ...|$|R
60|$|PETKOFF. I don't {{doubt it}} in the least, my dear. But I should have had to subdue the whole Austrian Empire first; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> kept me too long away from you. I missed you greatly.|$|R
30|$|Further in a {{regional}} outback town, a male Elder described exploitation and threatening behaviour as: “Yes, {{a lot of}} domestic violence problems. You get your men that stand over for their key cards <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ramifications”.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is lucky}} it wasn't two feet lower," [...] {{he said to}} Bob, [...] "or it would have brought the topsail down; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a serious loss, now the main-topsail is of no use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Kate, if you please," [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "And it is well, Dickory, {{you did not}} know, for then you might have jumped upon him and stuck him in the back, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dishonourable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{had paid}} the money," [...] replied the lawyer, with a decided {{emphasis}} on the first word, [...] "you would have received a release, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recorded with the mortgage, otherwise that instrument is in full force." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A modern {{picture from}} Mount Hua, in the Qinling Mountain Range, perhaps {{suggesting}} {{some of the}} area's wild and rugged features which still exist today, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> also been enjoyed by Wang Wei and his friends.|$|R
60|$|From nine till ten Forrest {{gave himself}} up to his secretary, {{achieving}} a correspondence that included learned societies and every sort of breeding and agricultural organization <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> compelled the average petty business man, unaided, to sit up till midnight to accomplish.|$|R
5000|$|Eno {{recorded}} and mixed {{most of the}} album on a Mac, using Logic, {{over a period of}} four years. He also engineered it himself, [...] "because otherwise I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to spend six years in a commercial studio and pay staff, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> become too expensive".|$|R
60|$|If Aunt Jane {{had gone}} into the state of wrath to be {{naturally}} expected, Gillian would have risen in arms on her brother's behalf, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> much pleasanter than the leniency which made her views of justice appear like unkindness.|$|E
6000|$|The skipper's laugh {{was very}} grim. [...] "It wouldn't have counted if they hadn't. One thing {{would have been}} certain--I was in command, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> quite enough to stop my getting another steamer. It's always {{somebody}} else's fault {{when you get a}} boat ashore." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{all turned}} on that release. What {{had given her}} {{strength}} to refuse him this time was solely {{the tale of the}} widow told by the dairyman; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> overcome in another moment. But Angel said no more; his face was perplexed; he went away.|$|E
60|$|Objection 3. But I find, {{together}} with these things, weakness and faintness as to my graces; my faith my hope, my love, and desires to these {{and all other}} Christian duties are weak; I am like {{the man in the}} dream, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> run, but could not; <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fought, but could not; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fled, but could not.|$|R
2500|$|... "No {{military}} defeat {{could then}} have robbed {{her of the}} trust and gratitude of half of Asia or even more, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> mattered {{a great deal in}} finding for her a new, great, and abiding place in a postwar world in which Asia was coming into her own." ...|$|R
50|$|According to history, {{that man}} was {{supposed}} to be Fire Shogun Blaird. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> obtained the last Cosmo Capsule from her, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> plunged the world into darkness. However, due to a mixup, the first man she saw was instead Takuto, and she instantly fell in love with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better as it is," [...] said Marika {{in a low}} voice. [...] "If you {{had been}} killed she would have fallen {{into the hands of}} the Bashi-Bazouks, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> worse--far worse. The Lord does all things well. He gave, and He has taken away--oh let us try to say, Blessed be His name!" ...|$|E
60|$|At last Black Pussy {{grew tired}} of playing, so {{catching}} up Grandfather Frog in her mouth, she started along the little path from the spring to the Long Lane. Grandfather Frog didn't even kick, which was just as well, because if he had, Black Pussy would have held him tighter, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very uncomfortable indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no; we {{are safe}} enough," [...] Dick agreed. [...] "If I {{had not been}} sure of that, we would have gone {{up one of the}} passes to the south, that has been ceded to us, though {{it would have been a}} great deal longer round to Bangalore--unless, indeed, we had gone by Kistnagherry, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> too {{dangerous}} to attempt, for the officers on the frontier would probably have recognised us." ...|$|E
60|$|That noble savage {{required}} no persuasion. From {{the first}} he had shown himself to be utterly devoid of fear. He felt that the grand craving of his nature--a thirst for knowledge--was about to be gratified, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> encouraged him to risk anything, {{even if he had}} been much less of a hero than he was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well {{for both}} of us geese!" [...] said Tom inwardly, as he went to pick him up. [...] "I verily believe he was going to strike me, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done for neither of us. I was a fool to say it; but the temptation was so exquisite; and it must have come some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only thrice, Nell, if so often," [...] said Bill. [...] "Well, {{that was}} the luckiest shot the Frenchmen ever fired at me; for if I hadn't had my thumb took off I couldn't have left the sarvice, d'ye see; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> delayed my {{marriage}} with you, Nell. But now, as the old song says-- ...|$|R
60|$|Did she {{question}} him, hurry him, frighten him, threaten him, to {{make him}} confess? Not a bit. You may see her, as I said, at her work often enough if {{you know where to}} look for her: but you will never see her do that. For, if she had, she would have tempted him to tell lies in his fright; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> worse for him, if possible, than even becoming a heathen chimney-sweep again.|$|E
60|$|XIII. If God had not put it {{into the}} heart of some Christians or Church to {{preserve}} the Epistles of the Apostle to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, and others, we in this age of the world should in all probability never have known that there ever were any such Christians and doctrines; their names and doctrines might have been lost, and we might have perished, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dreadful; for God mostly works by second causes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{could never}} have told, till I was obliged to betray myself,' said Laura. 'You know, Amy, it was no engagement. We never wrote to each other, we had but one walk; it was no {{business}} of his to speak till he could hope for papa's consent to our marriage. It would have been all confusion if he had told, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> only that we had always loved each other with all our hearts, which every one knew before.' ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{he took a}} {{step towards}} me, but again the nozzle of my pistol drove him back. To have pistoled him there and then as he {{deserved}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> brought the household about my ears, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> defeated my object. To have fallen upon him and slain him with silent steel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> equally embarrassed me, as you shall understand anon.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is wonderful," [...] he said, {{when she}} had finished; [...] "but I did not tell Luud--you noticed that I did not tell Luud about it. Had he known, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had you sing to him <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{resulted}} in your being kept with him that he might hear you sing whenever he wished; but now I can have you all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You might <b>have</b> been caught, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> meant endless trouble. You {{might have}} {{incurred}} {{all sorts of}} consequences. What {{did you know about}} her?... We have wasted four days in that hot close place. When we found that League of Social Service we were talking about," [...] he said with a determined eye upon me, [...] "chastity will be first among the virtues prescribed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{pity the}} old fellow {{had to tell}} his wife," [...] said the Master of the House. [...] "Women ruin great ambitions by too much common-sense. A great many of the inventions we now {{consider}} necessary would have been utterly lost to us if some men's brains {{had not been a}} little addled. A woman would have set them straight, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the end. That is the reason so few women are inventors; they have too much sense." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} added {{somewhat}} {{to that which}} Pierre had said, counting thereby to soothe my cousin; but little Frenchie dragged me back, motioning with his finger on his lips that I hold my peace. I understood that again was the lad right, for if {{we did what we}} might toward coaxing Saul into a better humor, we were possibly giving him an opportunity to fly off in a rage again, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> fatal to all the faint hopes in which we then indulged.|$|E
60|$|Sir Harry Burrard, with a caution {{characteristic}} of age, refused to adopt Wellesley's bold plan. A great success had been gained, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> imperilled by Junot's falling {{with all his}} force upon one or other of the British columns. Sir Arthur himself, at a later period, when a commission was appointed by Parliament to inquire into the circumstances, admitted that, though he still believed that success would have attended his own plan, he considered that Sir Harry Burrard's decision was fully justified on military grounds.|$|E
25|$|The walled {{garden at}} the back of the house has been {{specially}} planted with flowers <b>and</b> herbs <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been known in Shakespeare's time.|$|R
50|$|Interstate 895 was a {{proposed}} Interstate Highway in Rhode Island <b>and</b> Massachusetts <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> supplemented Interstate 295 {{to create a}} full beltway around Providence.|$|R
