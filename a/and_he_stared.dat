60|$|Sir Oliver's brows went up, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at {{the row of}} solemn faces.|$|E
60|$|Kurt had vibrated {{to those}} most {{significant}} words <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> speechless at his father.|$|E
60|$|The rancher gave a start, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> {{as he had}} stared before, fixedly and perplexedly at Wade.|$|E
60|$|The {{sick man}} {{raised his eyes}} suddenly, <b>and</b> <b>stared.</b> <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> for a long time. The youth looked inscrutably out of the window.|$|R
50|$|Blacksad {{meets with}} Miss Grey and {{compliments}} {{her on her}} dedication towards the neighborhood's children. After the two say goodbye, Blacksad finds Kaylie sadly staring at him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> back sadly as well. The book concludes by highlighting Kaylie's innocence and her ultimate abandonment, but her fate is not made clear.|$|R
6000|$|... (His mistake surprises her, {{but she is}} in a wild {{mood and}} curtsies, then turns away <b>and</b> smiles. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> as if half-convinced.) ...|$|R
60|$|Bostil {{shook his}} huge frame, and {{he rubbed his}} eyes {{as if they had}} become dim, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> again.|$|E
60|$|Again Dingaan moaned, for he {{had heard}} these very words spoken. Umbopa turned and stared at him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at Umbopa.|$|E
60|$|Stroeve {{was silent}} again, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> {{at me with}} his mouth open and his round blue eyes {{starting}} out of his head.|$|E
60|$|When McNutt {{was handed}} his letter by the {{postmaster}} <b>and</b> storekeeper <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at its contents in a bewildered way that roused the loungers to amused laughter.|$|R
60|$|Ill as I was, I forgot my sufferings {{the moment}} I looked at him. Wild <b>and</b> haggard, <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> {{at me with}} bloodshot eyes like a man demented.|$|R
6000|$|... "Great Caesar! what's this?" [...] groaned Tom as {{he shifted}} a weight from his shoulders, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> in amazement as {{he found himself}} confronted by Nellie Laning! ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{for a few}} moments, {{there was}} silence, while Dot and Tot stared at the hairy old man <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at them.|$|E
6000|$|Again Mr Boffin's {{eyes opened}} wide, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at the {{applicant}} {{from head to}} foot, repeating 'Queer!--You're sure it was Secretary? Are you?' ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Domitian grew angry, {{the false}} modesty left his face, his tall form {{straightened}} itself, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> round with his blear, evil-looking eyes.|$|E
60|$|He gave {{a sort of}} roar of {{amusement}} and apology, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at her again {{with much of the}} interest of a naturalist in an extraordinary specimen.|$|R
6000|$|To hear a man {{stuffed with}} straw speak, and speak so well, quite startled Woot, <b>and</b> perhaps <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> a bit rudely at the Scarecrow. But {{after a moment}} he replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|But how the King did {{open his}} eyes, to be sure, <b>and</b> how <b>he</b> <b>stared!</b> [...] "Now," [...] said Peter, [...] "I {{should like to}} marry your daughter, if you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My God!" [...] said Leandre, overcome, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> awhile. Then {{he burst}} out afresh. [...] "Are you quite heartless? Are you always Scaramouche?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The master's pulse stood still, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> helplessly. The buzz {{of study}} ceased. The pupils {{wondered}} if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind. The master said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I've {{seen her}} wrong," [...] said Ludlow, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at Charmian {{as if she}} were a lay-figure. She bore his {{scrutiny}} as impassively as a lay-figure could.|$|E
60|$|He stopped suddenly, rose <b>and</b> went white. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at the man, open-mouthed; he trembled visibly.|$|R
60|$|There was a tone in {{his voice}} which roused Appleby suddenly, <b>and</b> {{standing}} up <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> about him.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at it, {{it began}} slowly to dawn upon Fenn {{that he had}} not shown up to {{advantage}} in the recent interview. In a word, he had made a fool of himself.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him slowly. His face turned a little pale, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at her blankly, like a deaf-and-dumb man who was {{wondering}} what it was all about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah but it was," [...] {{he gently}} insisted. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> before him {{now as he}} had been staring for so many weeks. [...] "I was to have known myself." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{checked his}} wildness. It brought {{him up with}} a round turn. His jaw fell, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at her, lost now for words. Of this she took the fullest advantage.|$|E
60|$|Holmes sat {{for some}} little time {{twisting}} this letter between his fingers, <b>and</b> frowning, as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> into the fire.|$|R
60|$|Harder <b>and</b> harder <b>he</b> <b>stared,</b> {{his head}} sinking lower every moment, till at length without another sound, very quietly <b>and</b> {{unexpectedly}} <b>he</b> {{went over the}} side of the boat. For a few seconds they saw his bright-coloured garments sinking to the depths, then he vanished.|$|R
60|$|Elias Lacy was thunderstruck by {{the sudden}} turn of affairs, <b>and,</b> {{wheeling}} around, <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> in open-mouthed wonder at the retreating girlish figures.|$|R
60|$|When one of {{the candles}} was lighted, and stuck into an empty ink-bottle that served as candlestick, Paul {{was able to see}} the interior, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at it in surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Vincent Cawdor," [...] she continued, [...] "came in alone. He {{looked just}} as {{objectionable}} as ever, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at me till I nearly threw my wine glass at him." ...|$|E
60|$|Umslopogaas stood {{great and}} grim, his hands {{resting on the}} handle of his tall axe; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> also, the blood pulsing against the skin that covered the hole in his head.|$|E
6000|$|The heath-keeper never moved. Possibly {{he raised}} his eyebrows, <b>and</b> {{certainly}} <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> harder than <b>he</b> did before. [...] "You're pretty unsociable," [...] he said slowly, as Mr. Hoopdriver seized the handles and stood ready to mount {{as soon as the}} cart had passed.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of the Apache Indian Chief Geronimo, ca. 1880 - 1884. Full figure in a half kneel, taken in a studio. He grasps a rifle diagonally across his chest. He is wearing a dotted shirt <b>and</b> buckskin(?) boots. <b>He</b> has a bandana tied around his neck and wears a bracelet on his right wrist. His dark hair is parted in the middle and falls to his shoulders. His face wears a grimace <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> intensely directly into the camera. A painted backdrop and props give the illusion of an setting in the wilderness...|$|R
6000|$|He fumbled in {{his pocket}} and drew out a dirty piece of pasteboard. It read: [...] "R. Canter, Second Hand Furniture, 20 Second Street." [...] <b>And</b> still <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> at Stephen, as one who gazes upon a mystery. A few curious {{pedestrians}} had stopped in front of them.|$|R
