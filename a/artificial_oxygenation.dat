40|$|In 2010, the Swan River Trust {{commissioned}} Murdoch University {{to evaluate}} the effects of <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation</b> on the benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) fauna of the Upper Swan Estuary (USE). The project involved the collection of BMIs monthly between January 2010 and December 2011, at five locations in the USE between Ron Courtney Island and just upstream of Middle Swan Bridge (i. e. the Jane Brook confluence). Specifically, the project had two components; 1) to describe any spatial and/or temporal patterns in the BMI community during eight consecutive seasons in 2010 and 2011 and 2) to assess the ecological and management implications of the findings, with specific reference {{to the effects of}} hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) and of the <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation</b> program...|$|E

40|$|Benthic macroinvertebrates are {{a crucial}} {{component}} of estuarine ecosystems as they {{play an important}} role in nutrient cycling and also provide a food source for fish and birds. The limited mobility of these species and their predictable responses to natural and anthropogenic stressors has led to their extensive use in biotic indices of estuarine health and in other studies aimed at assessing the levels of degradation. Anoxic events have been known to occur periodically within the Swan-Canning Estuary and, as a result, the Department of Water in partnership with the Swan River Trust built an oxygenation plant at Guildford in 2008 to artificially oxygenate the water column in this area and thus prevent low oxygen events. While the supersaturation of the water column has resulted in increased oxygen uptake by the sediment, when the plant is running, the effects of the <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation</b> on the composition of the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna remained unquantified. This study will present one year of seasonal data on the composition of the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna at five locations along the Upper Swan, including sites in the direct vicinity of the Guildford oxygen plant, to determine whether the <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation</b> has had any positive effect on benthic macroinvertebrate diversity and community composition...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{covers the}} main medical {{applications}} of artificial membranes. Specific attention {{is given to}} drug delivery systems, artificial organs and tissue engineering which seem to dominate {{the interest of the}} membrane community this period. In all cases, the materials, methods and {{the current state of the}} art are evaluated and future prospects are discussed. Concerning drug delivery systems, attention is paid to diffusion controlled systems. For the transdermal delivery systems, passive as well as iontophoretic systems are described in more detail. Concerning artificial organs, we cover in detail: <b>artificial</b> kidney, membrane <b>oxygenation,</b> <b>artificial</b> liver, artificial pancreas as well as the application of membranes for tissue engineering scaffolds and bioreactors. This review shows the important role of membrane science and technology in medical applications but also highlights the importance of collaboration of membrane scientists with others (biologists, bioengineers, medical doctors, etc.) in order to address the complicated challenges in this field...|$|R
30|$|<b>Artificial</b> blood <b>oxygenation</b> is an {{essential}} aspect of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, maintaining physiological levels of oxygen and {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood, and thus temporarily replacing the normal function of the lungs. The blood-gas exchange devices used for such procedures have a long history and have had varying degrees of success. In this paper we consider a simple model of a new approach to enhancing the diffusion of oxygen into the blood while it is contained in the artificial blood oxygenator. We show that using a transverse flow, which may be set up using mixing elements that we have previously shown experimentally to enhance blood oxygenation, will increase the oxygen levels within the blood. This simple model and associated analytic solutions can then be used to aid the optimisation of blood oxygenation devices.|$|R
5000|$|The theory {{behind this}} {{invasive}} {{approach is that}} the <b>artificial</b> restoration of <b>oxygenation</b> and end-organ perfusion allows treating physicians more time to mitigate and reverse pathology which contributes to cardiac arrest and refractory shock. It {{has been well documented}} that the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation and furthermore eventual discharge from hospital, after ten minutes of CPR falls significantly. [...] Once circulation is established, the patient is able to be transferred, for further investigation and intervention, to facilities such as a cardiac cath lab and an intensive care unit.|$|R
40|$|Deoxygenation events {{within the}} Swan-Canning Estuary are a severe and {{potentially}} lethal {{threat to the}} resident aquatic fauna and an ongoing concern for management. Hypoxic conditions develop in the upper estuary following heavy rainfall events that deliver an influx of freshwater into the system, stratifying the water column. When tidally driven seawater and freshwater discharge meet, haloclines are formed, creating a barrier to vertical mixing. Organisms living within the stratified bottom waters can rapidly deplete oxygen reserves, eventually causing the lower layers to become hypoxic. The frequency and severity of these events are projected to increase due to climate change as associated reductions in surface runoff reduce river flow (a remediate of hypoxia) and allow deeper penetration of the marine salt wedge, causing prolonged and more intense stratification of the system. In response to this threat, <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation</b> plants have been installed in two regions of the upper estuary known to experience hypoxic conditions most frequently {{in an attempt to}} maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations appropriate for fauna. Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked fifty-five Acanthopagrus butcheri over a 116 -day period between autumn and winter with the aim to relate the patterns of movement (including residency, habitat use and movements on daily and seasonal scales) to a suite of environmental variables commonly associated with the movement of fishes in estuaries, and determine whether the spatial residency of this species is influenced by the operation of the <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation</b> plants. The study revealed that detection of A. butcheri was significantly influenced by hypoxia, habitat complexity, salinity and flow, while the operation of the oxygenation plants did not significantly influence A. butcheri detection. Acanthopagrus. butcheri avoided areas wherein large proportions (> 20...|$|E
40|$|Two {{applications}} of immobilized enzymes to the <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation</b> of blood are described. The first concerns facilitated transport of CO 2 {{moving from the}} blood through a hydrophobic membrane. It is based on activation of the rate-limiting step, which is the dehydration of hydrogen carbonic ions to CO 2 at the interface between the blood and the membrane. The addition of grafted carbonic anhydrase may hypothetically increase the diffusion rate 50 times. Multiplication by 2 - 8 of the CO 2 flux across a silicone membrane was obtained experimentally. The second application {{is the use of}} a catalase-bound cellophane membrane which creates oxygen in the blood stream, starting from a concentrated solution of hydrogen peroxide. Experimentally, a flux of 0, 4 cm 3 /sec-cm 2 could be obtained without any bubbling and without any analytically detectable hydrogen peroxide in the acceptor solution. Oxygen production by catalase is controlled by the movement of H 2 O 2 in the donor compartment. Catalase remains active for 48 hr in such a system. The technical problems linked to the presence of the stabilizer and to the protection of catalase against concentrated H 2 O 2 were successfully solved. One constraining factor {{in the use of the}} catalase oxygenator was the attack on the hydrophilic support of the enzyme by the hydrogen peroxide solution. A system using both enzymes in the same device was also tentatively designed...|$|E
40|$|Julkaistu vain painettuna, saatavuus katso Bibid. Published only in printed form, {{availability}} see Bibid. This thesis {{consists of}} four essays related to topics characteristic of the economic analysis of environmental issues with long-term consequences. The first two analyze intergenerational equity when benefits and costs of a project fall unevenly upon generations. The last two {{examine the effect of}} uncertainty and learning on optimal environmental policy, with specific application to mitigating eutrophication in the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe. The first essay examines the situation where the social time preferences differ from those revealed in agents' market behavior. I show that the reaction of the market prevents implementation of the government's first-best allocation. This implies a Ricardian-equivalence result for social discounting: The government cannot do better than to evaluate public investments using the time preferences revealed in the market. This equivalence-result breaks down and the government can use a social discount rate if public investment is either risky or large, or has returns that are imperfect substitutes for private consumption. The second essay analyzes the possibility of implementing intertemporal social welfare functions to promote intergenerational equity. As each generation chooses independently whether it will follow the proposed welfare function or not, it is ultimately only policy rules leading to subgame-perfect equilibria of the intergenerational game that will be followed. I propose a particular social welfare function satisfying this requirement: a backward-looking function that includes preferences of deceased generations in future decision making. The third essay studies the effect of an uncertain baseline development of emissions on optimal environmental policy. This uncertainty precludes implementation of the first-best policy and induces adjustment costs for society. In order to quantify this effect, we construct a model for the Baltic Sea, where nutrient emissions are subject to uncertain climate impacts. The optimal policy is a strong and immediate abatement of both nitrogen and phosphorus. Adjustment costs are found to be {{less than one percent of}} the total cost of climate change for the sea.   The fourth essay analyzes geoengineering measures whose true effectiveness are unknown but can be ascertained through experimentation. The relevant question for cost-benefit analysis in this context is determining the conditions under which experimenting should be started. We analyze this problem with a view to <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation</b> of Baltic Sea deep waters and find that the expected welfare effects of oxygenation are negative, but constructing around ten pumping stations is optimal due to the value of the information provided by this experiment...|$|E
40|$|Very recently, {{the concept}} of <b>artificial</b> intracorporeal <b>oxygenation</b> of blood for {{patients}} suffering from respiratory failure has been introduced into clinical practice through development of a totally implantable intravascular oxygenator (IVOX). We report {{on the use of}} such a device in a patient who developed severe respiratory insufficiency secondary to prolonged hypovolaemic shock and pneumonia following successful repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in September, 1990. Postoperatively, severe hypoxaemia occurred (AaDO 2 548 - 602 torr) despite extensive mechanical ventilatory support. There was no obvious chance to overcome this situation by conventional therapeutic measures and {{the decision was made to}} institute IVOX therapy. Hypoxaemia was resolved immediately and both FiO 2 and tidal volume could be reduced within hours. The patient's respiratory condition continued to improve over the next days leading to termination of IVOX therapy after 71 hours. However, the necessity of long-term ventilatory support secondary to recurrent pneumonia and sepsis, multiple abdominal reoperations for ischemic colitis and retroperitoneal abscess prolonged his recovery. He was discharged from the hospital after four months and is alive and well now 14 months after his operation. He is the first long-term survivor after IVOX therapy in Europe. IVOX may be successfully used in selected patients while the indications and it's potential role in the therapy of severe respiratory failure still need to be defined...|$|R
30|$|Hypolimnetic anoxia is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in productive lakes and reservoirs that are deep enough for thermal stratification. Anoxia can develop during the summer, because depletion of dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion is much faster than transfer of dissolved oxygen (DO) from the surface layers by advection and dispersion (Mackenthun and Stefan 1998; Beutel et al. 2007). Anoxia accelerates eutrophication, because in low oxygen conditions, iron (Fe) is reduced and loses its capability to bind phosphorus (P) (e.g. Boström et al. 1982). This is of crucial importance for lake ecosystems, where P {{is one of the}} most important factors regulating ecosystem productivity and sediment has a large storage of P compared to the water column (Wetzel 2001). Due to the effect of anoxia on internal P loading, <b>artificial</b> aeration or <b>oxygenation</b> (for simplicity, the term aeration is used hereafter) is frequently used in the management of eutrophicated lakes and reservoirs suffering from oxygen deficits (Cooke et al. 2005; Kuha et al. 2016; Grochowska et al. 2017; Horppila et al. 2017). However, evidence on the long-term positive effects of aeration on water and sediment quality is obscure (Gächter and Wehrli 1998; Liboriussen et al. 2009; Kuha et al. 2016; Horppila et al. 2017). In addition, an important issue is that aeration has negative side-effects that can counteract the positive effects. These include increased temperature and water flow velocities in the hypolimnion with consequences for the oxygen demand of the sediment (Beutel et al. 2007; Gantzer et al. 2009; Gerling et al. 2014; Niemistö et al. 2016). Such effects complicate the planning of aeration projects and scaling the use of aerators.|$|R
40|$|Le lac de Comabhio (Lombardie, Italie du Nord) est un lac peu profond (z- = 4, 4 m) en {{comparaison}} à sa surface (3, 44 km 2). L'eutrophisation naturelle du lac a été accélérée par l'apport d'effluents domestiques pas traités. Pour améliorer la situation, les effluents conduits par un collecteur circumlacustre, ont été recueillis à l'extérieur du bassin versant. Les effets seront visibles seulement dans plusieurs années et ces interventions ne seront pas suffisantes pour ramener le lac à l'état de mésotrophie. Afin d'accélérer l'assainissement du lac, mais surtout pour éviter la forte mortalité du poisson périodiquement à la fin de l'été, on a pris la décision d'oxygéner artificiellement l'hypolimnion. Pour prévoir les effets de l'oxygénation on a fait une expérience dans le lac avec deux enceintes en PVC (diamètre : 40 m; profondeur : 6 m; volume : 7000 m 3). On a gardé une enceinte comme témoin; dans l'autre a été insufflé de l'oxygène pur. On a recueilli, à certains intervalles de temps, des échantillons d'eau et de plancton du lac et des deux enceintes. Les éléments nutritifs ont été analysés; la température, la transparence, la conductivité et le pH ont été mesurés sur place. L'effet le plus visible du traitement consistait dans une augmentation de la concentration de l'oxygène visant à produire des conditions normales pour la vie des poissons. Les effets de l'oxygénation sur les caractéristiques chimiques, physiques et biologiques du milieu sont discutés. Lake Comabbio (Lombardy, Northern Itaty) is {{a shallow}} Lake (zmax = 8. 0 m; z-= 4. 4 m; surface = 3. 44 km 2). Its naturally high trophic level has been increased {{by the huge}} nutrient loading from domestic effluents. Each year (except in winter, when commonly the lake is covered with ice) more phytoplankton blooms are observed and {{in the late summer}} oxygen depletion, with a consequent mass mortality of fish, occurs. At present, to reduce the nutrient charge, the effluents are collected in a channel and diverted from the lake watershed. Because of the significant nutrient release from the sediment ("internal eutrophication") the reduction of the external loading may slow the eutrophication rate, but it is not sufficient to restore the lake to an acceptable mesotrophic state within a reasonable time. To prevent the periodic mass mortality of fish and possibly to accelerate the restoration process of the ecosystem, the Lake Comabbio Protection Committee decided to oxygenate the hypolimnetic layer artificially. In order to avoid undesirable effects of aeration (e. g. nitrogen enrichment of lake water), dissolved oxygen injection was preferred. As there is no general agreement on the ecological effects of the oxygen (or air) addition it was decided, before applying oxygenation to the whole lake, to carry out experiments using the "enclosure" method. One experiment was carried out from 26 th September to 9 th December 1986 and this was replicated in 1987 from 22 nd April to 30 th November. This paper is concerned with the first experiment, as data treatment of the second is still in progress. Two cylindrical "enclosures" of PVC (diameter = 40. 0 m; height = 6. 0 m; volume = 7000 m 3) were settled in Lake Comabbio to isolate a water column with its sediments. One enclosure was treated with oxygen from 15 th November to 6 th December, the other was kept as control. The water aspirated from the enclosure was oxygenated (20. 3 mg O 2 /l) and injected in the same enclosure at 4 m depth at a rate of 4 m 3 /h. During the enclosure settlement the fish escaped from the enclosures. To simulate a complete ecosystem, the plan was to add to each enclosure 60 kg of the most abundant fish species (Scardinius erythrophtalmus). By mistake, fish were added to the enclosure that was to be oxygenated but not to the control. Water and zooplankton were sampled simultaneously from both the enclosures {{as well as from the}} Lake. Zooplankton was collected by vertical hauls from the bottom to the water surface. The following parameters were measured : temperature, transparency, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, phosphorus and nitrogen compounds, chlorophyll-a and pheopigments. The injection of water rich in oxygen did not resuspend the sediments and the absence of bubbles showed that the oxygen had completely dissolved. Soon after oxygenation the difference in oxygen concentration in the treated enclosure and in the control was progressively reduced until 26 th November, when both the enclosures had the same oxygen concentration. At the end of the experiment (9 th December) the oxygen concentration in the control was about 4 mg/l, whereas in the treated enclosure it attained a concentration of 6 mg/l, although in the latter the oxygen consumption was greater than in the control, owing to fish respiration and the increased activity of aerobic microorganisms. The higher concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (N-NH 4) measured in the lake were probably due to the external loading of nutrients. The nutrient concentrations in the treated enclosure were similar to those of the control. The greater concentration of nutrients was probably the cause of more abundant phytoplankton in the lake, which was also demonstrated by the lower values of water transparency, when compared with those measured in both the enclosures. The pH values of the control were similar to those of the treated enclosure. The pattern of abundance and species composition of the zooplankton in the treated enclosure did not differ from that of the control. The Entomostraca populations decreased in the lake as well as in both the enclosures from the beginning to the end of the experiment. From this experiment, carried out when oxygen depletion affected the whole water column, we may conclude that oxygenation can prevent fish mortality, without significantly influencing the structure and biomass of the planktonic community. The variations in the plankton and chemical and physical characteristics of the water (except oxygen concentration) were essentially due to the season and mot to the <b>artificial</b> <b>oxygenation.</b> In addition, oxygenation, by abolishing the periodical mortality of fish, may also prevent the release of a huge amount of organic substances from the dead fish into the water...|$|E
