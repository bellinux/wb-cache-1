50|$|Chromosome 21-derived MicroRNAs Provide an Etiological Basis for <b>Aberrant</b> <b>Protein</b> Expression in Human Down Syndrome BrainsThis {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. In this paper, Elton and his lab were working with five microRNA genes. The ultimate results suggesting that the inactivation of the miRNA gene, Has-21, might provide a therapeutic tool in the treatment of down syndrome. The paper was first published on November 6, 2009. By the time the paper was retracted, it had already been cited 34 times. The paper was retracted due to falsified and/or fabricated “western blots” in figures 2C, 2D, 2F, 3C, 3E, 4G, 5C and 5F.|$|E
50|$|Chromosomal {{analysis}} of ASPS shows the breaking and joining of two chromosomes in the tumor cells. A piece of chromosome X breaks and is joined to chromosome 17. This translocation creates a fusion between two genes named ASPL and TFE3, {{which results in}} the formation of an <b>aberrant</b> <b>protein</b> (termed fusion protein) that is not found in normal cells. Two sorts of fusions between chromosome X and chromosome 17 are found in different ASPS tumors: Type one, and type two. Dr. Ladanyi at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in New York City, has pioneered this work. The first xenograft model of ASPS (for type one) was established in mice by David Vistica at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, MD in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Improper {{gene dosage}} of the PMP22 gene can cause <b>aberrant</b> <b>protein</b> {{synthesis}} {{and function of}} myelin sheath. Since the components of myelin are stoichiometrically set, any irregular expression of a component can cause destabilization of myelin and neuropathic disorders. Alterations of PMP22 gene expression {{are associated with a}} variety of neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A), Dejerine-Sottas disease, and Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsy (HNPP). Too much PMP22 (e.g. caused by gene duplication) results in CMT1A, and too little PMP22 (e.g. caused by gene deletion) results in HNPP. Gene duplication of PMP22 is the most common genetic cause of CMT1A where the overproduction of PMP22 results in defects in multiple signalling pathways and dysfunction of transcriptional factors like KNOX20, SOX10 and EGR2.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we show a {{correlation}} between synthesis of <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins</b> and their oxidative modification. The level of <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins</b> was elevated in Escherichia coli cultures by decreasing transcriptional or translational fidelity using specific mutations or drugs. Protein carbonylation, an oxidative modification, increased in parallel to the induction of the heat shock chaperone GroEL. As the protein turnover rates and level of intracellular oxidative stress remained unchanged, it appears that carbonylation results from the increased susceptibility of the misfolded proteins. These {{studies show that the}} cellular protein oxidation is not limited only by available reactive oxygen species, but by the levels of <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins.</b> Thus, protein oxidation seen in aging cells may be the consequence also of reduced transcriptional/translational fidelity, and protein structures appear to have evolved to minimize oxidative damage. In addition, we discuss the possibility that carbonylation, being an unrepairable protein modification, may serve as a tagging system to shunt misfolded proteins between pathways of refolding by chaperones or the proteolytic apparatus...|$|R

40|$|SummaryProtein {{quality control}} {{degradation}} systems rid the cell of <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins,</b> preventing detrimental effects on normal cellular function. Although such {{systems have been}} identified in most subcellular compartments, none have been found in the nucleus. Here, we report the discovery of such a system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is defined by San 1 p, a ubiquitin-protein ligase that, in conjunction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Cdc 34 p and Ubc 1 p, targets four distinct mutant nuclear proteins for ubiquitination and destruction by the proteasome. San 1 p has exquisite specificity for <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins</b> and does not target the wild-type versions of its mutant substrates. San 1 p is nuclear localized and requires nuclear localization for function. Loss of SAN 1 results in a chronic stress response, underscoring its role of protein quality control in the cell. We propose that San 1 p-mediated degradation acts as the last line of proteolytic defense against the deleterious accumulation of <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins</b> in the nucleus and that analogous systems exist in other eukaryotes...|$|R
5000|$|The Janda {{laboratory}} {{demonstrated that}} nornicotine, a constituent of tobacco, can catalyze aldol reactions in water: {{the only known}} example of a metabolite capable of serving as a catalyst. This finding has led him to propose new chemical links between smoking and metabolic diseases, including that nornicotine causes <b>aberrant</b> <b>protein</b> glycation and thus provides an unrecognized pathway {{for the development of}} the pathology of tobacco abuse; additionally nornicotine also catalyzes the covalent modification of certain prescription drugs such as the commonly used steroid, prednisone. These findings were crucial to his group’s publication on the glycation of the amyloid β-peptide by nornicotine, proposing the hypothesis that there is a fortuitous chemical dynamic between smoking and Alzheimer's disease. More recently, Janda’s group has found that nornicotine can also catalyze the isomerization of retinal molecules, implicating nornicotine in the pathology of both age-related macular degeneration as well as smoking-related developmental abnormalities. [...] Lastly, his group has linked this glycation process to methamphetamine addiction.|$|E
50|$|The Proopiomelanocortin gene (POMC) is {{expressed}} in the hypothalamus, in the pituitary gland. It yields a range of biologically active peptides and hormones and undergoes tissue-specific posttranslational processing to yield a range of biologically active peptides producing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), b-endorphin, and a-, b- and c-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)(cite). These peptides then interact with different melanocortin receptors (MCRs) and {{are involved in a}} wide range of processes including the regulation of body weight (MC3R and MC4R), adrenal steroidogenesis (MC2R) and hair pigmentation (MC1R). Published in the British Associations of Dermatologists in 2012, Lack of red hair phenotype in a North-African obese child homozygous for a novel POMC null mutation showed nonsense-mediated decay RNA evaluation in a hair pigment chemical analysis. They found that inactivating the POMC gene mutation results in obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair. This has been seen in both in humans and mice. In this experiment they described a 3-year-old boy from Rome, Italy. He was a source of focus because he had Addison's disease and early onset obesity. They collected his DNA and amplified it using PCR. Sequencing analysis revealed a homozygous single substitution determining a stop codon. This caused an <b>aberrant</b> <b>protein</b> and the corresponding amino acid sequence indicated the exact position of the homozygous nucleotide. The substitution was localized in exon 3 and nonsense mutation at codon 68. The results from this experiment strongly suggest that the absence of red hair in non-European patients with early onset obesity and hormone deficiency does not exclude the occurrence of POMC mutations. By sequencing the patients DNA they found that this novel mutation has a collection of symptoms because of a malfunctioning nonsense-mediated mRNA decay surveillance pathway.|$|E
5000|$|RNAs {{in native}} milieu {{are exposed to}} various insults. Among these threats, {{oxidative}} stress {{is one of the}} major causes of damage to RNAs. The level of oxidative stress that a cell endures is reflected by the quantity of Reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are generated from normal oxygen metabolism in cells and are recognized as a list of active molecules, such as O2•−, 1O2, H2O2 and, •OH [...] A nucleic acid can be oxidized by ROS through a Fenton reaction. To date, around 20 oxidative lesions have been discovered in DNA. RNAs are likely to be more sensitive to ROS for the following reasons: i) the basically single-stranded structure exposes more sites to ROS; ii) compared with nuclear DNA, RNAs are less compartmentalized; iii) RNAs distribute broadly in cells not only in the nucleus as DNAs do, but also in large portions in the cytoplasm. This theory has been supported by a series of discoveries from rat livers, human leukocytes, etc. Actually, monitoring a system by applying the isotopical label 18O-H2O2 shows greater oxidation in cellular RNA than in DNA.Oxidation randomly damages RNAs, and each attack bring problems to the normal cellular metabolism. Although alteration of genetic information on mRNA is relatively rare, oxidation on mRNAs in vitro and in vivo results in low translation efficiency and <b>aberrant</b> <b>protein</b> products.Though the oxidation strikes the nucleic strands randomly, particular residues are more susceptible to ROS, such hotspot sites being hit by ROS at a high rate. Among all the lesions discovered thus far, one of the most abundant in DNA and RNA is the 8-hydroxyguanine. Moreover, 8-hydroxyguanine is the only one measurable among all the RNA lesions. Besides its abundance, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-oxoG) are identified as the most detrimental oxidation lesions for their mutagenic effect, in which this non-canonical counterpart can faultily pair with both adenine and cytosine at the same efficiency. This mis-pairing brings about the alteration of genetic information through the synthesis of DNA and RNA. In RNA, oxidation levels are mainly estimated through 8-oxoG-based assays. So far, approaches developed to directly measure 8-oxoG level include HPLC-based analysis and assays employing monoclonal anti-8-oxoG antibody. The HPLC-based method measures 8-oxoG with an electrochemical detector (ECD) and total G with a UV detector. The ratio that results from comparing the two numbers provides the extent that the total G is oxidized. Monoclonal anti-8-oxoG mouse antibody is broadly applied to directly detect this residue on either tissue sections or membrane, offering a more visual way to study its distribution in tissues and in discrete subsets of DNA or RNA. The established indirect techniques are mainly grounded on this lesion’s mutagenic aftermath, such as the lacZ assay. This method was first set up and described by Taddei and was a potentially powerful tool to understand the oxidation situation at both the RNA sequence level and single nucleotide level. Another source of oxidized RNAs is mis-incorporation of oxidized counterpart of single nucleotides. Indeed, the RNA precursor pool size is hundreds of sizes bigger than DNA’s.|$|E

40|$|During {{erythroblast}} enucleation, membrane proteins distribute between extruded nuclei and reticulocytes. In hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and {{hereditary elliptocytosis}} (HE), deficiencies of membrane proteins, {{in addition to}} those encoded by the mutant gene, occur. Elliptocytes, resulting from protein 4. 1 R gene mutations, lack not only 4. 1 R but also glycophorin C, which links the cytoskeleton and bilayer. In HS resulting from ankyrin- 1 mutations, band 3, Rh-associated antigen, and glycophorin A are deficient. The current study was undertaken to explore whether <b>aberrant</b> <b>protein</b> sorting, during enucleation, creates these membrane-spanning protein deficiencies. We found that although glycophorin C sorts to reticulocytes normally, it distributes to nuclei in 4. 1 R-deficient HE cells. Further, glycophorin A and Rh-associated antigen, which normally partition predominantly to reticulocytes, distribute to both nuclei and reticulocytes in an ankyrin- 1 -deficient murine model of HS.

40|$|Most {{neurodegenerative}} disorders are characterised by deposits of aggregated proteins that are readily visualised by light microscopy. Although {{the presence of}} such a bulky structure inside the cell or in the extracellular space is likely not to be healthy, over recent years the idea has emerged that these end-stage aggregates are a relatively safe way to deposit harmful <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins.</b> Protein quality control is a multi-level security system to safeguard cells from <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins</b> and is therefore a protective response. However, protein quality control may turn destructive in case of impairment of protein quality control for example by aging or because of overflow of the quality control systems due to prolonged exposure.

The pathogenesis of MCC is not well understood, and despite a recent plethora of mutational analyses, we have yet to find a set of signature mutations implicated in the majority of cases.

When deregulated, however, cancer cells take advantage of this mechanism to produce <b>aberrant</b> <b>proteins</b> with added, deleted, or altered functional domains that contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we discuss aspects of alternative splicing misregulation in cancer, focusing on splicing events affected by deregulation of regulatory splicing factors and also recent stud-ies identifying mutated components of the splicing machinery.

Mutants with enhanced salinomycin production were detected at a high incidence (7 to 12 %) among spontaneous isolates resistant to streptomycin (Strr), gentamicin, or rifampin (Rifr). Finally, we successfully demonstrated improvement of the salinomycin productivity of the industrial strain by 2. 3 -fold by introducing a triple mutation. The Strr mutant was shown to have a point mutation within the rpsL gene (encoding ribosomal protein S 12). Likewise, the Rifr mutant possessed a mutation in the rpoB gene (encoding the RNA polymerase β subunit). Increased productivity of salinomycin in the Strr mutant (containing the K 88 R mutation in the S 12 protein) may be a result of an <b>aberrant</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis mechanism. This aberration may manifest itself as enhanced translation activity in stationary-phase cells, as we have observed with the poly(U) -directed cell-free translation system.
