5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with <b>a</b> <b>fluorescent</b> dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>fluorescent</b> screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, {{a small fraction of the}} alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E

2500|$|Pioneering work by Atsushi Miyawaki and {{coworkers}} developed the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (...) , which enables fluorescence imaging {{of the cell}} cycle. [...] Originally, <b>a</b> green <b>fluorescent</b> protein, mAG, was fused to hGem(1/110) and <b>an</b> orange <b>fluorescent</b> protein (mKO2) was fused to hCdt1(30/120). [...] Note, these fusions are fragments that contain a nuclear localization signal and ubiquitination sites for degradation, but are not functional proteins. [...] The green fluorescent protein is made during the S, G2, or M phase and degraded during the G0 or G1 phase, while the orange fluorescent protein is made during the G0 or G1 phase and destroyed during the S, G2, or M phase. A far-red and near-infrared FUCCI was developed using <b>a</b> cyanobacteria-derived <b>fluorescent</b> protein (smURFP) and <b>a</b> bacteriophytochrome-derived <b>fluorescent</b> protein (...)

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>{{fluorescent}}</b> lamp, or fluorescent tube, is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp {{that uses}} fluorescence to produce visible light. An electric current {{in the gas}} excites mercury vapor, which produces short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor coating {{on the inside of}} the lamp to glow. <b>A</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamp converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps. The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.|$|E
25|$|The extra {{energy used}} to start <b>a</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamp is {{equivalent}} to {{a few seconds of}} normal operation; it is more energy-efficient to switch off lamps when not required for several minutes.|$|E

25|$|If <b>a</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamp is broken, a {{very small}} amount of mercury can {{contaminate}} the surrounding environment. About 99% of the mercury is typically contained in the phosphor, especially on lamps that are {{near the end of}} their life. The broken glass is usually considered a greater hazard than the small amount of spilled mercury. The EPA recommends airing out the location of <b>a</b> <b>fluorescent</b> tube break and using wet paper towels to help pick up the broken glass and fine particles. Any glass and used towels should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag. Vacuum cleaners can cause the particles to become airborne, and should not be used.|$|E
