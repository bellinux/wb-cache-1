5|$|Imelda's Blue Ladies—specifically Maria Luisa, a {{daughter}} of the rich Madrigal family and the wife of Dr. Vasquez—contributed to the fashion spending of Imelda. In 1968, Maria Luisa accompanied Imelda on an overseas trip, during which Imelda and daughter Imee spent $3.3 million. It was also {{at this time that}} Dr. Daniel Vasquez and Maria Luisa opened a Citibank account. On November of the same year, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account. An allegation that Imelda and Fernanda Vasquez <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the same is validated {{by the fact that the}} notations for the bank account had Imelda Marcos's handwriting.|$|E

When he discovers that Bruce is Batman, he demands that Bruce help him find Two-Face so that he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma turns himself into a criminal called the Riddler and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two steal capital in order to mass-produce Nygma's brainwave device. At Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman, but she soon discovers that they <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the same. Bruce decides to stop being Batman {{in order to have a}} normal life with Chase and to prevent Dick from murdering Two-Face. Dick angrily runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor; in the process, the Riddler destroys the Batcave. The criminals kidnap Chase after Two-Face shoots Bruce and the Riddler leaves him an another riddle.|$|E

5|$|The {{second story}} focuses on Shiva marrying Dhatchayini against {{the will of}} her father Dhatchan. Dhatchan {{performs}} a Mahayajna without inviting his son-in-law. Dhatchayini asks Shiva's permission {{to go to the}} ceremony, but Shiva refuses to let her go as he feels no good will come from it. Dhatchayini disobeys him and goes only to be insulted by Dhatchan. Dhatchayini curses her father and returns to Shiva who is angry with her. Dhatchayini asserts that they <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> without her, there is no Shiva. He refuses to agree with her and burns her to ashes. He then performs his Tandava, which is noticed by the Devas, who pacify him. Shiva then restores Dhatchayini to life and accepts that they are one.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives {{the example of}} water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – {{both of which have}} a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E

25|$|In {{discussing}} God's {{relationship to}} His creation, Orthodox theology distinguishes between God's eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and His uncreated energies, {{which is how}} He reaches us. The God who is transcendent and the God who touches us <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the same. That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from, God's inner being.|$|E

25|$|Colpoys {{was one of}} four {{vessels that}} Mr. T. Lockyer, of Plymouth, owned that the {{government}} hired at the same time. In reporting the transaction, the Naval Chronicle described Colpoys as a schooner under the command of Lieutenant Usher (or Ussher), and the two chase guns as 6-pounders. Throughout Colpoyss military career, references to her in the London Gazette and Lloyd's List fluctuated between describing her as a brig, cutter, and schooner. There are no references in Admiralty records of other vessels by that name, and the names of her commander generally assure that all these vessels <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the same.|$|E
25|$|In an {{adiabatic}} process, {{there is}} transfer of energy as work {{but not as}} heat.

The work done on the system is defined and measured by changes in mechanical or quasi-mechanical variables external to the system. Physically, adiabatic transfer of energy as work requires the existence of adiabatic enclosures.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Indian scriptures see Ṛta, a Hindu {{theological}} term {{similar to}} dharma, {{as a natural}} law that governs both the cosmos and human society. Performance of one's duties to uphold social institutions, such as marriage and family, thus becomes imperative, and duty overrides individual freedom. Dnyaneshwar is in agreement with tradition; he believes that divine order and moral order <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the same and are inherent in the universe itself. He, therefore, recommends that all social institutions be protected and preserved in their totality. However, {{when it comes to}} the institution of caste, his approach becomes more humanitarian and he advocates spiritual egalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|The Hoddle Grid is {{the layout}} of the streets in the centre of the {{original}} Melbourne City Centre. The grid was laid out in 1837 by Robert Hoddle.

The majority of Melbourne is oriented at 8 degrees clockwise from true north–noting that magnetic north was 8° 3' E in 1900, increasing to 11° 42' E in 2009. It covers the area from Flinders Street to Queen Victoria Market, and from Spencer Street to Spring Street.|$|E
