40|$|In this paper, a model {{reference}} {{fault tolerant}} control (FTC) strategy {{based on a}} reconfiguration of the reference model, {{with the addition of}} a virtual <b>actuator</b> <b>block,</b> is presented for linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. The advantage of the proposed FTC method is that the control system is reconfigured in such a way that the nominal controller is used without the need of retuning it. Moreover, the presence of saturations is taken into account through their incorporation in the reference model, and the introduction of additional varying parameters, such that the system exhibits some graceful performance degradation when the system could not achieve the desired state because of the actuator limits. The design of the control scheme is based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and polytopic LPV techniques. In order to implement the proposed active FTC strategy, a fault estimation is required.

Modern fault tolerant control (FTC) could play a substantial part in increasing reliability of modern wind turbines. A benchmark model for wind turbine fault detection and isolation, and FTC has previously been proposed. Based on this benchmark, an international competition on wind turbine FTC was announced. In this brief, the top three solutions from that competition are presented and evaluated.

Results. All three actuator materials showed the same net charge trend across the five active drug ingredients, with BDP, BUD and FS showing positive net charges for both nylon and PTFE actuators, respectively. While SB and IPBr had significantly negative net charges across the three different actuators, which correlates to the ionic functional groups present on the drug molecule structures. Conclusions.

The complexity of an operation room implies to design surgical devices that are as compact as possible {{and that can be}} easily sterilized. One interesting design approach is to combine compliant mechanisms, which have a monolithic structure, and piezoelectric actuators. Based on this approach, a robotic device for minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting has been proposed previously in our laboratory. It is composed of a shaft with two fingers in contact with the heart at one end, and an actuated compensation mechanism at the other end. This device successfully helps {{to increase the}} stabilization of the heart surface during the surgery but its needs to be increased for an optimal integration in the operation room. One possibility is {{to reduce the size of}} the compensation by considering an assembly of planar manufactured structures. This helps to simplify the manufacturing process and may increase the compactness. Parallel architectures constitute interesting solutions for their intrinsic stiffness properties, but in a planar configuration parallel manipulators often exhibit kinematic singularities. Two design approaches for planar parallel compliant mechanisms are presented in this paper. One design approach consists in designing a passive compliant mechanism in a configuration close to the singularity by introducing some asymmetries during the manufacturing process. The second design approach consists in taking advantage of the singularities of parallel manipulators. In fact, in some singular configurations, the end-effector of the manipulator loses stiffness while its <b>actuators</b> are <b>blocked.</b> As compliant mechanisms only work around a given configuration this loss of stiffness is used to produce the required mobilities.

40|$|Unlike {{conventional}} rigid actuators, soft robotic technologies possess inherent compliance, so {{they can}} stretch and twist along every axis {{without the need for}} articulated joints. This compliance is exploited here using dielectric elastomer membranes to develop a novel six degrees of freedom (6 -DOF) polymer actuator that unifies ordinarily separate components into a simple cubic structure. This cube actuator design incorporates elastic dielectric elastomer membranes on four faces which are coupled by a cross-shaped end effector. The inherent elasticity of each membrane greatly reduces kinematic constraint and enables a 6 -DOF actuation output to be produced via the end effector.

40|$|International audienceThe {{capability}} of inchworm motor for long-displacement, heavy-load and precise positioning is greatly conditioned by {{the effectiveness of}} the clamping mechanism. A need exists in the art for clamping mechanism capable of delivering precise and heavy load motion. This paper presents a novel giant magnetostriction material (GMM) application to the development of such mechanism. GMM is advantageous over other smart materials in this particular aspect by its remarkable magnetostriction and especially the huge blocked stress. It can, e. g., display around 4000 N at moderate magnetization with a φ 25 x 100 mm GMM rod. Most desirably, such large force could be used as clamping force in inchworm movement. However, the force can only be generated under blocked state, which is generally hard to reach, especially in a moving regime. Addressing this problem, the research utilizes GMM rod's capacity to both positively stretch and negatively contract under permanent-magnet-biased condition and presents a specially designed clamping mechanism, a permanent-magnet-biased actuator fastened in a rigid guideway. Being applied reverse magnetic field, the formerly stretched actuator may contract to a suitable size to be put into the rigid guideway. Then, removal of the field will theoretically result in the restoration of the actuator. Practically, stretching of the <b>actuator</b> is <b>blocked</b> by the rigid guideway. This forms the so-called Pre-blocked-clamping-on state, where no-power fastening behavior exists. Moreover, the blocked force is adjustable. When being applied the same-direction field as the permanent one, the blocked force becomes greater (Blocked-clamping-on state). When being applied adequate reverse field, the blocked force is diminished with the shrinking of the actuator, till the actuator released from the rails (Blocked-clamping-off state). This process realizes the utilization of blocked force in clamping action, thus provides resolution for secure and heavy load inchworm motion. A clamping mechanism prototype (Sizeφ 32 x 130 mm, with a φ 10 x 100 mm GMM rod) has been realized. The design and working process of the setup is presented. Through experiments, the prototype can be facilely manipulated by square-instant and sinusoid-continuing current and it can agilely perform to meet the proposed blocked force the proposed clamping principle...|$|R

The analysis begins by developing a mechanical understanding of a single cell representation of the mechanism. This cell contains four linkages connected by pin joints, a single actuator, two springs to represent the bi-directional behavior of a flexible skin, and an external load. Equilibrium equations are developed using static analysis and the principle of virtual work equations. An objective function is developed to maximize {{the efficiency of the}} unit/multiple cell model. It is defined as useful work over input work. There are two constraints imposed on this problem. The first is placed on force transferred from the external source to the actuator. It should be less than the <b>blocked</b> <b>actuator</b> force to ensure the mechanism moves in the desired direction. The other is the requirement that the ratio of output displacement over input displacement, i. e., geometrical advantage (GA), of the cell is larger than a prescribed value. Sequential quadratic programming is used to solve the optimization problem. This process suggests a systematic approach to identify an optimum {{location of a}}n actuator and to avoid the selection of location by trial and error.

40|$|Introduction: Water {{shortage}} in arid and semiarid regions is {{the most}} serious factor in limiting agricultural activities as it leads to the rapid reduction of yields from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. Under conditions of water scarcity, leaf temperature rises, which causes plant wilting and premature senescence of leaves and, eventually, severes reduction of dry matter production. Use of high-efficient irrigation practices, improvement of soil's physical properties, and use of soil amendments such as superabsorbent polymers are some ways of compensating for water shortage, especially during the growing season. Some materials such as plant residues, manure, various types of compost, and superabsorbent polymeric hydrogels can store various amounts of water and thus increase water retention and storage capacity of soils. Superabsorbent hydrogels, which are also called superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) or hydrophilic polymeric gels, are hydrogels that can absorb substantial quantities of water. Hydrogels are a class of polymeric materials having network structures (with physical or chemical crosslinks) that are very capable of swelling and absorbing large amounts of water. These materials are formed from water-solublepolymers by crosslinking them either using radiation or a crosslinker. Superabsorbents are widely used in many products such as disposable diapers, feminine napkins, soils for agricultural and horticultural purposes, gel <b>actuators,</b> water <b>blocking</b> tapes, medicine for the drug delivery systems and absorbent pads where water absorbency or water retention is important. Water is a major constraint for crop growth in arid and semi-arid regions, as the precipitation is low and uncertain in these areas. Efficient utilization of meager soil and water resources necessitates the adaptation of appropriate water management techniques. Suitable soil moisture increases the biological activities as result of physical and chemical condition of soil improving the crop production finally. Material and Methods: This experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions in Shushtar city at northern Khuzestan Province using the randomized complete block design using 13 treatments and with 3 replications. Soil samples were taken from a field in the study area, air dried, and passed through a 2 mm sieve. Seven concentration (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25, and 1. 5 percentage) of superabsorbent polymers (Aquasorb and Accepta) were used in greenhouse condition. Superabsorbent and 10 Kg soil thoroughly mixed in each pot. All treatments were irrigated when the plants at control showed sign of wilting. There were three replications of each treatment. NPK fertilizers were applied as urea, diammonium phosphate (DAP) and potassium sulphate (K 2 SO 4) based the soil test. Soil samples were again collected which were analyzed for nitrate-N, total organic carbon (TOC), phosphorus and potassium, bulk density, particle density and saturation percentage. NPK of plant samples were also determined. Data were statistically analysed by Duncan test using SPSS. Results and Discussion: Results had shown that the highest bulk density (1. 515 gr/cm 3) seen in control treatment and with increasing the polymer, bulk density decreased significantly to 0. 91 gr/cm 3 in treatment No. 2. Also the treatments No. 4 and 11 shown decreasing EC significantly from 0. 9 in control treatment to 0. 68 in No. 4. Adding superabsorbent had significant effect on Potassium amount of soil. Using superabsorbent had no significant effect on real density, pH, N amount, Phosphorous, soil organic carbon after yield harvesting in soil and amount of Phosphorous in plant. Significant increasing in number of leaves, branches, fresh weight of plant, and fruit weight with using superabsorbent polymers and the highest used polymer level (treatments No. 7 and 13) had the highest effect on fresh weight of plant which reported 47. 2 g for No. 7 and 90. 47 g for No. 13. Also using 1 percentage of Accepta superabsorbent (No. 12) caused the significant increasing of fruit weight (502. 9 g) instead of control (73. 5 g). Based on the presented results No. 2 and 9 had the most effects on N of plants, which the N amount in control was 1. 31 percentage and in No. 2 and 9 were 2. 88 and 2. 82 measured respectively. Treatments No. 7, 8, 9, and 11 had the most measured plant potassium. Final results had shown the number of bacteria and fungi increased significantly using superabsorbent and the number of bacteria increased to 215 × 104 in No. 13 and the number of fungi to 176500 in each gram of soil. Conclusion: The overall results of this research had shown the promotion of physical, biological, and finally increase the yield as results of using superabsorbent especially Accepta type. Using these superabsorbent polymers in farms need more studies because of more effective climate parameters...|$|R
40|$|In the future, the {{precision}} manipulation of small objects {{will become more}} and more important for appliances such as data storage, micro assembly, sample manipulation in microscopes, cell manipulation, and manipulation of beam paths by micro mirrors. At the same time, there is a drive towards miniaturized systems. Therefore, Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS), a fabrication technique enabling micron sized features, has been researched for precision manipulation. MEMS devices comprise micro sensors, actuators, mechanisms, optics and fluidic systems. They have the ability to integrate several functions in a small package. MEMS can be commercially attractive by providing cost reduction or enabling new functionality with respect to macro systems. Combining design principles, a mature design philosophy for creating precision machines, and MEMS fabrication, a technology for miniaturization, could lead to micro systems with deterministic behavior and accurate positioning capability. However, in MEMS design trade-offs need to be made between fabrication complexity and design principle requirements. Therefore, the goal of this research has been twofold: 1. Design and manufacture a 6 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOFs) MEMS-based manipulator with nanometer resolution positioning. 2. Derive principle solutions for the synthesis of exact kinematic constraint design and MEMS fabrication technology for multi DOFs precision manipulation in the micro domain. The Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) sample manipulator {{has been used as a}} suitable carrier for the project. Design principles which are relevant to MEMS in particular, such as exact kinematic constraint design, and using compliant mechanisms to avoid backlash, play, friction, wear and hysteresis, have been studied. Special attention has been given to leaf-spring stiffness reduction due to large deflections. This was essential because deflections of compliant mechanisms in MEMS are relatively large and often feature leaf-springs as elastic elements. Designs have been presented for improved straight guiding with respect to the traditional folded flexure. This is important for the performance of electrostatic comb-drive actuators. For the 6 DOFs motion of the manipulator, the necessary combination of in- and out-of-plane motion of the wafer in MEMS is rather new. A motion converting mechanism using only one type of actuator has been chosen in favor of a combination of in- and out-of-plane actuators. Six electrostatic comb-drives have been used for actuation. The manipulator is a parallel kinematic mechanism. Based on these system design choices, three concepts have been presented and evaluated. Each concept includes a fabrication process in conjunction with an exact kinematic constraint design. The specifications for a precision manipulator require high frequency vibration modes combined with compliant actuation modes. The compliant actuation modes are necessary to generate sufficient displacement of +/- 10 μm by the low force MEMS actuators. Therefore, the design principles, especially exact kinematic constraint design, have been applied as much as possible. However, trade-offs had to be made between what is required from an exact kinematic constraint design point of view and what is feasible with the available fabrication processes. Therefore, to determine flexure dimensions, the used flexure mechanisms have been modeled taking into account geometric non-linearities. Although the design incorporates relatively long and slender leaf-springs, the first vibration mode frequency is 3. 8 kHz (with <b>blocked</b> <b>actuators).</b> However, the clean room fabrication of the total manipulator required more time than available during the project. Therefore, only several fabrication steps of the manipulator design have been tested. A 3 mask step fabrication process of the clamping mechanism based on the 5 mask step process of the 6 DOFs manipulator served as a test case for the fabrication. A clamping mechanism with a locking device enhances the passive stability of the manipulator by unpowered clamping of the manipulator actuators once the manipulator has reached its targeted position. The cross-talk between the electronbeam of the TEM and electric fields from the actuators of the manipulator is also decreased. Additionally, by using a clamping mechanism, the manipulator can be switched between compliant actuation modes for positioning, and high frequency vibration modes during imaging. The precision MEMS-based clamping mechanism for a relatively large force (0. 5 mN) was developed, fabricated and characterized. The elastic deformation of the clamp flexures was optimized so as not to influence the position of the TEM sample manipulator. The device area of the total mechanism was further optimized by balancing the area necessary for sufficient flexure compliance in the actuation direction and the actuator area necessary for sufficient actuation force and stroke. Measurements showed that the clamping mechanism is able to fix a test actuator, hold it without power, and release it...|$|R

The first part is called “Modeling and Analysis of an Excavator System’ and {{the title of the}} second part is “Modeling and Analysis of Tractor Rear Hitch Controls. ” The topics discussed in this thesis include modeling of an excavator sytem and the modeling of an agricultural tractor’s rear hitch controls. The objectives of this thesis have been to develop a fast simulation model to replicate the functioning of an excavators system and the analysis of a tractor rear hitch controls. Both topics are of substantial importance in today’s industrial research scenario. With a large demand being placed on more intelligent development of construction and agricultural equipment to meet the changing needs of the worlds economy, this thesis offers its contribution in the meeting of these requirements. These two parts of this thesis are based on the following papers published at various conferences and journals. •	Casoli P., Vacca A., Anthony A., Berta G. L.

Of 7 h FPNI-PhD Symposium Modena. FPNI Fluid Power Net Publications, 2012 PART 1 This part describes the results of a study focused on the mathematical modeling of an excavator hydraulic system. From the viewpoint of designing and tuning an efficient control system, an excavator is a very complex nonlinear plant. To design and tune such a complex control system an extremely good nonlinear model of the plant is necessary. The problem of modeling an excavator is considered in this document; a nonlinear mathematical model of an excavator has been developed using the AMESim® modeling environment to replicate actual operating conditions. The excavator model is described by detailed models of the main pump, mobile valve <b>block,</b> <b>actuators</b> and a completely developed kinematic model. The objective of this research is to develop a complete simulation model of an excavator with the capability of reproducing the actual characteristics of the system. This part presents the developed model of a complete excavator system with detailed verification of individual components and preliminary results of a complete excavator system. PART 2 This part of the thesis describes the work carried out towards mathematical modeling and analysis of a tractor rear hitch control valve (HCV). The HCV operates in two modes namely lifting and lowering. The lifting circuit incorporates a pressure compensated flow control valve, while the lowering circuit is gravity assisted. The HCV is a load-sensing system; load-sensing systems and pressure compensated valves are classified as feedback systems. Systems with feedback offer scope for tuning and towards this objective the pressure compensator has been linearised and its characteristics analyzed. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a complete mathematical model of the HCV. This would help to better understand its functionality and to quantify the energy losses across its components...|$|R
