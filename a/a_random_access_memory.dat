Past three decades have seen {{the introduction of the}} technology that has radically changed the way one analyses and controls the world around them. A byproduct of Microprocessor development by Intel is the 8051 Microcontroller which finds its use in almost all walks of life. The Microcontrollers are not as well known to the general public, or even the technical community, as are the more glamorous Microprocessors. The public is however very well aware that “something ” is responsible for all the Smart VCRs, clock radios, washers and dryers, video games, TVs etc. That “something ” is nothing but the Microcontroller. Any Microcontroller consists of three main components viz., an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), <b>a</b> <b>Random</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Memory</b> (RAM) and a Read Only Memory (ROM). An ALU is responsible for Arithmetic and Logic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND, OR, NOT etc operations.

In this paper, we consider processing queries {{within the context}} of a main memory database system and try to enhance the query execution engine of such a system. An execution plan is usually represented as an operator tree. Traditional query execution engines evaluate a query by recursively iterating each operator and returning exactly one tuple result for each iteration. This generates a large number of function calls. In a main-memory database system, the cost of a function call is relatively high. We propose a new evaluation method called power-pipelining. Each operator processes and passes many tuples instead of one tuple each time. We keep the number of matches generated in a join in a local counter array.
