5|$|<b>A</b> <b>snail</b> {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. <b>A</b> <b>snail</b> often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and it may have been <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E

5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, <b>a</b> <b>snail.</b> Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} co-productions of the 1970s, both made in 1979, {{occurred}} in Kuwait and Spain. The Kuwaiti show, Iftah Ya Simsim, which ran until 1990, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Arab world. It used Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and was broadcast in 22 Arab countries. The show continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air. It returned in 2013, and had similar goals and objectives as the original version, including the use of MSA. Barrio Sésamo, made in Spain, featured <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> character who was able to hide a thousand and one things in her shell. One of the show's Muppet characters, Dr. Valentin Ruster, was based upon Dr. Valentin Fuster, a native Spaniard who worked at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Dr. Fuster's likeness was created to educate children in Spain about exercise and eating healthy.|$|E

5|$|While meditating with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum has {{a premonition}} {{involving}} the Lich, an evil undead sorcerer who was long ago {{trapped in a}} block of amber by the legendary hero Billy. Bubblegum tells Finn and Jake about the dream, {{and the three of}} them journey to the tree at the top of Bubblegum's palace where the block of amber is hidden; Bubblegum also places magical jewels on Finn and Jake's heads that will prevent the Lich from exerting mind-control on them. While examining the amber, <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> is placed under the Lich's spell and helps break him out while Finn and Jake are not paying attention. The Lich then blasts out of the kingdom, leaving a wave of destruction in his path.|$|E
5|$|Each page of {{the codex}} has been painted on one side with a {{standing}} figure facing left. Each figure holds a weapon and most grip a rope leading to a restrained captive. Colours used on the codex include hematite red, black, blue-green, a red wash and a brown wash, all upon a strong white background. The left-hand side of each page {{is marked by a}} column of day signs; where this column is complete these total thirteen in all. Each day sign is associated with a bar-and-dot numerical coefficient. Six pages depict a figure bearing weapons and accompanied by a captive (pages 1–4, 6 and 9), two pages (5 and 8) both depict a figure hurling a dart at a temple. Page 7 of the codex shows a passive warrior {{standing in front of a}} tree. Page 11 depicts a death god with a javelin, pointing his weapon at a water vessel containing <b>a</b> <b>snail.</b> Page 10 is a badly damaged fragment with the subject largely obliterated. Based on the surviving portion, Michael Coe thought it depicted a standing figure wearing a waterbird headdress and bearing an atlatl. The figures represented on each page differ from those on the other Maya codices and are far more similar to the Mixtec codices and Toltec art styles of central Mexico. The heads of the death gods painted in the Grolier Codex are almost identical to those represented in the Laud Codex and Fejérváry-Mayer Codex, including the red colouring of the portion of the teeth closest to the gums.|$|E

25|$|Orthalicus reses is {{a species}} within the genus Orthalicus, {{a group of}} large, {{arboreal}} pulmonate snails in the family Orthalicidae. The genus Orthalicus occurs primarily in Central and South America. Two species occur in North America, Orthalicus reses and Orthalicus floridensis Pilsbry, {{both of which are}} restricted to South Florida. The Stock Island tree snail (Orthalicus reses) was first described by Thomas Say in 1830, based on <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> which was probably collected in Key West. That specimen was lost, and the species was later redescribed by Henry Augustus Pilsbry in 1946 using <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> collected from Stock Island.|$|E

25|$|Mudsnails are impressively resilient. <b>A</b> <b>snail</b> {{can live}} for 24 hours without water. They can however survive {{for up to}} 50 days on a damp surface, giving them ample time to be {{transferred}} from one body of water to another on fishing gear. The snails may even survive passing through the digestive systems of fish and birds.|$|E
25|$|Be sure to {{frequently}} {{clean the}} feed and water dishes. The {{amount of feed}} <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> eats depends very much on air humidity and {{on the availability of}} drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container {{to reduce the risk of}} the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{collector}} of a centrifugal compressor {{can take many}} shapes and forms. When the diffuser discharges into a large empty chamber, the collector may be termed a Plenum. When the diffuser discharges into a device that looks somewhat like <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> shell, bull's horn or a French horn, the collector {{is likely to be}} termed a volute or scroll. As the name implies, a collector’s purpose is to gather the flow from the diffuser discharge annulus and deliver this flow to a downstream pipe. Either the collector or the pipe may also contain valves and instrumentation to control the compressor.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the same}} snail {{population}} {{and under the}} same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in {{only a couple of}} generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.|$|E
25|$|Nests may be {{built in}} a wide variety of places – on the ground, in dense {{floating}} vegetation, in bushes, or at any height in trees. They are bulky structures of rushes, sticks or other materials. Nest building is undertaken by the male initially, who will construct the nest in his territory prior to pair-bond formation. Unpaired females will visit a number of territories before settling on a male to breed with. Males may initially challenge and fight off prospective mates, and may not accept first-year females as mates. Pair-bond formation may take a few weeks. Courtship feeding is part of the bonding process, where males catch and process <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> and then feed it to the female.|$|E
25|$|Another alternative, {{suitable}} for solid wall enclosures, is to {{attach to the}} wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When <b>a</b> <b>snail</b> crawls {{on the underside of}} the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.|$|E
