The physical {{and economic conditions}} in Israel at the time, allowed them to complete <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>number</b> of works in a relatively brief period of time, which brought international attention. Their joint works include the Mediterranean Sea Club in Achzib (1960–1961), Dubiner House (1963), the Chaim Laskov Officer Training School (1963–1967) Bahad 1, the main officer training school of the Israel Defense Forces, just later the synagogue (1969–1971) at the same academy, and the Bat Yam city hall (1963–1969). Their designs shared aspects {{in common with the}} metabolist movement, borrowing metaphoric shapes from nature for use in planning morphological structures. The modularity of these works, such as the Dubiner House, provided an architectural precedent for the Habitat 67 project by Moshe Safdie.|$|E

5|$|Silkies lay <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>number</b> of eggs, of a cream color, but {{production}} is often interrupted {{due to their}} extreme tendency to go broody; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production, is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds. In addition to being good mothers, Silkies are universally renowned for their calm, friendly temperament. They do well in confinement, and interact very well with children. This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks.|$|E

30|$|Reproductive {{biology is}} an {{important}} interdisciplinary area of plant sciences, which is essential to understand the evolution and survival of the species, to develop effective conservation strategies for exploitation of the economic potential of the medicinal plant species. In view of the above, reproductive biology and pollination behavior (flowering phenology, pollination types, role of pollinators) of S. asoca was studied under ex situ conditions. Our studies revealed that this species is <b>an</b> out-breeder. <b>Fair</b> <b>number</b> of seeds are produced by this species indicates that the species is capable of sustaining its progenies in the natural populations. However, {{the reason for the}} species to reach ‘vulnerable’ stage may be due to unscientific harvesting of its plant parts and poor seed viability and recalcitrant nature of the seeds (Smitha and Das 2016). The phenological and flowering studies could be helpful in setting up the conservation strategies as well as formulating measures for crop improvement and sustainable cultivation of this vulnerable species.|$|R
40|$|Duplex {{architectures}} naturally provide high safety because {{errors are}} easily detected {{by comparing the}} behavior of the two subsystems of the duplex. But, when an error occurs, it is usually long and difficult to know which subsystem fails; then it is difficult to intend a graceful degradation and to ensure the system availability. The improved duplex architecture proposed uses a powerful online test technique, control flow checking through signature analysis, which allows fast diagnostics and reconfiguration. Signature analysis has been already studied by many authors for CISC processors. The authors extend it to the RISC processors and particularly to the Motorola MC 88100 because this architecture has been designed for the high workload needed by onboard equipment. According to many particular features of the RISC machines (instruction pipelining and delayed branching), this extension is very complex. In order to keep <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> chip <b>number</b> on the computer board, the authors also studied an original implementation of the signature analyzer in the processor instruction cache memory...|$|R
