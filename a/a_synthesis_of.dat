5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. <b>A</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del método, 1974), is <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> several {{historical}} figures from Latin American, most prominently Gerardo Machado, dictator of Cuba. This fictional character, {{in his bid}} to be refined, spends half {{of his life in}} Europe, perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} years of his career, {{dedicated}} almost exclusively to the Sagrada Família, Gaudí reached the culmination of this naturalistic style, creating <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> all of the solutions and styles he had tried until then. Gaudí achieved perfect harmony between structural and ornamental elements, between plastic and aesthetic, between function and form, between container and content, achieving the integration of all arts in one structured, logical work.|$|E
5|$|Each show is <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> circus styles {{from around}} the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ {{continuous}} live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Rothbard {{left the}} Libertarian Party and began {{building}} bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism.

5|$|Durkheim had an {{important}} impact {{on the development of}} Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Levi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish sociology. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> Durkheim's work on religion with Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.|$|E
5|$|Early Medieval architecture's secular {{buildings}} were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority {{and in the}} north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
50|$|In {{his book}} The Electric Furnace, Henri Moissan {{describes}} <b>an</b> early <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> strontium boride by mixing strontium borate, aluminum, and carbon in an electric furnace.

He was becoming repulsed by the existence of Roma slavery in his country, and in his study, cited the example of active abolitionists in Western countries.|$|E
5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> {{old and new}} hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, {{he must have been}} an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Jack Souther {{produced}} <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera and delineated several Neogene to Quaternary volcanic belts throughout British Columbia. One {{of these}} was the linear Anahim Volcanic Belt, which included the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field at its eastern end. However, its origin {{had not yet been}} understood. In 1979, two volcano tectonic models had been proposed by Jack Souther, Mary Bevier and Richard Armstrong. This included a hotspot and a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large-scale plate tectonics of western North America.|$|E
40|$|Development {{of novel}} {{synthetic}} methodologies and their application to <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> natural products are described. The ˆrst {{topic is about}} {{an extension of the}} scope <b>of</b> our indole <b>synthesis</b> by radical cyclization of o-alkenylphenyl iso-cyanides. By utilizing this methodology and nitrogenzenesulfonamide chemistry, <b>an</b> e‹cient total <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> hexacyclic aspidosperma indole alkaloid, aspidophytine, was accomplished. As the second generation indole synthesis, we then de-veloped the method by radical cyclization of o-akenylthioanilides. Synthetic utility of this method was fully demon-strated by <b>a</b> total <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> iboga alkaloid, catharanthine. Furthermore, <b>a</b> total <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> vinca alkaloid, vinblastine through <b>a</b> practical <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> vindoline was achieved, in which the stereochemistry of the crucial coupling reaction of two indole fragments could be completely controlled. In addition to the indole chemistry, exceptionally mild transfor-mations of thiol esters to ketones and alkenyl ketones have been developed. Examples of application of the protocols for the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> natural products are also described...|$|R

5|$|Justinian saw the orthodoxy of {{his empire}} {{threatened}} by diverging religious currents, especially Monophysitism, which had many adherents {{in the eastern}} provinces of Syria and Egypt. Monophysite doctrine, which maintains that Jesus Christ had one divine nature or <b>a</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> a divine and human nature, had been condemned as a heresy by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of Zeno and Anastasius I had {{been a source of}} tension in the relationship with the bishops of Rome. Justin reversed this trend and confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites. Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them.|$|E
