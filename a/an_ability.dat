5|$|Moult is {{prolonged}} in all tubenoses, since they must maintain <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> to fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage after those further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced moulting in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.|$|E

50|$|Coren defines {{three aspects}} of dog {{intelligence}} in the book: instinctive intelligence, adaptive intelligence, and working and obedience intelligence. Instinctive intelligence refers to <b>a</b> dog's <b>ability</b> to perform the tasks it was bred for, such as herding, pointing, fetching, guarding, or supplying companionship. Adaptive intelligence refers to <b>a</b> dog's <b>ability</b> to solve problems on its own. Working and obedience intelligence refers to <b>a</b> dog's <b>ability</b> to learn from humans.|$|R

5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, and <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas {{where they have been}} introduced accidentally.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{although}} a higher cognitive capacity in some animals may indicate a greater likelihood of them being able to perceive pain, it also gives these animals <b>a</b> greater <b>ability</b> to deal with this, leaving animals with <b>a</b> lower cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>a</b> greater problem in coping with pain.|$|R

Infit and outfit were inspected in this study. Item infit/outfit indicates whether students from <b>a</b> high <b>ability</b> group and <b>a</b> low <b>ability</b> group perform “normally” as predicted. A large infit value for one item implies that <b>a</b> person’s <b>ability</b> close to <b>a</b> particular item difficulty level is not consistent with the model’s prediction. A large outfit value for an easy item indicates that <b>a</b> high <b>ability</b> level student fails to respond to the question correctly, and vice versa.

5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> to use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E
5|$|Dr. George Spomer of the University of Idaho has {{discovered}} protocarnivorous activity and function in several glandular plant species, including Cerastium arvense, Ipomopsis aggregata, Heuchera cylindrica, Mimulus lewisii, Penstemon attenuata, Penstemon diphyllus, Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, Ribes cereum, Rosa nutkana var. hispida, Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana, Solanum tuberosum, Stellaria americana, and Stellaria jamesiana. These species {{tested positive for}} protease activity, though {{it is unclear whether}} the protease is produced by the plant or by surface microbes. Two other species evaluated by Dr. Spomer, Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta, exhibited protease activity and were further examined with 14C-labeled algal protein for nutrient absorption activity. Both of these latter species displayed <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> to digest and absorb the labeled protein.|$|E

5|$|Echolocation {{probably}} first derived in bats from communicative calls. The Eocene bats Icaronycteris and Palaeochiropteryx had cranial adaptations suggesting <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> {{to detect}} ultrasound, implying they used echolocation. This {{may have been}} used at first mainly for communicative purposes or for mapping out their surroundings during their gliding phase, only being used for hunting insects while foraging on the ground or among vegetation. After the adaptation of flight was established, it may have been refined to target flying prey. Bats may have evolved echolocation through a shared common ancestor, in which case it was then lost in the Old World fruit bats, only to be regained in the horseshoe bats; or, echolocation evolved independently in both the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera lineages.|$|E

The protagonist is Obi, grandson of Things Fall Aparts main character, Okonkwo. Drawing on his time in the city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of Nigerian independence. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and larger society. He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture, Achebe demonstrated in his second novel <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> to depict modern Nigerian life.|$|E

When a Guardian Force has learned <b>an</b> <b>ability,</b> that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E
5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E

Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
