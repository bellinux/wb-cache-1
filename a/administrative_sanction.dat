The arrangements of <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> according to Law No. 12 of 2011 are stipulated in appendix II number 64 which stipulates that the substance in the form of <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> or civil sanctions for the violation of these norms are formulated into one part (chapter) with the norms that impose <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> or civil sanctions, and in appendix II number 65 which regulates if {{there is more than one}} norm that provides <b>administrative</b> or civil <b>sanctions,</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> or civil sanctions are formulated in the last chapter of the section. Thus, it does not formulate the provision of sanctions that also contains criminal sanctions, civil penalties and <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> in one chapter. The arrangements of <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> in the Local Regulation of Bali Province No. 2 of 2012 are stipulated in Chapter XIV of Article 33 paragraph (1), (2), and (3), thus it is contrary to the provisions of Appendix II of Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 12 of 2011 numbers 64 and 65...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> in Government Regulation No. 101 of 2014 on the Management of Hazardous and Toxic Waste (B 3) has emerged a polemic {{in the form}} of inconsistency in the sanction enforcement under Act No. 32 of 2009 on the Protection and Management of the Environment (Law PPLH). Under the provisions concerning with the management of B 3 waste as regulated in the Act of PPLH, criminal sanction is enforced as premium-remedium without any first enforcement of <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions.</b> This study observed two issues: first, the urgency and the strategy of sharpening the existence of the <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> in the Regulation No. 101 of 2014 of the Law No. 32 of 2009. Second, it concerns with the effectiveness of the <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> in the management and supervision of B 3 waste. This is a normative juridical law research. The study concluded that: first, although based on the law of PPLH criminal law is enforced in medium premium, but the role and presence of the <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> in the B 3 waste management is necessary especially to develop any preventive measures against environmental pollution caused by the B 3 waste. Second, although the Act of PPLH has applied the criminal sanctions in premium remedium, but the {{implementation of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>sanctions</b> is more effective and provides a protection against the threat of environmental pollution from waste B 3...|$|R
