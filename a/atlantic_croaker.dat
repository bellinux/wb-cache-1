40|$|The {{long-term}} {{impacts on}} marine ecosystems {{of the recent}} dramatic worldwide increase {{in the incidence of}} coastal hypoxia are unknown. Here, we show widespread reproductive disruption in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croakers</b> collected from hypoxic sites approximately 120 km apart in the extensive northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf hypoxic zone. Gonadal growth and gamete production were impaired in croakers from hypoxic sites compared with fish from reference normoxic sites east of the Mississippi River Delta. Male germ cells were detected in approximately 19 per cent of croaker ovaries collected in the hypoxic region, but were absent in ovaries from normoxic sites. In addition, the sex ratio was skewed towards males at the hypoxic sites. The masculinization and other reproductive disruptions were associated with declines in neuroendocrine function, as well as ovarian and brain expression of aromatase (the enzyme that converts androgens to oestrogens). A similar incidence of ovarian masculinization and decline in ovarian aromatase expression were observed in croaker after chronic laboratory hypoxia exposure, indicating that ovarian masculinization is a specific hypoxia response and is due to decreased aromatase activity. The results suggest severe reproductive impairment can occur over large coastal regions in marine fish populations exposed to seasonal hypoxia, with potential long-term impacts on population abundance...|$|R
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

The freshwater diet primarily consists of pike, perch, sunfish, trout, and bass; the saltwater diet primarily consists of rock fish, flounder, sea trout, herring, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker,</b> haddock, and Gulf silverside. When there is either a lack of fish or they are difficult to catch, it preys on crustaceans, crayfish, snails, leeches, insect larvae, molluscs, frogs, annelids, and occasionally aquatic plant matter such as pondweed, roots, moss, willow shoots, seeds, and algae.

5000|$|The name croaker is {{descriptive}} of {{the noise}} the fish makes by vibrating strong muscles against its swim bladder, which acts as a resonating chamber much like a ball. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> is the loudest of the drum family. The fish is {{also referred to as}} a hardhead, with smaller ones called pin heads. During spawning season (August to October), croakers turn a deep golden color, from this comes the name golden croaker. Beginning in August, tiny young enter the Chesapeake Bay and travel to low-salinity and freshwater creeks. They move to deeper parts of tidal rivers for the winter. Juveniles leave the Bay with the adults the following autumn. When full-grown (two to three years), croakers reach between 1-1/2 feet long and 4-5 pounds, but on average are 1/2-2 pounds.

50|$|The Gulf {{contains}} a hypoxic dead zone that runs east-west along the Texas-Louisiana coastline. In July 2008, researchers reported that between 1985 and 2008, the area roughly {{doubled in size}} and now stretches from near Galveston, Texas, to near Venice, Louisiana. It is now about 8000 sq mi, nearly the record.

50|$|To {{produce the}} croaking sound, special muscles vibrate against the swim bladder. These muscles are called sonic muscle fibres, and run {{horizontally}} along the fish's body {{on both sides}} around the swim bladder, connected to a central tendon that surrounds the swim bladder ventrally. These sonic muscle fibres are repeatedly contracted against the swim bladder to produce the croaking sound that gives drum and croaker their common name, effectively using the swim bladder as a resonating chamber. The sciaenids' large swim bladder is more expansive and branched than other species, which aids in the croaking. In some species the sonic muscle fibres are only present in males. These muscles strengthen during the mating season and are allowed to atrophy {{the rest of the}} time, deactivating the croaking mechanism. In other species, most notably the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker,</b> the croaking mechanism is present in both sexes and remains active year-round. These species are thought to use croaking for communication, such as announcing hazards and location when in turbid water.|$|E
50|$|The most {{distinguishing}} {{mark on the}} red drum is one large black spot on {{the upper part of}} the tail base. Having multiple spots is not uncommon for this fish, but having no spots is extremely rare. As the fish with multiple spots grow older, they seem to lose their excess spots. Scientists believe that the black spot near their tail helps fool predators into attacking the red drum's tail instead of its head, allowing the red drum to escape. The red drum uses its senses of sight and touch, and its downturned mouth, to locate forage on the bottom through vacuuming or biting. On the top and middle of the water column, it uses changes in the light that might look like food. In the summer and fall, adult red drum feed on crabs, shrimp, and mullet; in the spring and winter, adults primarily feed on menhaden, mullet, pinfish, sea robin, lizardfish, spot, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker,</b> and mudminnows.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker,</b> northern kingfish, and northern puffer.

The majority of collected <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> are small, young of year (YOY) individuals, which may lead to changes in age and size-class structure within the population. North Carolina and other southeastern states receive economic benefits from the fishing practices of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> and other important Sciaenid fishes. The goal of this research is to determine if <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> populations can be monitored using passive acoustics by ascertaining if sound-production of a population will provide the listener with information such as length, maturity, or sex. An instrumented tripod (ITPod) was deployed to estimate the physical parameters (i. e. currents, water quality, waves, and turbidity) of the water and a passive acoustic recording system recorded environmental sounds (0. 05) for all months except June (ANOVA, p= 0. 01). Next, a comparison was made between the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> the predicted mean length from the passive acoustic recordings, the mean lengths from the trawls, and the mean length predicted from the active acoustic echosounder surveys. There {{was no significant difference between}} the mean <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> total lengths from the trawl and all of the fish in the active acoustics (ANOVA, p> 0. 05), except for June (ANOVA, p= 0. 001). Therefore, I conclude that the passive acoustic estimates of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> lengths (predicted from fundamental frequency) obtained in the laboratory did not correctly predict the observed length-structure of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> population. This result may be due to the cutoff frequencies of the sites; in shallow water, the dominant frequency of an acoustic signal can change as it propagates. If the wavelength of the low-frequency component of a signal exceeds the water depth (the cutoff frequency), than these frequencies are essentially filtered from the recorded sound. Another factor influencing cutoff frequency is that of the resonance of trapped bubbles under the surface of the sediment. These bubbles can cause their own echoes when the sound reverberates off of the surface of the bubble. The bubble reverberations will add higher frequency components to the original sound. Together these phenomena would have increased the dominant frequency at the hydrophone, leading to an underestimate of length-structure for an <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> population (the higher dominant frequencies would predict smaller fish observed). My research shows that <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> length is inversely related to the fundamental frequency of the "croak" call, but the acoustic environment and the effects of the cut-off frequency need to be better understood prior to using this method in the field to estimate <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> lengths.   M.

40|$|The {{most popular}} species pursued by {{near-shore}} anglers fishing {{near the bottom}} within the mid to lower portions of the Chesapeake Bay are <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> and spot. The Chesapeake Bay <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Croaker</b> and Spot Fishery Management Plan (FMP) was adopted in 1991. The FMP’s goal is to: “Protect the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> and spot resource in the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries, and coastal waters, while providing the greatest long term ecological, economic, and social benefits from their usage over time. ” To accomplish this goal, management strategies were developed to prohibit the harvest of small fish of both species, mostly under age 1, and to recommend monitoring and research programs for stock assessments and habitat needs. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) adopted coastal FMPs for each species in 1987. The main purpose of the plans was to decrease the number of small fish caught as bycatch in the coastal shrimp trawl fishery. Bycatch reduction devices were required in the offshore coastal areas and have successfully {{reduced the number of}} small fish caught in the trawl fishery. There are currently no interstate requirements for <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> or spot. Atlantic croaker- Biological reference points (BRPs) were established for croaker in the mid-Atlantic region in 2005. The BRPs were revised in 2011 (Addendum 1) following the 2010 ASMFC stock assessment and now apply to the entire Atlantic coastal stock. The BRPs set targets for fishing mortality and spawning stock biomass and fishing mortality. The BRPs are ratio-based. For the threshold, if F/FMSY= 1, overfishing is occurring. If SSB / (SSBMSY (1 -M))) = 1, the coastal stock is overfished. The 2011 ASMFC Atlantic Stock Assessment Technical Committee evaluated the stock assessment triggers in 2011 and found no evidence to alter management. The ASMFC <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> plan review team accepted the 2011 review of the FMP in August, 2012. The 2013 ASMFC Action Plan calls for the development of an addendum to consider alternate croaker trigger mechanisms.

40|$|Using data {{collected}} simultaneously from a trawl and a hydrophone, {{we found that}} temporal and spatial trends in densities of juvenile <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> (Micropogonias undulatus) in the Neuse River estuary in North Carolina can be identified by monitoring their sound production. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MA NCOVA) revealed that catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> had a significant relationship with the dependent variables of sound level and peak frequency of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> calls. Tests of between-subject correspondence failed to detect relationships between CPUE and either of the call parameters, but statistical power was low. Williamson’s index of spatial overlap indicated that call detection rate (expressed by a 0 – 3 calling index) was correlated {{in time and space}} with <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> CPUE. The correspondence between acoustic parameters and trawl catch rates varied by month and by habitat. In general, the calling index had a higher degree of overlap with this species’ density than did the received sound level of their calls. Classification and regression tree analysis identified calling index as the strongest correlate of CPUE. Passive acoustics {{has the potential to be}} an inexpensive means of identifying spatial and temporal trends in abundance for soniferous fish species...|$|E

Adult <b>Atlantic</b> <b>croaker</b> were fed MeHg-contaminated food at three levels: 0, 0. 05, and 0. 1 mg kg− 1 day− 1 for 1 month.

Behavioral performance of exposed and control larvae was measured at four developmental stages: end of yolk absorption (yolk), end of oil absorption (oil), and 4 and 11 days after oil absorption (oil + 4 and oil + 11). Behaviors analyzed included survival skills related to foraging and predator evasion: routine behavior (rate of travel, active swimming speed, net-to-gross displacement ratio, and activity) and startle response to a visual and a vibratory stimulus (responsiveness, reactive dist induced con behavioral e larvae.
