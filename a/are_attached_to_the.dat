50|$|The manuscripts of this Upanishad {{exist in}} two versions. The short version has 23 verses and <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Atharvaveda, while the longer version has 106 verses and <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Samaveda. The text is also called Dhyāna-bindūpanishad.|$|R
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue called septum separates the glands from the kidneys. The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm, and <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the drugs that <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arms don’t {{have to be the}} same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
50|$|Each booster <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{external}} tank at the SRB's aft frame by two lateral {{sway braces}} and a diagonal attachment. The forward {{end of each}} SRB <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> external tank at the forward end of the SRB's forward skirt. On the launch pad, each booster also <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mobile launcher platform at the aft skirt by four frangible nuts that were severed at lift-off.|$|R

5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels {{on through the}} ureters, which are {{consequently}} known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> restraints.|$|E

50|$|Lysine is a base, as are {{arginine}} and histidine. The ε-amino group often {{participates in}} hydrogen bonding {{and as a}} general base in catalysis. The ε-ammonium group (NH3+) <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fifth carbon from <b>the</b> α-carbon, which <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carboxyl (C=OOH) group.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of October 2014, <b>the</b> cockpit <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. The rear {{carry-through}} spar <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fuselage shortly after Thanksgiving 2014. At the beginning of May 2015, <b>the</b> strakes <b>were</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airframe. The last major component, the wings, {{were expected to be}} delivered in late 2015. In January 2016 XCOR's CEO Jay Gibson said [...] "...we anticipate <b>the</b> wings <b>to</b> be there in the very near future..." [...] and the CTO Michael Valant said they were finding that calibrating the flaps was a challenge. In February 2016 the first prototype was described as a [...] "wingless shell." ...|$|R
5|$|Some {{evidence}} of early evolutionary {{history is the}} structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> frontal cuticle to the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved ostium on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.|$|E
5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are tough and protective, lying as a shield {{on top of the}} membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.|$|E
5|$|Two {{antennae}} ("feelers") <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; {{they also}} are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence. In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, {{so it may be}} passed to other ants or their larvae.|$|E

5|$|X-ray diffraction, {{electron}} diffraction, and {{neutron diffraction}} give {{information about the}} structure of matter, crystalline and non-crystalline, at the atomic and molecular level. In addition, they <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> properties of all materials, inorganic, organic or biological. Due to the diffraction importance and variety of application of diffraction by crystals, {{a large number of}} Nobel Prizes were presented to studies involving X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
50|$|By 1790 {{the town}} of Badefols-sur-Dordogne <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canton of Cadouin Belvès which depends on the {{district}} until 1795, the date of abolition of the districts. In 1801, <b>the</b> township <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> district of Bergerac.In 1952, the commune of Badefols-de-Cadouin was renamed Badefols-sur-Dordogne.|$|R

5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with long}} and dense fur. The fur of the upperparts is brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray tips. Miniopterus brachytragos is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are {{partially}} haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is relatively thick, has the sides mostly parallel, and ends in a curved, rounded tip. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side. M.manavi and M.brachytragos also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter. The ears mostly lack hair and {{end in a}} rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is thin for most of its length, ends in an angular tip, and has a flange at the medial side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E
5|$|Peridioles <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{fruit body}} by a funiculus, a complex {{structure}} of hyphae {{that may be}} differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In some species the peridioles may be covered by a tunica, a thin white membrane (particularly evident in C.striatus and C.crassimurus).|$|E
