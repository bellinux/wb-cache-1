There was a high background proliferation of unstimulated leucocytes from infected cattle. This increase in background counts correlated with the parasitaemia in that both features were abolished by treatment with the trypanocidal drug Berenil (4, 4 '-diamidino-diazoaminobenzene-diacetamide acetone).

40|$|Cytotoxic {{effector}} lyrnphocytes (CEL) 1 play a {{major role}} in various forms of tumor immunity, autoimmunity, and allograft rejection and a number of experimental systems have been developed to study lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Thus, lymphocytes from sensitized animals destroy target cells in tissue culture which carry the specific antigens against which the lymphocyte donor was sensitized. Lymphocytes from nonirnrnunized donors may also become cytotoxic to target cells in the presence of phytohernagglutinin (PHA) or antibody (for review see reference 1). While PHA-induced cytotoxicity has been extensively studied, lymphocyte cytotoxicity induced by other mitogens such as concanavalin A (Con A) <b>and</b> pokeweed mitogen (<b>PWM)</b> (2 - 5) has received less attention. In the present studies <b>Con</b> A <b>and</b> <b>PWM</b> were as effective as PHA in inducing the development of CEL in cultures of chicken lymphocytes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a very high}} gain step up DC-DC {{converter}} is proposed. Maximum voltage gain in conventional boost converter like, switched inductor converter, switched capacitor converter, cascaded boost converter etc. are limited due to extreme duty cycle (i. e. duty cycle near to unity). Operation at extreme duty cycle leads to, serious reverse recovery problem at the switches, high conduction losses, high electromagnetic interference etc. Isolated converter such as fly-back converter, push-pull converter, forward converter, bridge converters etc. overcomes the above issues, where basically a transformer or coupled inductor is used to boost the voltage. But, inclusion of transformer or coupled inductor introduces voltage spike at the main switch and power loss due to leakage inductance. Recently, DC micro-grid gets major importance because of the significant increase in DC loads and demand of high quality power. These DC loads require different voltage levels based on their power ratings. Photo voltaic source (PV) {{is one of the}} prime source of energy in DC micro-grid. A very high voltage gain converter is necessary for DC micro-grid because of low PV source voltage. In this regard, here a step up DC-DC converter is proposed, which possess a very high voltage gain characteristic. Along with this, it provides the additional advantage of supplying power to two different loads (i. e. one for high voltage level and another for low voltage level), which makes it more suitable for DC micro-grid application. Steady state <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>PWM</b> control of the proposed converter are described in this paper.

In this study, we attempted to examine the change in cellular immunity after renal transplantation, the serum immunosuppressive factor and the usefullness of mitogenic blastogenesis for immunological monitoring. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated by the Ficoll-Conray gradient from 10 ml of fresh heparinized blood obtained from renal allograft recipients and healthy individuals. Serum was isolated from 10 ml of fresh nonheparinized blood and added in culture after inactivation and sterilization. Pooled AB serum was used for control. Lymphocytes were adjusted to a concentration of 5 x 10 (5) /ml in RPMI, supplemented with 60 μg/ml Kanamycin and 20 % patient's serum or AB serum, and then to 200 μl of this suspension, phytohemaggultinin, pokeweed mitogen and concanavalin A were dispensed. The culture was incubated for 72 hrs in a humidified atomosphere of 5 % C 0 (2) and air, after which 1 μCi tritiated thymidine was added to each well and the incubation continued for 24 hrs. The contents of each well were transfered to glassfiber filters, and the amount of isotope incorporated was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. PHA <b>and</b> <b>PWM</b> blastogenesis of patients treated with hemodialysis were significantly decreased. PHA, <b>PWM</b> <b>and</b> <b>Con</b> A blastogenesis of renal allograft patients were significantly decreased, but turned to recover 1 year after renal transplantation.

40|$|Cultures {{of chicken}} lymphoid tissues were tested for their {{capacity}} to lyse 51 Cr-labeled chicken, burro (BRC), and human red blood cells (HRC) {{in the presence of}} phytomitogens. PHA-stimulated cultures lysed all three types of targets, while <b>PWM</b> <b>and</b> <b>Con</b> A showed a "target cell specificity" for HRC and BRC, respectively. In mixtures of target cells only the appropriate targets were lysed by lymphocytes activated by either <b>Con</b> A or <b>PWM</b> indicating that soluble lymphotoxins do not {{play a major role in}} these reactions. Preincubation experiments suggested that there may be a population of pre-existing aggressor cells which only require linking to the targets by the mitogens for activation of their cytotoxic potential. Strong cytotoxic reactions were found with spleen cells, peripheral blood leucocytes, and bone marrow cells. Thymocytes were less active but could be stimulated for significant cytotoxicity, while bursal cells were generally unreactive. Spleen cells from agammaglobulinemic chickens totally lacking serum immunoglobulins and B cells with surface-bound immunoglobulins were as active as cells from normal chickens. The activity of spleen cells, from which phagocytic cells were removed was also unimpaired. These results indicate that the development of cytotoxic effector lymphocytes in mitogen-treated leucocyte cultures is a property of T lymphocytes. Although bone marrow cells fail to proliferate in response to these phytomitogens, they do have strong cytotoxic reactivity suggesting that different subsets of thymic-derived lymphocytes are responsible for mitogen-induced transformation and mitogen-induced cytotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Three ataxia {{telangiectasia}} (AT) {{patients have}} been characterized immunologically and molecularly. Patient 1 presents two nondescribed splicing mutations which affect exons 15 and 21 of the ATM gene. The maternal defect {{consists of a}} G > A transition in the first nucleotide of the intron 21 donor splicing site which results in a complete deletion of exon 21. The paternal mutation consists of an A > C transversion in the intron 14 acceptor splicing site which produces a partial skipping of exon 15. Two abnormal alternative transcripts were found, respectively, 17 and 41 nucleotides shorter. Patient 2 presents a homozygous genomic deletion of 28 nucleotides in the last exon of the gene. This deletion changes the normal reading frame after residue 3003 of the protein and introduces a premature stop codon at residue 3008 that could originate a truncated ATM protein. Patient 3, a compound heterozygote, presents a defect which consists of a G > A transition in the first nucleotide of intron 62 donor splicing site which results in a complete deletion of exon 62.

40|$|The target antigen of the FN 18 {{monoclonal}} antibody, called RhT 3, {{is probably}} the rhesus monkey homologue of the human CD 3 antigen, expressed on mature T cells. RhT 3 appears to be polymorphic, since FN 18 was not reactive with T cells from all the screened animals. Thus, immunofluorescent staining of peripheral blood lymphocytes with FN 18 antibody revealed either a positive or a negative phenotype for the target antigen. In a rhesus monkey population, nonreactivity for FN 18 was observed in low frequency (2. 7 %). Expression and non-expression of RhT 3 appeared to be constant characteristics. Non-expression {{was not associated with}} any demonstrable immunodeficiency. Further, {{there seemed to be no}} association between the presence of the FN 18 target antigen and sex, age or expression of MHC class I antigens. Family studies indicated that the positive phenotype is expressed in the same fashion by animals presumably heterozygous or homozygous for the positive allele, the negative phenotype being expressed only on cells from animals homozygous for an assumed blank allele. Therefore, the positive phenotype is likely to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode. In the animals with the negative phenotype, normal T-cell numbers were present, as was demonstrated by B- and T-cell specific monoclonal antibodies. Cytoplasmic staining of cytospun lymphocyte preparations with FN 18 revealed that polymorphism was present at the intracellular level. Cell proliferation tests, using <b>PWM</b> <b>and</b> <b>Con</b> A as mitogens, showed the presence of apparently functional RhT 3 cell surface molecules in FN 18 non-reactive animals.

Regulatory cells were stimulated in vitro with concanavalin A (Con A; 5 micrograms/ml) or an extract of adult B. pahangi (20 micrograms/ml) for 72 hr and irradiated (1500 rads) prior to cocultivation with normal cells. Addition of Con A-activated normal spleen cells to normal cells produced moderate suppression of PHA <b>and</b> enhancement of <b>PWM</b> responsiveness. However, <b>Con</b> A-stimulated spleen cells from infected animals consistently suppressed both the PHA <b>and</b> <b>PWM</b> responsiveness of normal cells by 80 - 90 %.

In contrast, spleen cells from animals 3 - 15 weeks after infection and lymph node cells from all time points were capable of suppressing only PWM responses when stimulated by antigen. Normal spleen cells were not induced by B. pahangi antigens to exhibit immunoregulatory activity. The suppression mediated by antigen-induced spleen cells from chronically infected jirds was partially or totally alleviated by removal of non-specific suppressor cells which are plastic adherent and cyclophosphamide-sensitive, or by removal of antigen-specific suppressor cells which bear receptors for histamine. the results suggest the involvement of regulatory cell circuits in experimental filarial infections...|$|R

HISFF is distinct from the known T cell-derived interleukins. HISFF functions in an HLA-unrestricted fashion since it can facilitate the synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulins by allogeneic B cells.
