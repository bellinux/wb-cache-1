40|$|PbTe nanocrystals were {{synthesized}} {{and then}} reacted with a toluene solution containing <b>AuCl(3).</b> Depending on {{the reaction conditions}} and on the starting PbTe nanocrystals morphology, different kinds of nanostructures have been obtained: single defect-free PbTe nanocrystals with and without an external amourphous oxide shell, crystalline-Au core/amorphous Pb(x) Te(y) Au, shell structure, large balloon-shaped (or mushroom-shaped) Au domain attached via its apex {{to the surface of}} the nanocrystals. Structure and composition of these different types of nanostructure have been studied by means of C(s) -corrected High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) together with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometry (EDX), respectively.

40|$|Colloidal PbTe nanocrystals are {{reacted with}} <b>AuCl(3)</b> in the {{presence}} of dodecylamine and tetraoctylammonium bromide in a toluene solution. At room temperature, only homogenous nucleation of isolated Au nanocrystals in solution is observed. At higher temperatures (i. e. 60 degrees C or higher) the gold ions/atoms are able to diffuse through the PbTe nanocrystals and to form one or more metallic gold regions inside them, while most of the remaining volume of each nanocrystal becomes amorphous. Longer reaction times lead to the growth of a single balloon-shaped Au domain attached via its apex to the surface of each nanocrystal. The structural and compositional quantification of the starting PbTe nanocrystals and of the various reaction products is often complicated by several reactive processes occurring during in situ analysis by electron microscopy.

This novel stain combines the nonspecific acetylcholinesterase(NsAchE) and gold chloride(AuCl) procedures to enhance staining contrast and facilitate computerised detection of corneal nerves. Fresh rat corneas were dissected, and the Descemet's membrane-endothelium complex was removed. Then the corneas were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde with 50 m 					m Na-K phosphate buffer (pH 7. 2) and 8 % sucrose for 30 min. They were rinsed and stained singly with NsAchE or AuCl, or were double stained using NsAchE followed by AuCl. Between NsAchE and AuCl staining the corneas were stored frozen in OCT compound at − 70 °C. Flat mounts of whole corneas were photographed {{before and after the}} second staining. Measurable stromal innervation density (mean± 					S. D.) in age-matched corneas stained with <b>AuCl(3.</b> 90 ± 0. 36 mm/mm 2) was not significantly different from that of NsAchE stained corneas. However, double staining compared with NsAchE staining of the same corneas revealed a 48 ± 27 % increase in demonstrable innervation density of the subepithelial nerve plexus (7. 95 ± 0. 86 mm/mm 2 vs 5. 52 ± 1. 31 mm/mm 2, respectively). Improved visualisation of epithelial nerves and their fine ramifications (leashes) was also obtained by double staining. This novel combination of 2 procedures enhances the detection of corneal nerves for analysis by computerised morphometry and provides a more representative estimate of total corneal innervation density...|$|E
