50|$|Over {{the last}} few years, Rexel has {{developed}} low-energy solutions (lighting and high-performance motors), as well as products using renewable energies, solar and wind power, geothermal and <b>aerothermal</b> <b>energy</b> (heat pumps, solar water heaters and climate control solutions).|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is aimed}} at {{assessing}} the energy performances of a multi-functional integrated system designed to cover the HVAC needs using renewable energy sources (RES), with a specific focus on residential buildings. In detail, within the system design, RES are represented by building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and <b>aerothermal</b> <b>energy.</b> The heating, cooling and DHW demand is in fact satisfied by a reversible and high efficiency air-water heat pump with continuous power modulation, optimized for the specific purpose, directly fed in direct current (DC) from the PV. The eventual surplus of PV production {{can be stored in}} form of thermal energy thanks to a dedicated storage system for providing heating, cooling or DHW production in the periods when there is no/low solar radiation. Moreover, the system is able to minimize the peak power demand of electricity, according to the match between PV electricity generation and usable/storable thermal energy demand. The results of the energy simulations on a case study residential building demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system towards nZEB standards...|$|E
