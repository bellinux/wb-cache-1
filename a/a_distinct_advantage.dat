5|$|On January 21, 1757, Captain Robert Rogers and {{a band of}} his rangers were on a {{scouting}} expedition near Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain {{when they}} were ambushed by a mixed troop of French regulars, Canadien militiamen, and Indians. The fighting ended when darkness set in, with significant casualties on both sides. The French in their reports claimed the British had <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> due to their snowshoes.|$|E
5|$|In 1228 John Malemort, William the Smith and William the Fletcher {{arrived at}} the castle and began {{production}} operations at a forge built within the bailey. A production level of 120,000 quarrels in a 120-day period was achieved by 1233, with men like Malemort being able to produce up to 100quarrels a day. Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities. Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford. The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> over potential baronial enemies, with the supply of arms from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh {{being one of the}} levers of royal power during the period.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E

5|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the Quasi-War, the 1,265-ton Constellation carried 38 cannon despite officially being {{classified}} by the United States Navy as a 36-gun frigate. Previously her armament had consisted of 24-pounder guns, but these had proven inefficient during Truxton's action with L'Insurgente and as a result were removed and replaced with twenty-eight 18-pounder cannon and ten 24-pounder carronades. Truxton and his crew were hardened veterans and were well prepared for a fight. Their French counterparts were not as ready for an engagement. Pitot's frigate was carrying a large quantity of specie as well as 36 American prisoners of war and 80 passengers, two of whom were generals. Under such circumstances Pitot intended to avoid an engagement if possible, even though La Vengeance was a more heavily armed vessel carrying eight 42-pounder carronades, twenty-eight 18-pounders, and sixteen 12-pounder cannon. The French also had <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> {{in the event of a}} boarding action, as Constellation had only 310 men to La Vengeance's complement of 380 crew.|$|E

25|$|In some East Asian countries, such as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, {{subtitling}} {{is common}} in all taped television programs. In these countries, written text remains mostly uniform while regional dialects in the spoken form can be mutually unintelligible.

25|$|Traditionally a sea battle {{would be}} {{fought with the}} two {{opposing}} fleets drawing themselves up to form two lines of battle. This tactic did not favour what was {{perceived to be the}} faster, more accurate gunnery of the Royal Navy and would often bring about indecisive results, usually with the enemy escaping. Nelson's idea was to quickly bring about a melee in which, due to superior gunnery, the British would have <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anarcho-capitalists {{argue that}} {{competing}} defense providers would concentrate on comparatively lower-cost defense and security technology rather than relatively costly offensive weaponry, {{in order to}} maintain lower premiums and service charges. A company's offensive capabilities would also be readily exposed by such an aggressor's competitors. State-subsidized militaries, in contrast, are granted <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> offensive <b>advantage,</b> resulting in a proportionately greater tendency toward monopolization.|$|R

25|$|Europe's {{access to}} a larger {{quantity}} of raw materials and a larger market to sell its manufactured goods gave it <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> through the 19th century. In order to further industrialize, it was imperative for the developing core areas to acquire resources from less densely populated areas, since they lacked the lands required to supply these resources themselves. Europe was able to trade manufactured goods to their colonies, including the Americas, for raw materials. The same sort of trading could be seen throughout regions in China and Asia, but colonization brought <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> to the West. As these sources of raw materials began to proto-industrialize, they would turn to import substitution, depriving the hegemonic nations of a market for their manufactured goods. Since European nations had control over their colonies, {{they were able to}} prevent this from happening. Britain was able to use import substitution to its benefit when dealing with textiles from India. Through industrialization, Britain was able to increase cotton productivity enough to make it lucrative for domestic production, and overtake India as the world's leading cotton supplier. Although Britain had limited cotton imports to protect its own industries, they allowed cheap British products into colonial India from the early 19th century. The colonial administration failed to promote Indian industry, preferring to export raw materials.|$|E
25|$|Because of its low {{molecular}} weight, helium enters and leaves tissues {{more rapidly than}} nitrogen as the pressure is increased or reduced (this is called on-gassing and off-gassing). Because of its lower solubility, helium does not load tissues as heavily as nitrogen, {{but at the same}} time the tissues can not support as high an amount of helium when super-saturated. In effect, helium is a faster gas to saturate and desaturate, which is <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> in saturation diving, but less so in bounce diving, where the increased rate of off-gassing is largely counterbalanced by the equivalently increased rate of on-gassing.|$|E

Fisichella finished 3rd, while Alonso finished 5th.|$|R
25|$|Though {{the colonial}} {{boundaries}} sometimes caused internal strife and hardship, some present day leaders {{benefit from the}} desirable borders their former colonial overlords drew. For example, Nigeria's inheritance of an outlet to the sea — and the trading opportunities a port affords — gives the nation <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> economic <b>advantage</b> over its neighbor, Niger. Effectively, the early carving of colonial space turned naturally occurring factor endowments into state controlled assets.|$|R
50|$|ZEEP {{was one of}} the world's first {{heavy water}} reactors, and it was also {{designed}} to use natural (unenriched) uranium; a feature carried through to the CANDU design. Uranium enrichment is a complex and expensive process; thus, the ability to use unenriched uranium gave ZEEP and its descendants <b>a</b> number of <b>distinct</b> <b>advantages.</b>|$|R
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1928 that Geiger and Walther Müller (a PhD student of Geiger) {{developed}} the sealed Geiger-Müller tube which developed the basic ionization principles previously used experimentally. This was relatively small and rugged, and could not only detect alpha and beta radiation such as prior models but also gamma radiation. Now a practical radiation instrument could be produced relatively cheaply, and so the Geiger-Muller counter was born. As the tube output required little electronic processing, <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> in the thermionic valve era due to minimal valve count and low power consumption, the instrument achieved great popularity as a portable radiation detector.|$|E
25|$|The Georgia Tech and Georgia {{basketball}} rivalry {{can be just}} as heated as its football counterpart. The {{two teams}} have played 187 times with Georgia Tech leading the series with 101 wins over Georgia's 86 wins. The first game between the two basketball teams was on March 10, 1906. Georgia Tech won the game 27–13 in Athens. The longest winning streak by UGA was 7 games, which occurred twice from 1909–1921 and from 1980–1984. Georgia Tech accumulated a 10-game winning streak, its longest over UGA, from 1958–1961. Like most series, there is <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> to being the home team. The home record since 1906 is 111–53 (67.7%) while 23 games in the series have been played on neutral courts.|$|E
25|$|An {{integrated}} aquaculture system {{consists of}} a number of species at different trophic levels of the food chain. Thus waste generating (fed organisms) such as fish and shrimp are coupled with extractive organisms such as abalone, sponges or sea urchins, as a mechanism of removing excess nutrient matter from the water column. Sea sponges have <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> as an extractive organism in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system, as they have the potential of acting as a bioremediator to remove both pathogenic bacteria and organic matter. The sponge Hymeniacidon perlevis has exhibited an excellent ability to remove total organic carbon (TOC) from seawater under integrated aquaculture conditions, and could be a potentially useful bioremediation tool for aquaculture systems in regions where water pollution is high. Furthermore, the organic enrichment originating from fish farmed in the vicinity may stimulate sponge growth, resulting in more efficient sea sponge aquaculture.|$|E
25|$|Cuba's tourism {{policies}} of the early 1990s, which were driven by the government's pressing need to earn hard currency, had {{a major impact on}} the underlying egalitarianism espoused by the Cuban revolution. Two parallel economies and societies quickly emerged, divided by their access to the newly legalized U.S. dollar. Those having access to dollars through contact with the lucrative tourist industry suddenly found themselves at <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> financial <b>advantage</b> over professional, industrial and agricultural workers.|$|R
25|$|As the {{popularity}} of Bordeaux wine increased, the vineyards expanded to accommodate the demands from abroad. Henry and Aliénor youngest son, John {{was in favor of}} promoting the wine industry, and to increase it further, abolished the Grande Coutume export tax to England from the Aquitaine region. In the 13th and 14th century, a code of business practices called the police des vins emerged to give Bordeaux wine <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> trade <b>advantage</b> over its neighboring regions.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of ZnO/ 64 °-YX LiNbO 3 and ZnO/ 36 °-YX LiTaO 3 layered SAW structures was compared {{in terms of}} mass sensitivity and acoustic wave velocity. It {{was found that the}} ZnO/ 64 ° LiNbO 3 structure has <b>a</b> few <b>distinct</b> <b>advantages</b> over ZnO/ 36 ° LiTaO 3. For ZnO/ 64 ° LiNbO 3, the mass sensitivity is similar to 2. 5 times larger. Additionally, the optimum thickness of the ZnO guiding layer is approximately half that of the ZnO/ 36 ° LiTaO 3 structure, which reduces the cost of fabrication...|$|R
25|$|During the pre-war era, flying boats {{had been}} {{preferred}} for conducting long distance flights as, unlike their land-based counterparts, {{they were not}} limited by available runway length – the majority of which were still grass-surfaced at this point – and as a long range aeroplane {{would be required to}} carry a large load of fuel, a larger size of the aircraft could be permitted without needing to cater for factors such as limited runway and airfield sizes. In addition, for services to far-flung parts of the British Empire, the ability to land and take-off from any available area of water was <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>advantage</b> for services to such places, many of which at the time had no airport facilities at all. With the end of the Second World War, flying boats services were resumed with other types being operated, such as the Short Hythe, Short Sandringham, and Short Solent. However, the war had also produced a legacy of large runways and sizable airports formerly used for military purposes that could now meet the needs of a larger generation of land aircraft.|$|E
