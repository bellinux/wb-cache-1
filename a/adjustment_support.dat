50|$|Regent Park was {{designed}} as a transitional community. It was to house people experiencing financial difficulties, or socioeconomic <b>adjustment</b> <b>support.</b> Most residents were on social assistance, and working residents paid rent proportional to their income (average total income of individuals in 2010 was $38,714). In the last two decades Regent Park has also become an immigrant community, as immigrants facing difficulties settling in Canada end up living there. Thus, the community is always viewed and administrated as a transitional community. This contributed to the concentration of a socially marginalized population, and various social ills of Regent Park. In particular, a transitional community failed to generate the awareness, interest, and commitment of its residents to invest in the development and sustainability of a higher quality of life.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} explores the sociocultural adjustment of international {{students and the}} role played by university structures in the process. The adjustment process of international students has been modelled in psychological literature as a U-curve, a learning curve and most recently as a long, uneven and unending process of change. Yet, little of the literature has addressed the role played in this process by university structures. The research was conducted in the UK with 58 undergraduates from Malaysia. It utilized a qualitative design and consisted of two waves of semi-structured small-group interviews. It was found that university structures, in the form of accommodation provision, course provision, and student union clubs and societies, provide opportunities for integration and <b>adjustment</b> <b>support</b> {{in the early stages of}} the sojourn. However, the desire for contact with a wide range of others, central to the adjustment process, takes time to develop in international students.

A total of 34 participants were interviewed at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ambulatory Heart Failure Clinic. Participants completed three questionnaires, which included a demographic questionnaire, a social support questionnaire (PRQ- 85 /Part Two), and the Meaning of Illness Questionnaire (MOIQ). Results indicated that subjects perceived their social support to be high. Perceived social support was seen to account for 24 % {{of the variance in}} MOIQ Factor 3 (degree of stress, change in commitments, and secondary coping resources to deal with it), and 11 % of the variance in MOIQ Factor 2 (type of stress, negative attitude of harm, loss or threat, and viewing the illness as disabling, disfiguring and deteriorating). Content analysis revealed six major themes which described the subjects' feelings about how heart failure had affected their lives.

40|$|From {{a single}} view that {{contains}} a three dimensional scene is possible to obtain substantial information about the object and even its partial reconstruction. This analysis can provide, {{in the case of}} Photogrammetry, measures of the original object, {{and in the case of}} Computer Vision, useful information to 3 D reconstruction. Nevertheless, to carry out this analysis, a critical part of the process is to identify with a high degree of quality, the structural elements of an oblique image, mainly vanishing lines and points. The presence of mini-segments due to the automatism, and the own weakness of the scene’s geometry, provide unfavorable intersection cases. Taking into account the qualitative and quantitative gap of complexity associated to real images corresponding to architectural buildings, this paper aims to present a new method for vanishing points detection that takes a scientific approach combining several proven techniques and which applies three different steps: 1. A Clustering step, in order to cluster the mini-segments in vanishing lines. 2.

Chose the Beidaihe district in Hebei Province as the study region, the eco-system service functions were evaluated by ecological economics approach. The results showed that the indirect value was 1. 09 times of the value direct in 2014. The farmland ecosystem not only had direct production function, but also had important ecological supporting functions. In the process of agricultural structure adjustment, the indirect functions should be given enough attention. The sort of values were production function > tourism function > carbon sequestration and oxygen release function > dispose of waste function > water conservation function > social security function > soil protection value > straw returning to field function > clean air function. In the process of accelerating the construction of modern agricultural park, vigorously developing ecological leisure agriculture, pushing forward the comprehensive utilization of crop straw, and actively developing ecological cycle of agriculture, the Beidaihe district should rationally adjust the use of farmland and focus on improving the values of indirect services to optimize service values.

40|$|Begins by {{considering}} {{trends in the}} incidence of rural poverty in China, comparing China and India. Although the incidence of rural poverty in China declined generally, such poverty is still a matter for concern, especially now that China has joined the WTO. There is concern about the possible impact of China’s WTO entry on its rural poverty and its ability to adopt policies to address it. Recent international studies of such poverty in China by bodies such as the World Bank, OECD, ADB and IFPRI are outlined and reviewed critically with these economic issues in mind. The most recent study by Anderson and others suggests that China’s agriculture will be forced to undertake more structural adjustment than forecast in earlier studies. The Chinese policies to deal with rural poverty will need to give increasing attention to structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>support</b> and migration from rural areas in the future. The WTO does not count such measures as a form of economic protection. In fact, a large number of measures to provide financial support to farmers, including support to poor farmers, are WTO exempt. As discussed these include ‘green box’ measure, certain development measures in developing countries, and ‘blue box’ measures. In addition, under the de minimis principle, China can provide economic protection on average of 8. 5 per cent of the value of an agricultural product. agriculture, China, economic, reform, rural poverty, WTO, Agricultural Finance, Food Security and Poverty, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

By estimating univariate and multivariate GARCH models, as well as applying an MTAR threshold cointegration approach, the study finds similar patterns across the aforementioned markets.

Finally, the cointegration analysis detects some signs of asymmetric <b>adjustments,</b> <b>supporting</b> the hypothesis of a faster adjustment above the threshold in most cases...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to explore how {{adolescents}} with a parent with multiple sclerosis (MS) adjust to their parents' illness. Design: we used an inductive qualitative approach with open ended questions as this was appropriate to facilitate the development of a broad and child-centred understanding of how adolescents adjust and which resources they use to cope with the challenges that are associated with parental MS. Methods: fifteen semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: adolescents described both positive and negative experiences related to having a parent with MS. Benefits to having a parent with MS included reports of feeling more empathetic to others and more grown-up. Negative impacts included family tension, less time to spend with friends, and worries about the future. The support from the well parent, siblings, and friends were found to facilitate adolescents' adjustment. Adolescents assuming a parenting role and illness characteristics, such as illness deterioration, relapses and fatigue, challenged adolescents' adjustment to having a parent with MS. Conclusions: some adolescents described adjusting well to having a parent with MS, while others appeared to have more difficulty. Whilst the severity of the parent's deterioration and symptoms appeared to play a role in adjustment, other potentially modifiable factors such as the lack of well parent's support, adolescents' increased parenting responsibilities, and family tension also posed barriers to adolescents' <b>adjustment.</b> <b>Support</b> interventions may be helpful for vulnerable adolescents, which consider both family and individual factor...|$|E
