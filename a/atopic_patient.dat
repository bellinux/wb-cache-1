IL- 12 acts through interaction with its receptor, especially 2 subunit. In several studies, the low production of IFN- in peripheral mononuclear cells of <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> on response to IL- 12 stimulation has been reported. Therefore we investigated the IL- 12 receptor 2 (IL- 12 R 2) mRNA expression and RNA editing, nucleotide 2451 C-to-U conversion, {{to find the}} cause of low responsiveness to IL- 12 in atopy. Quantitative real time PCR for mRNA expression and sequence analysis for RNA editing were performed in 80 <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> and 54 healthy controls.

In sequence analysis, RNA editing on nucleotide 2451 was not found from either <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> or healthy controls. In additional evaluation, there was no relationship between expression of IL- 12 R 2 mRNA and serum total IgE or blood eosinophil count.

IFN-γ was detected in the culture supernatants of all of 36 PPD-specific TCL established from healthy controls, whereas only 24 of 38 PPD-specific TCL from patients produced IFN-γ. Furthermore, the amounts of IFN-γ produced by PPD-specific TCL from patients were significantly lower than those from healthy controls.

40|$|Allergic fungal {{sinusitis}} is a benign noninvasive sinus disease {{related to a}} hypersensitivity reaction to fungal antigens. A wide variety of fungal agents has been implicated, with the vast majority belonging to the Dematiaceae family. Allergic {{fungal sinusitis}} should be suspected in any <b>atopic</b> <b>patient</b> with refractory nasal polyps. Sinus computed tomograms and magnetic resonance imaging findings can be quite distinctive, but not diagnostic. Diagnosis requires histopathologic examination, which shows characteristic allergic mucin. Hyphae can be demonstrated on special fungal stains or confirmed by a positive fungal culture. At surgery, the diagnosis should be considered if thick, tenacious allergic mucin is encountered in the <b>atopic</b> <b>patient</b> with nasal polyps. Fungal cultures should then be obtained, and the pathologist alerted to the possible diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitus. Current recommendations for therapy include conservative but complete exenteration of all allergic mucin. This can often be accomplished endoscopically. Adjunctive short-term systemic steroids are often helpful, and nasal steroid sprays should be continued long term. The length and dose of steroid therapy is controversial. Persistence of allergic fungal sinusitis with recurrence of sinonasal symptoms is common, particularly when there has been incomplete eradication of allergic fungal mucin. Even when the patient is clinically disease free, recurrence can occur, presumably from reexposure to fungal antigens. Therefore close clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic fol-low-up is important.

The use of specific histamine receptor antagonists reveals that this inhibition is mediated via the H 2 receptor and induction of intracellular cAMP. The inhibition of IL- 12 production is independent of IL- 10 and IFN-gamma.

In the primary response, titres of IgG 1, 2 and 3 antibodies were lower in the <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> than in the controls. In contrast, titres of IgG 4 were much higher for the patient group. In both patients and controls, the kinetics of IgG 4 antibody production following the initial immunization with KLH showed a slow rise reaching a peak at 30 weeks.

CD 138 + cells were mainly CD 45 +, CD 44 ++, CD 19 dim, CD 38 ++, CD 27 ++, CD 86 +, HLA-DR+/++, CD 71 dim, VLA- 4 +, VLA- 5 −, CD 28 −, CD 25 −, CD 69 −, CLA−, CD 20 −, CD 21 − and CD 22 −. They show weak expression of surface Ig but high levels of intracellular Ig and they secrete Ig in culture. Thus CD 138 + cells from peripheral blood show characteristics of early plasma cells. IgE+ CD 138 + plasma cells could be detected in 19 of 24 normal donors with an average frequency of 0 · 06 % IgE+ cells among CD 138 + cells.

In addition, we performed an exercise test on a bicycle ergometer (15 min at 150 W) and an oral challenge test with foods, using a double-blind and placebo-controlled study. Only oral challenge with a teaspoon of flaxseed with additional exercise on the bicycle ergometer elicited itching, urticaria, nausea, coughing and dyspnea.

40|$|In recent years, Extramucosal Fungal Sinusitis (EFS) in immunocompetent hosts have aroused {{increasing}} interest from both clinicians and pathologists. Histopathologically, they {{are characterized by}} the presence of fungal hyphae in the lumen of the sinus with no tissue invasion. They include two different entities: the mycetoma and the atopical fungal sinusitis (AFS). The mycetoma is the most frequent and best recognized form of EFS. The clinical picture is that of a unilateral symptomatic chronic sinusitis, often painful, unresponsive to appropriate medical treatment. CT scanning is very evocative in most cases. Definitive diagnosis requires histological and bacteriological examinations of the sinus contents. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Additional antifungal therapy is not indicated unless there is fungal tissue invasion. AFS is a distinct form of EFS. It typically occurs in an <b>atopic</b> <b>patient</b> with a long story of either chronic sinusitis or recalcitrant nasal polyposis recurring after adequate medical treatment or previous sinus surgery.

40|$|For allergists, itch is {{the most}} {{important}} symptom of atopic dermatitis (AD), and at the same time, the most difficult-to-manage com-plaint of <b>atopic</b> <b>patient.</b> Rather than just one symptom of AD, itch has more profound clinical significance in the following sense: itch, as a key component of so-called ‘itch-scratch ’ vicious-cycle, plays {{a central role in the}} development and persistence of AD, thus, treating itch is not just alleviating one symptom of AD, but stopping genesis and progress of AD. In other words, itch is AD in itself. Pathomechanism underlying development of itch in AD could be summarized as follows: First, exogenous triggering factors pene-trate impaired barrier, leading to allergic skin inflammation. Resulting characteristic itch of AD is amplified through the ‘itch → scratch → inflammation → (again) → itch → … ’ vicious-cycle. Thus, pathomechanism-based management strategy could be pro-vided accordingly–avoidance of triggering factor, repair of impaired barrier, control of skin inflammation, and decreasing desire for itch/scratch. Among them, controlling inflammation is thought to be most effective measure based on the clinical experiences, for skin inflammation, as one of key components in ‘itch-scratch-inflammation ’ vicious-cycle, at the same time, is a crucial connecting link between OUTSIDE and INSIDE.

40|$|Atopy is a {{predisposition}} to hyperproduction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) against common environmental allergens. Sensitization to various airborne and food allergens contributes to {{different types of}} atopic diseases, including asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis. The development of these diseases is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Several loci and genes that control IgE level have been described in different chromosomal regions. Some {{of them have been}} detected in several populations, others only in one or a few populations. These differences might be caused by variations of genetic composition between populations, different lifestyles and/or by environmental variations in major allergens triggering development of atopic diseases. Thus, the environmental conditions may likely determine, which from the potential atopy-controlling genes will operate in a certain population. As the first step in study of such gene-environment interactions we analyzed the specificity and intensity of sensitization to 40 different allergens in <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> from the Czech Republic and Ukraine, representing two genetically not very distant populations, which live in different environmental conditions. The <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> from both countries displayed a higher reactivity to inhalant than to food allergens. We found highly significant differences in sensitization to airborne allergens between patients from the two countries. The most pronounced allergens for the <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> from Ukraine were allergens from dust mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (38. 5 %), Dermatophagoides farinae (48. 1 %) and cat (44. 2 %). In the <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> from the Czech Republic the level of sensitization to these allergens was similar, but the level of sensitization to outdoor allergens, grasses and trees was dramatically higher. More than 68 % of the patients from the Czech Republic in comparison with less than 25 % of the patients from Ukraine have been sensitized to cocksfoot, sweet vernal grass, timothy grass and cultivated rye (Bonferroni-corrected P values ranged from 0. 0007 to 0. 000000003). More than 50 % and 60 % of the patients from the Czech Republic but only 2 % and 19. 2 % of the patients from Ukraine reacted to alder (corrected P < 0. 00009) and birch (corrected P < 0. 002), respectively. The higher sensitization to plant allergens of the patients from the Czech Republic was present in those with asthma and rhinitis, but not with dermatitis. The higher sensitization levels to outdoor allergens in the Czech Republic suggest an influence of westernization on development of allergic reactivity. Genetic analysis of <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> from these two countries will establish which geneloci control development of atopy under different environmental conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) from certain atopic patients can sensitize basophils to release histamine in response to IgE-dependent histamine-releasing factors (HRFs). It has also been shown that patients suffering from severe forms of atopy may contain IgE autoantibodies. It was investigated whether HRF-responsive sera contained IgE autoantibodies and if there was an association between IgE autoreactivity and IgE-dependent responsiveness to HRF. The presence of HRF-responsive IgE (IgE(+)) in serum of patients with respiratory atopy was determined by stimulating stripped human basophils sensitized by serum with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) -derived HRF, and measuring the release of histamine. In parallel, these sera were screened for the presence of IgE autoantibodies to nitrocellulose-blotted human cellular extracts. The capacity of IgE autoantigen-containing preparations to induce histamine release was tested in the stripped basophil assay. Eleven out of 52 sera contained IgE autoantibodies to blotted cellular extracts of human PBMCs or of the human epithelial cell line A 431. No significant association was found between IgE autoreactivity and IgE-dependent responsiveness to HRF: 7 / 26 IgE(+) sera contained IgE to human cellular extracts, and 4 / 26 of the sera without IgE(+) did also. IgE autoantigen-containing extracts did not induce histamine release of appropriately sensitized basophils. By size-exclusion chromatography it was shown that a 32 000 MW autoantigen eluted in the > 55 000 MW fraction, which indicates that this protein forms polymers or complexes with other macromolecules. This might explain the discrepancy between binding and histamine-releasing activity. A 20 000 MW IgE-defined autoantigen cross-reacted with a shrimp allergen. Our results indicate that IgE-reactivity to immunoblotted human protein and IgE-dependent HRF activity are distinct entities that may co-occur in <b>atopic</b> <b>patient...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{indicated}} {{the significance of}} IL- 4 - and IL- 5 -secreting allergen-specific human Th 2 lymphocytes in the control of immune responses to allergens in atopic individuals. The precise allergenic epitopes that activate these allergen-specific Th 2 cells are, however, hardly known. We analyzed the epitope-specificity of T lymphocytes specific for Der p II, {{one of the major}} allergens of house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Using a panel of overlapping synthetic peptides that span the entire Der p II molecule, we could demonstrate that polyclonal Der p II-specific T cell lines prepared from the peripheral blood of five atopic patients can react with at least 10 different epitopes of the molecule. Each donor showed a different pattern of reactivity with the synthetic peptides, suggesting that Der p II contains multiple T cell epitopes that may differ from individual to individual. We studied the specificity of the T cell response to Der p II in more detail in one <b>atopic</b> <b>patient</b> using a short term polyclonal T cell line that strongly reacted to one single peptide (116 - 129) of the allergen. From this patient we established a panel of 11 Der p II-specific TLC. Ten TLC were of the CD 3 + CD 4 + phenotype and showed a high IL- 4 /IFN-gamma production ratio, whereas another TLC expressed CD 3 and CD 8 and failed to secrete substantial IL- 4 and IFN-gamma. The use of at least four different TCR V beta gene segments was shown within this panel TLC. All TLC tested recognized the allergen in an HLA-DR 1 -restricted manner. Although this patient reacted to only one peptide on the polyclonal level, two T cell epitopes were identified on the clonal level by using synthetic peptides and autologous APC to stimulate the TLC. Combining data of CD 4 /CD 8 expression, TCR V beta usage, and epitope specificity, at least six different types of Der p II-specific TLC could be identified within this patient. Binding of IgE to all synthetic peptides of Der p II is low and of low affinity, which may be of particular importance with respect to possible desensitization protocols using such peptide...|$|E
40|$|With {{the fast}} growth of seafood trading worldwide, the {{potential}} health risks of eating contaminated seafood have greatly increased. Biological effects of contaminated seafood are associated and {{caused by a}} variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites; this various groups of pathogens results in an extensive diversity of clinical syndromes, each with its own epidemiological characteristics. According to a World Health Organization investigation, more than 1 billion people worldwide are infected with different species of the Ascaris lumbricoides worm parasite (282), which causes serious conditions ranging from mild to lethal. Anisakis parasites in marine fish have imposed a signiﬁcant economic burden, reducing productivity and requiring elaborate and expensive control methods. Nematodes of the family Anisakidae is a major group parasitise fish, mammals, birds and reptiles, with the larval stages of some species. Several species of Anisakis {{have been found to be}} parasitic in marine mammals such as whales and dolphins in their adult stages, and their larvae are found in a variety of fish species. Anisakid nematodes have complex life cycles that include invertebrate and vertebrate hosts at various developmental stages during their life. Most reports of anisakiasis infections are associated with eating raw or undercooked ﬁsh that contain larval Anisakis. Humans can also be accidental hosts for larval Anisakis, however they cannot progress their life cycles, but they can frequently cause hypersensitivity IgE-mediated reactions with or without several gastrointestinal manifestations ranging from urticaria to angioedema, called anisakiasis diseases. The development of an allergic reaction mediated by IgE may be against ES and somatic allergens of larval Anisakis. Nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) provides suitable genetic markers for the identification of larval Anisakis. Therefore, the sequences of internal transcribed spacers (ITS- 1 and ITS- 2) are a powerful approach to identify and distinguish anisakid nematodes (at any developmental stage) for diagnostic or taxonomic purposes, for exploring the genetic composition of larval anisakid populations and for investigating their ecology. Although several allergens have been identified in Anisakis simplex, little information is available for other parasite species infecting fish. Therefore, this project aims to investigate the allergenicity of tropomyosin (Ani p 3) and a cysteine protease inhibitor (Ani p 4) from the sibling species, Anisakis pegreffii, using biochemical, genetic and immunological approaches. Larvae (L 3) were harvested manually from tiger flathead fish and identified morphologically using a light microscope. For molecular characterisation and genetic diversity, total genomic DNA was extracted from individual samples and verified by species-specific PCR amplification using the sequences of the first and/or second internal transcribed spacers (ITS- 1 and/or ITS- 2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) as the species-specific genetic markers. For molecular characterisation of Anisakis allergens, RNA of Anisakis pegreffii was extracted, then cDNA synthesised and amplified using designed primers and used to amplify tropomyosin and cysteine protease inhibitor genes from Anisakis pegreffii. Whole muscle proteins from Anisakis larvae were extracted directly with extraction solution and analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and confirmed by immunoblotting assays. Tropomyosin protein was detected using anti-tropomyosin and anti-crustacean polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits while a cysteine protease inhibitor was detected using anti-cysteine protease inhibitor polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit. The allergenicity of the nematode tropomyosin and cysteine protease inhibitor was evaluated using human serum of <b>atopic</b> <b>patient</b> with a shellfish allergy. The result of SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting assays of Anisakis pegreffii extracts indicates the presence of tropomyosin and cysteine protease inhibitor proteins of 44 and 12. 8 kDa molecular weight, respectively. These results are similar to the allergenic tropomyosin and cysteine protease inhibitor of Anisakis simplex. Also, strong reactivity with human serum designated these proteins as allergens in Anisakis pegreffii spp. The molecular sequencing was successful for tropomyosin and cysteine protease inhibitor genes from Anisakis pegreffii, and demonstrated that they are closely related to the Anisakis simplex proteins previously sequenced and submitted in the GenBank database. Our results indicated that, the cDNA sequence similarity searches using the BLAST program and phylogenetic analysis (Clustal W programme) revealed that tropomyosin of A. pegreffii L 3 has the highest homology to &alpha; tropomyosins isoform from A. simplex L 3 (98 %) and A. lumbricoides (84 %), respectively. In addition, cysteine-protease inhibitor of A. pegreffii L 3 has the highest identity to cysteine-protease inhibitor isoform from A. simplex L 3 (98 %) using the BLAST program and 100 % using phylogenetic analysis (Clustal W programme). This analysis highlights that this nematode tropomyosin and cysteine protease inhibitor share high sequence identity with other parasitic nematodes, house dust and crustacean tropomyosin, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Peripheral blood {{lymphocytes}} (PBL) from {{a proportion}} of grass-sensitive patients, studied during or immediately after the grass pollination period, showed spontaneous production in vitro of grass-specific IgE antibody, whereas PBL from <b>atopic</b> <b>patients</b> sensitive to allergens other than grass pollens or non-atopic individuals did not. Pre-incubation of IgE antibody producing PBL from grass-sensitive patients with minute amounts of a mixed grass pollen (MGP) extract or Rye grass antigen Group I (Rye I) usually resulted in a reduction of the spontaneous production in vitro of IgE protein and in a marked inhibition of the spontaneous production in vitro of grass-specific IgE antibody. This antigen-specific inhibition was not mediated by T lymphocytes, but it was apparently due to a signal directly delivered by antigen to the spontaneously IgE antibody producing cells.

In the other two groups, no apparent peak response was observed. Lymphokine production by fraction stimulation was studied in six distinct individuals.
