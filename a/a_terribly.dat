25|$|With fan {{frustration}} {{after the}} McFarland match, a rematch was arranged for 4 July, with Welsh facing just one {{opponent in the}} {{four and a half}} months between the bouts, Phil Brock. Welsh was meant to fight Dick Hyland, but blood poisoning to the Welshman's hand meant the Hyland fight did not take place. The Brock encounter, held at Vernon, California, was Welsh's first 25-round bout and ended in <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> one-sided victory with a plucky Brock losing on points.|$|E
25|$|Welsh {{began his}} British return with an {{encounter}} with Young Joseph at the Pavilion in Mountain Ash, a 20-round match which only reached the eleventh after Young was disqualified for two low punches. Just over a month later, Welsh was back fighting in Mountain Ash, to face little known French lightweight Henri Piet. The press were unimpressed with the choice of opponent, but Piet gave a good account for himself before retiring in the twelfth. After Piet, Welsh faced Joe Fletcher from England; it was <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> mismatched affair which resulted in negative press reports towards Welsh's choice of opponents. In truth {{there were very few}} fighters of a sufficient calibre to test Welsh in Britain, but on 8 November, Welsh got his chance to face Johnny Summers, for the British and European Lightweight Championship.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} about the game's camouflage system. Edge commented that [...] "laying, camouflaged, in short grass inches away from a patrolling enemy is a gripping twist on stealth," [...] while GameSpy criticized it as [...] "just a number to monitor and not <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> interesting one." [...] Out {{of the variety of}} new features, GameSpot called it [...] "the most important and best implemented." [...] The game has also been criticized for its low frame rate, which has been reduced to 30 frame/s (compared with 60 frame/s in Sons of Liberty).|$|E

500|$|Michael J. Nelson, the show's head {{writer who}} also plays the {{character}} of the same name, said the staff initially felt strange making jokes at the expense of Rondo Hatton and his real-life illness; however, Nelson said, [...] "Then you realize it's {{the whole point of the}} movie: he's a guy with a big ugly face...And he is <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> bad actor." [...] Paul Chaplin, another writer with the series, said of the actor's acromegaly: [...] "That fact opens up a large, irresolvable issue concerning the movie industry's use of this poor afflicted fellow; he was paid, after all, and movie work is nice work. Yet it can seem exploitative of misfortune." ...|$|E
500|$|Food critic Katharine Shilcutt of the Houston Press {{criticized the}} episode for giving {{what she thought}} was an {{inaccurate}} depiction of foodies, as people that are [...] "tacky, snotty, slightly racist, hoarders of food experiences that you gather like rare gems and patronizingly hold over other people's heads." [...] Shilcutt added that she found it upsetting that what she believes to be the moral of the episode is that [...] "Educated, passionate people are elitists. It reduces all the hard work that people put into creating good, honest food into a joke, and not <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> funny one. There was no balance in the episode between smug, arrogant, obnoxious foodies and those who have a genuine, guileless interest in food and all its important permutations in our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Phobia {{received}} mixed critical reception. It received {{praise for}} general composition and musicianship but received criticism {{for a lack}} of originality. AllMusic's Corey Apar found the album [...] "nothing if not consistent," [...] and while generally regarding the disc with positive sentiments, noted a lack of distinction from the [...] "rest of the post-grunge/alt-metal pack" [...] aside from [...] "a certain charm". IGN's Spence D. gave the disc a negative review, citing tedium and lack of vocal distinction, feeling that the group's [...] "intersection of hard rock and emo-oriented introspection" [...] is [...] "not a bad thing, but also not <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> memorable or earth-shattering one, either." [...] However, the writer praised the musicianship of Fink, Klepaski, and Szeliga, ultimately giving the album a score of 5.7 out of 10. Entertainment Weekly graded the album C+ and noted its angst-ridden themes, saying, [...] "as pathological angst goes, it's expertly done, with expansive choruses and epic riffs – not that that matters, when, like, we're all going to die cold and alone anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
500|$|With the {{financial}} and critical success of Jaws, Spielberg earned {{a vast amount of}} creative control from Columbia, including the right to make the film any way he wanted. Schrader turned in his script, which Spielberg called, [...] "one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major film studio or director. It was <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all." [...] Titled Kingdom Come, the script's protagonist was a 45-year-old Air Force Officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. [...] " [...] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers." [...] Schrader continued. [...] "One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15 years trying to make contact." [...] Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring John Hill to rewrite. At one point the main character was a police officer. Spielberg [...] " [...] it hard to identify with men in uniform. I wanted to have Mr. Everyday Regular Fella." [...] Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during post-production on Jaws. He reflected, [...] "they wanted to make it like a James Bond adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the release}} of each episode, Telltale Games {{released}} three corresponding machinima shorts. These shorts are set between the episodes; fifteen were released in total. [...] The first short, [...] "Frank Discussion", released on November 30, 2006, has Sam and Max share a discussion regarding frankfurters and their preservative properties in Bosco's store. The short was followed on December 7 by [...] "Trainspotting", in which Sam ponders {{the meaning of life}} while Max questions the sensibility of being outside, away from the comforts of their office. On December 12, Telltale released [...] "A Painstaking Search": having misplaced the keys to their office, Sam and Max return to Brady Culture's hideout in an attempt to retrace their steps. The first short of 2007, [...] "Reality Blights", was released on January 4 and sees Max volunteer the duo to appear on a reality television show, Four Freaks in <b>a</b> <b>Terribly</b> Cramped Office. [...] "Egregious Philosophy Platter" [...] was released seven days later on January 11 and features Sam and Max as host the hosts of television show Egregious Philosophy Platter, discussing the philosophers Socrates and Descartes. The final short relating to television shows, [...] "Kitchen Consequential", was released on January 18 and follows Sam and Max hosting Fun in the Kitchen With Sam and Max where they showcase a few recipes of special effects.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, The Spectator in <b>a</b> not <b>terribly</b> {{positive}} review criticised Hall's prose {{style as}} Victorian {{and noted that}} Adam's Breed had the same plot as The Well of Loneliness and The Unlit Lamp: [...] "lack of {{the right kind of}} love in childhood".|$|R

500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} the New York Times noted that the basic premise is a good idea, but [...] "studded {{as it is with}} undigested chunks of {{scientific}} jargon, sociology-speak and polemical rhetoric Batman: The Ultimate Evil misses out almost completely on the pure pulp thrills that {{lie at the heart of}} its title character's appeal." [...] In the St. Petersburg Times, Adam Begley also noted the use of what he called [...] "techno-babble". In The Washington Post, Jack Womack wrote that Vachss describes the Batmobile [...] "lovingly yet gnomically, as if a Motor Trend review had been translated into Slovakian by someone more familiar with Czech" [...] and concluded that the novel was [...] "as satisfying — aesthetically, ethically, morally — as a pulse-pounding yarn in which pulp-fiction hero Doc Savage ransacks the shantytowns of South America in <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> successful search for Doc Mengele." [...] In Kirkus Reviews, the story was compared to a generic [...] "Destroy All Exploiters" [...] video game where Batman [...] "disposes of each lower-level pimp, then moves up to the next level". Sybil Steinberg in Publishers Weekly noted that [...] "while no classic, this is likely the [...] most stylish adaptation yet of a comic-book figure, its cold stiletto prose and white-hot passions lifting it leagues above recent Spider-man and Incredible Hulk offerings. It's also Vachss' best work since Shella". [...] Both the Library Journal and Booklist predicted heavy demand for it at public libraries.|$|E
500|$|The first Paris performance, on 14 November 1958, was disastrous. According to Stephen Walsh, Pierre Boulez {{failed to}} fulfil his {{undertaking}} to obtain adequate performers, {{and those that}} he could obtain broke down several times. The audience response was polite at first, but when Stravinsky refused to return and take a bow, it gradually descended into jeers. Stravinsky said he would never conduct in Paris again. Stravinsky felt humiliated by {{what he called a}} [...] "scandalous concert", writing in his diary immediately after the performance that it was the [...] "unhappiest concert of my life" [...] and blaming Boulez for the result. Robert Craft adds that Boulez had promised to rehearse Threni, but failed to do so. Stravinsky nevertheless had a share in the blame for not cancelling the concert despite the pleas of family and friends, including his wife and Nadia Boulanger. Conceding that the performance was a [...] "catastrophe", Boulez nevertheless insisted that he did in fact participate in the piano rehearsals, together with Stravinsky, whom he had tried in vain to persuade to be more firm with the singers. He concluded that Stravinsky [...] "was not a good conductor; he was <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> lousy conductor", and the problems with the singers were compounded because [...] "the orchestra had been ill-prepared by Craft". While agreeing that the singers were [...] "absolutely awful", Boulez protested they had been chosen not by himself, but by an {{agent in charge of the}} Aix-en-Provence festival.|$|E

500|$|More {{negative}} reception {{came from}} the magazine Empire, where reviewer Ian Nathan compared the film to New Coke, saying that [...] "it utterly failed". Phil Villarreal believed that there were [...] "too few laugh-worthy moments" [...] and that [...] "instead of stretching to new frontiers, the film rests on the familiar". Sheila Johnston criticized the pacing of the film and its joke level saying that [...] "the overall momentum flags at times" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "a salvo of comic squibs, some very funny, others limp". David Edwards agreed with this, writing that although [...] "there's a great half-hour show rattling around...the rest is padding at its very dullest", concluding that it [...] "isn't a terrible film, just <b>a</b> <b>terribly</b> disappointing one." [...] Cosmo Landesman believed, [...] "the humour seem to have lost its satirical bite and wit" [...] and that [...] "much of the comedy is structured around the idiocy of Homer". This assessment was shared by Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times, who felt that [...] "once the movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning, the trenchancy kind of creaks and falls off." [...] She negatively compared it to [...] (1999), a film similarly adapted from an animated television series, saying that, in terms of satire, it offers [...] "nothing we don't hear every night on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart." [...] Bruce Newman criticized the fleeting appearances of many of the show's secondary characters, and found the film to be [...] "a disappointment".|$|E

2500|$|The {{method of}} incarcerating {{people in the}} insane asylum is {{apparently}} of the easiest. All {{that appears to be}} necessary is an order from some court.
