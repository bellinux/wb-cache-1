40|$|One major {{index of}} social change and {{development}} today is indeed rural development. No nation can boast of having achieved development if {{a large percentage of}} her rural inhabitants are still wallowing under abject poverty, want and adepth in socio-economic penury. However, in Nigeria, empirical evidence shows that underdevelopments have continued to wage on as people are either ignorant of, or indifferent to the reasons for which local governments are created. This paper examines the impact of local government on community and rural development in Nigeria, challenges and the way forward. To scientifically and analytically interrogate the issues raised, the paper traversed conceptualizations and theoretical terrain; utilizing system and rural development theories. Yet, because of the dearth of data, it did content analysis of 466 newspapers and magazines in Nigeria published between 2007 and 2011, to determine people’s feelings about the local governments’ development efforts in communities. It is the position of this paper that the creation of local government in most cases were not based on viability and developmental purposes as required by the constitution but on <b>administrative</b> <b>conveniences</b> to score cheap political goals and legitimacy especially by the military rulers. The paper concludes that while the basic rationale behind the creation of local government is to meet the peculiar needs of the people at the grassroots, it is however pathetic to note that local government has demonstrated incompetence in this regard. Given the catalogue of challenges facing local government, it recommends among other measures, that while local government should remain as a third tier of government, it should be given more powers, resources and enabling environment for the development of localities...|$|R

Salem and Malabar districts were obtained from Tipu Sultan in 1792 as per the Treaty of Seringapatam and Coimbatore and Kanara districts after the Fourth Mysore War in 1799. The territories of the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom were constituted as a separate district in 1799. In 1800, the districts of Bellary and Cuddapah were created out of the territory ceded by the Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1801, the districts of North Arcot, South Arcot, Nellore, Trichinopoly, Madura and Tinnevely were created out of the territories of the erstwhile Carnatic kingdom. Trichinopoly district was made a sub-division of Tanjore district in June 1805 and remained so till August 1808 when its status as a separate district was restored. The districts of Rajahmundry(Rajamahendravaram), Masulipatnam and Guntur were created in 1823. These three districts were reorganised in 1859 into two – the Godavari and Kistna districts. Godavari district was further bifurcated into East and West Godavari districts in 1925. The Kurnool kingdom was annexed in 1839 and was constituted as a separate district of the Madras Presidency.

2500|$|Great Britain {{was first}} divided into {{administrative}} areas by the Romans, most likely following major geographical {{features such as}} rivers. Before their arrival there were distinct tribal areas, but {{they were in a}} constant state of flux as territory was gained and lost. After the demise of Roman Britain around 410 these first divisions of land were generally abandoned, although traditional divisions taking the form of petty kingdoms such as Powys, [...] Dumnonia and Elmet, remained in those areas which remained British, such as south west England. The areas that would later form the English counties started to take shape soon afterwards, with the Kingdom of Kent founded by settlers around 445. In southern England more widely, shires emerged from earlier sub-kingdoms as part of the administrative structure of Wessex, which then imposed its system of shires, boroughs (or burhs) and ealdormen on Mercia after it came under West Saxon control during the 9th century. [...] Once the Kingdom of England was united as a whole in 927 it became necessary to subdivide it for <b>administrative</b> <b>convenience</b> and to this end, earldoms were created out of the earlier kingdoms. The whole kingdom was divided into shires by the time of the Norman conquest.

In most cases the counties or shires in medieval times were administered by a sheriff (derived from [...] "shire-reeve") on behalf of the monarch.

40|$|Justice {{has been}} sacrificed again at Guantanamo Bay, writes GEOFFREY BARKER THE {{resolution}} of the David Hicks saga has revealed much more about the hypocrisy of the US military commission system and the mindset of the Australian government than it has about Hicks’ role in international terrorism. It is now beyond doubt that the military commissions {{have more to do}} with servicing the <b>administrative</b> and political <b>convenience</b> of the US and allies than with dispensing justice to people accused of terrorist offences. It is just as clear that the dominant attitudes of Australian government leaders are cynicism and vindictiveness and that they are driven primarily by their desire to sidestep a potentially damaging political issue ahead of this year’s Federal election. The sentence and conditions imposed on Hicks leave little room for doubt that behind the facade of last week’s proceedings at Guantanamo Bay there was a deal - a fix - between the Bush and Howard administrations to remove what had become a problem for them both. US lead prosecutor Colonel Morris “Moe” Davis, apparently shocked by the direct deal between lawyers for the US defence department and for Hicks, told the Washington Post that he was not even considering a sentence “that didn’t have two digits. ” So obvious is this fix, and so unclear are the legal implications, that it remains an open question as to whether it will in fact assist the government electorally and whether it will ultimately to be legally enforceable if challenged. South Australian Premier Mike Rann has asked the right initial questions: For five years Australians have been told Hicks is a dangerous terrorist. What are the conditions of his early release? What are the parole conditions? Who will supervise him? That the Guantanamo Bay deal was to Hicks’ advantage - he will be home within weeks and a free man by next January - is really beside the point. What will never be tested in a courtroom, what will never be assessed by a jury, is the extent and gravity of his involvement with al-Qaeda. Hicks pleaded guilty to supporting a terrorist group, agreed not to talk about his experiences for a year, and acknowledged that he had not been mistreated by his US military gaolers during his five years at Guantanamo Bay. In return he was given a largely suspended seven-year sentence that will see him free within nine months. So, in the short-term everyone wins. Hicks gets to go home. The Australian government gets to wave Hicks’ guilty plea and (it hopes) to remove him from pre-election politics. The US government avoids a high-profile Hicks show trial before its shonky military commission and (it hopes) to remove a serious impediment to US-Australia relations and a source of rising Australian hostility to the US. The loser, of course is the idea of justice. The {{resolution of the}} Hicks case has further eroded the Australian government’s commitment to justice. It was prepared to acquiesce in the perversity of the military commission system and to leave an Australian citizen in Guantanamo Bay for five years. That delay in itself was profoundly unjust. In fact the Australian and US governments showed little concern about the delays until they became politically uncomfortable for them. Given the arrangement into which the parties have now entered, Hicks’ guilty plea and apologies have to be seen as his get-out-of-gaol pass rather than a serious recognition and acceptance of the offence with which he was charged. His lawyer Major Michael Mori downplays Hicks as a “wannabe” soldier, a dope rather than a danger. Prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Chenail told the Military Commission: “We are face to face with the enemy. ” But the fix was in and neither claim was put to the test. Prime Minister John Howard urged Australians not to view Hicks as a hero. In fact nobody does view Hicks as a hero. Even more disingenuously Howard says Hicks was sentenced by a US judge and that the Australian government was not consulted. In fact Australia only had to let the US defence department legal authorities know what it wanted. The mythical “reasonable person” of legal rhetoric would find it impossible to believe that the Australian government did not know about and approve the plea bargain deal. One particularly shabby aspect of this affair has been the role and rhetoric of the foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer. Downer was among senior ministers quietly encouraging journalists recently to write that Hicks could be released if he agreed to a plea bargain involving a guilty plea to the charge of supporting a terrorist group. Another was the attorney-general, Philip Ruddock. Earlier Downer was at the forefront the campaign insisting insist that Hicks was too dangerous to be released onto the streets of his home town of Adelaide. Now Downer is saying: “I consider anybody who goes and fights for al-Qaeda to be dangerous”. It is hard to read these words as other than a vindictive afterthought echoing Howard’s superfluous observation that Hicks should not be seen as a hero. Perhaps, as many journalists have rushed to claim, Hicks’ guilty plea and early release will be the end of the matter in the Australian public and political consciousness, a problem solved for the government’s election campaign planners - especially as Labor has fallen into step with the outcome. But the fix is so brazen, such a legal travesty, that it might cling to the government like a bad smell even after the gagged Mr Hicks returns to serve out his sentence in South Australia. • Geoffrey Barker is senior defence and foreign affairs writer with the Australian Financial Review and author of Sexing It Up: Iraq, Intelligence and Australia (UNSW Press).
