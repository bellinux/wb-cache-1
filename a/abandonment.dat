40|$|Most {{departments}} of education and school boards do not identify nor compile data reasons for public school <b>abandonments.</b> Public schools are anchors, vital components, and “heartbeats” of communities {{that contribute to the}} growth or decline of neighborhoods. Despite the influences that public schools have on the development and sustainability of neighborhoods, public school <b>abandonments</b> are increasing. School systems use <b>abandonments</b> to address challenges of poor academic achievements, decreasing budgets, declining enrollments, and deteriorating and underutilized facilities. However, absent from literature are comprehensive data and analyses that identify the number of public school <b>abandonments,</b> their locations, or the contributing factors for these <b>abandonments.</b> In this dissertation, I argue that this lack of information creates a critical gap to effective urban and school planning and neighborhood preservation. I confirm this gap and provide a foundation for future research. First, I analyze demographic data for ten of the nation’s most populous metropolitan areas. Second, I survey inner-city school district administrators to obtain primary data about school <b>abandonments.</b> I confirm through my data analyses that <b>abandonments</b> occur most often in poverty and minority concentrated inner-city neighborhoods. I conclude that the findings of my research support the need for comprehensive data and analyses specific to public school <b>abandonments</b> and the need for urban and school planners to evaluate and incorporate the analyses of these data in strategic neighborhood and school planning and development decisions, thereby, minimizing additional adverse impacts on communities that are already in social, economical, and physical distress...|$|R
40|$|In {{queueing}} theory, {{the phenomenon}} that customers get impatient and renege {{from the system}} when the waiting time exceeds their tolerance is called customer <b>abandonments.</b> For those abandoning customers, they may {{go back to the}} service system after some time. This is called customer retrials. In the modern design of service systems, the impact of customer <b>abandonments</b> and retrials on the system performance and queueing dynamics has been realized. In this thesis, we aim to characterize the stationary properties for queueing systems with both customer <b>abandonments</b> and retrials. We also apply some of those properties in a revenue management problem for queueing systems with customer <b>abandonments.</b> First, we study a multi-server queueing system with both customer <b>abandonments</b> and retrials. By using RTA (retrials see time average) approximation, we characterize the stationary properties of such a queueing system. We also justify the appropriateness of RTA approximation in this model both theoretically and numerically. Then, we extend the study to incorporate negative customers and unreliable servers. Two different models are considered. One is a multi-server retrial queueing system with both regular customers and negative customers. The other is a single-server retrial queuewith negative customers and server interruptions. Closed-form expressions of some relevant performance measurements for both models are obtained. For the last, we apply some of our findings in queues with <b>abandonments</b> and retrials to a revenue management problem for a queueing system with customer <b>abandonments.</b> By using a mechanism design framework, we identify the optimal price-lead time manus and scheduling policies for different scenarios...|$|R

5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as <b>abandonment</b> of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the <b>abandonment</b> could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E

5|$|From the {{eleventh}} through the fourteenth centuries, urban development at Gedi expanded {{primarily to the}} north, west and south with the eventual shift of the population around the Great Mosque during the fifteenth century. Gedi's population and prosperity peaked during the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century until it and many other coastal sites began to decline in the late-sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Gedi was abandoned {{by the middle of}} the seventeenth century. The presence of the Portuguese from the sixteenth century has been considered one of the primary factors in Gedi's eventual <b>abandonment</b> with their attempts to monopolize trade and due to armed intervention. However, a drop in the water table seen with the deepening of the well next to the Great Mosque, a Wazimba raid along the coast in 1589, and Galla migrations and raids from Somalia may have been additional factors in the <b>abandonment</b> of Gedi an most of the mainland coastal sites north of Mombasa.|$|E
