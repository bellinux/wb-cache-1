5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the Armadillo can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E

It was powered by the last six cylinder engine built by the Wright Brothers with <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> drive on the flywheel. The 406 cubic inch engine ran at 1,400 to 1560rpm powering two counterrotating propellers via chains.|$|E

25|$|The tensile {{strength}} of a material quantifies how much elongating stress the material will endure before failure. This {{is very important in}} applications that rely upon a polymer's physical strength or durability. For example, <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> with a higher {{tensile strength}} will hold a greater weight before snapping. In general, tensile strength increases with polymer chain length and crosslinking of polymer chains.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the {{convex hull}} or convex {{envelope}} {{of a set}} X of points in the Euclidean plane or in a Euclidean space (or, more generally, in an affine space over the reals) is the smallest convex set that contains X. For instance, when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> stretched around X.|$|E
25|$|During the {{capsizing}} and {{the subsequent}} reporting, the government's announcements, {{as well as those}} from the media, were inconsistent and inaccurate. An editorial in The Huffington Post stated that the governmental reports were like <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> 'increasing at one moment and decreasing at another.' Newspapers such as The JoongAng Ilbo, MBN, and JTBC later made corrections and apologies concerning their earlier reports. Conspiracy theories were also present {{in the aftermath of the}} sinking.|$|E

25|$|Any {{physical}} process which models some computation {{can be interpreted}} as an analog computer. Some examples, invented for the purpose of illustrating the concept of analog computation, include using a bundle of spaghetti as a model of sorting numbers; a board, a set of nails, and <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> as a model of finding the convex hull of a set of points; and strings tied together as a model of finding the shortest path in a network. These are all described in Dewdney (1984).|$|E
25|$|Both EMG and NCS {{involve some}} measure of discomfort. EMG {{involves}} the use of a tiny needle that is inserted into specific muscles to test the associated muscle and nerve function. Both EMG & NCS involve very mild shocks that in normal patients are comparable to <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> snapping on the skin. Although these tests can be very useful in CRPS, thorough informed consent needs to be obtained prior to the procedure, particularly in patients experiencing severe allodynia. In spite of the utility of the test, these patients may wish to decline the procedure in order to avoid discomfort.|$|E

500|$|Scuba divers {{take great}} care to avoid {{breathing}} oxygen enriched [...] "deco gas" [...] at great depths {{because of the}} high risk of oxygen toxicity. To prevent this happening, cylinders containing oxygen-rich gases must always be positively identifiable. One way of doing this is by marking them with their maximum operating depth as clearly as possible. Other safety precautions may include using different coloured regulator housing, flavoured mouthpieces, or simply placing <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> vertically across the mouthpiece as an alert.|$|E
500|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{aimed to}} create a look for the Son'a that was not exaggerated. He consulted several sculptors; Dean Jones, {{who was on the}} production staff for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, created the look. The prosthetics for Ru'afo consisted of overlapping layers that were stretched over Abraham's head. Westmore said Abraham's prosthetics was [...] "like <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> F. Murray Abraham could turn his head and the skin would look translucent. It was so thin, and the layers were pulling on each other." [...] The two other aliens on the Son'a vessels also had specific prosthetic make-up designs created. The Tarlac's look was based reptilian skin, while the Ellora required only nose and forehead prosthetics.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} case {{concerns the}} ways that a circle (1-sphere) can be wrapped around another circle. This can be visualized by wrapping <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> around one's finger: it can be wrapped once, twice, three times and so on. [...] The wrapping can be in either of two directions, and wrappings in opposite directions will cancel out after a deformation. The homotopy group π1(S1) is therefore an infinite cyclic group, and is isomorphic to the group Z of integers under addition: a homotopy class is identified with an integer by {{counting the number of}} times a mapping in the homotopy class wraps around the circle. This integer can also be thought of as the winding number of a loop around the origin in the plane.|$|E
5000|$|The sound {{producing}} technique {{is also a}} little different from the modern violin technique. the performer, instead of using a regular bow, moves the strings with <b>a</b> tight <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> tied to the ends of a wooden stick. To make the <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> less slippery folk musicians will sometimes rub it with regular rosin or with a substance made of white flour mixed with honey and chopped walnuts.|$|R
50|$|Other armies {{used these}} or similar covers printed with {{different}} camouflage patterns, or employed entirely different methods. In the Dutch Army, for example, {{it was common}} practice to use a square piece of burlap as a helmet cover on M1 helmets, usually secured by a net (see above) and <b>a</b> wide <b>rubber</b> <b>band.</b>|$|R
50|$|The very {{simplest}} of these motors may use <b>a</b> stretched <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> as <b>a</b> linear spring, {{rather than a}} coil spring.

2500|$|His {{modus operandi}} [...] was to set fires using an {{incendiary}} timing-device, usually comprising a lit cigarette, three matches wrapped in ruled yellow writing paper and secured by <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> in stores {{while they were}} open and populated. [...] He would set small fires often in the grassy hills, in order to draw firefighters, leaving fires set in more congested areas unattended.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{methods for}} dealing with H. axyridis in private homes involve sealing {{openings}} they may enter. Sweeping and vacuuming are considered effective methods for removing them from homes, though this should be done carefully {{so as not to}} trigger reflex bleeding. A nylon stocking placed inside the vacuum cleaner's hose, secured with <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> allows the beetles to be [...] "bagged" [...] rather than collected inside the machine. A trap designed for indoor use was developed which attracts the beetles with a light and seals them in a removable bag, though as the beetles are not strongly attracted to light, this does not work particularly well.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{challenge}} is to simply avoid collision with the floor, or obstacles such as furniture. Moving obstacles include bouncing basketballs, popping toast, and dripping water. Candles and other ablaze objects sport both a handy updraft and a lethal flame. Collision with [...] "enemy" [...] paper planes and balloons is also fatal, but these can be shot down {{with the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> bonus item. The other bonus items are pieces of paper (extra lives), a variety of clocks (points), and batteries (temporary increased speed.) Glider PRO includes two new bonus items: aluminum foil (shielding against in-flight collisions) and helium tanks (mutually exclusive with regard to batteries, allows the glider to float upwards).|$|R

5000|$|Silly Bandz come in many {{different}} shapes and colors. On a wrist, they function like a regular bracelet, and when taken off they revert to their original shape.

2500|$|The {{essential}} part of any improvised firearm is the barrel and chamber. For small, low-pressure cartridges, like the common [...]22 caliber (5.5mm) rimfire cartridges, even very thin-walled tubing will suffice. Author Harlan Ellison describes the zip guns used by gangs in 1950s New York City as being made from tubing used in coffee percolators or automobile radio antennas, strapped to a block of wood {{to serve as a}} handle. <b>A</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band</b> provided the power for the firing pin, which is pulled back and released to fire. The use of such weak tubing results in a firearm that can be as dangerous to the shooter as the target; the poorly fitting smoothbore barrel provides little accuracy and is liable to burst upon firing.|$|E
2500|$|On ANZAC Day (25 April) 1992, Dirty Three {{played their}} first gig—at the Baker's Arms Hotel, Richmond. At the trio's first live show, Ellis {{attached}} a guitar pick-up to his violin with <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band,</b> providing the instrument with a distorted, feedback-drenched tone unlike the violin's more traditional sound. In 1992, they recorded a self-titled cassette of 12-tracks in Turner's bedroom (aka Scuzz Studio). Dirty Three played all over Melbourne's inner city in Abbotsford, then Fitzroy, Richmond and St. Kilda. In 1993 {{copies of the}} Dirty Three cassette were given away at their early gigs. During 1994 they were the support act for international groups Pavement, Beastie Boys and John Spencer Blues Explosion. In July that year, Torn & Frayed Records issued the band's eponymous album. According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, it was [...] "rimming with Ellis's alternately subtle and dramatic violin flourishes, Turner's tensile guitar lines and White's sympathetic drumming, [...] was a strong introduction to the band's atmospheric musical palate".|$|E
2500|$|Ear {{piercing}} instruments, {{sometimes called}} ear-piercing guns, were originally developed for physician use but with modifications became available in retail settings. Today [...] {{more and more}} people in the Western world have their ears pierced with an ear piercing instrument in specialty jewellery or accessory stores, or at home using disposable ear piercing instruments. An earlobe piercing performed with an ear piercing instrument is often described as feeling similar to being pinched, or being snapped by <b>a</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>band.</b> Piercing with this method, especially for cartilage piercings, is not recommended by many piercing professionals and physicians, as it can cause blunt force trauma to the skin, and takes far longer to heal than needle piercing. In addition, the vast majority of ear piercing instruments are made of plastic, which means they can never be truly sterilized by use of an Autoclave, increasing chance of infection exponentially. In the case of cartilage piercing, doing it with an ear piercing instrument can shatter the ear cartilage and lead to serious complications.|$|E
50|$|In animal husbandry, <b>rubber</b> <b>bands</b> {{are used}} for docking and {{castration}} of livestock.
