5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his junior}} college career, two {{universities}} offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University. Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year in college, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him. NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues, and Johnson was known to be <b>a</b> <b>troublemaker.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lowell {{graduated}} from Harvard College in 1838, despite {{his reputation as}} <b>a</b> <b>troublemaker,</b> {{and went on to}} earn a law degree from Harvard Law School. He published his first collection of poetry in 1841 and married Maria White in 1844. The couple had several children, though only one survived past childhood. They soon became involved in the movement to abolish slavery, with Lowell using poetry to express his anti-slavery views and taking a job in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper. After moving back to Cambridge, Lowell was {{one of the founders of}} a journal called The Pioneer, which lasted only three issues. He gained notoriety in 1848 with the publication of A Fable for Critics, a book-length poem satirizing contemporary critics and poets. The same year, he published The Biglow Papers, which increased his fame. He went on to publish several other poetry collections and essay collections throughout his literary career.|$|E
5|$|She {{was elected}} {{national}} senator in the 1995 general elections. She opposed most bills proposed by Menem, {{such as a}} treaty with Chilean president Patricio Aylwin that benefited Chile {{in a dispute over}} the Argentina–Chile border. The Minister of Defense Oscar Camilión was questioned in Congress about the Argentine arms trafficking scandal; Kirchner told him that he had to resign, which he refused to do. As a result, she made a name for herself as <b>a</b> <b>troublemaker.</b> She was removed from the PJ bloc in the Congress in 1997 for misconduct. She resigned her senatorial seat that year and ran for national deputy in the 1997 midterm elections instead. Menem ended his term of office in 1999 and was replaced by Fernando de la Rúa. Kirchner took part in a commission to investigate money laundering with fellow legislator Elisa Carrió, and got into conflicts with her. She ran again for senator in the 2001 midterm elections.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being <b>a</b> <b>troublemaker</b> and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not <b>a</b> <b>troublemaker</b> but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

5|$|Louis Antoine de Saint-Just {{was born}} at Decize in the former Nivernais {{province}} of central France. He was the eldest child of Louis Jean de Saint-Just de Richebourg (1716–1777), a retired French cavalry officer, knight of the Order of Saint Louis, and of the 20-years younger Marie-Anne Robinot (1736–1811), {{the daughter of a}} notary. He had two younger sisters, born in 1768 and 1769. The family later moved north and in 1776 settled in the village of Blérancourt in the former Picardy province, establishing themselves as a countryside noble family living out of the rents from their land. A year after the move, Louis Antoine's father died leaving his mother with the three children. She saved diligently for her only son's education, and in 1779 he was sent to the Oratorian school at Soissons. After a promising start, Saint-Just acquired a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>troublemaker,</b> augmented by infamous stories (almost certainly apocryphal) of how he led a students' rebellion and tried to burn down the school. Nonetheless, he earned his graduation in 1786.|$|E

It was also around this time that he became involved with a local gang on his home street of Sutjeska. As a teenager, he enrolled in a streamlined secondary school focusing on commerce, which perhaps contributed to his eventual involvement in racketeering. His early transgressions were limited to bullying and street brawls.|$|E

In love with Nadia Chernyshevski, he is killed during the first Martian revolution in 2061.|$|E

In 1990, he moved to New York City to study acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. He appeared in plays in New York and his first acting role was in Felicity Huffman's independent film Erie, which was filmed on the Erie Canal.|$|E
25|$|Ethel lives above Doctor Legg's (Leonard Fenton) {{surgery and}} works as the cleaner in the pub. She is {{somewhat}} of <b>a</b> <b>troublemaker</b> and often spreads the most insane rumours about and gets her words {{mixed up with}} hilarious consequences. She is famous for her questionable ability to read-palms and tea-leaves, once even earning a living from it. After Lou's death in 1988 Ethel and Dot become an inseparable double-act and although the two argue constantly, they actually depend on each other a great deal. Despite the fact that Ethel appears totally barmy, she can be quite astute when she wants and she is always the first {{to point out the}} malicious ways of Dot's villainous son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). Ethel is never afraid to stand up to Nick, even kneeing him in the groin once when he attempts to mug her. She also correctly figures out that Nick is trying to poison Dot to get her money, and she refuses to back down, despite Dot falling out with her because of her accusations. Following several falls and a broken hip, Ethel is persuaded to move out of her residence above the surgery and into sheltered housing in 1988. Although she is strongly opposed to this initially, she eventually comes to enjoy her new home, though she would continue to show up in Albert Square regularly.|$|E
25|$|A boat took Gazis to Skiathos. The island housed {{significant}} numbers of refugees from Thessaly, who had resorted to selling their clothes and jewelry for minuscule portions of food. Skiathos kodjabashis saw Gazis as <b>a</b> <b>troublemaker,</b> spreading rumors that he had embezzled funds sent to him from abroad. One day a mob of refugees nearly lynched Gazis who was saved after the intervention by a local man named Anagnostis Benakis. Gazis' comrades then {{took him to the}} Skiathos Castle and then Skopelos. When the man housing Gazis accidentally killed a man while practicing with his pistol, a mob set fire to his house. Gazis was seriously injured in the incident, spending two days in bed. Following his recovery he departed for Talantonisi and from there to Morea, eventually settling in Salona. On 15 November, Gazis participated in the Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece, a meeting of clerics, kodjabashis, armatoloi and other officials from Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia and Central Greece. There Gazis was elected as an official representative of the First National Assembly at Epidaurus. For the next thirteen months Gazis provided logistical support to insurgents on Euboea and obstructed Turkish efforts to send supplies to their garrisons in Morea. On 29 March 1823, he joined the Second National Assembly at Astros. On 17 May 1824, he became a member of a commission regarding military affairs while simultaneously working in commissions of education. During that time Gazis and Konstantas presented a draft proposing the creation of an academy in Argos named Protypon Didaktirion. The plan did not come to fruition due to events such as the Destruction of Psara and the ongoing Greek civil wars of 1824–1825.|$|E
