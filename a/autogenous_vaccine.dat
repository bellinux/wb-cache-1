40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of three control measures in reducing nursery mortality caused by Haemophilus parasuis, namely, a commercial vaccine, an <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccine,</b> and controlled exposure using a low dose of live, virulent organisms. Methods: The experiments were performed in a multi-farm system experiencing high nursery mortality (> 4. 8 %) due to H parasuis infection. In Experiment 1, pigs were vaccinated at weaning using a commercially available, one-dose H parasuis vaccine. In Experiment 2, pigs were vaccinated at processing and at weaning with an <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccine.</b> In Experiment 3, pigs were orally inoculated at processing using a bacterial suspension containing a total of 105 - 6 colony forming units per mL of three H parasuis strains prevalent in the studied herd. Experiments 1 and 2 were repeated five times (5 consecutive weeks of production), and Experiment 3 was repeated nine times. Results: Mortality in pigs exposed to H parasuis was lower (P <. 001) than that in groups vaccinated with either commercial or autogenous vaccines. Discussion: The lack of effect of parenteral vaccination may be due to lack of crossprotection between heterologous strains, timing of vaccination, and potential interference of maternally-derived immunity. The efficacy of controlled exposure likely reflects the induction of homologous mucosal immunity preventing pathogen systemic invasion. Implications: The use of controlled exposure of young pigs to the prevalent H parasuis strains involved in nursery mortality provides a valuable alternative for control of H parasuis, compared to traditional vaccination using commercial or autogenous products...|$|E

An <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccine</b> was prepared from E. coli bearing the bla(CTX-M- 14) gene and evaluated as a potential control measure to reduce shedding and dissemination of these organisms in cattle. Calves (n= 30) received either an <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccine</b> prepared from E. coli serotype O 33 bearing the bla(CTX-M- 14) gene or a placebo by intramuscular injection on three separate occasions. Two weeks after the final vaccination, all calves were challenged by oral gavage with the O 33 CTX-M- 14 strain of E. coli (1 × 10 (10) CFU). Faeces, intestinal mucosa and blood samples were taken for enumeration of total and CTX-M- 14 E. coli and for assessment of the humoral immune response.

Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Haemophilus parasuis is {{a common}} {{epiphyte}} of the upper respiratory tract of pigs. The factors of H. parasuis pathogenicity that enable some strains to be virulent and consequently cause a clinical disease have not been established yet. Fifteen serovars of H. parasuis have been described at present. Individual serovars differ in virulence, and considerable differences in virulence also exist within each serovar. Virulent strains can particularly participate as microorganisms secondary to pneumonia, cause septicaemia without polyserositis or Glässer’s disease characterized by polyserositis, pericarditis, arthritis and meningitis. Clinical symptoms of this disease are highly variable. Therefore, culture detection of causative agent, particularly from the brain, joints and polyserositis is an essential diagnostic tool. The disease caused by H. parasuis can be treated with antibiotics; however, oral or parenteral administration of very high doses of antibiotics is necessary. The level of animal hygiene and animal husbandry are important factors for prevention of this disease. Commercial or <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{can be used in}} the immunoprophylaxis of pre-parturient sows and their progeny after weaning.

40|$|Streptococcus iniae causes severe septicemia and {{meningitis}} in {{farmed fish}} {{and is also}} occasionally zoonotic. Vaccination against S. iniae is problematic, with frequent breakdown of protection in vaccinated fish. The major protective antigens in S. iniae are the polysaccharides of the capsule, which are essential for virulence. Capsular biosynthesis is driven and regulated by a 21 -kb operon comprising up to 20 genes. In a long-term study, we have sequenced the capsular operon of strains {{that have been used}} in <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccines</b> across Australia and compared it with the capsular operon sequences of strains subsequently isolated from infected vaccinated fish. Intriguingly, strains isolated from vaccinated fish that subsequently become infected have coding mutations that are confined to a limited number of genes in the cps operon, with the remainder of the genes in the operon remaining stable. Mutations in strains in diseased vaccinated fish occur in key genes in the capsular operon that are associated with polysaccharide configuration (cpsG) and with regulation of biosynthesis (cpsD and cpsE). This, along with high ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations within the cps genes, suggests that immune response directed predominantly against capsular polysaccharide may be driving evolution in a very specific set of genes in the operon. From these data, {{it may be possible to}} design a simple polyvalent vaccine with a greater operational life span than the current monovalent killed bacterins...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A ISO-sow farrow-to-finish {{operation}} had {{a history}} of endemic skin problems in sows and pigs for 2 years. A complete investigation, including skin biopsies, cultural examination and sensitivity, blood samples, and nutritional and building evaluation, was conducted to identify possible causes.

A control program, which included washing sows, using antibiotics and <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccines,</b> changing processing techniques, adding supplemental micronutrients, and modifying buildings, was initiated. These changes were followed by rapid improvement in the skin problems. The multiple control programs make it difficult to attribute the improvement to anyone change or treatment.

40|$|When recommending a {{specific}} pharmaceutical, more {{has to be}} taken into account than whether the API is indicated for the illness in question. Based on the preceding discussion, product source can have a tremendous impact on efficacy, on therapeutic success, and on practitioners' credibility in the eyes of their clients. However, product source goes beyond simple credibility, encompassing professional ethics and liability. In answering the Ethical question of the month [...] December 2001 "Should private veterinary practitioners be allowed to produce <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccines</b> or compound antimicrobial products for use in food producing animals?" Rollin concluded, "one cannot envision a clearer case of unethical behavior. " The reality is that quality assurance, efficacy, potency, and safety are not defined for compounded products, and should veterinarians choose to script or dispense one, the responsibility for its quality, efficacy, potency, and safety falls squarely on their shoulders. Ultimately, this also translates into 100 % liability should an ADR, illness, or lack of effect, befall the patient. While having access to ELDU and compounded products is crucial in facilitating the treatment of the various diseases that veterinarians face, the regulatory freedom that gives them this choice carries heightened responsibilities when electing this option. In a nutshell, ethical and responsible principles of pharmacy dictate that a veterinarian's first choice should be a veterinary-licensed pharmaceutical for the indication in question. Should this not exist, ELDU of a licensed product with clinically derived therapeutic protocols should be the next choice. Compounded pharmaceuticals should only be used when no licensed (those sporting a DIN) product exists, and extreme cautions should be exercised when using transdermal formulations. Liability dictates that this decision be undertaken with informed consent of the owner and with appropriate due diligence when selecting a compounding service provider.

One group was vaccinated with inactivated liver homogenate vaccine prepared in our laboratory from the liver of HPS infected birds. Two groups were vaccinated with similar <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccine</b> procured from two commercial laboratories. One group was vaccinated with cell cultured DNA based vaccine while one group was kept as a control. Multiple shots of each vaccine were used in its specific group along with boosting doses. The hyper immune sera thus raised were tested for the presence of HPS and CAV antibodies using Agar Gel Precipitation Test (AGPT) and Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbant Assay (ELISA) techniques. The results demonstrated that antibodies against HPS were present in hyper immune sera of all the vaccinated birds. No antibodies against CAV were detected in the tested sera. It was concluded that CAV is not associated as a contributing agent in causing hydro pericardium syndrome in broilers...|$|E
40|$|A 19 {{year old}} female intact Warmblood {{presented}} to the Cornell University Large Animal Surgery Service for surgical debulking of multiple sarcoids. This was her sixth surgical procedure for this problem over a 13 year history of treatment. On presentation, the patient was afebrile, and temperature, pulse, and respiration were within normal limits. The sarcoid tumors were large, pendulous, ulcerated, and necrotic in many areas. The regions where the sarcoids were most prevalent were those persistently affected {{since the start of}} the disease, namely her left flank/inguinal region, and her right axilla. Smaller, individual, fibroblastic sarcoids were present on her pectoral region, and above her right eye. Under general anesthesia, the exuberant components of most lesions were sharply removed. Following debulking, intralesional chemotherapy using cisplatin and carboplatin in a lipid emulsion was also performed. The patient was recovered without incident. Prior to this surgery, the mare had been treated at CUHA and by local veterinarians with a variety of medications and procedures including cautery, various immunotherapies, <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccines,</b> intralesional and systemic chemotherapy, and 5 other debulking surgeries. Her history of equine sarcoid began in 2001, when a small, flat (occult) sarcoid was found on her left flank. No treatment was instituted at that time. However, after a hock injury in 2002 that left the mare on stall rest for a year, the sarcoid quickly became more aggressive. It soon became clear that this was not an ordinary case of equine sarcoid, as the tumors spread to other areas of the body to include the right axilla and right ear base. The tumors grew very rapidly as they spread, and began to transition quickly from occult to malevolent sarcoids. This presentation will focus on the origin, types, and various treatment modalities available for the treatment of equine sarcoids. The ethical implications of invasive long-term management of disease in animals will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} sensitivity of human papillomavirus type 11 was evaluated {{by using a}} human xenograft severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model. Incubation of the virus for 1 h at a temperature higher than 56 °C but lower than 72 °C was sufficient to inhibit the virally induced growth of infected human tissue. However, 100 °C was necessary to completely inactivate HPV type 11 genome expression. The conditions for heat inactivation of human papillomavi-ruses (HPVs) have not been rigorously established. Investiga-tions of human <b>autogenous</b> wart <b>vaccines</b> prepared from condylomata acuminata suggested that incubation at 56 °C for 1 to 2 h is sufficient for inactivation, but the infectivity of the preparation was not determined prior to inoculation in those studies (1, 7). More recently, Smith et al. (9) described an in vitro model of HPV type 11 (HPV- 11) infection and evaluated {{the ability of a}} single temperature, 60 °C for 1 h, to abrogate viral expression, as measured by the presence of E 1 ^E 4 mRNA. In the present study, we used the severe combine...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M Environmental Sciences) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Environmental pathogens, such as Escherichia coli and Streptococcus uberis, are {{currently}} the {{major cause of}} mastitis within dairy herds. This leads to severe financial losses, lower production rates and deterioration of the general health of the herd. E. coli mastitis is becoming {{a major threat to}} high milk-producing dairy herds. This is because of its increasing resistance to antibiotics, rendering antibiotic treatment regimes against E. coli infections mostly ineffective. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a method to select mastitis causing E. coli isolates for the formulation of effective herd specific vaccines. Two methods, namely a genotyping method (Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA; RAPD) and an antibiogram based method, were used. A dairy farm milking approximately 1000 Holstein cows in the Darling area, Western Cape Province, was selected for this study. The study was conducted over a period of 48 months and mastitis samples were analysed for mastitis pathogens. Antibiogram testing (disk diffusion method) and an in-house developed RAPD analysis method were used to analyse the E. coli isolates. A total of 921 milk samples were analysed from which 181 E. coli isolates were recovered. The number of all other common mastitis pathogens combined was 99 isolates (Streptococcus uberis 18, Streptococcus dysgalactiae 46, Streptococcus agalactiae 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis 21, Arcanobacterium pyogenes 13). All E. coli isolates, except for one, were resistant to at least three antibiotics. Antibiotic variance profiles were also highly erratic. The RAPD analysis revealed high levels of polymorphisms and clear epidemiological trends were observed over time. No similarities in the variance profiles between the antibiotic variance data and phylogenetic data were observed. Formalin inactivated <b>autogenous</b> <b>vaccines</b> were produced containing E. coli isolated from the herd. The vaccines were formulated using the RAPD or antibiogram data of the E. coli isolates. A total of 5 vaccines were formulated using RAPD data (Rvaccines) and one vaccine was formulated using antibiotic variance data (A-vaccine). The RAPD formulated vaccines were more effective than the antibiotic variance formulated vaccine. After each R-vaccination, the number of E. coli mastitis cases declined within the herd. The A-vaccinations seemed to have had no effect, which lead to a rise in E. coli mastitis cases. RAPD analysis on new emerging isolates was able to detect genetic variation from vaccine strains, which in turn facilitated the formulation of new updated vaccines with higher effectiveness than the previous vaccine. Mastitis data prior to and after the vaccination period revealed significant higher incidences of mastitis in the herd than during the vaccination period. This study demonstrated that sufficient sampling practices coupled with a reliable genotyping method, resulted in the formulation of updatable vaccines which were highly effective in controlling E. coli mastitis within the herd.
