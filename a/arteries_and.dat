5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain <b>arteries)</b> <b>and</b> CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E

Every day, having hardly finished working in the operating room, Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> their relation with the cardiac muscle. The laboratory of Sones, father of the coronary angiography, had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} the muscles and {{skeleton}} is described in the Hippocratic Corpus, an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors. Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. Praxagoras identified the difference between <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> veins. Also in the 4th century BCE, Herophilos and Erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> causing strokes.|$|E

His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{concerns}} of long-term adverse side effects such as calcification of <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day. The EFSA set UL at 2,500 mg/day for adults but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine ULs.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have known}} about the heart since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304â€“250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.|$|E

If the common hepatic artery had not replaced the SMA, PI and pneumoperitoneum could not have occurred, because there is rich collateral flow between the celiac <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> SMA. This rare variation of the common hepatic <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> the SMA caused CMI symptoms due to severe stenosis of the two mesenteric arteries.|$|R
40|$|Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) {{were created}} at the elbow, {{rather than using}} {{prosthetic}} grafts, when forearm vessels were inadequate. A total of 272 such fistulas were constructed: 49 between the brachial <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> a forearm vein, 91 between the brachial <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> the elbow perforating vein, 52 between the brachial <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> cephalic vein and 80 between the brachial <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> the basilic vein. In each case the vein was sutured end to side to the artery. The immediate failure rate was 11. 8 per cent. The 1 - and 4 -year cumulative patency rates were 68. 7 and 51. 2 per cent for brachial artery-forearm vein AVFs, 80. 3 and 68. 0 per cent for those between the brachial <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> the elbow perforator, 74. 1 and 61. 3 per cent for brachial artery-cephalic veins fistulas, and 76. 7 and 49. 2 per cent for those between the brachial <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> the basilic vein. The elbow AVF is a reliable means of establishing vascular access for haemodialysis. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWNAinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60â€“90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{cases are}} {{considered}} to be caused by intrinsic factors that weaken the arterial wall. Only a very small proportion (1â€“4%) have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndrome type 4 and more rarely Marfan's syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, caused by mutations of the COL3A gene, leads to defective production of the collagen, type III, alpha 1 protein and causes skin fragility as well as weakness of the walls of <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> internal organs. Marfan's syndrome results from mutations in the FBN1 gene, defective production of the protein fibrillin-1, and a number of physical abnormalities including aneurysm of the aortic root.|$|E

50|$|The brachiocephalic artery or trunk is {{the first}} <b>and</b> largest <b>artery</b> that {{branches}} to form the right common carotid <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> the right subclavian artery. This artery provides blood to the right upper chest, right arm, neck, and head, through a branch called right vertebral <b>artery.</b> The right <b>and</b> left vertebral <b>artery</b> feed into the basilar <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> upward to the Posterior cerebral artery, which provides most of the brain with oxygenated blood.The posterior cerebral <b>artery</b> <b>and</b> the posterior communicating artery are within the circle of Willis.|$|R
5|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or <b>arteries,</b> <b>and</b> instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial <b>arteries</b> <b>and</b> branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, <b>arteries,</b> <b>and</b> veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
