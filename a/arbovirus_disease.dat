40|$|The rapid {{succession}} of the pandemic of <b>arbovirus</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as dengue, West Nile fever, chikungunya, and Zika fever, has intensified research on {{these and other}} <b>arbovirus</b> <b>diseases</b> worldwide. Investigating the unique mode of vector-borne transmission requires {{a clear understanding of}} the roles of vertebrates. One major obstacle to this understanding is the ambiguity of the arbovirus definition originally established by the World Health Organization. The paucity of pertinent information on arbovirus transmission at the time contributed to the notion that vertebrates played the role of reservoir in the arbovirus transmission cycle. Because this notion is a salient feature of the arbovirus definition, it is important to reexamine its validity.

Traditional means of controlling <b>arbovirus</b> <b>diseases</b> include vaccination of susceptible vertebrates and mosquito control, {{but in many cases}} these have been unavailable or ineffective, and so novel strategies for disease control are needed. One possibility is genetic manipulation of mosquito vectors to render them unable to transmit arboviruses. This review describes recent work to test the concept of pathogen-derived resistance in arthropods by expression of viral genes in mosquito cell cultures and mosquitoes. Sense and antisense genome sequences from La Crosse virus (LAC) (a member of the Bunyaviridae) and dengue viruses serotypes 1 to 4 (DEN- 1 to DEN- 4) (members of the Flaviviridae) were expressed in mosquito cells from double-subgenomic and replicon vectors based on Sindbis virus (a member of the Togaviridae). The cells were then challenged with homologous or related viruses. For LAC, expression of antisense sequences from the small (S) genome segment, particularly full-length antisense S RNA, effectively interfered with replication of challenge virus, whereas expression of either antisense or sense RNA from the medium (M) segment was completely ineffective in LAC inhibition. Expression of sense and antisense RNA derived from certain regions of the DEN genome also blocked homologous virus replication more effectively than did RNA from other regions. Other parameters of RNA-mediated interference have been defined, such as the time when replication is blocked and the minimum size of effector RNA. The mechanism of RNA inhibition has not been determined, although it resembles double-stranded RNA interference in other nonvertebrate systems.

40|$|Background: The {{spread of}} Aedes albopictus, a vector for re-emergent <b>arbovirus</b> <b>diseases</b> like {{chikungunya}} and dengue, points up {{the need for}} better control strategies and new tools to evaluate transmission risk. Human antibody (Ab) responses to mosquito salivary proteins could represent a reliable biomarker for evaluating human-vector contact and the efficacy of control programs. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used ELISA tests to evaluate specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to salivary gland extracts (SGE) in adults exposed to Aedes albopictus in Reunion Island. The percentage of immune responders (88 %) and levels of anti-SGE IgG Abs were high in exposed individuals. At an individual level, our results indicate heterogeneity of the exposure to Aedes albopictus bites. In addition, low-level immune cross-reactivity between Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti SGEs was observed, mainly in the highest responders.

Reverse genetics technology has completely revolutionized the study of these viruses, making it possible to manipulate their genomes and evaluate the direct effects of these changes on their biology and pathogenesis. The most commonly used reverse genetics system is the infectious clone technology. Whilst flavivirus infectious clones provide a powerful tool, their construction as full-length cDNA molecules in bacterial vectors can be problematic, laborious and time consuming, because they are often unstable, contain unwanted induced substitutions and may be toxic for bacteria due to viral protein expression. The incredible technological advances that have been made during the past 30 years, such as the use of PCR or new sequencing methods, have allowed the development of new approaches to improve preexisting systems or elaborate new strategies that overcome these problems.

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} component of arbovirus surveillance is monitoring the vector for presence of the pathogen. Intervention and preventive programs need early detection of arboviral activity in mosquito populations. In this report, we examine the factors affecting the probability of detection of mosquito infections. Since arbovirus infection rates in mosquito populations are very low, observations of zero-infected mosquito samples are common. Using statistical models, we describe methods to estimate the probability of detection and upper bounds of confidence intervals of mosquito infection rates as measures of confidence for observations of zero infection. Our results show that detection of low levels of mosquito infections requires large samples (greater than 1, 600 individuals) for a high probability (0. 8) of detection. Due to focal transmission of arboviruses, grouping samples over different sampling sites and times is often inappropriate for detection of mosquito infection. We emphasize sample size as a key determinant in detection of mosquito infections and recommend intensified entomologic surveys at sentinel sites to detect arboviral activity. Mosquito-borne <b>arbovirus</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), pose severe threats to public health.

40|$|Abstract. Dengue fever, an <b>arbovirus</b> <b>disease</b> {{transmitted}} by Aedes mosquitoes, has recently spread rapidly, {{especially in the}} tropical countries of the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. It is endemic in Malaysia, with an annual average of 37, 937 reported dengue cases from 2007 to 2012. This study measured the overall economic impact of dengue in Malaysia, and estimated the costs of dengue prevention. In 2010, Malaysia spent US$ 73. 5 million or 0. 03 % of the country’s GDP on its National Dengue Vector Control Program. This spending represented US$ 1, 591 per reported dengue case and US$ 2. 68 per capita population. Most (92. 2 %) of this spending occurred in districts, primarily for fogging. A previous paper estimated the annual cost of dengue illness {{in the country at}} US$ 102. 2 million. Thus, the inclusion of preventive activities increases the substantial estimated cost of dengue to US$ 175. 7 million, or 72 % above illness costs alone.

Thus, under the influence of increasing temperatures and rainfall through warming of the oceans, and alteration of the natural cycles that stabilise climate, one is inevitably drawn to the conclusion that arboviruses will continue to emerge in new regions. For example, we cannot ignore the unexpected but successful establishment of chikungunya fever in northern Italy, the sudden appearance of West Nile virus in North America, the increasing frequency of Rift Valley fever epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula, and very recently, the emergence of Bluetongue virus in northern Europe.

Aedes hendersoni, a sibling species of Ae. triseriatus, has a salivary gland barrier to LAC virus and, therefore, is not considered a vector of this virus. Adults of Ae. triseriatus are morphologically indistinguishable from those of Ae. hendersoni, and the two species are sympatric in the eastern United States. A definitive method of identifying field specimens {{is an important part}} of any disease surveillance program, particularly in the case of LAC virus.

Mosquito coils, repellents, and citronella candles each decreased risk by at least 2 -fold, with a dose–response for the number of protective measures used. Light-coloured clothing decreased risk 3 -fold. Camping increased the risk 8 -fold. Conclusions These risks were substantial and statistically significant, and provide a basis for educational programs on individual protection against RRV disease in Australia.

50|$|Meyer also {{investigated}} {{what are}} called <b>arbovirus</b> <b>diseases,</b> among them equine encephalitis. Several diseases transmitted from animals to humans are due {{to a group of}} viruses carried by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes belong to the ‘animal family’ (technically a ‘phylum’) called arthropods; hence the viruses carried by them are arthropod-borne. Different arboviruses may cause diverse diseases. Here, we summarize examples of Meyer’s outstanding discoveries in this area. In the early 1930s, thousands of horses in California suffered and died from a paralytic disease, later called western equine encephalitis. Meyer proved that it was of viral origin. Later {{it became clear that the}} virus can also infect humans causing encephalitis, sometimes with deadly complications. - Meyer and his colleagues at the Hooper later demonstrated that mosquitoes pick up the virus from chicken and (migratory) birds and transfer it to man and to horses. It also became clear that the disease is common near irrigated fields where mosquitoes abound. Meyer therefore qualified encephalitis as a man-made disease. Subsequently, a vaccine for horses was developed. And it turned out that the isolation of the virus by Meyer led to the discovery of similar kinds causing other types of encephalitis in man. (Other microbiologists found related types of viruses in other animals than horses.) - Effective mosquito control was the key to minimizing this problem.|$|R
40|$|Background The {{capacity}} of Aedes mosquitoes to resist chemical insecticides threatens {{the control of}} major <b>arbovirus</b> <b>diseases</b> worldwide. Until alternative control tools are widely deployed, monitoring insecticide resistance levels and identifying resistance mechanisms in field mosquito populations is crucial for implementing appropriate management strategies. Metabolic resistance to pyrethroids is common in Aedes aegypti but the monitoring {{of the dynamics of}} resistant alleles is impeded by the lack of robust genomic markers. Methodology/Principal findings In an attempt to identify the genomic bases of metabolic resistance to deltamethrin, multiple resistant and susceptible populations originating from various continents were compared using both RNA-seq and a targeted DNA-seq approach focused on the upstream regions of detoxification genes. Multiple detoxification enzymes were over transcribed in resistant populations, frequently associated with an increase in their gene copy number. Targeted sequencing identified potential promoter variations associated with their over transcription. Non-synonymous variations affecting detoxification enzymes were also identified in resistant populations. Conclusion /Significance This study not only confirmed the role of gene copy number variations as a frequent cause of the over expression of detoxification enzymes associated with insecticide resistance in Aedes aegypti but also identified novel genomic resistance markers potentially associated with their cis-regulation and modifications of their protein structure conformation. As for gene transcription data, polymorphism patterns were frequently conserved within regions but differed among continents confirming the selection of different resistance factors worldwide. Overall, this study paves the way of the identification of a comprehensive set of genomic markers for monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of the variety of insecticide resistance mechanisms in Aedes aegypti...|$|R
