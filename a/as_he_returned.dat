5|$|Beginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet {{presidium}} {{chairman and}} nominal {{head of state}} Leonid Brezhnev began discussing Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues. While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> {{from a trip to}} Scandinavia in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the Committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot. Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy; Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, President Richard Nixon {{stopped at}} Loring on 3 July in Air Force One (SAM 27000) <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> from a summit in Moscow, {{where he and}} Leonid Breshnev had signed the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. In a speech in front of 5,000 people in the double {{cantilever}} hangar, {{he talked about the}} importance of the treaty. President and Mrs. Nixon were welcomed home by vice president Gerald R. Ford, who flew from Washington. His daughter Julie Nixon Eisenhower was also in attendance. Nixon resigned from office five weeks later.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E

5|$|Banks was {{determined}} to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units' participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow {{was wounded in the}} right arm and left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{continued}} to commentate for the station, along with various satellite and Asian channels, until 2003, when {{his career was}} further threatened by throat cancer (see below).

5|$|FutureSex/LoveSounds is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Justin Timberlake. It was released on September 8, 2006 by Jive Records and its affiliated label of the Zomba Group of Companies. During a two-year hiatus, Timberlake resolved his feelings on being unable to record any new material, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to record some new music, he began collaborating with his longtime record producer Timbaland, alongside the latter's colleague Danja. The album's contents were produced at Timbaland's Thomas Crown Studios. The album shares some lyrical themes with Timberlake's debut album Justified (2002), although FutureSex/LoveSounds has more diversity in music genres. It infuses R and pop with techno, funk, and elements of rock. The reprises and interludes interspersed on the album's tracks were created by the production team {{with the goal of}} channeling Timberlake's influences; including David Bowie and Prince.|$|E
5|$|He {{secretly}} left Louisville {{at night}} and returned to Indianapolis by train. Eitel defended Riley to the press {{in an effort to}} gain sympathy for Riley, explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made. Riley however refused to speak to reporters and hid himself for weeks. Much to Riley's surprise, the news reports made him more popular than ever. Many people thought the stories were exaggerated, and Riley's carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic. Riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath, but they soon began corresponding with him requesting that he resume writing. This encouraged Riley, and he made another attempt to give up liquor <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to his public career.|$|E

Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to the American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E

5|$|Munnerlyn {{played in}} 16 games with 11 starts for Carolina in the 2012 season. He {{tied for the}} team lead with two interceptions and tied the team record for interceptions {{returned}} for scores in a season <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> both interception for touchdowns, a record that was previously accomplished by Eric Davis in 1998 and Mike Minter in 2003. He produced more tackles than the previous season with 61 tackles. He also batted down six passes and was credited with two quarterback pressures, contributing to a unit that ranked 10th in the NFL in total defense. He started 11 of the last 12 games at left cornerback after Chris Gamble suffered a season-ending injury in Week 7. As a punt returner, he averaged 5.1 yards on a team-high 14 punt returns with a long of 20 yards. In Week 5 against the Seattle Seahawks, he intercepted a pass by quarterback Russell Wilson and returned it 33 yards for a touchdown. In Week 10 at the Denver Broncos, he matched a career-high in tackles with seven. In Week 11, he picked off a pass by Buccaneers quarterback Josh Freeman and returned it 74 yards for a touchdown, his second of the year. In {{the final game of}} the season at New Orleans Saints, he equaled his previous career-high of seven tackles.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> from a lower-body injury {{that kept him}} from the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell to the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out of the lineup, Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrender}} of the fortresses began {{a long period}} of conflict between the Greeks of the reconstituted Byzantine Empire and the forces of the Principality for control of the Morea. Prince William was absolved by the Pope of his oaths to Palaiologos, and warfare began almost as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to the Principality. Despite this precarious situation, Geoffrey absented himself from the Morea, without William's permission, and spent the years 1263–65 in Italy, ostensibly on a pilgrimage, but in reality living with the wife of one of his feudatories, John of Katavas. His absence allowed the inhabitants of Skorta to rise up and aid the Byzantine troops in their offensive, which was halted by the same John of Katavas in the Battle of Prinitsa. Geoffrey was again deprived of his barony for this act, but was pardoned and restored to it on his return.|$|E

5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Leader of a Machine-gun Section of Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas City Chiefs {{credited}} {{their defense}} with the win after holding the Buccaneers to 14 yards rushing. The Buccaneers managed only 2 first downs and 34 yards of total offense before exploding for three {{touchdowns in the}} final ten minutes. The Buccaneers were mistake-prone and ineffective throughout the first three quarters. Ken Stone was penalized for roughing on a missed field goal in the first quarter, {{with the result that}} the Chiefs got a second chance to kick it. The special teams allowed Henry Marshall to return a punt 59 yards, setting up the Chiefs’ second touchdown. They got 14 first downs and 162 yards in the final 15 minutes, scoring on an Essex Johnson run and passes from Steve Spurrier to Johnny McKay and Jack Novak. Coach McKay felt that the difference was that the team did not begin giving effort until the fourth quarter. McKay also felt that the Chiefs left themselves vulnerable by trying to run up the score. Bert Cooper, filling in at linebacker for an injured Steve Reese, was consistently exploited in the passing game. McKay later threatened to fire players who he felt were giving a slack effort, specifically referring to a Chiefs kickoff that rolled {{all the way to the}} 4-yard line, with no Buccaneers trying to recover it. Spectators booed the team, and one threw a dead bird at Spurrier <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>returned</b> to the locker room after the game. Buccaneer defenders found some consolation in having held the AFC’s top offensive team to only 13 points.
