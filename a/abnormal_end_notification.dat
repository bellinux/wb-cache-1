40|$|Rapid {{convergence}} to {{a desired}} allocation of network resources to endpoint traffic has been a long-standing challenge for packet-switched networks. The {{reason for this is}} that congestion control decisions are distributed across the endpoints, which vary their offered load in response to changes in application demand and network feedback on a packet-by-packet basis. We propose a different approach for datacenter networks, flowlet control, in which congestion control decisions are made at the granularity of a flowlet, not a packet. With flowlet control, allocations have to change only when flowlets arrive or leave. We have implemented this idea in a system called Flowtune using a centralized allocator that receives flowlet start and <b>end</b> <b>notifications</b> from endpoints. The allocator computes optimal rates using a new, fast method for network utility maximization, and updates endpoint congestion-control parameters. Experiments show that Flowtune outperforms DCTCP, pFabric, sfqCoDel, and XCP on tail packet delays in various settings, converging to optimal rates within a few packets rather than over several RTTs. Our implementation of Flowtune handles 10. 4 x more throughput per core and scales to 8 x more cores than Fastpass, for an 83 -fold throughput gain...|$|R

5000|$|Optimizer - Capex's IBM COBOL Compiler optimizer using Peephole {{optimization}} - This product had {{two significant}} additional components: The first was called Analyzer, {{and the second}} was called Detector. The former allowed execution analysis giving a count {{of the number of}} times program instructions were executed. This provided a way for the COBOL computer programmer to move source code so the most frequently executed conditions would be found first, thus saving time on needless IF statements. While this may not be significant for a few hundred input file records, it was very important when there were millions of input records. The latter, Detector, trapped execution [...] "abends" [...] (<b>abnormal</b> <b>ends)</b> to the execution of an instruction, displayed the contents of applicable fields, and could be told to apply a fix to the offending field so program execution could continue. The programmer could then correct one or more error conditions later and recompile the program. Both were substantial time savers in IBM mainframe OS/MVS and DOS/VSE COBOL environments. Computer Associates subsequently developed an additional product called CA-OPTIMIZER II for the OS/MVS operating system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Due {{to highly}} dynamic nature of Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANET), predictability {{and design of}} efficient protocols and methodology to handle congestion proves to be a tedious task. Since issues and architecture of mobile ad hoc networks are very much different from their counterparts, so are its congestion control strategies due to frequent changes in network’s topology. A noted congestion control mechanism is to notify source for the congestion in the network so that either it may pacify the transmission rate or look for an alternative option. It must be noted down that all the existing methodologies are capable to tell the source about the congestion problem as they use TCP. But in case of MANET, the packet losses due to link failure (due to its dynamic nature) are misinterpreted as packet losses due to congestion, and in the snapshot of a timeout, backing-off its RTO. This results in needless reduction of transmission speed due to which throughput of the whole network degrades. In this paper, we compare various congestion control mechanism used in MANET such as TCP Tahoe, TCP-Reno,TCP New Reno, TCP SACK, TCP FACK, TCP Vegas. Along with the above specified APCC, RED and strategical RED approach to handle congestion is also illustrated. The same is tried to resolve by using concept of explicit congestion Notification (ECN) which is an extension to transmission control protocol (TCP) and allows <b>end</b> to <b>end</b> <b>notification</b> of network congestion without dropping packets which is done conventionally in TCP/IP networks with a bit difference of additional bit and other methodologies available for the same have been discussed...|$|R

Objective: To evaluate whether this metabolite score can predict 3 -year neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with perinatal asphyxia and HIE, compared with current standard biochemical and clinical markers. Methods: From September 2009 to June 2011, infants at risk of perinatal asphyxia were recruited from a single maternity hospital. Cord blood was drawn and biobanked at delivery. Neonates were monitored for development of encephalopathy both clinically and electrographically. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 36 - 42 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, ed. III (BSID-III). Death and cerebral palsy were also considered as <b>abnormal</b> <b>end</b> points. Results: Thirty-one infants had both metabolomic analysis and neurodevelopmental outcome at 36 - 42 months. No child had a severely abnormal BSID-III result. The metabolite index significantly correlated with outcome (ρ 2 = 0. 30, p 3 ̆c 0. 01), which is robust to predict both severe outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0. 92, p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and intact survival (0. 80, p = 0. 01). There was no correlation between the index score and performance in the individual BSID-III subscales (cognitive, language, motor). Conclusions: The metabolite index outperformed other standard biochemical markers at birth for prediction of outcome at 3 years, but was not superior to EEG or the Sarnat score. © 2016 S.

40|$|An ideal {{datacenter}} network {{should allow}} operators to specify policy for resource allocation between users or applications, while providing several properties, including low median and tail latency, high utilization (throughput), and congestion (loss) avoidance. Current datacenter networks inherit {{the principles that}} went into the design of the Internet, where packet transmission and path selection decisions are distributed among the endpoints and routers, which impede obtaining the desired properties. Instead, we propose that a centralized controller should tightly regulate senders' use of the network according to operator policy, and evaluate two architectures: Fastpass and Flowtune. In Fastpass, the controller decides when each packet should be transmitted and what path it should follow. Fastpass incorporates two fast algorithms: the first determines the time at which each packet should be transmitted, while the second determines the path to use for that packet. We deployed and evaluated Fastpass in a portion of Facebook's datacenter network. Our results show that Fastpass achieves high throughput comparable to current networks at a 240 x reduction is queue lengths, achieves much fairer and consistent flow throughputs than the baseline TCP, scales to schedule 2. 21 Terabits/s of traffic in software on eight cores, and achieves a 2. 5 x {{reduction in the number of}} TCP retransmissions in a latency-sensitive service at Facebook. In Flowtune, congestion control decisions are made at the granularity of a flowlet, not a packet, so allocations change only when flowlets arrive or leave. The centralized allocator receives flowlet start and <b>end</b> <b>notifications</b> from endpoints, and computes optimal rates using a new, fast method for network utility maximization. A normalization algorithm ensures allocations do not exceed link capacities. Flowtune updates rate allocations for 4600 servers in 31 ps regardless of link capacities. Experiments show that Flowtune outperforms DCTCP, pFabric, sfqCoDel, and XCP on tail packet delays in various settings, and converges to optimal rates within a few packets rather than over several RTTs.

40|$|Abstract Background Unlike {{maternal}} inheritance of mitochondria in sexual reproduction, somatic hybrids follow no obvious pattern. The introgressed segment orf 138 from the mitochondrial genome of radish (Raphanus sativus) to its counterpart in rapeseed (Brassica napus) demonstrates that this inheritance mode {{derives from the}} cytoplasm of both parents. Sequencing of the complete mitochondrial genome of five species from Brassica family allowed the prediction of other extraneous sources of the cybrids from the radish parent, and the determination of their mitochondrial rearrangement. Results We obtained the complete mitochondrial genome of Ogura -cms-cybrid (oguC) rapeseed. To date, {{this is the first}} time that a heterogeneously composed mitochondrial genome was sequenced. The 258, 473 bp master circle constituted of 33 protein-coding genes, 3 rRNA sequences, and 23 tRNA sequences. This mitotype noticeably holds two copies of atp 9 and is devoid of cox 2 - 2. Relative to nap mitochondrial genome, 40 point mutations were scattered in the 23 protein-coding genes. atp 6 even has an abnormal start locus whereas tatC has an <b>abnormal</b> <b>end</b> locus. The rearrangement of the 22 syntenic regions that comprised 80. 11 % of the genome was influenced by short repeats. A pair of large repeats (9731 bp) was responsible for the multipartite structure. Nine unique regions were detected when compared with other published Brassica mitochondrial genome sequences. We also found six homologous chloroplast segments (Brassica napus). Conclusions The mitochondrial genome of oguC is quite divergent from nap and pol, which are more similar with each other. We analyzed the unique regions of every genome of the Brassica family, and found that very few segments were specific for these six mitotypes, especially cam, jun, and ole, which have no specific segments at all. Therefore, we conclude that the most specific regions of oguC possibly came from radish. Compared with the chloroplast genome, six identical regions were found in the seven mitochondrial genomes, which show that the Brassica family has a stable chloroplast-derived source. </p...|$|R

40|$|Physician-patient {{relationship}} {{is unique in}} some aspects and not-so-unique in other aspects {{when compared to other}} human interactions. Until-unless for the sake of health promotional activities, this {{relationship is}} almost always conceived in the times of human sufferings and consequently culminated when those sufferings have subsided as well as sought out happiness has ensued/been achieved. However, not all physician-patient relationships follow the normal course and/or meet the natural <b>ends.</b> These <b>abnormal</b> relationships are not inconsequential in terms of numbers and/or their effects (short-term and long term) on both patients and physicians. Every country has its own baggage in the wake of why, how and what about these <b>abnormal</b> <b>ends</b> to physician-patient relationships; however, the most common causes are the patients’ inability to pay their medical bills, the conflicting goals of physicians and their patients in regards to patients’ sufferings’ management and finally the behavioral issues (patients’ and/or physicians’) interfering these relationships. Irrespective of any cause, the physicians should never forget that the patient can always discharge their physicians and discontinue their relationship with their physicians without any reason (until unless the physicians deem those patients either incapable/non-consentable to do so and/or potential threat to their own personal safety or other people’s safety). Contrarily, physicians can also discharge patients from their care but cannot abandon these patients (1 - 3) which mean that physicians have to ensure their discharged patients either are referred to or have sought another physician within appropriate time frame post-relationship-discontinuation. Each country has their own medico-legal liabilities that vary in terms of penalties imposed; however, irrespective of the feared legal concerns, the physicians should not forget that ethical essence of medicine is the art of healing that does not encompass part of deserting patients but rather appropriate transferring of patient care to accepting/receptive fellow brethren/colleagues. The transfer of care does not mean that a particular physician has failed to perform his/her duties for his/her patients rather that the particular relationship with a particular patient has failed to meet its ends. Therefore without abandoning the patient, the patient is given ample and honest opportunity to be transferred out to another physician with the sincere hope that the discharged patient will be able to achieve relief of his/her suffering with the new physician-patient relationship meeting their goals and means-to-the-ends. The one thing that need not be forgotten is that the terminated physician-patient relationship can always be revived if the causative concerns have been resolved in the interim and if the medico-legal laws and ethical practices allow the relationships’ revival. In summary, it is prerogative of the patient (whose suffering made him/her to reach out to a physician and enter in a physician-patient relationship in the first place) when he/she wants to and decides to terminate physician-patient relationship; whereas the prerogative of the physician is to recognize a dysfunctional physician-patient relationship early-on so that corrective measures (if possible) can be executed, and if that is not possible, then instead of patient abandonment, patients may be appropriately and timely transferred out off failed physician-patient relationship...|$|R

This study was taken up to evaluate {{the effect of a}} dialysis session on plasma BCAA&#x 2019;s for which fifteen patients of ESRD on Maintenance HD, thrice a week were recruited into the study.

Plasma BCAA&#x 2019;s were estimated by Reverse phase High performance liquid chromatography using pre column derivatization with O-pthalaldehyde-Mercaptoethanol. A significant decrease in plasma concentration of Valine and Isoleucine were observed post-HD compared to the pre-HD levels (p&#x 3 c; 0. 05). After correcting the data by creatinine, the decrease in plasma concentrations of Valine and Isoleucine were still found to be statistically significant.

Recurrent wheezing episodes, brassy cough, chronic stridor, vomiting, and dysphagia are the main presenting {{signs and symptoms of}} pulmonary artery sling. PAS diagnosis is rare for recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Due to abnormal course of the left pulmonary artery it presses over trachea or right pulmonary artery. The presentation of this case was considered for its atypical anatomy and clinical presentation. (Journal of Current Pediatrics 2013; 11 : 81 - 4...|$|R
40|$|M. Phil. This {{dissertation}} {{provides an}} overview {{on the problem of}} electronic component obsolescence from a military product support perspective. By assessing applicable literature as well as feedback and lessons learned from relevant support projects, a strategy for the management of component obsolescence is proposed. The aim of the research is to provide a definition of component obsolescence drivers and to formulate a strategy for the management of component obsolescence within a military electronic support environment. The strategy will give guidelines on how management activities can be optimised to reduce applicable obsolescence risks and thereby reducing related life cycle costs. In order to implement a successful obsolescence management process (OMP), the following approach is proposed: Ensure that the drivers of component obsolescence and the possible impact there of will be made visible to applicable levels of management. Promote an environment where obsolescence management {{is an integral part of}} the system engineering process so as to optimise the rapid electronic development process whilst also keeping support expenditure within acceptable limits. Encourage projects to support a process that is directed at addressing obsolescence risks applicable to that project. Introduce OMP as an important part of the Through Life Support (TLS) planning of projects. Materials management should be encouraged to implement a process where interfacing with suppliers will address obsolescence risks. This typically includes a feedback loop regarding component usage patterns, component <b>end</b> of production <b>notifications,</b> component substitutions and other related component supplier information. Adequate funding must be allocated to ensure that obsolescence risks and activities can be addressed cost effectively over the complete life cycle of the product or system from initial design to end of support...|$|R

In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) {{were randomly assigned to}} functional testing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-based diagnostic test reports were classified as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely <b>abnormal.</b> The primary <b>end</b> point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26. 1 months. Both the prevalence of normal test results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional testing (33. 4 % versus 78. 0 %, and 0. 9 % versus 2. 1 %, respectively; both P 10 %) who had a normal functional test were reclassified as being mildly abnormal, the discriminatory capacity improved to 0. 69 (95 % CI, 0. 64 - 0. 74). Coronary CTA, by identifying patients at risk because of nonobstructive CAD, provides better prognostic information than functional testing in contemporary patients who have stable chest pain with a low burden of obstructive CAD, myocardial ischemia, and events.

40|$|AbstractIn a Phase 1 trial, we {{evaluated}} {{the safety of}} AERAS- 402, an adenovirus 35 -vectored TB vaccine candidate expressing 3 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) immunodominant antigens, in subjects with and without latent Mtb infection. HIV-negative, BCG-vaccinated Kenyan adults without evidence of tuberculosis, 10 QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-G) (−) and 10 QFT-G(+), were randomized 4 : 1 to receive AERAS- 402 or placebo as two doses, on Days 0 and 56, with follow up to Day 182. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or withdrawals. For 1 AERAS- 402 QFT-G(−) and 1 AERAS- 402 QFT-G(+) subject, there were 3 self-limiting severe AEs of injection site pain: 1 after the first vaccination and 1 after each vaccination, respectively. Two additional severe AEs considered vaccine-related were reported after the first vaccination in AERAS- 402 QFT-G(+) subjects: elevated blood creatine phosphokinase and neutropenia, the latter slowly improving but remaining <b>abnormal</b> until study <b>end.</b> AERAS- 402 was not detected in urine or throat cultures for any subject. In intracellular cytokine staining studies, curtailed by technical issues, we saw modest CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses to Mtb Ag 85 A/b peptide pools among both QFT-G(−) and (+) subjects, with trends in the CD 4 + T cells suggestive of boosting after the second vaccine dose, slightly more so in QFT-G(+) subjects. CD 4 + and CD 8 + responses to Mtb antigen TB 10. 4 were minimal. Increases in Adenovirus 35 neutralizing antibodies from screening to end of study, seen in 50 % of AERAS- 402 recipients, were mostly minimal. This small study confirms acceptable safety and tolerability profiles for AERAS- 402, in line with other Phase 1 studies of AERAS- 402, now to include QFT-G(+) subjects...|$|R
