5|$|Macedonia's {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991, {{but it did not}} take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it. A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia, and busloads of soldiers' parents, funded by the Macedonian government, travelled to Montenegro to find their sons <b>and</b> <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> home. Meanwhile, Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia. The commander of JNA forces in {{the first phase of the}} battle, Gen.

Miroslav Stojanovski, became the focus of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle.|$|E
