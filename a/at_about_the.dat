5|$|<b>At</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{time of his}} {{union with}} Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. With {{powerful}} maritime forces at his command, Echmarcach would have certainly been regarded as an important potential ally. Clear evidence of an alliance between Echmarcach and the Uí Briain is preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, to Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (died 1086). Annalistic evidence of such an alliance is found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the Uí Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), to the kingship of the Isles <b>at</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> turn of the twelfth century.|$|E
