The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> can be expressed as the angle between a horizontal plane representing the Earth's surface and the actual flight path followed by the aircraft during its ascent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{speed of}} an {{aircraft}} type {{at which the}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> is largest is called VX. It is always slower than VY, the speed for the best rate of climb.As the latter gives the quickest way for gaining altitude levels, regardless of the distance covered during such a maneuver, it is more relevant to cruising. The maximum <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> {{on the other hand}} is where the aircraft gains the most altitude in a given distance, regardless of the time needed for the maneuver. This is important for clearing an obstacle, and therefore is the speed a pilot uses when executing a [...] "short field" [...] takeoff.VX increases with altitude and VY decreases with altitude until they converge at the airplane's absolute ceiling.|$|E
5000|$|The pilot {{adjusts the}} {{instrument}} {{to indicate the}} edge of the red-white zone during minimum airspeed practice at altitude, indicating the aircraft has zero POWL beyond that point. Since the wing will stall at the same angle of attack at any airspeed, once properly adjusted the LRI will indicate the red-white edge anytime the stall is approached. This includes landing stalls, climbing stalls, and accelerated stalls. After adjustment, the black line {{in the center of the}} white indicates maximum <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> and maximum angle of descent with enough reserve lift for the landing flare. With practice, the pilot can use the LRI to determine the exact moment for liftoff with minimum ground roll and maximum <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> combined.|$|E
40|$|Most male spiders {{are smaller}} than females; during sexual maturity, males change their behaviour, abandoning their web or nest to seek out {{receptive}} females actively, whereas females stalk prey near their web or nest and tend not {{to move away from}} it. Considering this behavioural difference to be associated with increased locomotor activity at maturity, it may be hypothesized that males will have traits that increase locomotor performance. The present study examines the kinetics and energetics of the movements of the mygalomorph spider Grammostola rosea Walckenaer, a large spider with sexual size dimorphism. It is found that males have a higher maximum aerobic speed, average speed, distance travelled and critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> than females, indicating better performance. Males also have lower costs of transport than females. These results support the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in wandering spiders with active males, which are characterized by smaller body size and longer legs than the larger and more static females, is associated with low transport cost, high velocity and better locomotor performance...|$|R

He might with propriety have portrayed the {{suffering}} and loss of the poor farmer who was his client; he merely quoted from the doctor's testimony to the effect that Mr. Meader would never again be able to do physical labour of the sort by which he had supported himself, and ended up by calling the attention of the jury to the photographs and plans of the crossing he had obtained two days after the accident, requesting them to note the facts that the public highway, approaching through a dense forest and underbrush at an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> thirty-three degrees, <b>climbed</b> the railroad embankment at that point, and a train could not be seen until the horse was actually on the track.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the design was the {{aircraft}}s method <b>of</b> <b>climbing.</b> In most aircraft designs, climb is achieved (without change in engine power) by pitching the aircraft so that the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack of the wings increases, thereby increasing lift. The Poussin, however, was designed to climb by lowering specially-designed flaps and trimming the tailplane to balance out any change in pitch, therefore allowing the aircraft to achieve its maximum rate <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> while keeping the fuselage within 4° of level. The extra drag created by the lowered flaps was balanced by drag saved by keeping the fuselage level.|$|R

As a dedicated interceptor, the F4D was unsuited to the multi-mission capabilities soon in demand, so it had a short career in Navy and Marine Corps service, the last aircraft being withdrawn from service in 1964. Four aircraft were used by NACA (soon to be NASA) until 1969.|$|E
50|$|In takeoff {{and landing}} {{operations}} from short runways, such as Naval Aircraft Carrier operations and STOL back country flying, aircraft may {{be equipped with}} angle of attack or Lift Reserve Indicators. These indicators measure the angle of attack (AOA) or the Potential of Wing Lift (POWL, or Lift Reserve) directly and help the pilot fly close to the stalling point with greater precision. STOL operations require the aircraft {{to be able to}} operate close to the critical angle of attack during landings and at the best <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> during takeoffs. Angle of attack indicators are used by pilots for maximum performance during these maneuvers since airspeed information is only indirectly related to stall behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|Operations with {{transport}} category aircraft employ {{the concept of}} the takeoff V-Speeds, V1, VR and V2. These speeds are determined not only by the above factors affecting takeoff performance, but also by the length and slope of the runway and any peculiar conditions, such as obstacles off the end of the runway. Below V1, in case of critical failures, the takeoff should be aborted; above V1 the pilot continues the takeoff and returns for landing. After the co-pilot calls V1, he/she will call VR or [...] "rotate," [...] marking speed at which to rotate the aircraft. The VR for {{transport category}} aircraft is calculated such as to allow the aircraft to reach the regulatory screen height at V2 with one engine failed. Then, V2 (the safe takeoff speed) is called. This speed must be maintained after an engine failure to meet performance targets for rate of climb and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The J8M {{took to the}} air for {{its first}} powered flight on 7 July 1945, with Lieutenant Commander Toyohiko Inuzuka at the controls; after his [...] "sharp start" [...] rocket-powered takeoff, Inuzuka {{successfully}} jettisoned the dolly upon becoming airborne and began to gain speed, climbing skywards at a 45° angle. At an altitude of 400 m, the engine stopped abruptly and the J8M1 stalled. Inuzuka managed to glide the aircraft back, but clipped a small building {{at the edge of}} the airfield while trying to land, causing the aircraft to burst into flames. Inuzuka died the next day. While Mitsubishi and naval technicians sought to find the cause of the accident, all future flights were grounded. The engine cutout had occurred because the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> coupled with the fuel tanks being half-filled for this first flight, caused a shifting of the fuel, which in turn caused an auto cutout device to activate because of an air lock in the fuel line. Requests to continue flight testing were denied pending the modification of the fuel pumps in the aircraft. The sixth and seventh prototypes were to be fitted with the modified Ro.2 engine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{performance}} of the Me 163 far exceeded that of contemporary piston engine fighters. At a speed of over 320 km/h the aircraft would take off, in a so-called scharfer Start ("sharp start", with [...] "Start" [...] being the German word for [...] "take-off") from the ground, from its two-wheeled dolly. The aircraft would be kept at level flight at low altitude until the best climbing speed of around 676 km/h was reached, at which point it would jettison the dolly, retract its extendable skid using a knob-topped release lever just forward of the throttle [...] (as both levers were located atop the cockpit's portside 120 litre T-Stoff oxidizer tank) that engaged the aforementioned pneumatic cylinder, and then pull up into a 70° <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> to a bomber's altitude. It could go higher if required, reaching 12000 m in an unheard of three minutes. Once there, it would level off and quickly accelerate to speeds around 880 km/h or faster, which no Allied fighter could match. The usable Mach number {{was similar to that}} of the Me 262, but because of the high thrust-to-drag ratio, it was much easier for the pilot to lose track of the onset of severe compressibility and risk loss of control. A Mach warning system was installed as a result. The aircraft was remarkably agile and docile to fly at high speed. According to Rudolf Opitz, chief test pilot of the Me 163, it could [...] "fly circles around any other fighter of its time".|$|E
40|$|Hypertensive {{disorders}} in pregnancy {{are a major}} cause of maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. The main reason for this in around 2 % of all pregnancies is pre-eclampsia. The object {{of this study was to}} establish whether the depth of a notch (defined as notch index) and the size of the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> of the envelope-curve in the sonogram of—one or both—uterine arteries, provides predictive parameters for a hypertensive disorder during pregnancy and/or a growth restriction. This involved the retrospective study of 119 pregnant women with bilateral uterine artery notch in the 19 th to 40 th GW in the maternity unit of Neukölln Hospital in Berlin. All were single pregnancies only. We analysed how many of the women with bilateral notch had an abnormal pregnancy—defined as SIH, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and HELLP syndrome—and how many exhibited intrauterine growth restriction (birth weight < 10 th percentile). The notch index (NI) is calculated from the ratio of the difference between the distance B–A and the distance B, it is dimensionless (NI=B-A/B). B is the distance in centimetres from the punctum maximum of diastole at the curve envelope and the flatline. A represents the distance in centimetres from the punctum minimum of diastole at the curve envelope and the flatline. The systolic <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> at the envelope curve of the sonogram of the uterine artery was also measured in degrees. It could be shown that pregnant women who presented with bilateral notch had abnormal pregnancies, i. e. either a hypertensive pregnancy disorder and/or a child with restricted growth (66 %). There was a significant correlation between the notch index and abnormal maternal pregnancy outcome in respect of the development of a hypertensive pregnancy disorder (p= 0. 008). Particularly significant was the result p= 0. 001 for the development of pre-eclampsia. A steep systolic <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> was also linked to a pathological maternal pregnancy outcome (p= 0. 004). There was, however, no correlation between the notch index (p= 0. 131) and the systolic <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> (p= 0. 138) in respect of a growth restriction. Neither the notch index, nor the systolic <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> provided threshold values for the development of a maternal or child pathology. This result emphasises the fact that notch depth should be taken as a key parameter for identifying a pre-eclampsia. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> however, has no impact as indicator. Neither notch index nor systolic <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> play any role in predicting an increased growth restriction risk...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{morphological}} {{types of}} shadow dunes, tongues and ridges, were observed {{after a recent}} storm {{on the west coast}} of Jylland, Denmark. Sand-shadow tongues form where vegetation is a weak obstruction to the sand-transporting wind, whereas sand-shadow ridges form behind vegetated coastal dunes, which intemcct more effectively with the wind. The sand-shadow tongues consist of low- to medium-angle-dipping strata, which dip in a uniform direction and reflect almost uninterrupted downwind transport of sand. The longitudinal ridges consist of medium- to high-angle cross-strata which are bidi-rectional and reflect secondary winds that blow obliquely towards the crest line of the dune. Three kinds of oppositely dipping cross-strata occur: 1) tepee-like cross-strata, 2) chevron-like cross-strata with both "'stoss"-side and "lee"-side laminae preserved ("double bundles"), and 3) chevron-like cross-strata with only "'lee"-side laminae preserved. Tepee-like cross-strata form during vertical accretion of the dune ridge, whereas the chevron-like pattern forms when the dune crest migrates from side to side. If the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> of the "stoss' " side is supereritical, "stoss"-side laminae are preserved and "double bundles " are formed. The cross-strata contain a significant amount of plane-bed stratification due to their formation during high-wind velocities...|$|E
40|$|The {{most extreme}} climate {{transitions}} in Earth history are {{recorded by the}} juxtaposition of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits with overlying cap carbonate beds. Some {{of the most remarkable}} sedimentary structures within these beds are sharp-crested (trochoidal) bedforms with regular spacing of as much as several meters that are often interpreted as giant wave ripples formed under extreme wave conditions in a nonuniform postglacial climate. Here we evaluate this hypothesis using a new bedform stability diagram for symmetric oscillatory flows that indicates that the first-order control on the formation of trochoidal rather than hummocky bedforms is sediment size, not wave climate. New measurements of bedform wavelengths and particle sizes from the ca. 635 Ma Nuccaleena Formation, Australia, indicate that the giant ripples are generally composed of coarse to very coarse sand; most are within the trochoidal bedform stability phase space for normal wave climates. Moreover, numerical simulations of flow over fixed bedforms show that symmetric trochoidal ripples with a nearly vertical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> may be produced over long time periods with variable wave climates in conjunction with rapid seabed cementation. These data reveal that, rather than extreme wave conditions, the giant wave ripples are a consequence of the unusual mode of carbonate precipitation during a global carbon cycle perturbation unprecedented in Earth history...|$|E

The vehicle control and navigation technique is implemented using a two-mode controller consisting of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic control.

40|$|Abstract. Climbing ripples {{characterize}} {{a variety}} of sedimentary depositional settings in which suspension sedimentation exceeds the rate of traction transport, but are poorly documented from tidal environments. Research within a modem macrotidal estuary (Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel, France) demonstrates that this form of stratification is very common and also closely associated with tidal dynamics along the fluvio-tidal transition zone of macrotidal estuaries. Flood- and ebb-dominated climbing ripple facies (CRF) have been distinguished. Successive climbing ripple units are up 10 cm in thickness. Flood dominated CRF are associated with tidal channel levees found in the inner/straight channel zone of the fluvio-estuarine transition. In thicker CRF units, sedimentary structures indicate very high suspended sediment loads and rapidly decelerating flow velocity. Ebb-dominated CRF are found in chute channels and chute bars associated with the meandering zone of the fluvial-estuarine transition. The role of tidal dynamics {{in the formation of}} these CRF, both flood- and ebb-dominated, is indicated by the vedical organization and thickness evolution of the successive climbing ripple units. They are frequently ananged in packages of strata which thicken and thin progressively. These packages are tidal rhy{hmites and correspond to the sedimentary record of the neap-spring-neap cycle. The increasing energy from neap to spring tides is indicated by an overall decreasing <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> in the generalized bedding sequence (progradation is dominant), whereas the decreasing energy from spring to neap is evidenced by an increase of this angle (vertical accretion is dominant).

40|$|Data {{derived from}} core and well-logs are {{essentially}} one-dimensional and determining eolian system type and likely {{dimensions and orientation}} of architectural elements present in subsurface eolian reservoir successions is typically not possible from direct observation alone. This is problematic because accurate predictions of the three-dimensional distribution of interdune and dune-plinth elements that commonly form relatively low-permeability baffles to flow, of net:gross, and of the likely distribution of elements with common porosity-permeability properties {{at a variety of}} scales in eolian reservoirs is crucial for effective reservoir characterization. Direct measurement of a variety of parameters relating to aspects of the architecture of eolian elements preserved as ancient outcropping successions has enabled the establishment of a series of empirical relationships with which to make first-order predictions of a range of architectural parameters from subsurface successions that are not observable directly in core. In many preserved eolian dune successions, the distribution of primary lithofacies types tends to occur in a predictable manner for different types of dune sets, whereby the pattern of distribution of grain-flow, wind-ripple, and grain-fall strata can be related to set architecture, which itself can be related back to original bedform type. Detailed characterization of individual eolian dune sets and relationships between neighboring dune and interdune elements has been undertaken through outcrop studies of the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone and the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone in southern Utah. The style of transition between lithofacies types seen vertically in preserved sets, and therefore measurable in analogous core intervals, enables predictions to be made regarding the relationship between preserved set thickness, individual grain-flow thickness, original bedform dimensional properties (e. g., wavelength and height), the likely proportion of the original bedform that is preserved to form a set, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> of the system, and the likely along-crest variability of facies distributions in sets generated by the migration of sinuous-crested bedforms.

40|$|Using recent {{advances}} in the stability analysis of current ripples, a new model for the calculation of duration of sediment deposition from decelerating high-density turbidity currents is proposed. The model, named TDURE, refines a duration model proposed by Allen (1991) (J. Sediment. Petrol. 61, 291 - 295) by calculating the accumulation time of the rippled T(c) -division separately from the massive and plane parallel-laminated T(ab) -divisions in Bouma-type turbidites. TDURE consists of three modules. In the first module, the accumulation time for the T(a) - and T(b) -divisions is approximated by assuming a linear decrease in sedimentation rate with height in the turbidite. As in the original model, a straight line is fitted through inferred sedimentation rates at the T(ab) - and T(bc) -boundaries. In the second module, <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> of ripples, thickness of the T(c) -division and grain size distribution are used in empirical relationships between ripple migration rate and a grain-related mobility parameter to estimate the accumulation time of the T(c) -division. In the third module, the expected development of ripple size across the T(c) -division is calculated using empirical relationships between rate of development of ripple height and grain-related mobility parameter, and subsequently compared with the observed development of ripple size in the turbidite. In this way, {{the accuracy of the}} accumulation time calculated in module 2 can be verified independently. TDURE was tested using Bouma-type turbidites from the Doheny Channel (Capistrano Fm., CA, USA) and the Flysch di Motta (Calabria, Italy). Accumulation times of 12 and 10. 75 min for the T(c) -division, and 19 and 16 min for the T(abc) -sequence were calculated for the Doheny Channel and the Flysch di Motta turbidites, respectively. Although module 3 underestimates the rate of development of current ripples near the T(bc) -boundary in both beds, ripple size at the T(cd) -boundary is calculated accurately. The underestimation of development rate may be caused by differences between flow conditions in experimental flumes on which the model calculations are based and turbidity-current dynamics.
