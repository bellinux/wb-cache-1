We conduct two experiments to show that the <b>social</b> <b>and</b> ideal <b>social</b> SC effects are stronger than the actual and ideal SC effects for individuals with a dominant interdependent self-construal. In Study 1, using samples from collectivistic cultures, four SC effects are compared. In Study 2, we examine how primed self-construal, whether independent or interdependent, impacts the four SC effects.
