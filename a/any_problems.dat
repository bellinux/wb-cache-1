He hated his small Delta region {{hometown}} because of its predominantly black population. He had never had <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> with the law prior to the alleged Obama plot. He had a strong affinity for drinking and smoking.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese never {{spotted the}} D-21B. The first one failed {{to turn around}} and {{continued}} straight on, crashing somewhere in the Soviet Union. Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct <b>any</b> <b>problems.</b> The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor and back to the recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E

5|$|In October 1857, an {{expedition}} led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Los Angeles, California. From Fort Smith, his journey continued through Fort Defiance, Arizona, before crossing the Colorado near Needles, California. This route {{became known as}} Beale's Wagon Road, and the location where Beale crossed the river as Beale's Crossing. Beale's journal and subsequent report to the United States Secretary of War did not mention <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> with Irataba and the Mohave, but an assistant named Humphrey Stacy recorded that the Mohave had prevented Beale from traveling downriver.|$|E
5|$|October 29, 2012– Hurricane Sandy makes {{landfall}} {{north of}} the state. However, due to the tremendous size of the storm, its effects were felt all over Maryland. During {{the peak of the}} storm, 60mph sustained winds were felt from Frederick, Maryland eastward. However, power outages were not widespread and <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> were solved quickly due to better preparation. Heavy rain affected the state, with up to a foot of rain falling in some spots. Storm surge was also a large factor along the beaches, washing out many piers and some boardwalks along Ocean City. Hurricane Sandy is the deadliest tropical cyclone to affect the state, causing 11 deaths.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, Barrett {{instructed}} Colonel David Branson of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry {{to attack}} the Confederate encampment at Brazos Santiago Depot near Fort Brown. Barrett commanded the 62nd United States Colored Infantry and the 2nd Texas Cavalry, and advanced towards Fort Brown {{with the intention of}} reoccupying Brownsville with Union forces thinking they would not encounter <b>any</b> <b>problems,</b> assuming all the Confederates surely had heard of Lee's surrender by this time. To their surprise they encountered Confederates that did not know of Lee's surrender.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{complexity}} classes QZK and HVQZK of problems having a quantum computational zero-knowledge proof system and an honest-verifier quantum computational zero-knowledge proof system, respectively. The results proved {{in this paper}} include: (a) HVQZK = QZK, (b) <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in QZK has a public-coin quantum computational zero-knowledge proof system, (c) <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in QZK has a quantum computational zero-knowledge proof system of perfect completeness, and (d) <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in QZK has a three-message public-coin quantum computational zero-knowledge proof system of perfect completeness with arbitrarily small constant error in soundness. All the results above are unconditional and do not rely any computational assumptions. For the classes QPZK, HVQPZK, and QSZK of problems having a quantum perfect zero-knowledge proof system, an honest-verifier quantum perfect zero-knowledge proof system, and a quantum statistical zero-knowledge proof system, respectively, the following new properties are proved: (e) HVQPZK = QPZK, (f) <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in QPZK has a public-coin quantum perfect zero-knowledge proof system, (g) <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in QSZK has a quantum statistical zero-knowledge proof system of perfect completeness, and (h) <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in QSZK has a three-message public-coin quantum statistical zero-knowledge proof system of perfect completeness with arbitrarily small constant error in soundness. It is stressed that our proofs are direct and do not use complete promise problems or those equivalents. This gives a unified framework that works well for all of quantum perfect, statistical, and computational zero-knowledge proofs, and enables us to prove properties even on the computational and perfect zero-knowledge proofs for which no complete promise problems are known.

5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived that there was <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E
5|$|In 1929–30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, Ann is {{hired by}} a wealthy and {{sophisticated}} aristocrat (Umbers) {{to act as}} a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff—led by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper—and then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely hoping that he will visit.|$|E

5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, {{which has a}} mass of 16 short tons. It was installed {{with the use of}} the shuttle's robotic Canadarm, controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without <b>any</b> <b>problems.</b> While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{handrail}} was removed, Massimino {{went to work}} attaching the capture plate, but ran into additional problems when the battery {{in one of his}} power tools failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without <b>any</b> <b>problems,</b> but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E
5|$|Rough {{surf and}} {{moderate}} winds from the hurricane capsized several ships along the East Coast of the United States; 30people were left missing and presumed killed from a shipwreck in Chincoteague, Virginia. Along the coast, 57people died {{due to the}} storm. In New Jersey, the hurricane caused heavy damage, particularly near the coast and in Atlantic City. Dozens of buildings were damaged or destroyed, and damage across the state totaled $8million (1903USD). In New York City, high winds disrupted traffic, closed businesses, and overturned wagons, with many windows and roofs damaged. On Long Island, President Theodore Roosevelt directly experienced {{the effects of the}} hurricane while on a yacht. The life of the president was briefly threatened by the rough conditions, though none on board the yacht suffered <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> from the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Submarine Corporation {{construction}} {{facility was}} established on previously undeveloped {{land on the}} bank of the Port River, at Osborne, South Australia. Work on the site began on 29 June 1987, and it was opened in November 1989. South Australia was selected as the site of the construction facility based on the proposed location of the facility and promises by the State Government to help minimise <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> caused by workers unions. The state's bid was aided by careful promotion to both Kockums and IKL/HDW during early in the project, and problems with the other states' proposals: Tasmania and Western Australia lacked the necessary industrial base, New South Wales could not decide on the location of the construction facility, Victoria's proposed site was poorly sited, and building in Liberal-led Queensland would have been politically unwise for the project when Labor was in power both federally and in all other states.|$|E

He spends his time with many fellow attendees, some of which live in the nearby dormitory, and enjoys helping them with <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> they may have. His childhood friend Mariya Mikado attends the school with him, and helps in his female transition.

Mizuho meets a classmate named Shion Jujo who has a silent voice and demeanor; she quickly figures out that Mizuho is actually a boy, but tells no one. The previous year, she had to be hospitalized soon after she was elected as the Elder due to an illness.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be <b>any</b> <b>problems,</b> and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
