5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This leads to an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E
5|$|After {{driving home}} from work, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{is struck by}} a drunk driver and transported to a hospital, where she is {{examined}} by Dr. Preijers (Jack Blessing) and Nurse Edwards; she soon slips into a coma. Reyes, however, wakes up moments later {{in the same room}} all alone. Running to the door, she discovers that the hospital is floating in a dark void. She soon finds two other patients, Stephen Murdoch (Stan Shaw), and Mr. Barreiro (Del Zamora). They assume that they are dead. Reyes, however, maintains that they <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Black Christmas {{has three}} {{alternate}} endings, {{the second of}} which {{was used as the}} actual ending for the UK theatrical release of the movie. In the UK ending, Billy dies on the operating table from his wounds, thus when Kelli kills Agnes, the scene ends there with her parents picking her up from the hospital. The third ending is similar, having Billy die and Kelli's parents picking her up, however his body disappears and the last shot shows someone moving through the vents, indicating that either Agnes or Billy <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> The first ending, which follows the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from someone using Kyle's cellphone.|$|E

5|$|The Fringe team is {{alerted to}} an {{incident}} at a quarantine site, where the amber encasing {{the site has}} been cut into and a body has been removed. They identify the missing body as Joshua Rose, a former bank robber. Joshua had previously caught Fringe Division's attention as he used a molecular destabilization device to break into banks, triggering quarantine-level events. Colonel Broyles is privately cautioned by Walternate that those trapped in amber <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive,</b> a fact {{he does not want}} to be made public for fear of their outcry. Broyles relays this to his team, requesting they find Rose and bring him in as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize {{that all of them}} <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten off the plane. While driving to the hospital, they are involved in a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E
5|$|Following Dana's murder, {{the killer}} uses her {{cellphone}} {{to call the}} girls. Figuring out that something is wrong, they go outside to look for her. There, they discover Eve's decapitated head inside her car. Realizing there is a killer out there, Kelli calls 9-1-1, {{only to be told}} that due to the snowstorm, help would be unavailable for at least two hours. When their housemother Mrs. Mac and Heather decide to take the car and reach the police station on their own, Kelli, Leigh and Melissa all go to Lauren's room to see them through their window and make sure they leave safely. Noticing that the car has started but they're not leaving, Kelli and Leigh go to check on them through the basement where Leigh slips on Mrs. Mac's blood, who had gotten killed by a falling icicle. Going back to Lauren's room, after a quick confrontation between Leigh and Kyle, they realize that Lauren has also been killed and despite protest from Kyle, decide to go to the attic in case any of the girls <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fortunately for the party, {{the reunification}} of worlds has opened the {{pathways}} to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E
5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which {{stems from the fact that}} it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2005, 650,000 Israelis {{had left}} the country for over one year and not returned.

25|$|As our {{television}} sets show bombers preparing for war against Iraq, we survivors of Guernica and Dresden recall our own helplessness and horror {{when we were}} flung into the inferno of bombing—we saw people killed. Suffocated. Crushed. Incinerated. Mothers trying to protect their children with only their bodies. Old people with no strength left to flee from the flames. These pictures <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> in our memory, and our accounts capture indelibly what we went through.|$|E
25|$|The Welsh Indians {{were not}} claimed until later. Morgan Jones' tract {{is the first}} account, and was printed by The Gentleman's Magazine, {{launching}} a slew of publications on the subject. There is no genetic or archaeological evidence that the Mandan {{are related to the}} Welsh, however, and John Evans and Lewis and Clark reported they had found no Welsh Indians. The Mandan <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive</b> today; the tribe was decimated by a smallpox epidemic in 1837–1838 and banded with the nearby Hidatsa and Arikara into the Three Affiliated Tribes.|$|E

As the car is driven uncontrollably down the street, Marge is grabbed through the window of their front door by Freddy's gloved hand and is dragged through it to her apparent death.|$|E
25|$|Some mosquito-{{transmitted}} rabbit viruses {{are only}} transmitted to uninfected rabbits from infected rabbits which <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>alive.</b> This creates a selective pressure on every group of viruses already infecting a rabbit {{not to become}} too virulent and kill their host rabbit before enough mosquitoes have bitten it, since otherwise all the viruses inside the dead rabbit would rot with it. And indeed in natural systems such viruses display much lower virulence levels than do mutants of the same viruses that in laboratory culture readily outcompete non-virulent variants (or than do tick-transmitted viruses since ticks do bite dead rabbits).|$|E
