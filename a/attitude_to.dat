40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of mental health problems in later life, older people markedly underutilize mental health services. A greater awareness of factors influencing older peoples' <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> mental illness may therefore improve awareness and treatment of mental disorders in this population. A mixed methodology approach was used to explore and compare older peoples' <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> mental illness {{in a sample of}} clinical and non-clinical participants. Results indicated that, similar to younger people, older people endorsed a range of positive and negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> mental illness. However, when <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> mental illness were considered within the context of ageing and experience a more complex pattern of results emerged. Although negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> mental illness were associated with negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> ageing across the entire sample, clinical participants (and those with prior experience of mental illness) reported more positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> mental illness and more negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> ageing than non-clinical participants, for whom the reverse was true. Attitudes were also differentially related to health behaviour outcomes. Results suggest that <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> mental illness and ageing may be linked and mediated by personal experience and capacity for psychological self-regulation in the face of age-associated adversity...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to find {{variables}} related <b>to</b> positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> physical education (PE) and strong sense of coherence (SOC) among adolescents. Methods: The study included three parts: seven physical tests; a questionnaire which included ways of living, <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> PE, and subjective health, the 13 -question version of SOC; and information on every student's grades. The study group comprised 301 teenagers (131 girls and 170 boys, aged 16 – 19 years) attending upper secondary school. Positive odds ratio was used in the logistic regression analyses with SOC and <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> PE as dependent variables. Results: Variables related <b>to</b> positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> PE were strong SOC, high physical capacity, high leisure-time physical activity (PA), high grades in PE, and little time spent watching TV. Variables related to strong SOC were positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> PE, high grades in PE, very good subjective health, and feeling comfortable in school. Highest physical capacity, highest mean grades, and highest grades in PE were found among adolescents who reported exercise four times or more per week. Conclusions: An interrelation between <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> PE and SOC was shown. The relation between positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> PE and high scores in SOC indicated that past experiences of PA and PE could contribute to the development of SOC, and actual levels of SOC could influence the persistent <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> PE and be important for lifelong PA. One means of identification of favourable or unfavourable health behaviour among young people might be through PA patterns, and relations between <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> PE and SOC...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Attitudes</b> <b>to</b> aging {{have been}} {{investigated}} in non-carer populations and found to have important relationships with physical and mental health. However, these have not been explored in an older carer sample, although {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to clarify variables which are linked with positive carer outcomes. This {{is one of the first}} studies to report on older carers, their <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> aging, and the relationship with carer-related factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 202 carers with a mean age of 70. 8 years was conducted in Victoria, Australia, using carer demographic data, carer factors such as depression (using the Geriatric Depression Scale), burden (using the Zarit Burden Inventory, ZBI), physical health, personality, and <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> aging (using the <b>Attitudes</b> <b>to</b> Aging Questionnaire, AAQ). Spearman rank correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were used. RESULTS: This study showed that carers had overall positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> aging inspite of their caring role. It also identified that carer factors including depression and burden contributed a significant amount of the variance <b>to</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> aging in terms of physical change and psychosocial loss. Personality traits, specifically neuroticism, and extraversion, were also important contributors <b>to</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> aging. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study demonstrated that inspite of moderate levels of depression and spending significant time caring, carers reported positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> aging.

The study is aiming <b>to</b> examinehow the <b>attitudes</b> are distributed according to sex, educational programmes and urban/ruralliving {{as well as to}} examine how the values, from which the attitudes emanate, are correlatedwith each other. The results show that young female students in theoretical programs and students who livein larger cities are most supportive of nature preservation.

5|$|De la Ferté {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the Air Ministry's <b>attitude</b> <b>to</b> his service. In 1937 several exercises were carried out by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet's defence against submarine and air attack. However, despite the experiences of the First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade protection measures. Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect ASDIC invention which was never intended to detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain's sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty's conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. The saving grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. This {{was one of the few}} successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.|$|E

He convened a meeting of Scottish notables at Lochearn in August 1653. Among those present were John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Archibald Campbell, eldest son of the Marquis of Argyll, Lord Loin, Donald MacDonell of Glengarry, Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, John Graham of Duchray and Colonel Blackadder of Tullyallan. These notables then mustered their vassals and supporters to form a small army of about 60 horse, and a force of foot, made up of 60–80 Lowlanders and 150 Highlanders. The governor of Stirling Castle, Colonel Kidd, sallied out to suppress this force, but was defeated at Aberfoyle.

40|$|Volume 13 of BiAS series {{brings out}} into {{prominence}} {{issues at the}} bottom of dialogue between African and Christian <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> nature. The Shona notion of hierarchy of sacredness of nature as opposed to the intrinsic value of nature forms a barrier to a possible reconciliation between Shona and Christian <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> nature. This is largely {{based on the belief that}} some aspects of nature in Shona are imbued with spirits. Although sacred aspects may be accidentally protected, there is a weakness in the discriminative attitudes that leaves other aspects vulnerable. It appears the Shona have yet to extricate themselves from an ethic based on fear of ancestral spirits to conscious assessment of scientific causes of ecological imbalances. Shona <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> nature fail to take account of the denial of the sacredness of some aspects of nature. The Christian <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> nature on the other hand, propound the doctrine of the equal worth and equal integrity of all aspects of nature, rather than a discriminative sacredness of nature. The attitudes are, however, based on the assumption that nature is purely material. This position results into divergent <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> nature. <b>Attitudes</b> <b>to</b> nature presented from a Christian perspective appear reluctant to identify divinity with natural phenomena. Christianity suggests the idea of creation value to bridge this gap. To this end, the creation value <b>to</b> which Christian <b>attitudes</b> tend <b>to</b> lend support, might well act as common denominator between Shona and Christian <b>attitudes</b> <b>to</b> nature particularly in the light of eco-spirituality and move towards African-Christian environmental ethics...|$|R
