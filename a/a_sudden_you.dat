First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>you</b> put the money involved or the opportunity involved or you put a label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down." [...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal {{in a way to}} the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E

Dandois also said of Kinkade, [...] "Thom would be fine, he would be drinking, {{and then all of}} <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> couldn't tell where the boundary was, and then he became very incoherent, and he would start cussing and doing a lot of weird stuff." [...] In June 2010, Kinkade was arrested in Carmel, California, for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was later convicted.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{was often}} seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and {{imposing}} figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. [...] "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," [...] biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were {{and used it to}} his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, [...] "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." [...] At [...] tall, Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as [...] "The Johnson Treatment". A contemporary writes, [...] "It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on you, all of <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you." ...|$|E

6000|$|His meek {{tone was}} a further provocation; and with uplifted chin, hair ruffled like {{the crest of}} a Shetland pony, {{flashing}} eyes, and distinct enunciation, James exclaimed, 'You will excuse me for not understanding you.

And you find some woman, coarse and low and vulgar, some beastly creature in whom all the horror of sex is blatant, and you fall upon her like a wild animal. You drink till you're blind with rage." ...|$|E

I believe, in my soul, you would run with a piece of the egg-shell on your head like the curlews, which (I would we were after them again) we used to call whaups in the Halidome and its neighbourhood.

[...] "I put it right here by the table leg; maybe it got into some of the berths."

[...] "Maybe it's here," [...] she resumes, darting upon something dark in another berth. [...] "No, that's my bag," [...] responds the occupant. The chambermaid then proceeds to turn over all the children on the floor, to see if it is not under them. In the course of which process they are most agreeably waked up and enlivened; and when every body is broad awake, and most uncharitably wishing the cap, and Peter too, at the bottom of the canal, the good lady exclaims, [...] "Well, if this isn't lucky; here I had it safe in my basket all the time!"
