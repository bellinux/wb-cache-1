5|$|On July 4, 1939, Ruth {{spoke on}} Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium {{as members of}} the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, who was forced into {{premature}} retirement by ALS disease, which would kill him two years later. The next week, Ruth went to Cooperstown, New York, for the formal opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Three years earlier, {{he was one of the}} first five players elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers. During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> baseball when he contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but he was sent a rejection letter.|$|E
5|$|Slowed by knee injuries, Motley {{left the}} Browns after the 1953 season.

He then pursued a coaching career, but was turned away by the Browns and other teams he approached. He attributed his trouble finding <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> football to racial discrimination, questioning whether teams were ready to hire a black coach.

30|$|Second, {{in order}} to test the {{predictions}} regarding (unexpected) drops in new match quality, Part II studies the probability of <b>a</b> reduction <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction from one year to the other. Although both the stepping stone and the learning model predict <b>an</b> average gain <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction following <b>a</b> <b>job</b> quit, <b>in</b> the stepping stone model this is the result from only positive changes <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction, while <b>in</b> the learning model this is a positive sum of all positive and negative changes <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. Hence, to distinguish between both models it is necessary that some workers quitting their <b>job</b> experience <b>a</b> decline <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. The results from a fixed effects logit model are presented in the lower part of Table  3. The results indicate that job quitters are less likely to experience <b>a</b> reduction <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction than <b>job</b> stayers. Furthermore, <b>a</b> reduction <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction is more likely if workers leave <b>a</b> good <b>job.</b> This confirms earlier evidence from the raw data that job satisfaction reductions occur after <b>a</b> <b>job</b> quit, which means that there is a role for the learning model. The relative importance of both models is investigated in the next section.|$|R
