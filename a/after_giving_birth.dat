5|$|Several {{women in}} Carnivàle {{are tied to}} Avatars, but only two have Avataric blood: Belyakov's {{daughter}} Iris is a Vectorus by definition, and Justin's daughter Sofie is the Omega. Although Sofie is {{two years older than}} Ben, her father's Avataric generation places her in the next Avataric generation. The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior <b>after</b> <b>giving</b> <b>birth</b> to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would not touch her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her eyes out and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born. Sofie's mother Apollonia became catatonic after Sofie's birth. Justin's and his older sister Iris's mother receives no special mention in the series, but the Pitch Document mentions her chronic paranoid schizophrenia after Justin's birth.

5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} shortly <b>after</b> <b>giving</b> <b>birth.</b> Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant {{for nearly}} a year.

However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E
