5|$|Aldfrith {{was said}} to have been ill for some time before his death, dying on 14 December 704 or 705. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died at Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The {{succession}} was disputed by Eadwulf, supported initially by Bishop Wilfrid, and supporters of Aldfrith's young son Osred, apparently led by Berht's kinsman Berhtfrith.|$|E
5|$|Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa {{stays in}} a flat in London for several weeks. Now that she has no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Littlefinger {{arrives at}} Runestone in the Vale, with a pet falcon for his stepson, Lord of the Eyrie Robin Arryn. When Lord of Runestone Yohn Royce asks how Sansa became married to Ramsay Bolton instead {{of at the}} Fingers, Littlefinger claims Bolton's men {{attacked}} them and kidnapped her on the way. When Royce is dubious, Littlefinger <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was the only person}} who knew of their destination, implying his guilt. He manipulates Arryn into considering executing Royce, then into giving him a second chance after he pledges his absolute loyalty. Littlefinger then tells Arryn that Sansa, his cousin, has escaped the Boltons and is taking refuge at Castle Black, but that she is still not safe. Arryn agrees to command Royce to lead the knights of the Vale to protect her.|$|E

5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, the Prince's shaving {{is interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} Tancredi. Tancredi reveals that his position in the Italian nationalist movement has risen. He <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will soon be joining Garibaldi in the mountains. The Prince suddenly imagines his beloved nephew dead in the garden with his guts trailing out like the Crown soldier, and tries to dissuade him from departing. Tancredi, however, insists that he is fighting for a very good reason. Later, as the Prince gets dressed, he realizes the practicality of Tancredi's words. As he ponders the coming upheavals, he realizes that his nephew is more aristocratically like-minded than he thought.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{explanations}} {{as to why}} Judas betrayed Jesus. In the earliest account, in the Gospel of Mark, {{when he goes to}} the chief priests to betray Jesus, he is offered money as a reward, {{but it is not clear}} that money is his motivation. In the Gospel of Matthew account, on the other hand, he asks what they will pay him for handing Jesus over. In the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John, the devil enters into Judas, causing him to offer to betray Jesus. The Gospel of John account has Judas complaining that money has been spent on expensive perfumes to anoint Jesus which could have been spent on the poor, but <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the keeper of the apostles' purse and used to steal from it.|$|E

25|$|Wiles {{states that}} {{on the morning of}} 19 September 1994, he {{was on the verge of}} giving up and was almost {{resigned}} to accepting that he had failed, and to publishing his work so that others could build on it and find the error. He <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was having a final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made to work, when he had a sudden insight that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin–Flach approach would not work directly also meant that his original attempts using Iwasawa theory could be made to work, if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin–Flach approach. Fixing one approach with tools from the other approach would resolve the issue for all the cases that were not already proven by his refereed paper. He described later that Iwasawa theory and the Kolyvagin–Flach approach were each inadequate on their own, but together they could be made powerful enough to overcome this final hurdle.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Belle {{returns to}} Gold and forgives him. However, after Emma hears the whispers of the dagger, she meets with Gold, who reveals {{the truth to}} Emma, about him using a magic potion to turn Excalibur into a conduit, so that when Emma killed all of the Dark Ones, their magic was {{transferred}} into Gold, allowing Gold to reclaim his life as the Dark One, and creating a new Dagger in the process, with a reversed color scheme of a black blade with silver engravings. (Excalibur was still tethered to the Darkness, so when Gold became the Dark One again, the Dagger reappeared.) He <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is more powerful than ever before, since he now wields the combined power of every Dark One that ever lived including her. Emma is very cross about this and tells him that she now has leverage over Gold, threatening to tell Belle at any moment the truth about her husband. In exchange for Emma keeping the secret, Gold agrees to help her enter the Underworld to rescue Hook. At the lake, Emma is joined by Gold, Regina, Mary Margaret, David, Robin, and Henry, as they approach the ferry to descend into the Underworld.|$|E

500|$|Although as High Commissioner Constantine {{looked after}} {{his staff and}} was {{respected}} by other diplomats, Howat observes there is limited evidence that he was successful in the post: [...] "In the one area in which he acted positively, he blundered—the Bristol affair. In {{the language of the}} game he loved... his timing was wrong though he was full of good intentions". Howat <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not increase his stature or reputation during his term of office. Mason believes that [...] "there was too much of the welfare officer about him and not enough of the government focused diplomat." ...|$|E

500|$|The casual {{environment}} at Schwa attracts a diverse clientele, including many local chefs. [...] Carlson {{says he does}} not care about etiquette or attire, but will not tolerate rudeness. [...] "If anybody acts as though they expect to be catered to, they're in the wrong place," [...] he says. [...] Carlson <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not afraid to tell a customer off if they deserve it. One reporter observed that Schwa couldn't possibly [...] "do less to preselect customers or filter out undesirable ones." [...] Schwa does not cater to families, offering no highchairs and few tables capable of seating more than two people.|$|E
500|$|Máni (Old Norse [...] "moon") is the {{personification}} of the moon in Norse mythology. Máni, personified, is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Both sources state {{that he is the}} brother of the personified sun, Sól, and the son of Mundilfari, while the Prose Edda <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is followed by the children Hjúki and Bil through the heavens. As a proper noun, Máni appears throughout Old Norse literature. Scholars have proposed theories about Máni's potential connection to the Northern European notion of the Man in the Moon, and a potentially otherwise unattested story regarding Máni through skaldic kennings.|$|E
500|$|George Harrison wrote [...] "Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond)" [...] {{while on}} holiday in Ireland with his wife, Pattie Boyd. The couple stayed with Scottish singer Donovan, {{a friend of}} the Beatles since the mid 1960s and a fellow student on the band's 1968 Transcendental Meditation course in India. The visit took place over the Easter holiday weekend in April 1971, when Donovan, having {{recently}} become a tax exile in Ireland, hosted a party for his musician friends at the Castle Martin estate in Kilcullen, County Kildare. While discussing the song in his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison recalls composing the melody on an open-tuned guitar, and <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote it [...] "like an old Irish folk song, a bit like country music".|$|E

500|$|Regarding basketball, Robertson {{has stated}} that legendary Harlem Globetrotters players Marques Haynes and [...] "clown prince" [...] Goose Tatum were his idols. Now in his seventies, he is long retired from playing basketball, {{although}} he still follows it on TV and attends most home games for the University of Cincinnati, his alma mater. [...] He now lists woodworking as his prime hobby. Robertson <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> still could average a triple-double season in today's basketball, {{and that he is}} highly skeptical that anyone else could do it (it was later done by Russell Westbrook in the 2016–17 season). On June 9, 2007, Oscar received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Cincinnati for both his philanthropic and entrepreneurial efforts.|$|E
500|$|The Codex Boreelianus {{is named}} after Johann Boreel (1577–1629), Dutch Ambassador at the Court of James I of England. There is no record of Boreel's obtaining the codex, but it is {{generally}} believed that he {{brought it to the}} Netherlands from one of his travels to the Middle East. The connection to Boreel is indicated by Wettstein, who was given a partial collation of the codex in 1730. The collation was made by Izaak Verburg, rector of the Amsterdam gymnasium, and contained text from Matthew 7:2 to Luke 11. Wettstein <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not aware of its current location. Wettstein cited the codex in his Novum Testamentum Graecum (1751), also in these parts, which do not survive to the present day (e.g. Matthew 7:9).|$|E
500|$|About 731, Bede, a Northumbrian monk and chronicler, wrote a work {{called the}} Ecclesiastical History of the English People. [...] The work was not {{primarily}} a secular history, but Bede provides much {{information about the}} history of the Anglo-Saxons, including a list early in the history of seven kings who, he said, held [...] "imperium" [...] over the other kingdoms south of the Humber. [...] The usual translation for [...] "imperium" [...] is [...] "overlordship". [...] Bede names Ceawlin as the second on the list, although he spells it [...] "Caelin", and <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "known in the speech of his own people as Ceaulin". Bede also makes it clear that Ceawlin was not a Christian—Bede mentions a later king, Æthelberht of Kent, as [...] "the first to enter the kingdom of heaven".|$|E
