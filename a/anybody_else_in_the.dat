Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin Härterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold.

Related with many vehicles passed on it in transportation, there were two vehicles like private and public transportation. Generally, public transportation usage was based on rent agreement between public transportation owner and driver. From above background, the writer stated the problems as : (1) how the application of rent agreement between public transportation owner with <b>the</b> rentman <b>in</b> public transportation of ADL line Malang City ? (2) How the responsibility taking of public transportation damage based on the rental agreement ? From above problem statement, the method used were : socio-juridical approach method. The method tried to answer the above question based on social scope, also law scope. Data sources were original data from the first hand researcher, from the original source which haven’t processed by <b>anybody</b> <b>else.</b> Primary data <b>in</b> <b>the</b> research was information from interview with related parties, it was interview with ADL Line Organization, whether the owner and the driver. Secondary data was processed by the writer and documentation from the research and somebody else processing which existed in books and documentation by using qualitative descriptive analysis. What called descriptive research was giving description about existing phenomena, not trying to test theory or making certain hypothesis. Qualitative analysis mean that data existed was word data, not statistic or numbers. The reserach showed that in rental agreement between public transportation owner and driver in ADL line based on trust between parties in rental agreement. Related with the achievement between public transportation owner and driver about right and obligation of cost, damage, maintenance, and rent tools. There suggest that the agreement between two parties, the owner and driver of public transportation based on trust without any agreement letter, the agreement would be so weak. If there was ’wanprestasi’ (un-fulfilled obligation) between parties, the law solution {{would be hard to}} prove. So, the agreement would be better if stated in a letter of agreement or agreement contract. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Early 17 th-century {{mathematical}} {{publications of}} Johann Faulhaber contain some remarkable theorems, {{such as the}} fact that the r-fold summation of 1 m, 2 m, [...] ., n m is a polynomial in n(n + r) when m is a positive odd number. The present paper explores a computation-based approach by which Faulhaber may well have discovered such results, and solves a 360 -year-old riddle that Faulhaber presented to his readers. It also shows that similar results hold when we express <b>the</b> sums <b>in</b> terms of central factorial powers instead of ordinary powers. Faulhaber’s coefficients can moreover be generalized to factorial powers of noninteger exponents, obtaining asymptotic series for 1 α + 2 α + · · · + nα in powers of n − 1 (n + 1) − 1. 1 Johann Faulhaber of Ulm (1580 – 1635), founder of a school for engineers early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17 th century, loved numbers. His passion for arithmetic and algebra led him to devote a considerable portion of his life to the computation of formulas for the sums of powers, significantly extending all previously known results. He may well have carried out more computing than <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Europe during <b>the</b> first half of the 17 th century. His greatest mathematical achievements appear in a booklet entitled Academia Algebræ (written in German in spite of its latin title), published in Augsburg, 1631 [2]. Here we find, for example, the following formulas for sums of odd powers: 1 1 + 2 1 + · · · + n 1 = N, N = (n 2 + n) / 2; 1 3 + 2 3 + · · · + n 3 = N 2; 1 5 + 2 5 + · · · + n 5 = (4 N 3 − N 2) / 3; 1 7 + 2 7 + · · · + n 7 = (12 N 4 − 8 N 3 + 2 N 2) / 6; 1 9 + 2 9 + · · · + n 9 = (16 N 5 − 20 N 4 + 12 N 3 − 3 N 2) / 5; 1 11 + 2 11 + · · · + n 11 = (32 N 6 − 64 N 5 + 68 N 4 − 40 N 3 + 5 N 2) / 6; 1 13 + 2 13 + · · · + n 13 = (960 N 7 − 2800 N 6 + 4592 N 5 − 4720 N 4 + 2764 N 3 − 691 N 2) / 105; 1 15 + 2 15 + · · · + n 15 = (192 N 8 − 768 N 7 + 1792 N 6 − 2816 N 5 + 2872 N...|$|R

25|$|Alec Bedser {{dominated}} the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) {{as much as}} Len Hutton did the batting {{and by the end}} of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world. He sent down almost twice as many overs as <b>anybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both. Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length. Unfortunately the 1950-51 tour was the first to use extensive air travel. Hollies was scared stiff of flying and had to be drunk before he could get on a plane. He failed to turn the ball on Australian wickets and was kept out of the team by Wright. Roy Tattersall and Bob Berry were off-spinners who were supposed to tie down the Australian batsmen, but like many of their kind failed to adjust to the faster, harder Australian pitches. John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler. Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen.|$|E

He finally laid the bunny to rest with his highest Test century in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, making 206 out of 371. The real trouble was finding him a suitable opening partner as Jack Moroney made a pair, Ken Archer never made a Test 50 and Jim Burke failed when promoted after making an unbeaten century on his Test debut.
