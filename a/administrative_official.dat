25|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 7th century, the old provincial {{administration}} was replaced by the thematic system. Even after that however, the term eparchos remained in use until the 840s for the senior <b>administrative</b> <b>official</b> of each thema, under the governing strategos. Thereafter, eparchs are evident in some cases as city governors, but the most important by far amongst them was the Eparch of Constantinople, whose office had wide-ranging powers and functioned continuously until the 13th century.|$|E

The mayor is directly elected, while the council selects a deputy mayor from among its members.|$|E

It is also traditionally said that it is in remembrance of the circumstances of Qu Yuan's death that the annual Dragon boat races are held.|$|E

2500|$|None of {{the sources}} {{consulted}} clarifies why Cortina left the regional jefatura. At the time Carlism was divided into supporters of de Mella and those standing by the claimant, but in historiography he is only marginally mentioned as a somewhat disoriented Mellista sympathizer. It seems that the circumstances were strictly personal. Third Carlist War broke {{the back of the}} family; while other Marchena representatives of [...] "burguesia agraria" [...] kept growing into wealth, Cortina struggled. Turning 60 and with health problems, he concluded that he would be better off on the state payroll possibly earning a pension and perhaps assumed that moving to Madrid would facilitate his return to public service. Starting 1917 he was already noted as resident of the capital. As Ministerio de Ultramar no longer existed he knocked at the doors of Ministerio de Hacienda and got finally restored as 3. class <b>administrative</b> <b>official</b> in Ministerio de Fomento, success probably conditioned by distant family ties.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, {{by a vote}} of 17,809 {{in favor}} and 13,752 against, voters {{approved}} a charter for a [...] "Council-Manager" [...] form of government, making Montgomery County the first home-rule county in Maryland. The charter created an elected seven-member County Council with the power to pass local laws. All seven Council Members would be elected at-large by all county residents. Five would have to live in five different residence districts, while the other two could live anywhere within the county. The Council would serve as both the legislative and executive functions of the county. Council members would elect one of their own to serve as president of the Council. The charter also authorized the hiring of a county manager, the top <b>administrative</b> <b>official,</b> who could be dismissed by the Council after a public hearing. The charter created a department of public works, department of finance, and office of the county attorney, while it abolished the positions of county treasurer and police commissioner. The first County Council was elected in 1949.|$|E
