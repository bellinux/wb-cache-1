500|$|In August 1948, Whittaker Chambers, {{a former}} spy for the Soviets and <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>editor</b> <b>at</b> Time magazine, {{testified before the}} House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).

Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for denials under oath. The Soviet Union's success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and {{the fall of the}} nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude that subversion by Soviet spies was responsible, and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence. However, Truman did not fully share such opinions. He famously called the Hiss trial a [...] "red herring," [...] and the Justice Department was moving to indict Chambers instead of Hiss for perjury.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of the European sovereign-debt crisis, Radek Sikorski, Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, [...] "I will {{probably}} be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's indispensable nation." [...] According to Jacob Heilbrunn, <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>editor</b> <b>at</b> The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. [...] "This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position {{at the center of the}} Continent." [...] Heilbrunn believes that the adage, [...] "what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union" [...] has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.|$|E
