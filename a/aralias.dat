60|$|The natives {{collect the}} leaves of many <b>Aralias</b> as fodder for cattle, for which purpose they are of the {{greatest}} service {{in a country where}} grass for pasture is so scarce; this is the more remarkable, since they belong to the natural family of ivy, which is usually poisonous; the use of this food, however, gives a peculiar taste to the butter. In other parts of Sikkim, fig-leaves are used for the same purpose, and branches of a bird-cherry (Prunus), a plant also of a very poisonous family, abounding in prussic acid.|$|E
60|$|Migration from North to South {{has been}} long going on.--Now, if each phase of colder and warmer mountain-climate--each {{alternate}} depression and {{elevation of the}} snow-line, only helped on the migration of a few species some stages of the long route from the north to the south temperate regions, yet, during the long course of the Tertiary period there might well have arisen that representation of the northern flora in the southern hemisphere which is now so conspicuous. For {{it is very important}} to remark that it is not the existing flora alone that is represented, such as might have been conveyed during the last glacial epoch only; but we find a whole series of northern types evidently of varying degrees of antiquity, while even some genera characteristic of the southern hemisphere appear to have been originally derived from Europe. Thus Eucalyptus and Metrosideros have been determined by Dr. Ettingshausen from their fruits in the Eocene beds of Sheppey, while Pimelea, Leptomeria and four genera of Proteaceæ have been recognised by Professor Heer in the Miocene of Switzerland; and the former writer has detected fifty-five Australian forms in the Eocene plant beds of Häring (? Belgium).[140] Then we have such peculiar genera {519} as Pachychladon and Notothlaspi of New Zealand said to have affinities with Arctic plants, while Stilbocarpa--another peculiar New Zealand genus--has its nearest allies in the Himalayan and Chinese <b>Aralias.</b> Following these are a whole host of very distinct species of northern genera which may date back to any part of the Tertiary period, and which occur in every south temperate land. Then we have closely allied representative species of European or Arctic plants; and, lastly, a number of identical species,--and these two classes are probably due entirely to the action of the last great glacial epoch, whose long continuance, and the repeated fluctuations of climate with which it commenced and terminated, rendered it an agent of sufficient power to have brought about this result.|$|E
50|$|Gurugram {{is divided}} into 36 wards, with each ward further divided into blocks. The housing type in the city {{consists}} largely of attached housing, though {{a large number of}} attached multi-dwelling units, including apartments, condominiums and high rise residential towers are getting popular. The top five condominiums in the city, as rated by The Times of India, are: <b>Aralias,</b> Hamilton Court, The World Spa, Gurugram One and Raheja Atlantis.|$|E
50|$|Natesan Park is a park in T.Nagar, Chennai, India. It {{is located}} on Venkatanarayana Road. The park covers an area of 4 acre and was {{opened to the public}} on 13 September 1950 by the then Minister of Agriculture, A. B. Shetty. It is the only park {{maintained}} by the Chennai Corporation that has a separate tennis court for coaching children. There is also a plant propagation centre and play zone for children. It is a popular spot for morning walks for the local residents. Plant varieties found in the park include Crotons, <b>Aralias,</b> Bougainvilleas, Acalypha, Caesal pinioidese, pulcherima, mahogany, neem, gulmohar, Cassia fistula and foliage trees like pungam, palm, Ficus religeosa and Thespesia.|$|E
5000|$|Rosaneves is a {{neighbourhood}} of the Ribeirão das Neves town, metropolitan {{region of}} Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Its streets were baptized with plant names, in Portuguese (with exception of Jardineiras Street): Acácias Street, Alfazema Street, Alva-Bonina Street, Anis Street, Antúrios Street, <b>Arálias</b> Street, Azaleia Street, Begônias Street, Buganville Street, Cabreúvas Street, Calêndulas Street, Camélias Street, Caneleiras Street, Capuchinhos Street, Carmesim Street, Cássia Imperial Street, Cravina Street, Cravos Street, Dálias Street, Dama da Noite Street, Flor-de-Lis Street, Flor de seda Street, Genciana Street, Hortências Street, Ipê Street, Jacarandás Street, Jasmim Street, Jatobá Street, Madressilva Avenue (the main street), Magnólias Street, Malva Street, Manacás Street, Mimo de Vênus Street, Oliveiras Street, Orquídeas Street, Palmeiras Street, Papoulas Street, Perpétuas Street, Petúnias Street, Primaveras Street, Tinhorões Street, Trombetas Street, Tulipas Street, Urze Street, Violetas Street and Vitória-Régia Street.|$|E
50|$|The design’s {{repetition}} of linear rows of trees aims {{to create a}} sense of harmony though repetition. Specific trees and plants were selected as allegories of the trans experience: rare, overlooked, and aesthetically unconventional. Native perennials were selected to attract butterflies: whose life-course transition symbolizes the transgender experience. Redbuds can be rather plain small, ornamental trees in summer but are highly prized for their butter-yellow fall foliage and spectacular display of magenta flowers in early spring. Hackberry trees have bark not always considered beautiful, but produce berries that support a wide array of birds and other wildlife in winter. Devil's walkingstick is a large shrub or small tree having stems spiked with large thorns but a canopy topped with beautiful white flowers in mid-spring. Hackberry and aralia are undervalued plants and rarely used in conventional domestic gardens and commercial landscaping. The original design called for nine redbud trees, 17 hackberry trees, and six <b>aralias.</b>|$|E
