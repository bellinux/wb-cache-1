Once there, in 1940 Trott joined the Nazi Party in order to <b>access</b> <b>party</b> information and monitor its planning.

40|$|American {{political}} parties, {{throughout their}} history, have functioned as central institutions of governance and democracy. While their legislative and policy making role remains vital today, {{their identity as}} a link between citizens and government has changed markedly in this century. A major reason for their shifting electoral role has been the emergence of state governments as active regulators {{of the political process}} in the Progressive Era. ^ Since the late 19602 ̆ 7 s, the U. S. Supreme Court has adjudicated a series of disputes involving this legalized electoral environment, becoming in the process a major interpreter of the legal status of political parties. The absence of any reference to parties in the text of the Constitution has given the justices of the Court significant authority in structuring the constitutional status of parties. The dissertation examines the ideas which have guided the exercise of that authority, and explores their implications for the American party system and American democracy. ^ Analysis of Court opinions involving ballot <b>access,</b> <b>party</b> organization/nomination procedures, campaign finance, and patronage reveals two opposing schools of thought among the justices of the Court. One viewpoint envisions politics as a 2 ̆ 2 natural order 2 ̆ 2 nurtured by wide party competition and access to the electoral arena, and perverted by many state regulations. A contrasting vision sees politics as a 2 ̆ 2 constructed order 2 ̆ 2 nurtured by stable party competition and best preserved by state regulation. These differing ideas of party politics are reflected in the justices 2 ̆ 7 conceptions of political competition and choice, party structure and functions, judicial standards of review, and the proper role of government in the electoral process. ^ The political implications of these contending viewpoints extend beyond the purely judicial realm, shaping the future of the American electoral system and efforts to build stronger parties. An analysis of these schools of thought using a set of 2 ̆ 2 strong party/responsible party 2 ̆ 2 attributes concludes that, while the 2 ̆ 2 natural order 2 ̆ 2 offers parties some increase in autonomy, neither viewpoint offers a clear road to stronger parties. The quest for party renewal must ultimately be as political as it has been judicial. In addition, these opinions reflects a broader, continuing debate over whether democracy is best understood as expression (access, competition) or governance (legislative representation, stability). ...|$|E
50|$|The legal {{implications}} of a marital separation may be regulated by a contract. A separation agreement is typically negotiated and drafted. It agrees to the division of property as well as child support, custody, and <b>access.</b> <b>Parties</b> can also enter into pre-nuptial contracts to regulate the economic consequences of a future marriage breakdown. If it is shown that one party had unfairly negotiated the agreement can be invalidated.|$|R

In section 4, the gradual process of market opening for railway transport services and the evolution of third <b>party</b> <b>access</b> regulation in Europe are characterized. In this context the potentials for competition on the markets for passenger rail services and public subsidies are also considered...|$|R

40|$|Ownership {{unbundling}} {{and third}} <b>party</b> <b>access</b> are discussed as two options of unbundling {{in both the}} literature and political discussions. Focusing on the South American electricity sector, I contrast static and dynamic impacts of ownership unbundling and third <b>party</b> <b>access</b> regimes on customer prices. Substantially different results are found using dynamic rather than static analysis. In particular, negative short term effects of ownership unbundling found in static models are approximately cancelled out by subsequent positive impacts in the dynamic model. Third <b>party</b> <b>access</b> seems to allow for similar benefits while avoiding the (restructuring) costs of ownership unbundling. Previously estimated static models thus appear to suffer from either omitted variable biases or endogeneity problems of static non-difference models. ...|$|R

50|$|Alignment {{was made}} more significant—certain {{areas of the}} game were {{accessible}} only to appropriately aligned (good or evil) parties. The first level was accessible to all parties, good, neutral or evil. (Note that evil and good characters are unwilling to adventure together, so a party is always either good least one good character, the rest neutral, evil least one evil character, the rest neutral or neutral characters are neutral.) The second and fourth levels could only be <b>accessed</b> by <b>parties</b> with no evil characters—good or neutral parties. The third and fifth levels could only be <b>accessed</b> by <b>parties</b> with no good characters—evil or neutral parties. The sixth level could only be <b>accessed</b> by a <b>party</b> {{with at least one}} good or one evil character—no neutral parties. Neutral characters could travel into all areas but the last level, so theoretically you could get through most of the game with a party where all six characters were neutral. But practically speaking players were forced to build up more than 6 characters, as no party could function long term without a Cleric (good or evil), Wizard (good or evil) or Lord (good) for healing. This had the effect of prolonging gameplay.|$|R
