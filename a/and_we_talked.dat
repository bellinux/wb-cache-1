The company was, at the time, licensed to Island Records, and Boyd, {{the man who had}} discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. A four-track demo, recorded in Drake's college room in the spring of 1968, led Boyd to offer a management, publishing, and production contract to the 20-year-old, and to initiate work on a debut album. According to Boyd:In those days you didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [...] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked,</b> and I just said, [...] "I'd like to make a record." [...] He stammered, [...] "Oh, well, yeah. Okay."

500|$|Leterrier {{had planned}} to use {{prosthetic}} makeup and animatronics to complement the computer-generated imagery that was solely used in the previous film.

A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic. An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however. Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.|$|E

Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high."
