40|$|Background: Although {{traditional}} fermented foods <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> play {{an important}} role in contributing to the livelihoods of Namibians through enhanced food security and income generation, there is a scarcity of information regarding their traditional production methods, microbiological and biochemical characteristics, nutritional value, and safety. Research into the processing technologies of these foods <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> is still in its infancy; thus, there is a need to document their traditional production methods, microbiology, and biochemistry in order to evaluate their nutritional value and safety, standardize and industrialize them, where possible, and preserve them for future generations. Methods: The socioeconomic importance, traditional production methods and, where available, microbiological, biochemical, and nutritional properties and safety evaluation of commonly consumed fermented foods <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> in Namibia are documented. Recommendations are made for potential research areas. Results: Commonly produced fermented foods <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> in Namibia include milk-based products (omashikwa, mashini ghakushika, mabisi, <b>and</b> âudaï), cereal-based <b>beverages</b> (oshikundu, omalodu, otombo, epwaka, okatokele, oshafuluka, maxau, and /Ho ≠Goas), vegetable-based fermented food, mudhika, <b>and</b> fruit-based <b>beverages</b> (ombike, omagongo, <b>and</b> omalunga). Conclusion: Fermented foods <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> play a major role in the diet, socioeconomic, and cultural activities of the Namibian population. Most are spontaneously fermented. Research is scarce and should be conducted on the microbiology, biochemistry, nutritional value, and safety of the fermented foods <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> to ensure the health of the population...|$|R

40|$|Ambulatory 24 -hour double-probe pH {{monitoring}} {{seems to}} be the best test to measure reflux. Artifacts caused by intake of acid foods <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> have to be excluded, necessitating a time-consuming manual review of the 24 -hour data. Dietary restrictions used to bypass these artifacts would interfere with the normal daily life situation. Therefore, the influence of food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> ingested during the monitoring period was studied. Data from 252 patients who underwent double-probe pH monitoring were analyzed, first by visual inspection of the 24 -hour tracing and second by leaving out the intake periods. As to the registration of gastroesophageal reflux, the inclusion or omission of meals <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> hardly influenced the data. However, the registration of laryngopharyngeal reflux was severely biased by intake of food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> <b>and</b> other artifacts. Leaving out meals <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> did not correct for all artifacts. Therefore, we recommend review of each laryngopharyngeal pH dro...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the degree of}} market power of the Greek food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry over the period 1983 – 2007 at the three-digit SIC level. The present study also estimates the “deadweight” loss and the reduction of consumers’ income due to the possible existence of market power in the Greek food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry. Based on Bresnahan’s (1989) conjectural variation model, three different approaches are used to investigate competitive conditions of the Greek food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry. The first approach assesses the extent of market power of the whole industry over the period 1983 – 2007; the second approach tests the degree of market power in {{each one of the}} nine sectors of the industry over the whole period, i. e. 1983 – 2007; and the third one estimates the extent of market power for the whole Greek food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry for specific sub-periods of the period 1983 – 2007. The methodology of Dickson and Yu (1989) is adopted to measure the welfare losses. The empirical results indicate the presence of some degree of market power in the whole Greek food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry as well as in each one sector of the industry during the period 1983 – 2007 and, as a result, the existence of welfare losses. In addition, the empirical findings support the presence of some degree of market power for each sub-period of the period 1983 – 2007 in the whole Greek food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> manufacturing industry <b>and</b> the existence of welfare losses.
