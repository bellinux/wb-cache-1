5|$|Just {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the genus Xenocyon (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog)</b> that was as large as the dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, Smilodon, and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the modern cougar (Puma concolor), the Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog</b> (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|Carnivores {{include both}} pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter {{depends on a}} {{powerful}} bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular symphysis. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use {{the strength of the}} mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to enable the animals to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of the dire wolf was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog.</b> The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of the dire wolf indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and was therefore a pack hunter. This suggests that the dire wolf may have processed bone but was not as well adapted for it as was the gray wolf. The fact that the incidence of fracture for the dire wolf reduced in frequency in the late Pleistocene to that of its modern relatives suggests that reduced competition had allowed the dire wolf to return to a feeding behavior involving a lower amount of bone consumption, a behavior for which it was best suited.|$|E

40|$|Chimpanzees and large, social, {{mammalian}} carnivores hunt similarly, yet {{few studies}} use comparative methodologies to help understand these animals hunting behaviour. This thesis investigates {{the extent of}} current knowledge of chimpanzee hunting {{in the context of}} what, how and why chimpanzees hunt. Furthermore it investigates whether the high hunting success of chimpanzees is related to their choice of relatively small prey. This is done by comparing chimpanzee hunting to that of other social carnivores that hunt relatively large prey, wolves, Canis lupus, <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs,</b> Lycaon pictus, spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta, and the lion, Panthera leo [...] Chimpanzees are highly successful hunters compared to large social carnivores. Chimpanzees preferentially hunt relatively small prey compared to the carnivores studied. The mediation analysis shows that the high hunting success of chimpanzees is partially mediated by them hunting prey of a smaller relative size. A comprehensive review of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, as predators as well as a mediation analysis on the relationship between prey size and hunting success across the five social predators is presented. It is shown that chimpanzees prefer hunting arboreal primates, particularly the red colobus monkey, Piliocolobus sp [...] Seasonality in hunting prevalence occurs at some study sites but is not ubiquitous. Adult and adolescent males conduct the majority of hunts and often hunt in groups. Chimpanzees at the Taï Forest, Cote d’Ivoire, hunt more cooperatively (fulfilling different roles) than documented elsewhere. This has been likened to hunting by large social carnivores, specifically African lions and <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs.</b> The traditional explanations of the reasoning behind chimpanzee hunting that have currently been proposed are not well supported. A more recently proposed explanation, the meat-­‐scrap hypothesis provides an important avenue for future research and the explanation for chimpanzee hunting is likely to be related to nutritional, rather than social factors...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} goals to {{cooperative}} hunting in social carnivores: taking down large prey species through a coordinated effort and subsequently protecting their kill from scavengers. A common goal in cooperatively hunting pairs is to coordinate the separation of {{a mother and her}} offspring, facilitaing an easier kill that a solitary hunter could not make. Cooperative hunting is also important in species that prey on larger animals, such as <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs,</b> as it allows them to make a kill in a safer, more efficient manner. After the kill has been made, the hunters restrict meat access to those involved in the hunt to protect their food from scavengers. This includes both strictly scavenging species and members of their own species who do not participate in the hunt. In these ways, cooperative hunting confers adaptive advantages by affording species a means to make more efficient kills and by ensuring they get the maximum amount of food possible from their kill.|$|R
50|$|Broadcast 5 December 1990, {{this episode}} {{concentrates}} on animal communication. In Kenya, Attenborough accompanies a tribesman who calls to a honeyguide, {{which in turn}} answers him and leads the pair to a bees' nest. The tribesman extracts the honey, and some is left to reward the bird. <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs</b> are shown <b>hunting</b> gazelles, of which the target is the individual that leaps lowest. Larks evade merlin by sending a similar message: by continuing to sing while being chased, it tells the pursuer that its prey is fit and therefore {{will be difficult to}} catch (see handicap principle). (In 80% of cases this turns out to be true.) Vervet monkeys' cries are among the most complex. Their utterances are effectively words: a vocabulary that defines each of their predators, so an alarm call is specific to a particular threat. Some creatures transmit their presence by display, and Attenborough observes thousands of fireflies illuminating the darkness. Sounds travel faster and further underwater, and over 200 species of fish use them to communicate. In turn, sea lions have become adept at sensing their proximity. However, the most visual aquatic animal is the squid, which uses colour change and posture to communicate. Finally, Attenborough swims with spotted dolphins. They converse with a series of ultrasonic clicks, and each has a family call inherited from its mother: effectively a 'surname'. They also use normal sound, body posture and touch — in short, in terms of ability to communicate, they are man's closest rival.|$|R
50|$|Canids {{have five}} toes on their forelimbs. By the Early Pleistocene this lineage had {{developed}} four digits on their forelimbs, {{which is the}} characteristic feature of the modern <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog</b> (Lycaon pictus). The <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog</b> cannot be positively identified in the fossil record of eastern Africa until the middle Pleistocene, and identifying the oldest Lycaon fossil is difficult because these are hard to distinquish from Canis (Xenocyon) africanus. Some authors consider Canis (Xenocyon) lycanoides as ancestral of both genus Lycaon and genus Cuon. Therefore, one taxonomic authority has proposed {{that all of the}} Canis (Xenocyon) group should be reclassified into genus Lycaon. This would form three chrono-species, with would include Lycaon falconeri during the Late Pliocene of Eurasia, Lycaon lycaonoides during the Early-Middle Pleistocene of Eurasia and Africa, and Lycaon pictus during the Middle-Late Pleistocene and the extant African form.|$|E

40|$|Approach-motivated {{humans and}} nonhumans alike display a {{behavioral}} asymmetry {{consisting of a}} right-oriented bias. When dogs observe their owners, they wag their tail toward the right (Quaranta, Siniscalchi, & Vallortigara, 2007); when toads attempt to catch prey, {{they are more likely}} to flick their tongue at prey to their right side than to their left side (Vallortigara, Rogers, Bisazza, Lippolis, & Robins, 1998); when humans kiss their romantic partners, they turn their head to the right twice as often as they turn it to the left (Güntürkün, 2003); and when approach-motivated humans quickly divide a line into two equal parts, they show a rightward bias (Friedman & Förster, 2005; Nash, McGregor, & Inzlicht, 2010). This right-oriented bias in approach-motivated individuals is associated with left-hemispheric brain activation (Harmon-Jones, 2003; Nash et al., 2010). Evolutionary theory suggests that brain lateralization evolved because it enhanced cognitive capacity and brain efficiency: Lateralization allows each hemisphere to specialize in specific tasks that can be per-formed with increased precision and reduced cognitive costs (Levy, 1977). Groups of individuals presumably benefited from having the same directionality of brain lateralization because the sharing of directional behavioral tendencies increased intergroup coordination. Higher levels of coordination would increase a group’s likelihood of survival (Vallortigara & Rogers, 2005) until the directional behavioral tendency became evolutionarily stable (Ghirlanda & Vallortigara, 2004). For example, <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dogs</b> move together and hunt in coordinated groups to overpower large prey (Courchamp, Rasmussen, & Macdonald, 2002). These dogs exhibit an evo-lutionarily embedded tendency to move in synchronized ways while they close in on their prey, thereby reducing the effort required for coordinating their actions and increasing their likelihood of success. Humans, like other animals, routinely respond to stimuli in their environment and calibrate their responses to attain posi-tive outcomes.

50|$|The wolf-like canids (the canid {{subfamily}} Caninae) are a {{group of}} large carnivores that are genetically closely related because their chromosomes number 78. The group includes genus Canis, Cuon and Lycaon. The members are the dog (C. lupus familiaris), gray wolf (C. lupus), coyote (C. latrans), golden jackal (C. aureus), Ethiopian wolf (C. simensis), black-backed jackal (C. mesomelas), side-striped jackal (C. adustus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Newly proposed members include the red wolf (Canis rufus), eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), and African golden wolf (C. anthus). As they possess 78 chromosomes, {{all members of the}} genus Canis (coyotes, wolves, jackals) are karyologically indistinguishable from each other, and from the dhole and the <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog.</b> The members of Canis can potentially interbreed and there is evidence that the Ethiopian wolf has hybridized with dogs. According to zoologist Reginald Pocock, a dhole interbred with a golden jackal. The <b>African</b> <b>hunting</b> <b>dog</b> is large, highly mobile, known to disperse over large distances and are rare throughout much of their geographical range, making opportunities for hybridization difficult. A study of the maternal mitochondrial DNA of the black-backed jackal could find no evidence of genotypes from the most likely mates - the side-striped jackal nor the golden jackal - indicating that male black-backed jackals had not bred with these. A search of the scientific literature could not find evidence of hybridization for the rare side-striped jackal.|$|E
