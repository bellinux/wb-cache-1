5|$|Redfield and Alomar {{board the}} tanker and {{encounter}} Gionne, who escapes after dropping {{a case of}} syringes; Alomar keeps several. When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Redfield wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Alomar and Valentine, he decides to live in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>without</b> fear.|$|E

25|$|Insects {{that had}} evolved their proto-wings in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>without</b> flying predators {{could afford to}} be exposed openly without risk, but this changed when {{carnivorous}} flying insects evolved.

Those of the prey {{who came up with}} a good solution about how to fold their wings over their backs {{in a way that made}} it possible for them to live in narrow spaces would not only be able to hide from flying predators (and terrestrial predators if they were on the ground) but also to exploit a wide variety of niches that were closed to those who couldn't fold their wings in this way. And today the neopterous insects (those that can fold their wings back over the abdomen) are by far the most dominant group of insects.|$|E

25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>without</b> nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E
25|$|World War II had {{a greater}} impact on the novel than in poetry. It ended the careers of some novelists and delayed the start of others. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Robin Jenkins (1912–2005), Jessie Kesson (1916–94), Muriel Spark (1918–2006), Alexander Trocchi (1925–84) and James Kennaway (1928–68) spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Jenkins major novels such as The Cone Gatherers (1955), The Changeling (1958) and Fergus Lamont (1978) focused on working-class {{dilemmas}} in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>without</b> spiritual consolation. Very different in tone, Spark produced novels that explored modern social life as in her only two overtly Scottish novels The Ballad of Peckham Rye (1960) and the Edinburgh-set The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean (1922–87), and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett (b. 1923). A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Allan Massie (b. 1938), Shena Mackay (b. 1944) and Alan Spence (b. 1947). Massie's work often deals with historical themes while aware of the limitations of historical objectivity, as in his Augustus (1986), Tiberius (1991) and The Ragged Lion (1994). Working class identity continued to be a major theme in the post-war novel and can be seen in Archie Hind's (1928–2008) The Dear Green Place (1966), Alan Sharp's (1934–2013) A Green Tree in Gedde (1965), George Friel's (1910–75) Mr Alfred M.A. (1972) and William McIlvanney's (b. 1936) Docherty (1975).|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>without</b> transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E
