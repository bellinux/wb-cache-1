50|$|The {{inventory}} is exceptionally rich, presenting {{personal and}} grave goods made of gold, silver, bronze, <b>alabaster,</b> <b>glass,</b> clay, leather. Among the findings three subjects were {{of special interest}} - a bronze helmet, a silver jug and a silver cup, upon which one can read the name ΣΕΥΘΟΥ / the name of Seuthes/. This fact, the finding of three bronze coins {{with the image of}} Seuthes III {{at the beginning of the}} corridor and the extraordinary similarity of the bronze head with the images on the coins of this Thracian ruler are the reason why the discoverer G. Kitov Ph.D. makes the assumption that this is the tomb of the founder of the Thracian town Sevtopolis.|$|E
5000|$|Kha's wife Merit {{was buried}} in a single outer coffin with one inner anthropoid coffin and a cartonnage mask. Her mummy was loosely wrapped with funerary jewellery. A tomb of this {{magnitude}} would have taken years to prepare, a process that Kha certainly oversaw during his lifetime. Unexpectedly predeceased by his wife Merit, Kha donated his own coffin to his wife. Since it was too big for Merit’s mummy, Kha was forced to pack linens, monogrammed for him, around her mummy. Merit's single coffin combines features of Kha's inner and outer coffins; [...] "the lid is entirely gilded, but the box is covered with black bitumen, with only the figures and inscriptions gilded." [...] Both Kha's and Merit's anthropoid coffins were themselves contained within Middle Kingdom style [...] "rectangular outer coffins covered with black bitumen and having vaulted, gable-ended lids." [...] Kha's own coffin was mounted on sledge runners, notes Ernesto Schiaparelli in his 1927 publication report of the discovery. Thus, Kha and Merit’s tomb was furnished with all the objects necessary in the afterlife. Ointments and kohl were regarded as {{a necessary part of}} hygiene and these precious materials were held in a variety of lidded <b>alabaster,</b> <b>glass,</b> and faience vessels. Egyptians protected themselves from the flies and from sunlight by wearing dark kohl under the eyes (depicted as a long cosmetic stripe on sculptures). Other objects in the tomb include sandels and jar vessels. The Tomb of Kha and Merit also contained more than 100 clothing garments alone for the couple to use in their afterlife.|$|E

50|$|The high {{altar and}} reredos {{are made from}} Devonshire marble, <b>alabaster</b> and Venetian <b>glass</b> mosaics. One of the carved figures on the pulpit is of a former Mayor of Melbourne's {{daughter}} who died in infancy. The floor tiles and dado (wall tiles) are features of Butterfield's original design.

In Persian tile on the rear wall of the narthex is a replica of an 8-pointed star found in two churches in the Anglican Diocese of Iran - the church of St Simon the Zealot in Shiraz and St Luke's Church in Isfahan. There are two baptismal fonts. The round font of Harcourt granite was installed when the cathedral was constructed. In 1912 the immersion font was built in memory of Field Flowers Goe, third Bishop of Melbourne.|$|R
6000|$|Struck {{with these}} things, I {{explored}} further. Strange to say, old acquaintance {{were all about}} me, and [...] "auld lang syne" [...] smiled out of every nook. There were two oval miniatures over the mantel-piece, of which I knew by heart the pearls about the high and powdered [...] "heads;" [...] the velvets circling the white throats; the swell of the full muslin kerchiefs: {{the pattern of the}} lace sleeve-ruffles. Upon the mantel-shelf there were two china vases, some relics of a diminutive tea-service, as smooth as enamel and as thin as egg-shell, and a white centre ornament, a classic group in <b>alabaster,</b> preserved under <b>glass.</b> Of all these things I could have told the peculiarities, numbered the flaws or cracks, like any clairvoyante. Above all, there was a pair of handscreens, with elaborate pencil-drawings finished like line engravings; these, my very eyes ached at beholding again, recalling hours when they had followed, stroke by stroke and touch by touch, a tedious, feeble, finical, school-girl pencil held in these fingers, now so skeleton-like.|$|R
