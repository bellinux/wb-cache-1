50|$|Usselo is {{the type}} site for the 'Usselo Soil', which {{is also known as}} either the 'Usselo horizon' or 'Usselo layer'. It is a {{distinctive}} and widespread Weichselian (Lateglacial) buried soil, paleosol, that is found within Lateglacial eolian sediments known as 'cover sands' in the Netherlands, western Germany, and western Denmark. This paleosol is classified as either a weakly podzolized <b>Arenosol</b> or as a weakly podzolized Regosol. Numerous radiocarbon dates, optically stimulated luminescence dates, pollen analyses, and archaeological evidence from a number of locations have been interpreted to show that the Usselo Soil formed as the result of pedogenesis during a period of landscape stability during the Allerød oscillation. Locally, the period of landscape stability and pedogenesis associated with the formation of the Usselo Soil continued into the Younger Dryas stadial. The 'Usselo Soil' is an extremely important and very useful marker bed that is used by European archaeologists and geologists in their research.|$|E

Ninety {{percent of the}} soil samples collected from savannah contained at least four genera of plant-parasitic nematodes. The highest population densities were recovered from perennial plants and from acrisols. Nematodes from perennial and annual plants formed one cluster, which had a similar flexible-beta distance to that from the gallery forest.

40|$|Abstract – Soil {{productivity}} is generally associated with poor nutrient {{status and the}} physical condition of the soil, but the effect of soil mineralogy on soil productivity has received little attention. In this qualitative study, interactions between mineralogy and physico-chemistry and their role on the productivity of two luvisols, an <b>arenosol</b> and a vertisol are investigated. Minerals identified in the soils included smectites in the vertisol, kaolinite, quartz, hydromica, albite and biotite in the luvisols and <b>arenosol.</b> The presence of smectite in the vertisol has resulted in it having a higher organic matter content, higher cation exchange capacity, higher water holding capacity, and low bulk density than both luvisols and the <b>arenosol.</b> Both luvisols and the <b>arenosol</b> were dominated by quartz, feldspars and kaolinite, which are chemically inert compared to smectite and have fewer effects on soil cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, and bulk density. The effect of soil mineralogy and physico-chemistry on the productivity of these soils {{is reflected in the}} yield of spinach (Spinacia oleracea variety Fordhook giant) grown on the different soils where spinach yield on the vertisol was the highest followed by that of the luvisols and then the <b>arenosol...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is an {{important}} component of the global soil carbon (C) pool, but its fate, persistence, and loss dynamics in contrasting soils and environments under planted field conditions are poorly understood. To fill this knowledge gap, a 13 C-labelled biochar, as a surrogate material for PyC, produced from Eucalyptus saligna by slow pyrolysis (450 °C; δ 13 C - 36. 7 ‰) was surface (0 - 10 cm) applied in C 3 dominated temperate pasture systems across <b>Arenosol,</b> Cambisol and Ferralsol. The results show a low proportion of the applied biochar-C mineralised over 12 months in a relatively clay- and C-poor <b>Arenosol</b> (i. e., 2. 0 % loss via mineralisation), followed by a clay- and C-rich Cambisol (4. 6 %), and clay-, C- and earthworm-rich Ferralsol (7. 0 %). The biochar-C mean residence time (MRT), estimated by different models, varied between 44 - 1079 (<b>Arenosol),</b> 18 - 172 (Cambisol), and 11 - 29 (Ferralsol) years, with the shorter MRT estimated by a one-pool exponential and the longer MRT by an infinite-pool power or a two-pool exponential model. The two-pool model was best fitted to biochar-C mineralisation. The biochar-C recovery in the 12 - 30 cm soil layer varied from between 1. 2 % (<b>Arenosol),</b> 2. 5 - 2. 7 % (Cambisol) and 13. 8 - 15. 7 % (Ferralsol) of the applied biochar-C after 8 - 12 months. There was a further migration of biochar-C below the 50 -cm depth in the <b>Arenosol,</b> as the combined biochar-C recovery in the mineralised pool and soil profile (up to 30 or 50 cm) was 82 %, in contrast to 101 % in the Cambisol and 104 % in the Ferralsol after 12 months. These results indicate that the downward migration of biochar-C was greatest in the <b>Arenosol</b> (cf. Cambisol and Ferralsol). Cumulative CO 2 -C emission from native soil-plant sources was lower (p < 0. 10) in the biochar-amended vs. non-amended Ferralsol. This field-based study shows that the downward migration of biochar-C exceeded its loss via mineralisation in the <b>Arenosol</b> and Ferralsol, but not in the Cambisol. It is thus important to understand biochar-soil interactions to maximise long-term biochar C sequestration potential in planted soil systems...|$|E
40|$|Export of {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) from grassland ecosystems {{can be an important}} C flux which directly affects ecosystem C balance since DOC is leached from the soil to the groundwater. DOC fluxes and their controlling factors were investigated on two grassland sites with similar climatic conditions but different soil types (Vertisol vs. <b>Arenosol)</b> for a 2. 5 -year period. Parts of both grasslands were disturbed by deep ploughing during afforestation. Contrary to what was expected, ploughing did not increase DOC export but surface soil DOC concentrations decreased by 28 % (Vertisol) and 14 % (<b>Arenosol).</b> DOC flux from the soil profile was negatively influences by the clay content of the soil with seven times larger DOC export in the clay-poor <b>Arenosol</b> (55 kg C ha- 1 a- 1) than in the clay-rich Vertisol (8 kg C ha- 1 a- 1). At the <b>Arenosol</b> site, highest DOC concentrations were measured in late summer, whereas in the Vertisol there was a time lag of several months between surface and subsoil DOC with highest subsoil DOC concentrations during winter season. DOC export was not correlated with soil organic carbon stocks. Large differences in 14 C concentrations of 22 – 40 pMC between soil organic carbon and DOC in the subsoil indicated that both C pools are largely decoupled. We conclude that DOC export at both sites is not controlled by the vegetation but by physicochemical parameters such as the adsorption capacity of soil minerals and the water balance of the ecosystem. Only in the acidic sandy <b>Arenosol</b> DOC export was a significant C flux of about 8 % of net ecosystem production...|$|E

The differentiation of the ionic composition of soil sorption complex and soil water extracts within a soil type and amongst soil types was presented. The sum of cations in the soil and water extracts was the highest in Dystric Cambisol and the lowest in Haplic Podzol. Ca is a dominant cation in soil and soil water extracts in organic horizon, whilst Al is dominant in mineral soil horizons. The Ca/Al and the base cations to Al (BC/Al) molar ratios increased in the sequence of soils: Haplic Podzol < Dystric <b>Arenosol</b> < Dystric Cambisol.

40|$|Glyphosate, a broad spectrum, non-selective herbicide, is the world´s most {{important}} and widely used herbicide. The globally increasing adoption of no-till or reduced tillage systems is becoming a driving force for enhanced glyphosate use. In such systems, glyphosate is applied pre-sowing for weed control and glyphosate may remain in root and shoot residues. To evaluate potential risks associated with glyphosate residues, a pot experiment was conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions with two contrasting soils: weakly buffered acidic <b>Arenosol</b> and highly buffered Luvisol. Glyphosate was supplied as glyphosate enriched rye grass straw (1. 2 g DM kg- 1 soil) prior to sowing sunflower as a non-target plant. Several physiological parameters, such as intracellular shikimate accumulation as a metabolic indicator for glyphosate toxicity, biomass production and micronutrient status were analyzed. Detrimental effects on sunflower plants linked to glyphosate toxicity were observed only in the <b>Arenosol</b> {{but not in the}} Luvisol. This is most probably related to the difference in soil properties. The detoxification capacity of the fine-textured Luvisol, with a high clay content, was high enough for an adequate immobilization and inactivation of glyphosate. On the sandy <b>Arenosol,</b> the level of glyphosate supply exceeded the detoxification capacity. In addition to the difference in detoxification capacity, differences in nutrient bio-availability might also have aggravated the observed inhibition of nutrient acquisition. Thus, the findings suggest the importance of weed residues in transferring glyphosate from target to non-target plants, particularly in no-till or reduced tillage systems, with the consequence of detrimental effects on following crop plants...|$|E

Two adjacent cropland and grassland sites - one with a Vertisol with 23 y after conversion and one with an <b>Arenosol</b> 29 y after conversion - were sampled down to 60  cm depth. Concentrations of SOC and total nitrogen (Ntot) were measured before and after density fractionation in two light fractions and a mineral-associated fraction with C adsorbed on mineral surfaces. For the soil profiles, SOC stocks and radiocarbon (14 C) concentrations of mineral associated C were determined. Carbon stocks and mineral-associated SOC concentrations were increased in the upper 10  cm of the grassland soil compared to the cropland. This corresponded to the root-biomass distribution, with 59 % and 86 % of the total root biomass at 0 - 5  cm soil depth of the grasslands. However, at the <b>Arenosol</b> site, at 10 - 20  cm depth, C in the mineral-associated fraction was lost 29 y after the conversion into grassland. Over all, SOC stocks {{were not significantly different}} between grassland and cropland at both sites when the whole profile was taken into account. At the <b>Arenosol</b> site, the impact of land-use conversion on SOC accumulation was limited by low total clay surface area available for C stabilization. Subsoil C (30 - 50  cm) at cropland of the Vertisol site comprised 32 % of the total SOC stocks with high 14 C concentrations below the plowing horizon. We concluded that fresh C was effectively translocated into the subsoil. Thus, subsoil C has {{to be taken into account}} when land-use change effects on SOC are assessed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDetailed stratigraphic {{analysis}} and numerical dating (OSL, IRSL, ESR, 14 C) of Pleistocene coversands in southwest France enable {{the construction of}} a renewed chronostratigraphic framework for sand deposition. The chronological data obtained from sandsheet units testify to the development of transgressive dunefields since at least the Middle Pleistocene (MIS 10). Three main phases of accumulation occurred during the Last Glacial. The oldest one (64 – 42 ka) is associated with wet sandsheet facies, histic horizons and zibar-type dune fields, which reflect deposition in a context strongly influenced by the groundwater table. The Late Pleniglacial (24 – 14 ka) corresponds to the main phase of coversand extension in a drier context. Silty gley horizons suggest, however, local interruptions of sand drifting during GS 2. 1. Lateglacial stabilization of the coversands may not have occurred before GI- 1 c (Allerød), which was typified by the development of cumulic <b>arenosols.</b> These were covered by parabolic dunes during the Younger Dryas. The variations in extent of the emerged continental shelf during the glacial–interglacial cycles may explain the uneven geographical distribution of sand deposition through time. Because of coastline retreat up to 100  km north of 45 °N during the LGM lowstand, the coversands were unable to reach {{the northern part of the}} basin.

40|$|Long-term {{acidification}} {{has been}} shown to result in a considerable decrease in the amount of organically bound soil Al and in a gradual decrease in the solubility of Al. We examined the solubility of soil organic matter (SOM) and Al in four acid mineral soils (one <b>Arenosol</b> Ah, two Podzol Bh, and one Podzol Bs) as they were leached sequentially using a solution containing 0. 001 m HCl and 0. 01 m KCl. The acid leaching resulted in relative decreases in Al that were 2 - 6 times greater than for organic C. The organic C and Al dissolved by the acid leaching originated mainly in the pyrophosphate-extractable fraction of the elements. Protonation seems to be a major mechanism in stabilizing the residual SOM, as indicated by small changes in effective cation exchange capacity with the degree of acid leaching. In the samples of Podzol Bh and <b>Arenosol</b> Ah soils the solubility of Al (defined as log 10 {Al 3 } 1. 5 pH) in equilibrium suspensions (0. 01 m KCl) was closely related to the ratio of pyrophosphate-extractable Al to pyrophosphate-extractable organic C.

The flatland area is basically covered by river alluviums with main soils of chernozems, fluvisols, solonchaks and <b>arenosols.</b> Climate of the region is typically continental: warm and dry summers and cold winters vary. The area is traditionally of agricultural use, although strong afforestation was made in the late 1950 ’s.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} post-cultural {{dynamics in}} the semi-arid South-West of Madagascar (Analabo area, near the Mikea Forest). A synchronic comparison {{was performed on}} a set of abandoned fields plots aged from 2 to 30 years and on forest and savanna reference ecosystems, located on cambic <b>arenosols</b> developed from same Quaternary dune sands. The studied parameters concerned mainly a few physical and chemical soil properties (density, permeability, compaction, texture, C, N, K, P content). Important changes occur in the post-cultural succession: an increase of the soil density and compaction, and decrease of the soil upper layer permeability. Consequently, slash and burn cultivation leads to a packing and an induration of the soil surface. Results about edaphic indicators have shown that the physical parameters used better discriminate various stages of evolution than the chemical parameters do. The multivariate analysis of soil indicators shows that vegetative succession over 30 years in a forest ecosystem cleared, burnt, cultivated and left, does not lead to features corresponding to a closed-canopy forest but rather to those of a tree savanna with open, mixed woody-herbaceous vegetation. The primary dense dry deciduous regeneration of the primary forest is very low or nil. In the semi-arid SW Madagascar (Analabo region), post-cultural dynamics conditions consists in a savanna-formation process, controlled by: (1) the intensity and duration of the disturbance (during the cultivation phase); and (2) the more drastic environmental conditions (including both climate and soil).

40|$|Colluvial soils (in Polish: gleby deluwialne) are an {{important}} part of the soil cover in young morainic landscapes of northern Poland. They evolved as a result of the accumulation of eroded material at the foot of the slopes and bottoms of closed depressions. The aim of this study was to determine the systematic position of colluvial soils commonly found in the Chełmno and Brodnica Lake District, northern Poland. Ten soil pits located in different types of landscapes were selected for testing soil properties. The colluvial material is characterized by diversified properties: thickness, particle-size distribution, organic carbon content, color, pH, and base saturation. As a result, the investigated soils represent broad spectrum of typological units according to Polish Soil Classification (2011). Some of them contain epipedons mollic and meet the criteria of colluvial chernozemic soils. They were found mainly on buried black earths in areas with small slope inclinations. Many pedons contain pale colored acidic colluvial material with low base saturation and low organic carbon content and must be classified as other types: <b>arenosols</b> (in Polish: arenosole) or rusty soils (in Polish: gleby rdzawe). These soils occur mostly in areas with intensive relief and overlay the different soil types, including rusty soil and organic soils. They are formed as a result of soils lessivés and rusty soils truncation. An introduction of the additional units of “proper colluvial soils” which have epipedon ochric, and “rusty-colluvial soils” with endopedon sideric to the next edition of Polish Soil Classification would enable a more precise expression of the genesis of these soils in the type rank. Moreover, the definition of chernozemic colluvial soils could be extended to colluvial soils with umbric horizon.

Aims: Here we present a comprehensive description of the carbon cycle of two 1 ha forests plots in Allpahuayo, near Iquitos, Peru, one on an occasionally inundated alisol/gleysol landscape, the other on an <b>arenosol</b> (sandy soil). Methods: Data on the components of net primary productivity (NPP) and autotrophic respiration were collected over the period 2009 - 2011, and summed to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) and carbon use efficiency (CUE). Results: Overall, these forests showed high values of GPP (39. 05 +/- 4. 59 and 41. 88 +/- 4. 60 Mg C ha(- 1) year(- 1)). Despite the lack of a dry season, the forests showed distinct seasonality in tree growth, litterfall, flowering and fine root productivity. This showed that tropical forests with little seasonality in water supply can still exhibit distinct seasonality in NPP and carbon use, apparently synchronised to the solar radiation cycle. We found remarkably little difference in productivity between the alisol/gleysol plot and the <b>arenosol</b> plot. Conclusions: The GPP was higher than those reported for forests in Brazilian Amazonia on more infertile soils. The CUE was also higher, which {{may be related to the}} high forest dynamism and natural disturbance rate.

We carried out the study to assess the effects of chicken manure on soil chemical properties and the response of application rate on the yield of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) {{as well as the}} uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. To quantify these effects, we added chicken manure to samples of Calcisols, Arenosols and Luvisols at application rates: 5, 10, 20 and 40 % chicken manure. The addition of chicken manure irrespective of application rate did not change the acidity or pH of Calcisol, suggesting its hypo-buffering capacity. While the results reveal increases of EC with increasing rate, at rate above 40 %, the ECs were above the critical salinity level of 4 mS/cm indicating potential threat to soil productivity. The exchangeable bases increased with application rate, suggesting the positive effects of chicken manure in enhancing soil fertility. Similarly significant increase of nitrogen and phosphorus were observed following the addition of chicken manure. Initially the spinach yield increases up to optimum rate of 0. 06, 0. 07 and 0. 16 g/plant for Luvisol, <b>Arenosol</b> and Calcisol, respectively and subsequently drops after critical threshold values; 15, 5 and 1 % for Calcisol, <b>Arenosol</b> and Luvisol, respectively.

40|$|Isotopic ratio mass {{spectrometry}} (IRMS) {{has been proven}} as a promising tool for the monitoring of biogeochemical processes in soil. In this work, stable isotope signatures of light elements ¿ 15 N, ¿ 13 C, ¿ 18 O and ¿D were determined for two soils with contrasting characteristics in terms of climate, vegetation, land use and management. The studied soils were a Cambisol from a subtropical area (Paraná region, South Brazil) and an <b>Arenosol</b> from a Mediterranean climate (Andalusia, South Spain). A Flash 2000 HT (N, C, S, H and O) elemental analyzer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Delta V Advantage IRMS (Thermo Scientific) was used. Isotopic ratios are reported as parts per thousand (¿,) deviations from appropriate standards recognized by {{the international atomic energy}} agency (IAEA). In a first approach we took advantage of the well-known different ¿ 13 C signature between plants using either the C 4 or C 3 carbon fixation pathway (O¿Leary, 1981). The <b>Arenosol</b> (Spain) revealed a ¿ 13 C signature which is clearly in the range of C 3 plants (- 26 to - 30 ¿,). Different plant canopies (tree, shrubs or ferns) caused only slight variations ¿ 13 C (STD= 0. 98). In contrast, the Cambisol (Brazil) showed less depletion of the heavier carbon isotope corresponding to C 4 predominant vegetation. In addition an increase from - 19 ¿ in the soil surface (0 ¿ 5 cm) to - 16 ¿ in the subsoil (20 ¿ 30 cm) was observed in line with a recent (2 years old) shift of the land use from the predominant C 4 grassland to eucalypt (C 3) cultivation. Crossplots of ¿ 15 N vs. ¿ 18 O may provide information about nitrate (NO 3 -) sources and N cycling (Kendall, 1998). In the Mediterranean <b>Arenosol</b> this signal (¿ 18 O = 30 ¿, ¿ 15 N = 2 ¿,) was found compatible with a predominant nitrate atmospheric deposition, whereas the signal in the Brazilian Cambisol pointed to the use of a mineral N fertilization with signs of denitrification processes (¿ 18 O = 13 ¿, ¿ 15 N = 9 ¿,). No conclusive results could be obtained from the ¿D isotopic signature probably due to overlapping of the ¿D signals from the organic and the mineral fractions. For a more detailed analysis steps allowing their separation are necessary (Ruppenthal et al. (2013) and references therein). Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{semi-arid}} areas drought {{results in}} cattle death making people vulnerable to poverty. Drought conditions {{are set to}} increase as climate change is increasingly becoming an important threat to food security. In southern Africa, people recently discovered Neorautanenia brachypus (Harms) C. A. Sm., as an important medicinal feed that they now use to help cattle survive drought. N. brachypus was evaluated {{with the aim of}} providing scientific substantiation of peoples’ claims by determining the extent of its use, feed and anthelmintic value, and the ecological characteristics that explain its distribution. Information on characteristics and use of N. brachypus was gathered from focus group discussions and a semi-quantitative survey that employed structured interviews with both closed and open questions. The results showed that N. brachypus is used during drought by 59 % of cattle owners, 14. 5 % do not use it because they have alternative grazing, and 26. 5 % did not know it can be used as cattle feed. Feed value of N. brachypus was evaluated as well as the anthelmintic value in the feeding trials with cattle and goats. N. brachypus contains adequate nutrients to maintain ruminant livestock during a drought. Infected animals fed on N. brachypus ended with less strongyloid worm infection in small ruminants (P < 0. 05) and in large ruminants (P < 0. 01) similar to animals dosed with the conventional recommended drugs. In the natural environment, N. brachypus was more commonly found in eutric vertisols and chromic luvisols than in ferric <b>arenosols</b> and leptosols, more in open spaces than in closed forests and more in cultivated areas than in naturally vegetated areas. It grows in a range of different types of soils and management affects its abundance. Ethnobotanical studies can offer important options on adaptation of human livelihoods to climate change...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{sustainable}} vineyard management is needed at varied scales and particularly at farm-scale. More and more winegrowers wish to adopt environmental-friendly practices while better controlling harvest composition. This leads to question complex issues {{with regard to}} sustainability of winegrowing agroecosystem and the adoption of new soil and vineyard management practices {{that are likely to}} favour a long-term preservation of quality production together with soil ecosystem functions. This study aims at elaborating a multivariate approach framework for vineyard soil fertility assessment over a 6 ha-farm planted with rainfed black Grenache and Syrah varieties in the Southern Rhone Valley. In a previous study carried out at the regional scale, soil landscape and potential terroir units had been characterized. A new field survey comprising _ 20 soil pits, physico-chemical analyses for all soil profile horizons, and a series of additional soil surface samples analyzed for several parameters including soil organic carbon, calcium carbonate, copper and the major mineral nutrients, is here carried out. Along with soil parameters and soil surface condition, vine biological parameters including vigour, presence of diseases, stock-unearthing are collected. Very high resolution multispectral satellite data and resistivity EMI data are acquired and processed in order to characterize spatial variations in both physiological responses, soil surface conditions, soil depth and/or the presence of coarse elements. Multi-temporal historical aerial photographs are used in order to complement farmer’s surveys regarding past management practices. The farm is characterized by a diversity of soils including Red Mediterranean soils (chromic luvisols), colluvic calcisols, <b>arenosols,</b> fluvisols, and regosols, which develop from top to slope then bottom of a Neogene molassic and conglomeratic plateau. Soil management past practices are marked by the absence of chemical/organic manuring in the last decades, resulting in erosional features and weakened vines. Relationships between vine spatial variability, soil spatial variability and the impact of past practices are analyzed and result in formalizing decision rules. Several restoration scenarios are then proposed, that focus either on chemical fertilizer and/or organic amendment and/or interrow cover and/or agroforestry practices...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliography. This thesis {{introduces}} {{the environment and}} the vegetation of the Namaqualand coastal belt between Port Nolloth and Alexander Bay. Aspects of the abiotic environment are discussed and related to patterns and processes observed in the vegetation of the study area. The restoration of the natural vegetation impacted by diamond mining activities is discussed. 1 - 4 The study area, located within the winter rainfall area of the Namib Desert, is one of four global fog deserts. The area is characterised by a near ubiquitous covering of Recent to Tertiary amorphous dunes of marine origin. The dunes can be divided into two broad categories: Recent, mobile white dunes, and Tertiary to Late Quaternary, semi-mobile red dunes. The red dune soils are considered <b>arenosols,</b> underlain by dorbank and calcrete hardpans, whereas the white dunes generally lack this structure, unless they are superimposed on an older dune series. The dune landscape is interrupted by outcrops of bedrock, such as river canyons (Holgat River); inselbergs (Buchu Twins); and koppies. Gravel plains and rocky outcrops cover much of the area on the south bank of the Orange River, as far south as Cape Voltas. The low rainfall (< 70 mm) is offset by frequent fog and dew. Summers are dominated by high energy, southerly winds and winters by gentle land-sea breezes interrupted by occasional, warm-easterly "berg" winds. A complete bio-inventory of higher plants of the study area was undertaken. Patterns of diversity and endemism were analysed in relation to plant growth form and habitat. 300 plant species were collected in the study area representing 40 families, with 28 being endemic to the coastal region. The flora is dominated by the Asteraceae (53 species), Mesembryanthemaceae (47), Crassulaceae (28), Poaceae (17) and Aizoaceae (15). Endemic species are over-represented in the Mesembryanthemaceae (60 endemic) and Crassulaceae (44), and under represented in the Asteraceae (8), Poaceae (0) and Aizoaceae (0). Rocky outcrops have the highest species:area ratio (3. 77). They are characterised by their own distinct flora as well as representing a significant proportion (46) of the species from the surrounding dune landscape. Endemic species are concentrated on these, {{as well as on the}} gravel plain habitats. Dune habitats are the most widespread. However, they are characterised by a widespread, generalist flora with low species:area ratio (0. 81), few endemics, and share an expected number of species with other habitat types (21). An endemic species in the southern Namib can be characterised as being a dwarf leaf succulent in the Mesembryanthemaceae which is most likely to be encountered on a rocky outcrop...|$|R
40|$|A {{new site}} with Lateglacial palaeosols covered by 0. 8 - 2. 4 m thick aeolian sands is presented. The buried soils were {{subjected}} to multidisciplinary analyses (pedology, micromorphology, geochronology, dendrology, palynology, macrofossils). The buried soil cover comprises a catena from relatively dry ('Nano'-Podzol, <b>Arenosol)</b> via moist (Histic Gleysol, Gleysol) to wet conditions (Histosol). Dry soils {{are similar to the}} so-called Usselo soil, as described from sites in NW Europe and central Poland. The buried soil surface covers ca. 3. 4 km** 2. Pollen analyses date this surface into the late Aller 0 d. Due to a possible contamination by younger carbon, radiocarbon dates are too young. OSL dates indicate that the covering by aeolian sands most probably occurred during the Younger Dryas. Botanical analyses enables the reconstruction of a vegetation pattern typical for the late Allerod. Large wooden remains of pine and birch were recorded...|$|E
30|$|Soil {{samples were}} taken using Egner’s bow from the topsoil layer (0 – 20  cm) of agriculturally {{exploited}} sites (three replicates of 2  kg, consisting of about 50 samples {{taken from a}} 100  m 2 area). Arable soils were collected from non-ploughed sites {{in order to avoid}} artifacts from ploughing perturbations (Wolińska et al. 2014). Consistently, control samples were taken from non-agriculturally cultivated and non-forested sites (at least 1 -ha area) located in close vicinity to the basic soils and belonging to the same soil type (Table  1). As a control, old meadows or field-woodlots were selected. For the study, five types of soils were chosen: Haplic Luvisol, Brunic <b>Arenosol,</b> Mollic Gleysol, Eutric Fluvisol, and Rendzina Leptosol. Under laboratory conditions, each sample was passed through a 2.0 -mm sieve to remove large pieces of rocks and plant material and stored at 4  °C prior analysis.|$|E
40|$|Classification of soils {{according}} to internationally agreed criteria forms a valuable base for scientifi c and political analyses. The objectives {{of this study}} were to evaluate two soil classification systems and relate them to agricultural and environmental concerns, principally phosphorus leakage, by classifying three Swedish, arable soils. The Bjärröd soil was classifi ed as a Rupti-Endogleyic Phaeozem {{according to}} the World Reference Base for Soil Resources and as a coarse-loamy, mesic Oxiaquic Hapludoll according to the Soil Taxonomy. Bjelkesta was classified as an Orthieutric Gleysol and a fi ne, frigid, Typic Endoaquept, respectively, and Götala as a Haplic <b>Arenosol</b> and a frigid Typic Udipsamment. We evaluated some changes to the classification systems proposed by Nordic scientists and found the classification of Bjärröd misleading and suggest it being classified as a Cambisol/Inceptisol and that information of the characteristically high base saturation in Bjelkesta and the spodic character in Götala being included in their names. This information is useful for decisions regarding agrarian and environmental management of the soils. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was {{to assess the impact of}} forest site types on the ionic composition of the soil sorption complex and soil water extracts in a soil profile. Three forest site types: coniferous forest (CF), coniferous-deciduous forest (CDF), and deciduousconiferous forest (DCF), were selected for the studies. Three dominant soil types were distinguished on the studied plots: Haplic Podzol, Dystric <b>Arenosol,</b> and Dystric Cambisol. Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), and aluminium (Al) in the soil sorption complex and soil water extracts were determined. Ca is a dominant cation in the soil sorption complex in organic horizon, while Al in mineral soil horizons. The differences between forest site types in ionic composition of soil water extracts were observed, mainly in the organic horizon and the horizons below the rooting zone. The vegetation affected the Ca/Al and base cations to Al molar (BC/Al) ratios. The Ca/Al and the BC/Al molar ratios increased in the sequence of sites: CF < CDF < DCF...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{comparative studies}} on {{soil organic matter}} stocks and indices of the soil’s ecochemical state under Empetro nigri-Pinetum (En-P) and Vaccinio uliginosi-Betuletum pubescentis (Vu-Bp) in the Słowiński National Park. The investigated plant communities are associated with Arenosols that developed from eolian sands and are exposed to high groundwater levels. The presence of fossil Histosol {{at a depth of}} 75 cm in the Vu-Bp stand, which lies below the current groundwater level, is the factor that sets both stands apart. The fossil soil strongly differs from <b>Arenosol</b> in terms of its chemical composition. A high abundance of nutrients in bioavailable forms in the soil {{is one of the reasons}} for natural renewal of downy birch in the stand, which presence in turn affects the turnover of elements and the properties of <b>Arenosol.</b> The results of our studies confirm the existence of strong feedback between the soil and plant communities. Soils under the mixed pine-birch Vu-Bp stand are characterized by smaller stocks of organic matter and total organic carbon (TOC) contained in the ectohumus as compared to the soils under the pure pine En-P stand. The opposite is found in the humic horizon. Additionally, in the Vu-Bp stand we observed greater accumulation of total nitrogen (TN) in ectohumus, which is reflected in lower TOC:TN ratios. The contents of TN and TOC:TN ratios in humic horizons were similar in both stands. The soils under En-P were more strongly acidified, especially in O-horizons. Mineral horizons in both stands were characterized by a very small sorptive capacity, which increased in ectohumus and fossil soil. Significant differences between the stands were observed in the ionic composition of sorptive complexes. The soils under Vu-Bp stand were more strongly saturated with basic cations, predominantly calcium. In soil solums of both stands, we observed a deficit of bioavailable potassium and magnesium, which was partially compensated by significant amounts of these components in ectohumus and fossil soil in the Vu-Bp stand. Despite a strongly acidic pH, molar Ca:Al ratios suggest that there are no phytotoxic effects due to free aluminium in ectohumus, while they are unlikely in mineral horizons. The risk of phytotoxic effects is reduced by the influx of calcium from groundwater...|$|E

All the materials were used separately, to supply the following amounts of N to the crop: 0, 75, 100 and 125 kg N/ha. Plant growth, nitrogen uptake and nitrogen content of soil after the experiments were evaluated. Nitrate and phospsorus leaching losses from the pots as well as organic matter fractionation were determined at the end of both experiments. Pig slurries in general, were the treatments that allowed higher productions, higher N uptake and lower N losses. Digested slurry was responsible for the greater P losses by leaching. Treatments where pulse fertilizers were applied led to the higher accumulation of N in the soil...|$|E
