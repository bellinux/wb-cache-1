40|$|ABSTRACT: The soils {{examined}} {{are from}} <b>alluvial</b> <b>sheet</b> deposits {{in a high}} valley where they are subjected to alternate wetting and drying, leading to desiccation. They are principally derived from shale and limestone bedrock in the surrounding mountains which are rapidly eroded and transported down valley mainly when the snow melts. The soils have engineering properties of fairly low density, high permeability, high plasticity with the plasticity index above the A line (CH range). These properties are correlated with the size grading and the clay mineralogical composition [...] about 30 ~ ca/cite, 45 - 50 ~ clay minerals, dominated by Fen+ and Mg-smectites and fine-grained muscovite. The clay mineralogy isexplained in terms of Millot's zone of smectitization affecting biotite from detrital shale fragments, the muscovite remaining substantially unaltered. Calcite solution and redeposition account for the chalky texture and strong bond...|$|E
40|$|A {{geologic}} {{map of the}} Nez Perce drainage basin in southwestern Montana offers {{an understanding of the}} developing paleotopography of the area following the Laramide orogeny, ca. 65 ma. In this project, a small drainage basin was studied in detail, focusing on the geomorphology, structure, lithology, and ages of the various rock units. Based on the results of these studies and the relationships found among four major gravel units mapped within the basin, the basin development was approximated. The youngest unit is a fine-grained (mean diameter = 8. 23 cm) channel deposit within Nez Perce Creek, sourced from within the basin, based upon gneiss and quartzite derived from the present drainage. The next-youngest unit is a fine-grained (mean diameter = 10. 92 cm) <b>alluvial</b> <b>sheet</b> deposit forming broad flat surfaces adjacent to Nez Perce Creek in the central basin, which was also sourced from within the present drainage based upon gneiss and quartzite derived from the present drainage. The next unit, a coarse-grained (mean diameter = 22. 90 cm) Miocene gravel creating the western divide of the basin, was sourced from the Highland Mountains to the north. The oldest unit, a coarse-grained (mean diameter = 39. 88 cm) debris flow, is interlayered with Eocene basalt and rhyolite tuff, allowing its age to be bracketed to ca. 48 ma using Ar 39 /Ar 40. Based on unique lithology, this unit was sourced from the Pioneer Mountains to the east. One large fault separates Archean gneiss bedrock {{on the east side of}} the basin from younger gravel deposits on the west. Several younger normal faults within the divide gravel indicate tectonic activity more recent than the Miocene time. This evidence of recent faulting, along with a lack of evidence of geomorphology shaped by fluvial erosion, indicates that basin development was more recent than previously assumed (Reynolds, 1979; Rupple, 1993) and was controlled more by structural than by fluvial forces...|$|E
40|$|An <b>alluvial</b> <b>sheet,</b> {{in places}} 130 m thick and over 2000 km 2 in area, {{together}} with an extensive palaeovalley network and scattered source bordering and terrestrial sand dunes provide a history of drainage and landscape development {{in the middle and}} upper Shoalhaven catchment over the last 45 to 60 million years. This record tests the applicability, for this highland catchment, of models of longterm landscape evolution the passive margin of eastern Australia. It also provides a comparison to lake shore and slope deposits within neighbouring catchments upon which much of our understanding of Late Quaternary climate changes within southeast Australia is based. This study shows that mid Oligocene basalt flows dammed the Shoalhaven River downstream of the eastward bend near Tallong to form a lake approximately 100 km in length. In fact, within a relatively brief period of time Lake Tolwong formed twice; the second episode being considerably longer. Into Lake Tolwong were deposited two separate units of well laminated silts and clays, separated by a thin conglomeratic sequence representing a brief return to fluvial conditions. Each of the lacustrine units contains a well preserved spore and pollen assemblage, from cool temperate rainforest taxa, which can be equated with the Early to middle Oligocene lower Proteaceidites tuberculatus Zone of the Gippsland Basin. The second lacustrine unit reached a thickness of 60 m before being partially stripped and fluvially reworked following the progradation of approximately 50 m of coarse deltaic sediments. Basalt damming of the Endrick River and Limekiln Creek, eastern and western tributary networks within the Shoalhaven catchment, during the Middle Eocene also accounts for the accumulation of lacustrine sedimentary sequences in these valleys. Deposition of these sedimentary sequences has occurred within an extensive palaeovalley network carved into the Shoalhaven Plain. These valleys were excavated into a landsurface which in places was deeply weathered down to at least 150 m and, in other areas, capped with a thin sheet of well silicified, generally fine grained sands and shallow valley fills of well ferruginised coarse sands and gravels. The age of the palaeovalley network places a minimum age on the deep weathering and deposition of the high level duricrusted sediments throughout the catchment. This age must be at least very Early Tertiary. These Tertiary sedimentary sequences and palaeovalleys provide further evidence of the great antiquity of drainage patterns within the Shoalhaven catchment, well as the very slow rates of geomorphic change within a tectonically stable landscape that has experienced a stable and humid climate for much of its history. They also show that highland fluvial systems such as the Shoalhaven can evolve independently of external base level controls. The Quaternary alluvial terraces of the upper catchment provide clues to the behaviour the Shoalhaven River during the Miocene and Pliocene for they show that upstream of the headward advancing Shoalhaven gorge the Shoalhaven River did not re-excavate its Oligocene alluvial fill until probably the Pleistocene. Throughout the Miocene, a period traditionally regarded to have been one dominated by planation to produce the Shoalhaven Plain, the river moved freely across its Oligocene sedimentary base reworking only the upper 10 - 20 m of fill. The Late Pleistocene saw several episodes of valley incision and aggradation. The upper five alluvial terraces at Larbet, near Braidwood are much thicker and contain considerably coarser sediments than the lowest terrace and contemporary floodplain. Thermoluminescence dates from the floodplain and four lowest terraces, spanning a period from 7 - 460 ka, reveal that the Shoalhaven was a much more active stream prior to 57 ka. The period 20 - 35 ka, generally regarded as a time in which streams throughout southeastern Australia were active and receiving much sediment as a product of widespread slope instability, is registered as a relatively insignificant period of fluvial activity in the Shoalhaven valley. It is likely that the 14 C chronologies of slope and shore deposits in neighbouring highland catchments have identified only the dwindling stages of a much wetter period prior to the last glacial maximum which, in the Shoalhaven catchment, culminated in dry, windy conditions and the development of source bordering and terrestrial dunes between 6 - 19 ka...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe geomorphological {{response}} of valley bottoms in eastern France to climatic fluctuations of the Little Ice Age (LIA) was investigated using sedimentological analysis together with {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) and radiocarbon dating. Diachronic mapping of land use {{since the beginning of}} the nineteenth century was also carried out. Since A. D. 1500, the valley bottoms experienced three cycles of aggradation and subsequent incision, each characterized by paired periods of high and low detritic activity. While the impact of human activity on the aggradation of the alluvial plain is observed, the vertical dynamics of the valley bottom deposits seemingly were also linked to the hydroclimatic fluctuations during the LIA. The sensitivity to these fluctuations was increased by human activity at the scale of the basin. Variations of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and solar activity from the last five centuries correlate with wet and cold phases during which valley bottoms accumulated, and dry and warm phases during which the streams incised into the valley floors. This fluvial sensitivity to the meteorological conditions induced temporal variations in sedimentary supply originating from either direct input from remnants of periglacial <b>alluvial</b> <b>sheets</b> or local rocky outcrops and/or from indirect input from the erosion of alluvial and colluvial deposits. These two components, combined with the sheet runoff over the ploughlands, express the complex coupling between hillslopes and valley bottoms in the headwater catchments. This caused a cascade-shaped transit of the sediments characterized by alternating phases of storage and removal.
