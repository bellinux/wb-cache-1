Militarily, he wanted to conquer the Dacians and Parthians, and avenge the loss at Carrhae. Thus, he instituted a massive mobilisation. Shortly before his assassination, the Senate named him censor for life and Father of the Fatherland, and the month of Quintilis was renamed July in his honour.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1602 two {{merchant}} ships sailed {{from the}} Philippines to New Spain. They were beset by storms {{and unable to}} complete the voyage. The Santa Maria took refuge in the Ladrones Guam for forty days before sailing back to Manila. They were {{able to pick up}} most of the Spaniards left there by the Santa Margarita in 1600. The other ship, the Espiritu Santo, having lost its mainmast, put into port in Japan. There they were on the point of being held captive by the Japanese, who apparently intended to gain control of its cargo. Nevertheless, they did manage to sail out of the harbor with a jury-rigged mainmast. To do so, they had to leave a few hostage crewmen behind <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> rattan cable across the harbor entrance. There was some gunfire on both sides, and a few people were killed.|$|E
25|$|In 1915 the Order of the Arrow (OA) {{was founded}} at Treasure Island by the Camp Director, E. Urner Goodman, and Assistant Camp Director Carroll A. Edson. The W. W. W. (the {{original}} {{name of the}} OA in the Lenni Lenape language) {{was designed as a}} camp honor fraternity that would emphasize the ideals of Scouting through the use of ceremonies and American Indian lore. At the beginning of the camping season, Goodman explored the island to find a suitable site for the Council Fire and for the rituals of his new program. A natural amphitheater was chosen {{on the south side of}} the island that was secluded from the rest of the camp. On the day of the first induction campfire, July 16, 1915, Goodman and one of his staff members, Harry A. Yoder, cleared the brush for the new ceremonial grounds, built the altar, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> trail leading from the camp. This new ceremonial ring continued to be used for OA ceremonies and for the camp's campfire programs until Treasure Island closed. At the end of the camping season that year, the new Order contained twenty-five members who selected the totem and names for Unami Lodge.|$|E
25|$|A major {{development}} {{began in}} 1764, when {{a body of}} people called Holderness Drainage obtained an Act of Parliament which excluded land {{to the east of}} the River Hull from the jurisdiction of the Court of Sewers. They employed the engineers John Smeaton and John Grundy, Jr. to advise on a scheme for the Holderness level, and the main Holderness Drain was completed by October 1767. Work continued on building banks and drains until 1772, by which time the works had cost Â£24,000. The success of the scheme resulted in several areas {{to the west of the}} river attempting to improve drainage. Cottingham was the first, obtaining an Act of Parliament in 1766 which allowed them to enclose the land <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> new drain to join the Hull at Stoneferry. The Beverley and Skidby Drainage Act of 1785 was obtained to improve an area below Beverley by cutting a new drain which carried the water to a point further down the Hull. The area had previously been drained to a sluice called Wharton's clow at Cottingham since 1747. Flooding in these two areas had never been as serious as that in the carrs further to the north, and in 1796, the landowners started to consider how this might be remedied.|$|E

25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the event was between The Sandman, Mikey Whipwreck and Steve Austin with the three feuding over the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Whipwreck was the {{champion}} {{heading into the}} event. A match was booked between Whipwreck and The Sandman for the title on October 28, 1995. However, moments before the match began, Steve Austin appeared <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> promo on Whipwreck, The Sandman and Woman, who was Sandman's manager. He stated that he would soon be ECW World Heavyweight Champion. He distracted The Sandman by taking Woman backstage during the bout. Whipwreck won the title by pinning The Sandman. Many ECW wrestlers congratulated Whipwreck after the contest including Cactus Jack and Axl Rotten. The Sandman earned a rematch clause on November 4, but lost his rematch against Whipwreck. At November to Remember, Whipwreck was scheduled to face The Sandman, but before the match, Austin, kayfabe, attacked The Sandman, hitting him repeatedly with the cane. As a result, the match was changed to Whipwreck versus Austin, marking Austin's ECW in-ring debut. Austin would lose against Whipwreck, as Whipwreck pinned Austin, grabbing the tights after a sunset flip. After the bout, Austin, enraged about the loss, viciously attacked Whipwreck. This led to the Three Way Dance for December to Dismember.|$|E

The following week on Raw, Lynch gained revenge over Paige and defeated her in a singles match.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused {{primarily}} on constructing difficult grooves for songs. To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> drum part without having a melody in mind. He recounted his approach for the album to Musician, saying that [...] "I just played what I felt, working {{from a sense of}} 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.' And Robbie would come in the next night and lay a bass part." [...] Unlike most reggae or funk bassists, Shakespeare approached his playing as a jazz soloist and attempted numerous subtle variations to his riff. He said that his inspiration [...] "comes from God. Sometimes endless ideas just keep coming to me. Sometimes I'll change the drum pattern to a bass line and Sly will play the bass line on the drums." [...] Along with live percussion, Dunbar played Simmons drums, and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording. Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "magnificent and accurate" [...] Shakespeare edition which Boydell {{began in}} 1786 {{was to be}} the focus of his enterpriseâhe viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an {{advertisement}} prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that [...] "splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition". [...] The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. [...] Each play had its own title page followed by a list of [...] "Persons in the Drama". [...] Boydell spared no expense. [...] He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> new typeface specifically for the edition. [...] Nicol explains in the preface that they [...] "established a printing-house ... a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805.|$|E

500|$|The ice {{surface was}} very broken up, making travel slow and difficult. At first the parties {{were able to}} travel along a track that had been marked out by the advance parties. However, recent storms had {{destroyed}} much of the trail, and in places progress was held up by breaking ice which at one point almost wrecked Bartlett's camp as his team slept. On 28 February all the parties came together {{in front of the}} first of a series of high ridges, from [...] in height, that halted their progress. These stretched east and west, blocking any route to the island. McKinlay, Hadley and Chafe were sent on a risky journey back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up supplies that had been left there, while the rest slowly chopped <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> pathway through the towering ridges. When McKinlay's group returned to the main party a week later, the path forward had been advanced by only three miles (5km), but the worst of the ridges had been overcome. Hadley claimed that the ridges were worse than anything he had seen in his long years of Arctic experience. The later stages of the journey were easier, as the group travelled over steadily smoother ice, and on 12 March they reached land, a long spit of sand stretching out from the northern shores of Wrangel Island.|$|E
500|$|After {{a series}} of co-starring film roles, Lopez {{received}} her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in Selena, a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice {{is used for the}} musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip syncing. When asked in an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: [...] "I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." [...] After filming Selena, Lopez was [...] "really feeling [...] Latin roots" [...] <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled [...] "Vivir Sin Ti", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the album, Lopez was {{aware of the fact that}} she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career." ...|$|E

In June 2007, The Miz was moved to the brand, prompting a storyline in which all three members of Extreme ExposÃ© were attracted to him. When Kelly shifted her attentions towards Balls Mahoney, Layla, Brooke, and Miz mocked her, and Miz later prevented her from going on a date with Mahoney, stating that he owned her contract and would fire her if she did so. On November 1, Brooke was released from her WWE contract, and Extreme ExposÃ© dissolved as a group, leaving Kelly and Layla to enter an ongoing rivalry with more active wrestling roles. On the October 29 episode of Raw, Kelly won a battle royal to earn a match against the WWE Women's Champion, Beth Phoenix. After the match however, Kelly was attacked by Phoenix and lost the subsequent match between the two the following week on Raw. Kelly continued to feud with Layla, and they were on opposite sides of a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, which Kelly's team won. In December, Layla formed an alliance with Victoria, which expanded to include Lena Yada in January 2008, and Kelly continued to feud with the trio. At WrestleMania XXIV, Kelly was a [...] "lumberjill" [...] for the Divas' tag team lumberjill match.
