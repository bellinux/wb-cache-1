5|$|One day, Rachmat hears {{screaming}} and finds Atikah, who has fainted after seeing a snake. After she regains consciousness, Atikah thanks him for rescuing her. Although Rachmat is disgusted {{that he has}} helped her after learning the identity of Atikah's father, as Rachmat and Atikah dedicate their time to social work, they begin to fall in love. Doerachman, however, disapproves of their relationship, and refuses to fund their work; as a result, Atikah takes her deceased mother's jewellery and some {{money to pay for}} village development. Later, when Rachmat and Atikah are sitting together and singing romantic songs, Mardjan overhears them. Hurrying back to Doerachman's home, Mardjan convinces his boss that Rachmat intends only to steal Doerachman's wealth, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Mardjan marry Atikah. As Doerachman prepares to leave, Mardjan has the illiterate hadji put his seal on a letter.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{development}} processes of Ultimate Play the Game, which was known for its avoidance of media spotlight. Its founders, brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, were infamously taciturn both to preserve their time <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> their games speak for themselves. Though as the Sabreman series became popular, their silence contributed to the series' mystique. The main criticism of Underwurlde predecessor and the first game in the Sabreman series, Sabre Wulf, was its similarity to an earlier game by the Stamper brothers, as both were depicted in a top-down view as action-adventure games. While Retro Gamer wrote that the sequel, Underwurlde, resolved this criticism by instead using a side view as a platform game, Ultimate Play the Game also had a reputation for releasing games outside the order in which they were developed. Indeed, the Stamper brothers claimed to have finished their third Sabreman title, the epochal Knight Lore, in advance of both of its predecessors. The Stampers primarily developed for the ZX Spectrum home computer and outsourced the work of converting their games to work on other types of computers to external developers more familiar with the hardware architecture of other platforms. For instance, Firebird created the Commodore 64 releases of Sabre Wulf and Underwurlde. The game released alongside Knight Lore for the ZX Spectrum near the 1984 holiday season, and the Commodore 64 version released a year later.|$|E

25|$|Greenspan entered {{government}} in the 70s, and became Chairman of the Federal Reserve. In 1992, he visited the newly elected Bill Clinton. He persuaded him to let the markets grow, cut taxes, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the markets stabilise themselves {{with the help of}} computer technology, to create the New economy. This involved using computer models to predict risks and hedge against them, in accordance with the Californian Ideology. However, by 1996, the production figures had failed to increase, but profits were nevertheless rising, and Greenspan suggested that it wasn't working. After political attacks from all sides, Greenspan changed his mind and decided that perhaps the New Economy was real after all, but that it couldn't be measured using normal economic measures, and so the apparent boom continued.|$|E
25|$|A more {{detailed}} Georgian government account was released later on August 30. According to it, the crisis had begun on August 28, when the armed group captured a patrol of the Border Police of Georgia {{who had been}} searching for the five missing local residents. The gunmen agreed to an offer by a senior border guard officer to keep just him as a hostage <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go the civilians and the other border guards. Later, an official from the Georgian Interior Ministry arrived to negotiate and demanded their surrender, which was rejected. The group then decided to swap the last captive border guard for the official, telling him {{that he is now}} their hostage. Two of the gunmen then accompanied the official to a location where he could talk with his superiors to update them about the new developments, but instead they were led to an ambush site, where one of them was shot dead by a government sniper. The shooting sparked a firefight, in which 10 more members of the armed group and three Georgian troops were killed. Georgian forces used helicopters and aerial drones.|$|E

25|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{notes in}} The Uses of Enchantment that the 18th-century fairy tale Beauty and the Beast is {{a version of}} Cupid and Psyche. Motifs from Apuleius occur in several fairy tales, {{including}} Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin, in versions collected by folklorists trained in the classical tradition, such as Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. In the Grimm version, Cinderella is given the task of sorting lentils and peas from ash, and is aided by birds just as ants help Psyche in the sorting of grain and legumes imposed on her by Venus. Like Cinderella, Psyche has two envious sisters who compete with her for the most desirable male. Cinderella's sisters mutilate their own feet to emulate her, while Psyche's are dashed to death on a rocky cliff. In Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, the Little Mermaid is given a dagger by her sisters, who, {{in an attempt to}} end all the suffering she endured <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her become a mermaid again, attempt to persuade her to use it to slay the Prince while he is asleep with his new bride. She cannot bring herself to kill the Prince, however. Unlike Psyche, who becomes immortal, she doesn't receive his love in return, but she, nevertheless, ultimately earns the eternal soul she yearns for.|$|E

500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{was that}} Anderson {{had suggested that}} {{the water in the}} caisson chambers should be at a lower level than that in the canal. This had not been implemented, and so the lower caisson would not sink deep enough for either boat to be floated out. Attempts to fit gates <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the water in the chamber drain to waste had proved ineffective. Ultimately, lock chambers were built {{at the foot of the}} each lift. These were filled with water from the upper level, so that the boat could float out, and it then descended the final [...] as it would in a conventional lock. Only the lift at Greenham used Anderson's principle, and included a proper drain to lower the level in the chambers.|$|E
500|$|In Beni Suef, {{south of}} Cairo, 17 protesters {{were killed by}} police as the protesters {{attempted}} to attack two police stations. In Abu Zabaal prison in Cairo, eight people were killed as police clashed with inmates trying to escape. According to a Reuters tally, these unconfirmed deaths brought the death toll to at least 100. Several Islamist terrorists and others escaped. Prison overcrowding and police brutality were voiced {{by many of the}} protesters. Emad Gad, an analyst with the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, said that he had obtained information from a trustworthy source that [...] "there have been orders from the very top to free known felons from the prisons, to arm them <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them mingle with protesters." [...] Two Egyptian policemen jailed following the death of anti-corruption activist Khaled Said were among the hundreds of prisoners that escaped in Cairo that day.|$|E

Mertopuro of Grobogan, {{one of the more}} vocal advocates of active resistance, was tasked with the instigation of Chinese in his area. Within 's capital at Kartosuro, he ordered the restoration of the siti inggil kidul (a kind of terrace) outside his court, thus giving him a reason to tell the Dutch that he had no manpower to spare. Despite Visscher receiving intelligence of 's dealings, he trusted the Sunan due to his previous loyalty to the company.|$|E

500|$|Glosserman and {{the rest}} of the {{production}} team met together to put together a focus for the film; they centered their efforts on answering the question: [...] "How does Wikipedia get at the truth?" [...] They also wanted to provide information for everyday individuals wanting to know about Wikipedia's background and functioning. Experts were sought out, including the author of The Age of American Unreason Susan Jacoby, to discuss Wikipedia's approach to scholars knowledgeable about specific subject matter. Glosserman commented in an interview with IndieWire, [...] "We tried to get people offering compelling arguments for either side of any particular topic because our intention was to be objective <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the viewer make up his or her own mind." [...] The narrative structure of the film What the Bleep Do We Know!? served as an inspiration for Glosserman during the production process.

500|$|Congress {{convened in}} December 1860, {{with several of}} the {{southern}} states already pledging to secede. [...] Stevens was unyielding in opposing efforts to appease the southerners, such as the Crittenden Compromise, which would have enshrined slavery as beyond constitutional amendment. He stated, in a remark widely quoted both North and South, that rather than offer concessions because of Lincoln's election, he would see [...] "this Government crumble into a thousand atoms", and that {{the forces of the}} United States would crush any rebellion. Despite Stevens's protests, the lame-duck Buchanan administration did little in response to the secession votes, allowing most federal resources in the South to fall into rebel hands. Many, even in the abolition movement, were content to let it be so, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the South go its own way. [...] Stevens did not agree, and the congressman was [...] "undoubtedly pleased" [...] by Lincoln's statement in his first inaugural address on March 4, 1861, that he would [...] "hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the Government".|$|E
500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner.

Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, {{but he wants to}} have some fun. The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete was miserable. Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E
