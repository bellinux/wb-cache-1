5|$|News reports {{described}} the incident {{as the biggest}} {{of its kind in}} peacetime Europe <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> biggest such explosion in the United Kingdom since the 1974 Flixborough disaster. The flames had been extinguished by the afternoon of 13 December 2005. However, one storage tank re-ignited that evening, which the fire-fighters left to burn rather than attempting to extinguish it again.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{prepared}} a massive strike for 737, however, intended {{to end the}} war for good. Marwan apparently went to Damascus in person to persuade Hisham to back this project and was successful: an army 120,000 strong was assembled, comprising regular forces of Syria and the Jazira, as well as volunteers for the jihad, Armenian troops under Ashot Bagratuni, and even armed camp followers and servants. The number is clearly an exaggeration, but whatever the real size of Marwan's army, it was a huge force <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> largest ever sent against the Khazars. Marwan first secured his rear by subduing the Armenian factions who were hostile to the Arabs and their client Ashot. He then pushed into Iberia, driving its Chosroid ruler to seek refuge in the fortress of Anakopia on the Black Sea coast, in the Byzantine protectorate of Abkhazia. Marwan laid siege to Anakopia itself, but he was forced to retire due to the outbreak of dysentery among his troops.|$|E

25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{confirmed that}} ACE inhibitors are effective <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> first-line choice in hypertension treatment. This meta-analysis {{was based on}} 20 trials and a cohort of 158,998 patients, of whom 91% were hypertensive. ACE inhibitors were used as the active treatment in seven trials (n=76,615) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 13 trials (n=82,383).|$|E

25|$|Dollery's {{principal}} claim to fame, though, was {{as one of}} the first professional captains in English first-class cricket, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> first successful one. Appointed joint Warwickshire captain in 1948, he took sole charge the following year and retained the post for seven seasons. In 1951, he led the county to their first County Championship title since 1911, and only their second ever.|$|E
25|$|James the Red Engine was notable as {{the first}} book to be {{illustrated}} by C. Reginald Dalby, {{perhaps the most famous}} of the Railway Series artists, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most controversial. Dalby illustrated every volume up to Percy the Small Engine (1956), and also produced new illustrations for The Three Railway Engines and made changes to those of Thomas the Tank Engine.|$|E
25|$|The depot of the company, {{which is}} a newly-erected {{building}} off Arkwright-street, is complete to the detail, the stables being capable of accommodating 50 or 60 horses. The rooms are lofty and well ventilated, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> core of horses which we saw yesterday were well worth of the home which they now realise. A finer set of cattle it is scarcely possible to conceive, and cannot fail to win the admiration of the people.|$|E

25|$|A list of Poisson's works, {{drawn up}} by himself, is given {{at the end of}} Arago's biography. All that is {{possible}} is a brief mention of the more important ones. It was in the application of mathematics to physics that his greatest services to science were performed. Perhaps the most original, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most permanent in their influence, were his memoirs on the theory of electricity and magnetism, which virtually created a new branch of mathematical physics.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Waugh {{argues that}} Natan {{revolutionized}} pornographic film in France. He {{was one of}} the first, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most prominent, filmmaker to include bisexuality and homosexuality in his films, and introduced masochism to French adult film as well. Joseph Slade, who originally claimed that Natan unquestionably produced {{some of the most important}} hardcore film of the 1920s, now admits there is room for doubt over whether Natan worked in pornography at any time after 1910.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the mass}} {{can be said}} to be stylistically consistent, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> chosen chants are all {{celebrations}} of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Also adding weight to the claim that the mass is cyclic is the possibility that the piece was written or assembled for performance at a specific celebration. The possibility that it was for the coronation of Charles V, which was once widely accepted, is thought unlikely in modern scholarship. The composer's intention that the piece be performed as one entire mass setting makes the Messe de Nostre Dame generally considered a cyclic composition.|$|E

25|$|Illinois {{was one of}} {{the last}} states, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> largest, to retain a one-class system, where all schools, {{regardless}} of enrollment, competed for the same prize. In December 1970 the smaller schools, who make up the majority of IHSA members, forced a binding referendum on whether to implement a two-class system in boys' basketball, and the measure carried by a narrow margin, 312–293. After this move, several other sports adopted the two-class format. In January 2006, after a substantial majority of schools responding to an advisory referendum indicated a preference for more classes, the IHSA Board of Directors approved expansion in several sports, starting in 2007–08.|$|E
25|$|After each {{completed}} mission, bomber crews {{left the}} aircraft {{with a bag}} which they deposited in a safe ("the Bomb Vault"). This secure facility ("the AFCE and Bombsight Shop") was typically {{in one of the}} base's Nissen hut (Quonset hut) support buildings. The Bombsight Shop was manned by enlisted men who were members of a Supply Depot Service Group ("Sub Depot") attached to each USAAF bombardment group. These shops not only guarded the bombsights but performed critical maintenance on the Norden and related control equipment. This was probably the most technically skilled ground-echelon job, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most secret, of all the work performed by Sub Depot personnel. The non-commissioned officer in charge and his staff had to have a high aptitude for understanding and working with mechanical devices.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the tenure of Sir William Langhorne that the {{residency}} of the Agents of Madras, a garden-house called the Guindy Lodge, was constructed. On India's independence, this became the Raj Bhavan and is the official residence of the Governor of Tamil Nadu. It was also during this time that an Office of Archives was established to maintain {{the records of the}} Agency. The Council Room of Fort St George was allocated for this purpose. This later became the Madras Record Office. In 1909, the office was shifted to Egmore and has since become the Tamil Nadu State Archives. The Tamil Nadu State Archives is, therefore, one of the oldest record-keeping offices of the world <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> oldest such institution established by the British East India Company.|$|E

50|$|Englefield House was {{the home}} of the Englefield family, {{supposedly}} from the time of King Edgar <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> until <b>the</b> Elizabethan era when the present building was erected. The house eventually passed to the Benyon family.|$|R
500|$|Some critics {{maintain}} that Ken Russell's The Devils (1971) {{was influenced by}} Reeves's film, with one writer calling Russell's movie [...] "the apex of the 'historical' witch-persecution films started by Witchfinder General." [...] However, Russell has noted that he hated Reeves's film, describing it as [...] "one of the worst movies I have ever seen <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most nauseous." ...|$|E
500|$|Gordon-Cumming's biographer, Jason Tomes, {{thought that}} his subject possessed [...] "audacity and wit [...] gloried in the sobriquet {{of the most}} arrogant man in London", while Sporting Life {{described}} him as [...] "possibly the most handsome man in London, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> rudest". Gordon-Cumming also owned a house in Belgravia, London; {{he was a friend}} of the Prince of Wales, and would lend the premises to the prince for assignations with the royal mistresses.|$|E
500|$|Fetter's {{stand on}} this issue further led him to oppose Georgist ideas like the land value tax. Mark Blaug, a {{specialist}} {{in the history of}} economic thought, credits Fetter and John Bates Clark with influencing mainstream economists to abandon the idea [...] "that land is a unique factor of production and hence that there is any special need for a special theory of ground rent.... This is in fact the basis of all the attacks on Henry George by contemporary economists <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> fundamental reason why professional economists increasingly ignored him." ...|$|E
