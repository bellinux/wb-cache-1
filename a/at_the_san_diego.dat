Avnet cultivated a calculated release for the movie by first moving its release date from the summer (it was supposed to open a week before Spider-Man 2 (2004)) to September, then courting the Internet press and finally making an appearance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> Comic Con with key cast members {{in an attempt to}} generate some advance buzz.|$|E
