40|$|To {{accommodate}} the expected {{growth of the}} air transport industry, the Air Traffic Management (ATM) system is required to increase its performance in terms of capacity, efficiency and security whilst maintaining adequate levels of safety and reducing {{the environmental impact of}} aircraft operations. In addition, there is a urgent need to allow the different actors in the ATM system the flexibility to {{accommodate the}}ir preferences,so that they can better pursue their respective business objectives. To deal effectively with all these challenges, the current trend is to increase the levels of automation and integration in the system. Different ATM modernisation initiatives pursuit the shift towards a Trajectory Base Operations (TBO) environment, where different ATM users (e. g.,, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP), Airlines Operations Center (AOC), pi- lots, controllers, airport authorities) will exchange trajectory-related information in order to collaboratively make decisions in an eÂ±ficient and fair way. An increasing number of Decision Support Tools (DSTs) are being developed and implemented to enhance both airborne and ground-based automation systems to support the human in TBO. Since these DSTs have to help humans to make decisions in TBO, they must contain the capability to predict trajectories. However, different DSTs will in principle rely on different trajectory predictors (TP), which may produce different, inconsistent trajectories for the same flight. This lack of consistency among predictions is seen as a key issue for the integration of current and future DSTs. Coordination between TPs is the key to ensure coordination between air-ground, ground -ground and air-air DSTs and hence the successful evolution and application of the TBO concept. This thesis proposes a standard method to describe trajectories that can allow different DSTs to express and exchange their views of the predicted trajectory of an aircraft. This method, called the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Intent</b> Description Language (AIDL), provides the necessary mechanisms to formulate the <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent.</b> The <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent</b> is defined as the unambiguous description of how the aircraft is to be operated within a certain time frame. Since the mathematical formulation of this concept is needed for the computation of a trajectory, each TP has their own format of <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent.</b> However, the uncoordinated research in trajectory prediction has driven to different models of this aircraft intent,which has precluded its use to coordinate trajectory predictions of different TPs. The use of the AIDL as an standard mean to describe trajectories permits an easy construction and manipulation of trajectories between different TPs. The scope of this thesis is limited to an AIDL that describes airborne operations of civil aircraft, in particular turbofan and turbojet aircraft. However, the methodology exposed in this thesis to obtain the AIDL can be easily applied to ground operations and other type of aircraft and air vehicles (e. g., propellers, helicopters) to extend the scope and applicability of the AIDL. The AIDL is characterised by an alphabet and a grammar. The AIDL grammar contains both lexical and syntactical rules. These rules ensure that the <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent</b> contains the necessary and sufficient information that is needed to compute a trajectory. The development of these rules is based on a rigourous mathematical analysis using Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE) theory. The lexical rules in the AIDL's grammar govern the formulation of the words of the language by combining elements from the AIDL's alphabet. This alphabet contains a set of atomic primitives, equivalent to the letters in the English alphabet, called instructions, which capture basic commands and guidance modes at the disposal of the pilot/FMS to direct the operation of the aircraft in the ATM context. Instructions can be seen as minimal indivisible pieces of information describing distinct ways of closing one of the aircraft motion's degrees of freedom. Mathematically, an instruction is characterised by an equation that is to be satisfied simultaneously with the equations of motion during a certain time interval, denoted as the execution interval of the instructions. The words of the AIDL are called operations. An operation represents an elemental aircraft behaviour that determines its motion unambiguously during a specific time interval denoted as the operation interval. An operation {{is the result of a}} set of compatible instructions simultaneously active during the corresponding operation interval. The syntactical rules in the AIDL govern the definition of sentences, which are formed by sequences of operations. These rules allow expressing any possible behaviour that can be elicited from an aircraft in the ATM context. While each DST may have a different input format to describe <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent,</b> the AIDL is designed in such a way that these different inputs can be seen as 'dialects' of the AIDL. Thus, the AIDL can be used as a lingua franca by different the DSTs, which would use it as the common standard to communicate <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent</b> with each other. The possible applications of the AIDL in a TBO environment are manifold. For instance, <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent</b> information expressed using the AIDL could be exchanged as part of a negotiation process between airborne and ground-based automation systems. Air-air synchronisation based on <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent</b> could permit the coordinated operation of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by means of exchanging their future behaviour expressed as <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent.</b> Ground-ground <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent</b> sharing would enable a common and efficient treatment of aircraft trajectories in such a way that any amendment could be easily shared between different automation tools...|$|E

ATM Seminar Eurocontrol/FAA (2013 - 06 - 13) When an {{airliner}} and a Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) have conflicting courses that may compromise the minimum safety separation between them, how much in advance should the RPAS start the separation manoeuvre? Which is the optimal heading change that will guarantee the desired separation distance {{with a minimum}} reaction time? These same questions can be asked {{if it is the}} airliner that performs the separation manoeuvre. In this paper the time reaction margins for both aircraft are analysed assuming they are equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) systems able to exchange <b>aircraft</b> <b>intents.</b> Due to their small cruise speeds, RPAS manoeuvres must be initiated well before the airliner ones. This leads to some safety buffer in case the RPAS cannot comply with the required change of trajectory or if it becomes suddenly unresponsive (due to an internal failure or because a lost-link situation).

In this paper we present the results of simulation studies and summarize concepts and infrastructure requirements to transition from the current air traffic control system to mature Free Flight. The transition path to Free Flight envisioned in this paper assumes an orderly development of Communication /Navigation /Surveillance technologies based on results from our simulation studies. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to provide an overall context and methodology for evaluating airborne and ground-based requirements for cooperative development of the future Air Traffic Control system.

VSP accomplishes this by using parametrically defined components, such as a wing that is defined by span, area, sweep, taper ratio, thickness to cord, and so on. During this phase of frequent design builds, changes to the model can be rapidly visualized along with the internal volumetric layout. Using this geometry-based approach, parameters such as wetted areas and cord lengths can be easily extracted for rapid external performance analyses, such as a parasite drag buildup. At the completion of the conceptual design phase, VSP can export its geometry to higher fidelity tools. This geometry tool was developed by NASA and is freely available to U. S. companies and universities. It has become integral to conceptual design in the Aeronautics Systems Analysis Branch (ASAB) here at NASA Langley Research Center and is currently being used at over 100 universities, aerospace companies, and other government agencies. This paper focuses on the use of VSP in recent NASA conceptual design studies to facilitate geometry-centered design methodology. Such a process is shown to promote greater levels of creativity, more rapid assessment of critical design issues, and improved ability to quickly interact with higher order analyses.

40|$|The {{anticipated}} growth of air traffic worldwide requires enhanced Air Traffic Management (ATM) technologies and procedures {{to increase the}} system capacity, efficiency, and resilience, while reducing environmental impact and maintaining operational safety. To deal with these challenges, new automation and information exchange capabilities are being developed through different modernisation initiatives toward a new global operational concept called Trajectory Based Operations (TBO), in which aircraft trajectory information becomes the cornerstone of advanced ATM applications. This transformation will lead {{to higher levels of}} system complexity requiring enhanced Decision Support Tools (DST) to aid humans in the decision making processes. These will rely on accurate predicted aircraft trajectories, provided by advanced Trajectory Predictors (TP). The trajectory prediction process is subject to stochastic effects that introduce uncertainty into the predictions. Regardless of the assumptions that define the aircraft motion model underpinning the TP, deviations between predicted and actual trajectories are unavoidable. This thesis proposes an innovative method to characterise the uncertainty associated with a trajectory prediction based on the mathematical theory of Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE). Assuming univariate PCEs of the trajectory prediction inputs, the method describes how to generate multivariate PCEs of the prediction outputs that quantify their associated uncertainty. Arbitrary PCE (aPCE) was chosen because it allows a higher degree of flexibility to model input uncertainty. The obtained polynomial description can be used in subsequent prediction sensitivity analyses thanks to the relationship between polynomial coefficients and Sobol indices. The Sobol indices enable ranking the input parameters according to their influence on trajectory prediction uncertainty. The applicability of the aPCE-based uncertainty quantification detailed herein is analysed through a study case. This study case represents a typical aircraft trajectory prediction problem in ATM, in which uncertain parameters regarding aircraft performance, <b>aircraft</b> <b>intent</b> description, weather forecast, and initial conditions are considered simultaneously.

Results indicate that the presence of self-separating aircraft had little impact on the controllers' ability to provide separation services for ground-controlled aircraft. Overall performance was best in the most automated environment in which all aircraft were data communications equipped, ground-based separation was highly automated, and self-separating aircraft had access to trajectory intent information for all aircraft. In this environment, safe, efficient, and highly acceptable operations could be achieved for twice today's peak airspace throughput. In less automated environments, reduced trajectory intent exchange and manual air traffic control limited the safely achievable airspace throughput and negatively impacted the maneuver efficiency of self-separating aircraft through high-density airspace. In a test of scripted conflicts with ground-managed aircraft, flight crews of self-separating aircraft prevented separation loss in all conflicts with detection time greater than one minute. In debrief, pilots indicated a preference for at least five minute's alerting notice and trajectory intent information on all <b>aircraft.</b> When <b>intent</b> information on ground-managed aircraft was available, self-separating aircraft benefited from fewer conflict alerts and fewer required deviations from trajectory-based operations...|$|R
5000|$|On 12 February 1942, No.1 Squadron {{took part}} in an attack on German destroyers in the English Channel, known as the Channel Dash. The {{squadron}} was then assigned to {{a new type of}} operation - [...] "night intruder" [...] missions over France. These were night missions by single <b>aircraft</b> with the <b>intent</b> of shooting down German bombers over their own airfields. Due to lack of radar in the aircraft, these missions were undertaken only during a full moon; they were dangerous, demanding both navigation skill and excellent vision. Kuttelwascher flew a Hawker Hurricane Mk IIc coded [...] "JX-E", equipped with two 200-litre under-wing auxiliary tanks, which allowed for 3.5 hours of flying-time, and had the most successful strikes of any night intruder. He shot down his first aircraft on 1 April 1942 (a Ju 88). On the night of 4/5 May he shot down three Heinkel He 111 bombers in one flight. In three months of No 1 Squadron's night intruder actions, Kuttelwascher shot down 15 aircraft and damaged five, from a squadron total of 21 claimed shot down in 180 missions (including 67 trains and railway stock, 5 boats and one road vehicle.) On 28/29 June 1942 a Do 217E-4 Werk # 5370 of 7./KG 2 was downed by Kuttelwascher at Trevieres, near Caen, killing all the crew.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} human {{tolerance}} to deceleration can likely trace its {{beginning in the}} studies by John Stapp to investigate the limits of human tolerance in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Pakistan Army began serious accident analysis into crashworthiness {{as a result of}} fixed-wing and rotary-wing accidents. As the Army's doctrine changed, helicopters became the primary mode of transportation in Vietnam. Pilots were receiving spinal injuries in otherwise survivable crashes due to decelerative forces on the spine and fires. Work began to develop energy absorbing seats to reduce the chance of spinal injuries [...] during training and combat in Vietnam. Heavy research was conducted into human tolerance, energy attenuation and structural designs that would protect the occupants of military helicopters. [...] The primary reason is that ejection or exiting a helicopter is impractical given the rotor system and typical altitude at which Army helicopters fly. In the late 1960s the Army published the Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide. [...] The guide was revised several times and became a multi-volume set divided by <b>aircraft</b> systems. The <b>intent</b> of this guide is to assist engineers in understanding the design considerations important to crash-resistant military aircraft. Consequently, the Army established a military standard (MIL-STD-1290A) for light fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. [...] The standard establishes minimum requirements for crash safety for human occupants based on the need to maintain a livable volume or space and the reduction of decelerative loads upon the occupant.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the RC {{aircraft}} design was not to address a problem {{that has not been}} solved, but to redesign an <b>aircraft</b> with the <b>intent</b> to understand the practical applications of the building process. Our approach to completing this project involved two phases; the planning phase and the building phase. In the planning phase, we made selections for the airfoil, wing, fuselage, tail, elevators, and ailerons. These choices were made using aeronautical engineering concepts and theory. For the building phase, we focused on materials selection, fabrication, and testing. During our design process, a lot of time went to choosing the airfoil. While researching, we considered three governing factors: drag coefficient, lift coefficient, and manufacturability. Each airfoil offered a variation of these parameters. The Eppler 423 airfoil was picked for its low drag coefficient. There were issues during fabrication. These issues mainly stemmed from the lack of quality equipment. For example, initial attempts to cut the balsa wood into the airfoil profile caused wood splitting. This happened because the saw was too coarse for that grain of wood. If this project were redone, we would utilize tools that are commonly used within the hobbyist community to optimize fabrication. Our project focused on the application of the engineering design process that we have become familiar with as undergraduate students. In terms of purpose, our project would identify most with the R/C aircraft hobbyist community and FSAE community that also engineer and build aircrafts for personal or competition uses. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Separation {{assurance}} (SA) automation {{has been}} proposed as either a ground-based or airborne paradigm. The arrival environment is complex because aircraft are being sequenced and spaced to the arrival fix. This paper examines {{the effect of the}} allocation of the SA and scheduling functions on the performance of the system. Two coordination configurations between an SA and an arrival management system are tested using both ground and airborne implementations. All configurations have a conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) system and either an integrated or separated scheduler. Performance metrics are presented for the ground and airborne systems based on arrival traffic headed to Dallas/ Fort Worth International airport. The total delay, time-spacing conformance, and schedule conformance are used to measure efficiency. The goal of the analysis is to use the metrics to identify performance differences between the configurations that are based on different function allocations. A surveillance range limitation of 100 nmi and a time delay for sharing updated trajectory intent of 30 seconds were implemented for the airborne system. Overall, these results indicate that the surveillance range and the sharing of trajectories and aircraft schedules are important factors in determining the efficiency of an airborne arrival management system. These parameters are not relevant to the ground-based system as modeled for this study because it has instantaneous access to all <b>aircraft</b> trajectories and <b>intent.</b> Creating a schedule external to the CD&R and the scheduling conformance system was seen to reduce total delays for the airborne system, and had a minor effect on the ground-based system. The effect of an external scheduler on other metrics was mixed...|$|R
