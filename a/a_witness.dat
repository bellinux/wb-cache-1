5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> {{to the murder}} of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth as <b>a</b> <b>witness.</b> The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.|$|E

5|$|Walter was <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> on 12 of Henry's royal {{charters}}, {{all before}} 1131. He also was <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> for some royal charters issued by Henry's successor, King Stephen of England, early in Stephen's reign. One was a charter issued at Henry's funeral on 4 January 1136 and another at Stephen's court at Easter 1136. These two charter attestations {{show that he}} was an early supporter of Stephen in the king's seizure of the throne from Henry's daughter Matilda. These early charters from Stephen's reign are Walter's last appearances in documents during his lifetime. Also in 1136 Walter {{was in charge of the}} defense of Le Sap in Normandy against Geoffrey V of Anjou.|$|E
5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Basset was not {{employed}} as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> to a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has been questioned. He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E

5|$|Blois was {{frequently}} <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> to Puiset's charters, {{and was named}} as rector of a parish church {{in the city of}} Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese of Lincoln by 22 March 1194, probably from about 1189. He was a frequent witness to Hugh's charters in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor of Lincoln in 1197, in succession to the medieval writer Walter Map. Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III. He may be the Master William of Blois who is <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> to some Scottish charters.|$|E
50|$|When {{there is}} a {{positive}} correlation between eyewitness confidence and accuracy, it tends to occur when <b>a</b> <b>witness's</b> confidence is measured immediately following the identification, and prior to any confirming feedback. In keeping with this finding, researchers suggest that a statement of <b>a</b> <b>witness's</b> confidence, in her own words, be taken immediately following an identification. Any future statement of confidence or certainty is widely regarded as unreliable, given the host of intervening factors that have been shown to distort it as time passes.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{creation}} of the new archdiocese, Jaenberht retained his position as the senior cleric in the land, with Hygeberht conceding his precedence. When Jaenberht died in 792, he was replaced by Æthelheard, who was consecrated by Hygeberht, now senior in his turn. Subsequently Æthelheard appears as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> on charters and presides at synods without Hygeberht, so it appears that Offa continued to respect Canterbury's authority.|$|E
