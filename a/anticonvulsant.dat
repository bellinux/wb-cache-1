5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an <b>anticonvulsant</b> effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many <b>anticonvulsant</b> drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} {{treatment of}} epilepsy is <b>anticonvulsant</b> medications, possibly for the person's entire life. The choice of <b>anticonvulsant</b> {{is based on}} seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, other health problems, and the person's age and lifestyle. A single medication is recommended initially; {{if this is not}} effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. In about half, the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%. About 30% of people continue to have seizures despite <b>anticonvulsant</b> treatment.|$|E
5|$|Water hemlock is {{considered}} one of North America's most toxic plants, being highly poisonous to humans. Three members of the genus contain a toxin named cicutoxin which causes central nervous system stimulatory effects including seizures following ingestion. Medical treatment of poisoning may include the use of activated charcoal to decrease gastrointestinal absorption of the toxic principle along with supportive care including <b>anticonvulsant</b> drugs such as a benzodiazepine. High doses of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medicine are often required to halt seizure activity and further medical care including intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.|$|E

40|$|Seventy {{percent of}} the AIDS {{patients}} have neurological complications. Seizures {{are one of the}} complications and can occur at any stage. Seizures can be life–threatening and treatment with <b>anticonvulsants</b> is warranted. The therapeutic dilemma occurs in this case because of the interactions between the <b>anticonvulsants,</b> especially the first generation <b>anticonvulsants,</b> with antiretroviral agents resulting in significant side effects including toxicity. The non-availability of second-generation <b>anticonvulsants</b> and cost constraints further limit the choices for the physicians. In this mini-review, we discuss the management of AIDS related seizures with emphasis on the drug-drug interactions between <b>anticonvulsants</b> and antiretroviral agents. We will also address the future directions and the need for prospective studies with second-generation <b>anticonvulsants...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Anticonvulsants</b> (also {{commonly}} known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs) are {{a diverse group of}} pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. <b>Anticonvulsants</b> are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. <b>Anticonvulsants</b> suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. <b>Anticonvulsants</b> also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Some investigators have observed that <b>anticonvulsants</b> themselves may cause reduced IQ in children. [...] However these adverse effects must be balanced against the significant risk epileptic seizures pose to children and the distinct possibility of death and devastating neurological sequelae secondary to seizures. <b>Anticonvulsants</b> are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (abbreviated [...] "AEDs"), and are often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy.|$|R
5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of <b>anticonvulsant</b> drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of <b>anticonvulsant</b> drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The least {{expensive}} <b>anticonvulsant</b> is phenobarbital at around $5USD a year.

5|$|Various analgesics (painkillers) {{may be used}} in {{controlling}} the headaches of intracranial hypertension.

[...] Newer generation <b>anticonvulsants</b> including Lamotrigine and Topiramate are recommended due to their relatively limited side effects. [...] It is not recommended to prophylactically give anti-seizure medications when a seizure has not yet been experienced by a patient with brain metastasis.|$|R
25|$|<b>Anticonvulsants</b> {{affect the}} bones in many ways. They cause hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, low Vitamin D levels, and {{increased}} parathyroid hormone. <b>Anticonvulsants</b> {{also contribute to the}} increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing <b>anticonvulsants</b> than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing <b>anticonvulsants.</b> In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause arthralgia.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Anticonvulsants</b> such as {{valproic acid}} and topiramate. A {{meta-analysis}} by the Cochrane Collaboration of ten randomized controlled trials or crossover studies, which together included 1341 patients, found <b>anticonvulsants</b> had an [...] "2.4 {{times more likely}} to experience a 50% or greater reduction in frequency with <b>anticonvulsants</b> than with placebo" [...] and a number needed to treat of 3.8. However, concerns have been raised about the marketing of gabapentin.|$|R
5|$|Anticonvulsants {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) {{is a process that}} is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no <b>anticonvulsant</b> has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{has yielded}} at least 64 {{isoquinoline}} alkaloids, which include anti-parasitic (e.g. candimine) and psychopharmacological activity {{due to their}} high alkaloid content.

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing <b>anticonvulsant</b> regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E

5|$|The {{ketone bodies}} are {{possibly}} <b>anticonvulsant</b> in themselves; in animal models, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism {{that increase the}} energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, {{and the number of}} mitochondria is increased. This may help the neurons to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a neuroprotective effect.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, <b>anticonvulsant,</b> amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only <b>anticonvulsant</b> drugs were the {{sedative}} bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this review}} was to {{investigate}} the quality of the current literature on the transfer of <b>anticonvulsants</b> to breast milk to provide an overview of which <b>anticonvulsants</b> are in need of further research. METHODS: We reviewed the quality of the available lactation studies for 19 <b>anticonvulsants</b> against the guidelines of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the International Lactation Consultant Association (ILCA). RESULTS: Except for one study on lamotrigine and one case report on gabapentin, no study on <b>anticonvulsants</b> had both the absolute infant dose (AID) and milk to plasma ratio (M/P) correctly assessed. Only one study on carbamazepine, phenytoin and vigabatrin was found that correctly assessed the AID. Main cause for this low number is the lack of essential details in published studies, since 25 of 62 studies were case reports, letters or abstracts. Other major shortcomings were the lack of information on sampling methods, the number of samples in a particular dose interval as well as the low number of study participants. CONCLUSION: The quality of current literature on the transfer of <b>anticonvulsants</b> to breast milk is low, except for lamotrigine, which makes it hard to draw conclusions about the safety of the use of <b>anticonvulsants</b> during the lactation period. Therefore, further research is needed...|$|R

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the <b>anticonvulsant</b> effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain <b>anticonvulsant</b> therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent <b>anticonvulsant</b> action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their <b>anticonvulsant,</b> anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a mainstream}} therapy {{that does not}} use pharmaceutical drugs, which was developed to reproduce the success and remove {{the limitations of the}} non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy. Although popular in the 1920s and 30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new <b>anticonvulsant</b> drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20–30% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs. For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another <b>anticonvulsant</b> drug. There is some evidence that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of <b>anticonvulsant</b> drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
