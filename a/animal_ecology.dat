500|$|The Clementsian {{superorganism}} {{theory was}} an overextended application of an idealistic form of holism. The term [...] "holism" [...] was coined in 1926 by Jan Christiaan Smuts, a South African general and polarizing historical figure who {{was inspired by}} Clements' superorganism concept. Around the same time, Charles Elton pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book <b>Animal</b> <b>Ecology.</b> Elton defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains, food cycles, and food size, and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance. Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text. Alfred J. Lotka brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.|$|E

5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and <b>animals.</b> <b>Ecology</b> draws on many subdisciplines.|$|R

40|$|Forest areas {{restored}} after mining typically take decades, or longer, {{before they}} resemble the original vegetation community. Understanding how fauna succession varies with plant succession requires detailed knowledge of an <b>animal’s</b> <b>ecology.</b> Knowledge of an <b>animal’s</b> <b>ecology</b> {{can also be}} used to predict faunal responses to management manipulations and enable techniques to be developed that accelerate the return of fauna to restored sites. We radio-tracked western bearded dragons (Pogona minor) in a mix of unmined forest sites and sites restored after bauxite mining, in the jarrah forest of south-west Western Australia, to determine critical resources and important microhabitats for dragons. Dragons were generalists – utilising a range of microhabitats – and adaptable, adjusting their microhabitat use depending on availability. Individuals also differed significantly in their microhabitat use and did not appear to have a defined home range. We concluded that the species would rapidly recolonise restored sites and that no modifications to current restoration practices were required to accelerate their return. Prescribed burning of restored areas could negatively affect this species but the effect would be short-term (< 2 years). The approach used in this study could be used to develop management prescriptions that accelerate the return of late-successional species to restored sites...|$|R

I investigated the activity patterns of female M. tricolor over the reproductive period using radio telemetry. Six female bats were radio-tagged during each reproductive period: early pregnancy, late pregnancy and lactation. Times at which bats entered and exited the cave were recorded, as was the temperature, moon-phase, cloud cover, wind speed, rainfall and insect abundance. These data were used to calculate emergence time, number of foraging bouts and foraging duration for each reproductive period, which were then correlated with the environmental variables...|$|R
40|$|As {{the status}} of the otter and the results of {{research}} work done in Austria have not been summarized within the last years, this article is an attempt to fill this gap. Status, habitat, captive <b>animals,</b> <b>ecology</b> and pollutant burden are reviewed. No national survey has been carried out, but the main otter distribution is along the northern and southeastern border. The northern population seems safe but the southern one is likely to be fragmented by developments such as planned hydropowerstations. There are some conflicts with fish farmers but compensation is paid. There is a breeding colony of otters in Alpenzoo Innsbruck and another group at the WWF station Grünau, which has not yet bred. Recent pollutant assay results are discussed, and heavy metal levels presented...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{movement}} {{is important for}} defining <b>animal</b> spatial <b>ecology</b> and ensuring effective management and conservation. Accordingly, data on animal movement patterns, connectivity and habitat use have become crucial elements in management and conservation decisions. Large-scale movements of marine individuals are monitored using new tracking technologies such as acoustic monitoring. These new technologies often produce large amounts of high quality data, so data generation {{is no longer a}} challenge, however, data analysis and modelling are emerging issues. Arrangement of acoustic receivers into arrays or grids (i. e., as a "network") fits well with the use of an innovative approach: Network Analysis. Network Analysis is a powerful tool for examining the structure of complex interacting systems that are represented as a network characterized by connections between nodes. The use of Network Analysis to look at <b>animal</b> spatial <b>ecology</b> in the marine environment is in its early stages with only a few studies completed. Consequently, the potential of Network Analysis in studying <b>animal</b> spatial <b>ecology</b> using acoustic monitoring data is largely unexplored. However, this approach has been intensely used in other areas, including landscape ecology, and the results have proven incredibly useful for management and conservation. By combining acoustic monitoring and Network Analysis, researchers may be able to study the spatial ecology of species in the marine environment. Therefore, this project aimed to determine the contribution of Network Analysis in understanding marine <b>animal</b> spatial <b>ecology</b> using acoustic monitoring data. Literature analysis suggested that Network Analysis can help characterise marine <b>animal</b> spatial <b>ecology</b> in new ways, providing many tools to understand the complex interaction between animals and their environment. The multi-disciplinary nature of Network Analysis provides the researcher with convenient tools to understand the complexity of movement at different scales, compare movements between individuals or between species, and investigate the effect of environmental factors on the movement. The reviewed techniques were tested on acoustic monitoring data from six predator species. Field work was conducted along the north-east coast of Queensland, Australia. Two arrays of 67 and 48 acoustic transmitters deployed in the central section of the Great Barrier Reef passively tracked six predator species from 2008 to 2014. Two nearshore sharks (pigeye shark (Carcharhinus amboinensis) and spottail shark (Carcharhinus sorrah)), two reef sharks (silvertip shark (Carcharhinus albimarginatus) and grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos)), and two carangid teleosts (giant trevally (Caranx ignobilis) and golden trevally (Gnathanodon speciosus)) were selected to determine efficacy of the Network Analysis method to contribute to the understanding of marine <b>animal</b> spatial <b>ecology.</b> To investigate the utility of Network Analysis in identifying core use areas and compare the results with traditional analysis, a case study using C. amboinensis and C. sorrah was conducted. Comparison of traditional analysis (kernel utilization distribution, KUD) and Network Analysis demonstrated that both methods provided similar results for identifying core use areas (50...|$|R
