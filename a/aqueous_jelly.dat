40|$|Background: Perianal fistula is a {{commonly}} encountered condition in routine surgical practice. Accurate presurgical mapping of these tracts {{is vital to}} prevent recurrence. We have assessed the effectiveness of percutaneous instillation of <b>aqueous</b> <b>jelly</b> prior to magnetic resonance (MR) fistulography. Aims and Objectives: To study the role of percutaneous instillation of <b>aqueous</b> <b>jelly</b> in fistulous tracts prior to MR fistulography. Materials and Methods: All patients with active discharge, referred for MR fistulography between January 2014 and April 2016, were included in this study. Approximately 3 – 5 ml of sterile <b>aqueous</b> <b>jelly</b> was percutaneously instilled into the external openings prior to MR fistulography. Post MR fistulography, patients were monitored till surgery for pain, fever, or bleeding. The type of fistulae, location of internal openings, lateral ramifications, and presence of abscess were compared with per operative findings for diagnostic accuracy. Results: Sixty-four patients enrolled in our study had undergone preoperative MR fistulography with <b>aqueous</b> <b>jelly</b> instillation. MR fistulography revealed a total of 77 tracts and showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % in delineation of type of tract. Forty-nine internal openings were identified with 94. 2 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity, and 95. 3 % accuracy. 90. 5 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity, and accuracy of 97 % were observed in delineation of lateral ramifications. None of the patients reported pain, fever, or bleeding post procedure till surgery. Conclusion: Percutaneous instillation of <b>aqueous</b> <b>jelly</b> prior to MR fistulography is a safe, cost effective, and accurate technique to provide a comprehensive delineation of the complex anatomy of perianal fistulae...|$|E
40|$|The {{one-step}} {{preparation of}} silver nanoparticles and dendritic structures mediated by <b>aqueous</b> royal <b>jelly</b> solutions {{has been investigated}} for the first time. It {{has been found that}} royal jelly (RJ) is a complex organic matrix that can be simultaneously used as a reducing and stabilizing agent in the chemical synthesis of colloidal silver-based nanostructures from aqueous AgNO 3 solutions, without the requirement of additional reagents or heating sources to initiate the oxidation-reduction reactions. The resulting product consisted of very fine single-crystal disks of Ag and silver 4, 4 ′- dimethyldiazoaminobenzene (a triazenic compound). Both kinds of particles tended to coalesce and form supramolecular dendritic structures, the AgNO 3 /RJ weight ratio chosen in the synthesis being a key parameter to control the crystal growth and the microstructural properties of the Ag nanodisks. Data obtained from Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy analysis indicated that these nanostructures are coated by RJ biomolecules (residues of proteins and carbohydrates). In vitro biological assays showed that these nanostructures exhibit a promising enhanced antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
