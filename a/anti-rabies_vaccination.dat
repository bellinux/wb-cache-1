The annual estimated number of dog bites is 17. 4 million-one every two seconds- leading to 18, 000 to 20, 000 human rabies cases per year (WHO, 2015). In 2013, a UK based NGO launched Project Mission Rabies conducting mass <b>anti-rabies</b> dog <b>vaccination</b> campaigns throughout India. Despite a promising pilot, {{the project is}} no longer active in the State of Rajasthan. The purpose of the Capstone Project is to provide the evidence to propose a statewide expansion of the Project Mission Rabiesin Rajasthan. A systematic literature review was performed. Online surveys were administered to veterinary health care providers to investigate the knowledge and attitudes related to rabies and the Project Mission Rabies. Interviews with key stakeholders were conducted to identify their perspectives on the barriers and the facilitating factors encountered while implementing the Bikaner pilot project and recommendations for expanding the Project to a state level. The responses were analyzed using a quantitative and qualitative thematic approach. The triangulation of data indicates the importance of Project Mission Rabies to effectively control, prevent and eradicate rabies. Veterinary health care providers acknowledged the urgent need to control rabies and identified the Project Mission Rabies as deserving a statewide expansion.

Materials and Methods: A longitudinal survey was conducted in the Infectious Diseases Hospital of Lucknow from January to December 2013. During this duration a total of 390 patients presenting with animal bites were included. Results: A majority (63. 3 %) of patients were in the 16 - 59 years age group. 75 % of patients had attended the IDH for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) within 24 hours. The male to female ratio was 2. 98 : 1. A majority (79. 5 %) of patients were injured by dogs. 9. 0 % patients were in close contact with rabies patient. On the basis of WHO classification, 4. 2 % of animal bite patients were placed in grade I, 88. 2 in grade II and 7. 6 % in grade III. In 73. 3 % of patients wound were in lower limbs.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the immune response to <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccination</b> in the principal recipient (the domestic dog), four truncated {{fragments of the}} rabies virus glycoprotein were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Immune sera from vaccinated rabbits and dogs were then used to probe for reactivity with these expressed proteins. In two rabbits and four dogs tested, the dominant antibody response to non-conformational antigenic sites appeared to be directed to a region of the glycoprotein between amino acids 222 and 332. The N-terminal fragment of the glycoprotein was also significantly antigenic.

40|$|Background The {{outbreak}} of rabies in human in Bali-Indonesia is causing an extraordinary pressure {{for the government}} in providing adequate doses of anti-rabies vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Here, we directly compare the immune response and benefit of the intradermal (ID) protocol for rabies vaccine delivery with the intramuscular (IM) route. Methods: Sixty health workers {{who were willing to}} participate in this study have been randomly selected and grouped into ID, IM, and control groups, each with 20 volunteers. The Thai Red Cross ID- and Zangreb IM-protocols have been applied to the respective group. The sera of the volunteers were collected at day 0, week 1, week 3, week 4, month 3, month 6, month 9, and month 12 after the first <b>vaccination.</b> <b>Anti-rabies</b> virus IgG was detected using Platelia TM Rabies II Kit (Bio-Rad). Results: Anti-rabies IgG could be detected in the ID-group at one week. The ID-vaccine delivery induced a slightly higher maximum antibody titer compared to IM, though not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). ID vaccination caused less adverse reactions and produces longer lasting protective immune response.  Cost minimization analysis (CMA) on the provincial and national PEP data in 2009 - 2011 shows that the ID-delivery will reduce the total cost for a completed regimen by USD 28. 5, and would have saved the Indonesian government budget approximately USD 3. 6 and 4. 3 million for complete regimens in Bali and Indonesia, respectively. Conclusion: The ID administration of anti-rabies vaccine induces a similar immune response compared to that of intramuscular injection. It also produces longer lasting protective immune response. It offers additional advantages of potential net cost savings as well as decreasing the pressure on vaccine availability due to the high number of dog bite cases. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Dog bites {{are common}} and can affect victims of {{different}} ages, from {{children to the}} elderly. Injuries are usually located in different body regions, including head and face. The treatment of choice for injuries is the suture of the lesion, accompanied by antibiotic therapy and tetanus and <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Presentation of case: An 11 -year-old male black patient {{was admitted to the}} Surgery and Maxillo-Facial Traumatology Service, on an urgent basis, victim of domestic animal aggression (dog biting). The child had multiple and extensive lesions on the face, trauma with laceration with loss of substance, involving the left genic region, lower and upper lip, and lower gingival-labial sulcus. Discussion: Smaller children are especially vulnerable to injuries in the craniofacial region due their low stature, propensity to crawl/play on the ground and exploratory behavior. The primary treatment of bites is by means of direct suture, grafting or local flaps, {{depending on the type of}} wound and the surgeon's decision, regardless of time elapsed from the attack. Conclusion: This case shows a case of a child patient victim of animal bite, with lesions limited to the region of the face. The patient was followed up for a month and showed good wound healing without any complications...|$|E
40|$|Infection from a bite by a rabid {{animal is}} fatal unless rapid {{treatment}} (thorough cleaning of the wound, administration of rabies immunoglobulins (RIG), {{and a full}} <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccination</b> course) is provided. Ideally human RIG should be used, but cheaper, more readily available purified horse RIG (pERIG) are widely used in developing countries. Follow-up of over 7, 600 patients previously given pERIG at the rabies treatment reference center in Manila (Philippines) provided updated health status for 6, 458 patients 39 days to 29 months after treatment. A total of 151 patients had been bitten by animals with laboratory-confirmed rabies. Two rabies deaths were reported, one in a 4 -year-old girl with bites on the back, shoulder, and neck so severe that stitching was required to prevent bleeding (against recommended practice), and another in an 8 -year-old boy who only received rabies vaccination {{on the day of}} initial treatment. A 7 -year-old cousin of this boy, bitten by the same animal, who did receive the full vaccination course was still healthy 10 months later.

40|$|Control of animal-born {{diseases}} is a {{major challenge}} faced by applied ecologists and public health managers. To improve cost-effectiveness, the effort required to control such pathogens needs to be predicted as accurately as possible. In this context, we reviewed the <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccination</b> schemes applied around the world during the past 25 years. We contrasted predictions from classic approaches based on theoretical population ecology (which governs rabies control to date) with a newly developed individual-based model. Our spatially explicit approach allowed for the reproduction of pattern formation emerging from a pathogen's spread through its host population. We suggest that a much lower management effort could eliminate the disease than that currently in operation. This is supported by empirical evidence from historic field data. Adapting control measures to the new prediction would save one-third of resources in future control programmes. The reason for the lower prediction is the spatial structure formed by spreading infections in spatially arranged host populations. It is {{not the result of}} technical differences between models. Synthesis and applications. For diseases predominantly transmitted by neighbourhood interaction, our findings suggest that the emergence of spatial structures facilitates eradication. This may have substantial implications for the cost-effectiveness of existing disease management schemes, and suggests that when planning management strategies consideration must be given to methods that reflect the spatial nature of the pathogen–host system...|$|E

In this study, samples of foxes (Pseudalopex vetulus), insectivorous bats (Molossus molossus), raccoons (Procyon cancrivorous) and domestic animals brains were submitted to the diagnosis of rabies, by using the direct fluorescent antibody technique (d-FAT) and mouse inoculation test (MIT). Of the 581 examined materials, 50 (8. 60 %) were positive for d-FAT and 47 (8. 09 %) for MIT. From the positive samples for rabies, RNAs were extracted and transformed to cDNA, at the Laboratory of Rabies/Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia/USP, SP.

This paper reports the trend in CanL seroprevalence in the municipality of Évora (southern Portugal), where the disease is endemic, {{over a period of}} 20 years. The work comprises three different studies that were conducted in the years of 1990 (n = 3, 614), 1999 (n = 3, 563) and 2010 (n = 1, 485 dogs). Blood samples were collected during the <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccination</b> campaigns. Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected with the direct agglutination test (DAT). The total percentages of DAT seropositive dogs were 3. 9 % (in 1990), 9. 4 % (in 1999) and 5. 6 % (in 2010). The overall seroprevalence was significantly higher in 1999 compared to 1990, but in 2010 a significant decrease was found in comparison with 1999. However, compared to 1990 the overall seroprevalence was still significantly higher in 2010. From 1990 to 2010 seroprevalence has switched from significantly lower to higher in the rural areas. Relatively few dogs showed clinical signs of overt disease (0. 8 % to 2. 0 %) with lymphadenopathy, onychogryphosis and skin involvement as most frequently observed. Gender associated differences in seroprevalence were not found, and most commonly seropositive dogs were working or stray animals. The mean age of seropositive dogs was significantly higher than seronegative dogs in all three sampling rounds. A high proportion of dogs, which are apparently healthy, yet seropositive, may remain an important factor in limiting the outcome of zoonotic leishmaniosis control effort...|$|E

Nelore cattle were randomly assigned to one of three groups, which were vaccinated with one dose of rabies vaccine (group GVSR, N = 15), two doses of rabies vaccine (group GVR, N = 15) or were not vaccinated (group Gc, N = 15). A commercial liquid inactivated rabies vaccine was used. The stressors imposed on the cattle were vaccination, corral handling and the presence of people. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 30 and 60 post-vaccination. Serum cortisol concentrations were determined using a solid-phase radioimmunoassay, and rabies antibody titers were determined using a serum neutralization test with BHK 21 cells (RFFIT). Both serum cortisol concentrations and antibody titers increased after the second (booster) vaccination (P < 0. 05). In all the groups, the serum cortisol concentrations increased after the cattle were handled in the corral (P < 0. 05). No correlation was observed between the serum cortisol concentrations and the antibody titers with any treatment or on any observation day. In conclusion, booster vaccination is indispensable for primovaccinated cattle in achieving high and protective levels of rabies antibodies. Although booster vaccination and frequent cattle handling in corrals are stressors, the response is not strong enough to cause immunosuppression in cattle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Rabies is a fatal {{viral disease}} that {{potentially}} can affect all mammals. Terrestrial rabies {{is not present}} in the United Kingdom and has been eliminated from Western Europe. Nevertheless the possibility remains that rabies could be introduced to England, where it would find two potentially suitable hosts, red foxes and badgers. With the aim to analyse the spread and emergency control of rabies in this two species host community, a simulation model was constructed. Different control strategies involving <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccination</b> and population culling were developed, considering control application rates, spatial extent and timing. These strategies were evaluated for efficacy and feasibility to control rabies in hypothetical rural areas in the South of England immediately after a disease outbreak. Results The model confirmed that both fox and badger populations, separately, were competent hosts for the spread of rabies. Realistic vaccination levels were not sufficient to control rabies in high-density badger populations. The combined species community {{was a very strong}} rabies host. However, disease spread within species appeared to be more important than cross-species infection. Thus, the drivers of epidemiology depend on the potential of separate host species to sustain the disease. To control a rabies outbreak in the two species, both species had to be targeted. Realistic and robust control strategies involved vaccination of foxes and badgers, but also required badger culling. Although fox and badger populations in the UK are exceptionally dense, an outbreak of rabies can be controlled with a higher than 90 % chance, if control response is quick and follows a strict regime. This requires surveillance and forceful and repeated control campaigns. In contrast, an uncontrolled rabies outbreak in the South of England would quickly develop into a strong epizootic involving tens of thousands of rabid foxes and badgers. Conclusions If populations of both host species are sufficiently large, epizootics are driven by within-species transmission, while cross-species-infection appears to be of minor importance. Thus, the disease control strategy has to target both host populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{find out}} the period {{prevalence}} of animal bites and envenomings, its epidemiological risk factors and treatment seeking behaviour. Materials and methods: The present cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} the 34 villages of the field practising areas of the Rural Health Training Centre, Thiruvenainallur. Considering the prevalence of bites as 7. 4 %, and taking 5 members in each household with a non response of 10 % the number households studied were 4150 covering a population of 18865 which was calculated using an Open EPI version (2. 3) software package. Sampling frame of households was prepared and systemic random sampling method was used to select households from each village. Trained medical interns and social workers collected information on bites in the preceding one year. Data was entered and analyzed in Epi_info (3. 4. 3) software. Results: In this study, information of 12947 adults was included and the overall period prevalence of bites was 81. 8 / 1000 population. The most common bite is dog bite (22. 3) followed by scorpion (22. 1) and centipede (17. 8) per 1000 population. The dog bites are significantly higher among males, people below the poverty line, farmers and laborers. There is significantly increased risk of snake bites among people working in agriculture fields. Only 35 % of the dog bite victims washed their wound with soap and water and 28 % applied irritants such as ash, ink, calotropis milk etc. over the wounds. <b>Anti-rabies</b> <b>vaccination</b> was given in 60 % of the dog bite victims and life saving measure of Rabies Immunoglobulins (RIGS) was given in only in 6. 2 %.
