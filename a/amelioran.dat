40|$|Two {{studies of}} zeolite {{application}} on oil palm seedlings for repair media of planting using a sandy soil type to seedlings media of oil palm {{have been conducted}} by The Oil Palm Research Center at experimental garden Aek Pancur, North Sumatra. Research I using Typic Udipsamment soil with 4 dose level of zeolite (0, 50, 100, and 150 g / polybag). Research II using tin tailings which treated zeolite soil <b>amelioran</b> materials, empty fruit bunch compost, dolomite, and also compared with the top soil is Typic Hapludult. The study I showed that application of zeolite is generally able to increase nutrient content in soil and soil cation exchange capacity inclined growth of better seeds. However, at doses of 150 g/polybag, zeolite application actually lowers the pH and increasing Aldd was followed by poor seedling growth. The study II using tin tailings as planting media, zeolite application has not yielded as good as empty fruit bunch compost applications to support seedling growth and nutrient uptake. Continued research related to determining the appropriate dose, and combination with other soil <b>amelioran</b> materials to increasing effectiveness of zeolite in improving the physical, chemical, and biological soil charachteristic as a medium sand fraction dominated planting of oil palm breeding is still very necessary...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia rice {{production}} {{is not yet}} meet the need of main staple of its citizens due to increasing consumption per capita and income of the citizen. One of solution to meet the main staple need of the citizens is to utilize the peat area which characterized with low pH, low fertility, and high in organic acid substances. To overcome those limitations is by applying ameliorants which were ultisol soil, hull ash, and dolomite (as first factors) and four local rice varieties which were sokam, IR- 64, ciherang, and batang lembang (as second factors). The {{study was conducted in}} December 2007 through April 2008, at Pelokan village, Mukomuko District of Bengkulu Province. The study used split plot design in two factors. The combination of both factors resulted in sixteen pairs of treatments which replicated three times. The analysis of variances indicated that <b>amelioran</b> application resulted in differences on 1000 seed weight, while among local rice varieties showed differences in tiller number, productive tiller number, infertile seeds, and root dry weight. Interaction of both treatments indicated on 1000 seed weight. Sokam is the most favorable cultivar eventhough grown in that area without any ameliorant...|$|E

40|$|Acidic {{dry land}} the {{dominant}} soil types in Bengkulu province which have {{potential for the}} development of dryland agriculture, but it has properties to inhibit plant growth due to high soil acidity (average pH < 4. 5), high Al saturation, poor main macro-nutrient, especially P, K, Ca and Mg and low organic matter content. Application of P and K fertilizer and addition of organic matter (ameliorant) are expected to overcome the problems. The objectives {{of this study was to}} investigate the application of ameliorant on growth and yield of four groundnut varieties on acidic dry land planted in Bengkulu. The experiment was carried out on acidic dry land in Central Bengkulu from June to September 2014 in the dry season. The experimental design used was a split plot design with two factor, first factor were addition of <b>amelioran</b> and varieties second factor with four replicates. Peanut varieties used were Talam, Tuban, Kancil and Local. Ameliorant given was Dolomite at 0. 5 tons / ha and compost at 2. 5 tons / ha. Fertilizer used were Urea,SP- 36 and KCL at 75 kg / ha. The results showed that addition ameliorant was significantly different in plant height in early growth phase of peanut 28 and 42 days after planting (DAP) while for number of branch there is no significantly different. Addition ameliorant only provide significant difference in percentage of damaged pods, groundnut varieties provide real difference in weight of 100 grains, number of seeds / hill and number of pods / clump...|$|E
40|$|Fly ash as a coal {{combustion}} residue of thermal power plants has {{been regarded as}} a problematic solid waste all over the world. Due to the environmental problems created by large-scale fly ash generation, efforts are being made to recycle these materials. Generally, fly ash is a ferro-alumino-silicate mineral containing considerable quantities of Ca, K, and Na. They may, however, contain considerable quantities of minerals (aluminosilicate minerals like Mullite), which dissolve under strongly acidic conditions to provide liming function. Because of their chemical characteristics, fly ash {{have the potential to}} ameliorate soil chemical properties, such as the point of zero charge (PZC). Mixing fly ash with organic manure may enhanced the quality of the <b>amelioran</b> to improve the soils chemical properties. In the present study, the possibility to improving the status PZC in fly ash (FA) and chicken manure (CM) mixtures was investigated. Fly ash was mixed with organic matter in the form of cow chicken manure at 0 : 4, 1 : 3, 2 : 2, 3 : 1 and 4 : 0 ratios and incubated for 60 days. The FA+CM mixture with incubation time tended to decrease of the PZC status compared with the FA or CM alone. Among the different compositions of FA+CM mixtures, the 2 : 2 mixture at 45 days incubation time appeared to exhibit the lowest of the PZC compared with the other treatments. This composition could be use as an ameliorant to improve the soils chemical properties in terms of soil fertility and lowering PZC, and it is necessary for further research...|$|E

40|$|Saline soil cation dynamic is {{determined}} by the proportion of salt cations dissolved either acidic or alkaline.   Common base cations in saline soil are in the proportion of  Na >  Ca >  Mg >  K.   They affects the availability of water,  nutrients, and plant growth.   The six level of  NaCl  were 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and  75 mM  and  two  types of  soil  (saline and non saline) from Gununganyar and Mojokerto were evaluated  to soil sample cations taken from  depth of  0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15, and 15 - 20 cm. Rice growth and yields were measured. The experiment indicated  that increasing doses of NaCl increased the soil Na after rice harvest and decreased K, Ca and Mg contents, both of non-saline and saline soil, decreased of rice growth and yield (straw, grain, number of tiller).   NaCl up to 30 mM  caused highest Ca:Mg ratio, about 8, suppressed nutrient available, inhibited root growth and reduced nutrient uptake.
