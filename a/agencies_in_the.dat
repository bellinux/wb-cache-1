5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{has also}} suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967 it {{was listed as}} an endangered species, but the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife <b>agencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern United States stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate, and in 1987 it {{was removed from the}} endangered species list. Much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, a large area of marshland in the state of Louisiana. The resulting data has increased understanding of penning, stocking rates, egg incubation, hatching, rearing, and diet, and this information has been used at other establishments around the world. Income from the alligators kept at Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge contributes to conservation of the marshland. A study examining alligator farms in the United States showed that they have generated significant conservation gains, and poaching of wild alligators has greatly diminished.|$|E
