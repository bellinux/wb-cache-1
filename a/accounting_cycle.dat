The limitations of early business computing technology forced system designers to use batch processing. From an accounting process standpoint, batch systems don’t offer {{much of an}} improvement over paper-based ones in changing the timing of finance and accounting processes. They impose the same need to balance efficiency and control in taking computing systems off-line to handle computations and summarizations {{in a way that}} doesn’t interfere with transactions processing.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>cycle</b> <b>accounting</b> {{architecture}} for Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) processors that estimates the execution times {{for each of}} the threads had they been executed alone, while they are running simultaneously on the SMT processor. This is done by <b>accounting</b> each <b>cycle</b> to either a base, miss event or waiting cycle component during multi-threaded execution. Single-threaded alone execution time is then estimated as the sum of the base and miss event components; the waiting cycle component represents the lost cycle count due to SMT execution. The <b>cycle</b> <b>accounting</b> architecture incurs reasonable hardware cost (around 1 KB of storage) and estimates single-threaded performance with average prediction errors around 7. 2 % for two-program workloads and 11. 7 % for four-program workloads. The <b>cycle</b> <b>accounting</b> architecture has several important applications to system software and its interaction with SMT hardware. For one, the estimated single-thread alone execution time provides an accurate picture to system software of the actually consumed processor cycles per thread. The alone execution time instead of the total execution time (timeslice) may make system software scheduling policies more effective. Second, a new class of thread-progress aware SMT fetch policies based on per-thread progress indicators enable system software level priorities to be enforced at the hardware level.

At first, a mixed integer program (MIP) is proposed that projects the production lot trajectories (start and end dates) for the remaining subsequent steps, taking into account finite production capacities.

40|$|The {{two main}} goals of this thesis are {{to provide an}} {{assessment}} tool for accounting professors {{as well as a}} learning tool for students {{to gain a better understanding}} of the <b>accounting</b> <b>cycle.</b> Many students coming out of the basic accounting courses have a pretty good understanding of the different parts of the <b>accounting</b> <b>cycle,</b> but few have a solid understanding of the bigger picture and how each part fits together. I believe this is partly due to the fact that students in 200 level courses are never required to complete the <b>accounting</b> <b>cycle</b> from beginning to end. As such, it is necessary for professors to assess the level of knowledge possessed by new students beginning a particular course. In my experience as a student, I have found that when an introductory assessment is given in order for the professor to reflect on the results of that assessment and makes changes to the course curriculum as necessary, the overall success of the students in that course is much higher than if the assessment had not been given.

Frictions that reduce the efficiency with which factor inputs are used (efficiency wedge) were the primary factor in the economic downturn. The decline in consumption can be attributed to distortions in the Euler equation (investment wedge). In addition, frictions creating a gap between the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal product of labor (labor wedge) contributed to the slowdown of the economy after 1936. This drop in the efficiency wedge might have resulted from financial frictions and tariff policies, whereas the investment wedge might have been caused by financial frictions due to agency costs. A potential explanation for the decline of the labor wedge after 1936 is institutionals changes in the labor market. Business <b>cycle</b> <b>accounting,</b> French economy, Great Depression...|$|R
