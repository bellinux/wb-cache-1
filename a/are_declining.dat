5|$|The {{most common}} fish inhabiting the river include Chinook salmon, {{threatened}} coho salmon, and rainbow trout. Fish populations <b>are</b> <b>declining,</b> however, due to low {{water quality and}} barriers such as dams and culverts.|$|E
5|$|However, thanks {{largely to}} the crime {{prevention}} programme Saugus miestas ("Safe City"), crime rates in Žirmūnai, as in all other elderates of Vilnius, <b>are</b> <b>declining.</b> For instance, 886 crimes were registered in Žirmūnai during {{the first four months}} of 2005, versus 672 during the same period of 2006, a decline of about 24%. If this trend continues, Žirmūnai's crime rate for 2006 would decrease to about 37.2 crimes per 1,000 residents.|$|E

For example, for mortuus, mortua, mortuum (dead), mortua <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> {{like a regular}} first-declension noun (such as puella (girl)), mortuus <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> like a regular second-declension masculine noun (such as dominus (lord, master)), and mortuum <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> like a regular second-declension neuter noun (such as auxilium (help)).|$|R
5|$|The red-throated loon {{has a large}} global {{population}} and a significant global range, though some populations <b>are</b> <b>declining.</b> Oil spills, habitat degradation, pollution, and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces. Natural predators—including various gull species, and both red and Arctic foxes, will take eggs and young. The species is protected by international treaties.|$|E
5|$|Most tern species <b>are</b> <b>declining</b> {{in numbers}} {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased {{over the last century}} because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Predominantly insectivorous, the {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and the closeness of its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species {{for the study of}} warbler behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue warbler defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue warbler requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers <b>are</b> <b>declining.</b>|$|E

Other numerals such as διακόσιοι (diakosioi, [...] "two hundred"), τριακόσιοι (triakosioi, [...] "three hundred") etc. and χίλιοι (chilioi, [...] "thousand") <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> regularly like adjectives. Other numerals including two <b>are</b> not <b>declined.</b>|$|R
5|$|Terns are {{long-lived}} {{birds and}} are relatively free from natural predators and parasites; most species <b>are</b> <b>declining</b> in numbers due {{directly or indirectly}} to human activities, including habitat loss, pollution, disturbance, and predation by introduced mammals. The Chinese crested tern is in a critical situation and three other species are classed as endangered. International agreements provide a measure of protection, but adults and eggs of some species are still used for food in the tropics. The eggs of two species are eaten in the West Indies because they {{are believed to have}} aphrodisiac properties.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a near-threatened {{species and}} its numbers <b>are</b> <b>declining.</b> Threats include loss and {{fragmentation}} of habitat. While {{international trade in}} jaguars or their parts is prohibited, the cat is still frequently killed by humans, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous American cultures, {{including those of the}} Maya and Aztec.|$|E
5|$|Though human {{activities}} {{have allowed the}} expansion of a few species, such as the barn swallow and European starling, they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Micronesian islands. Many bird populations <b>are</b> <b>declining</b> worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as threatened by BirdLife International and the IUCN in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the IUCN {{listed the}} Asian {{elephant}} as endangered {{due to a}} 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years while CITES lists the species under Appendix I. Asian elephants once ranged from Syria and Iraq (the subspecies Elephas maximus asurus), to China (up to the Yellow River) and Java. It is now extinct in these areas, and the current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented. The total population of Asian elephants {{is estimated to be}} around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. It is likely that around half of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants <b>are</b> <b>declining</b> in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western Ghats appears to be increasing.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and cutting {{teeth of the}} silky shark make it {{potentially}} dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks are valued for their fins, {{and to a lesser}} extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the silky shark was once thought to buffer the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that silky shark numbers <b>are</b> <b>declining</b> around the world, which prompted the IUCN to reassess its conservation status from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2007.|$|E

5000|$|Adjectives <b>are</b> rarely <b>declined</b> for any purpose. They can <b>be</b> <b>declined</b> {{for number}} {{when they are}} used as {{substitutes}} for nouns (as in, [...] "I'll take the reds", meaning [...] "I'll take the red ones" [...] or as shorthand for [...] "I'll take the red wines", for example). Also the demonstrative determiners this and that <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> for number, as these and those. Some adjectives borrowed from other languages are, or can <b>be,</b> <b>declined</b> for gender, at least in writing: blond (male) and blonde (female). Adjectives <b>are</b> not <b>declined</b> for case in Modern English, though they were in Old English.

5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but <b>are</b> <b>declining</b> or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee species <b>are</b> <b>declining</b> in Europe, North America, and Asia due to {{a number}} of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E
