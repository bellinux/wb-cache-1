25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{previous}} claims, Clinkscales re-signed with the Hurricanes for the 2016–17 season on October 18, 2016, having been persuaded {{to make the}} decision by newly hired head coach Kevin Keathley. Clinkscales said, [...] "I am very excited to be returning to Halifax. I love the city <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> supporters. I'm ready to work hard and build a team to defend our title with Coach Keathley. Da General is back!" [...] However, Keathley was replaced by Mike Leslie by the start of the season. On December 26, in his season debut, Clinkscales scored six points, grabbed five rebounds, and passed for a team-high five assists to defeat the Moncton Miracles. He had another notable performance on January 12, 2017 vs. the Island Storm, scoring no points but recording 13 assists.|$|E

500|$|According to Jewish Law, one is {{obligated to}} grieve and rend one's garment upon visiting the Western Wall {{and seeing the}} desolate site of the Temple. Bach (17th century) instructs that [...] "when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are {{situated}} in the Western Wall, which is the wall King David built, he should recite: Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord". Some scholars write that rending one's garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control. Others disagree, pointing {{to the fact that}} the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim waqf and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress. If one hasn't seen the Wall for over 30 days, the prevailing custom is to rend one's garments, but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals. According to Donneal Epstein, a person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite: [...] "Our Holy Temple, which was our glory, in which our forefathers praised You, was burned <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> delights were destroyed".|$|E
500|$|The {{casting process}} {{continued}} into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. [...] "We {{have made the}} decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers," [...] stated Feige. [...] "Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks." [...] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it [...] "purposefully misleading" [...] and an [...] "inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be associated with only one character.|$|E

We hear a great deal of god-like minds, and of the far-reaching faculties we possess; and it may all be worthy of our eulogiums, until we compare ourselves in these, as in other particulars, with Him who produced them. Then, indeed, the utter insignificance of our means becomes too apparent to admit of a cavil. We know that we are born, and that we die; science has been able to grapple with all the phenomena of these two great physical facts, {{with the exception of the}} most material of all--those which should tell us what is life, and what is death.
