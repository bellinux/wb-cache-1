50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>avocet</b> nests near shallow, preferably {{alkaline}} {{lakes in}} the Andes, often in small groups. The eggs are laid {{in at least}} January.|$|E
50|$|The lake is a {{place to}} {{discover}} birds like <b>Andean</b> <b>avocet,</b> Andean lapwing, cattle egret, horned coot, Puna teal, ruddy duck and yellow-billed pintail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>avocet</b> forages {{in shallow}} water or on mud flats, often {{sweeping}} its bill {{from side to side}} in water as it seeks its crustacean and insect prey.|$|E
50|$|The French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot {{described}} the red-necked avocet in 1816, {{and it still}} bears its original name. It {{is one of four}} species of avocet that make up the genus Recurvirostra. A 2004 study combining genetics and morphology showed that it was the sister taxon to a lineage that gave rise to the <b>Andean</b> and American <b>avocets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Water {{birds are}} diverse, ranging from giant coot, Andean goose and other {{waterfowl}} in lakes, torrent duck in fast-flowing rivers, and <b>Andean</b> <b>avocet</b> and flamingos in hypersaline lakes such as Poopó.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>avocet</b> (Recurvirostra andina) {{is a large}} wader in the avocet and stilt bird family, Recurvirostridae. It is {{resident}} in the Andes, breeding above 3500 m in northwestern Argentina, western Bolivia, northern Chile and southern Peru.|$|E
50|$|The Soncor area {{includes}} the Chaxa, Puilar and Barros Negros lagoons. Despite the extreme conditions, the Salar de Atacama sustains {{a wide variety}} of species including Chilean and Andean flamingos (the latter using it as an important nesting site), the <b>Andean</b> <b>avocet,</b> the yellow-billed teal, the crested duck, the puna plover and Baird's sandpiper.Various plant species ground {{around the edges of the}} lagoons, such as Distichlis spicata, Ephedra and cachiyuyo (a species of the genus Atriplex), among others.The Sistema hidrológico de Soncor (Soncor hydrological system), like the Salar de Tara, is a Ramsar protected site. It comprises four shallow salt lakes.|$|E
50|$|Native mammals include llamas, alpacas, vicuñas and guanacos. Relatively few birds, {{such as the}} Darwin's rhea, Andean condor, {{and certain}} miners and yellow-finches, are {{frequently}} found in the vast expanses of puna grasslands, but numerous birds {{are associated with the}} highland lakes and marshes that are found in the puna grasslands, for example the Andean goose, Andean flamingo, <b>Andean</b> <b>avocet,</b> giant coot, puna teal and diademed sandpiper-plover. The highland puna is a biome that ecompases relatively large rserves. Some of the major species for its conservation are the Lama vicugna (vicuna) and Lama guanicoe. The guanaco (Lama guanicoe) is a camelid native to South America. This animal can grow up to four feet tall (1.2 metres).|$|E
