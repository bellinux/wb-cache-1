This study employs secondary data of 54 companies {{during the period of}} 4 years i. e. 2010 to 2013, except the data for variable dividend that is 2009 to 2012. The results showed that the agency costs significantly affected by the company's board of directors, board of commissioners, independent commissioners, audit committee, the concentration of shares, dividend policy, debt levels {{and the size of the}} company. As a component of corporate governance, the board of directors and board of commissioners significantly effect on reduction in agency costs. This shows that there are indications of progress in the implementation of corporate governance in Indonesia, particularly in the <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>companies</b> listed on IDX. In other words, it can be said that the implementation of the corporate governance has begun to be effective, though still an embryonic stage. As a novelty, the variable dividend also has a significant effect on reducing agency costs, both measured by BOM and TOA. It supports several previous studies, such as those conducted by Mutamimah and Hartono (2010) and Arifin (2005). While the influence of independent directors and audit committee actually significantly increase agency costs. This result is contrary to the initial hypothesis. This may happen because the independence issue, lack of integrity and the dominance of one party against another party, for example, the strong dominance of the commissioner of the independent directors. This dominance can occur due to lack of transparency and accountability in the recruitment process. Results also show that the influences of the size and debt of the company to agency costs can vary widely even conflicting. So that, it makes difficult to be concluded. Results could shade some highlights to management, investors and other decision makers that governance is already on the right track so it needs to be supported and encouraged in accordance with their own respective roles.

The {{impact of these}} changes for developing countries and for small farmers in those countries is not yet well understood. We analyze the developments in high-standards FFV supply chains and the effects for small farmers and rural households in Senegal. We use a unique dataset derived from company level interviews and household surveys in the main horticulture zone in Senegal. Supply chain restructuring resulted in a shift from contract-farming with small-scale producers to large-scale vertically integrated estate-farming. A comprehensive econometric analysis shows that the restructuring of the value chain has enhanced an equitable distribution of rents among the rural population. Contract-farming, {{on the one hand}} increases the gains from high-value production and trade that accrue to the rural smallholder population but on the other hand, leads to the exclusion of the poorest farmers. Estate-farming and associated rural employment have a smaller (albeit still significantly large) effect on rural incomes and probably increase the rents from high-value agricultural trade that are extracted by large <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>companies</b> but add to the income of the poorest households. This challenges the argument made in the literature that high-standards food production needs to integrate small farmers as suppliers if it needs to benefit rural development and increase the welfare for the poor.

These small-scale farmers’ challenges can be broadly classified into financial, technical and market challenges. Despite the awareness and the debate that favours progressing small-scale farmers from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture, financiers consider this group of farmers as of high risk and low returns. The emergence of contract farming as a mechanism to integrate small-scale farmers with agribusiness firms, <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>companies,</b> supermarket chains, and processors of agricultural produce has rescued the small-scale farmers from going into oblivion. Contract farming promises benefits for both the farmers and the contract sponsors. In {{the face of the}} benefits that contract farming hold, the concept has been critiqued as being an exploitative mechanism that contract sponsors use on the growers. This research evaluates the contract farming arrangement between Gledhow Sugar Company and Mansomini Farmers’ Cooperative. The study assesses how the scheme plays a part in the provision of access to finance, technical support and a guaranteed market access for the small sugarcane farmers. It explores how Gledhow Sugar Company’s structures manage to reduce the associated risk in providing finance to the small-scale farmers.

This environment consists of a huge number of agents, factors and relationships that influence directly or potentially conditional on the company’s competitive success of such a substantial way {{that is one of the}} main reasons explaining business failure. The current research builds on the “functional environment in Seville Province”, where the variables and their relationships are defined according to the logic of the entire system of the determinants of competitive advantage Michael Porter. Objective: The present study aims to analyze the functional environment of agribusiness in the department of Cesar, through the application of statistical correlation models, allowing an approximation to the definition of the structural type and level of quality business same. Method: The selected variables were sketched in the survey of 23 representative Cesar agribusinesses. 16 The research hypotheses posed in order to define relationships on: size, age, quality, innovation, business with government, borrowing, hostile environments, control, corporate social awareness, among others. The relationships are validated through the technique of Pearson correlation coefficient and covariance. The resulting data are subjected to analysis and comparison with the draft Seville (Spain). Then the information is tabulated and business profiles agribusiness sub-sector in the department of Cesar down. Results: From the results obtained, three (3) of the assumptions are valid and thirteen (13) are discarded, unlike research in Seville where most relationships among the studied variables (9 valid) are due to microeconomic differences territorial and corporate culture. From the foregoing, it is claimed between the companies studied a relationship between the size of the companies with which it cooperates and the physical location of the companies with which a cooperation agreement is established. In addition, the size of firms is significantly related to the certification of quality systems, that is, firms with larger are the most likely to certify their management systems quality.

40|$|Food {{security}} at present {{is a hot}} topic and is increasingly receiv¬ing more attention. This {{is partly due to}} the fast growing population and partly to the more frequent extreme events that are affect¬ing food production. Drought is becoming more frequent and {{in many parts of the}} world resulting in signiﬁcant negative impacts on food production. Increasing food production to meet the need of the growing population and to mitigate the impact of the drought events requires increasing cultivable lands, irrigation water sup¬plies, and the food produced per drop of applied water. The natural resources for food production are limited and in most cases, water is a limiting factor for food production. Field and laboratory research has shown that Improvements in agriculture water management can result in producing more food with the existing water supply. Non-conventional water resources could be used for irrigation provided proper manage¬ment is in place to safeguard the environment. Waste water is the most guaranteed water resource on the planet as it will always be available as long as human beings are still living on the face of the earth. The EU supported a worldwide project, SAFIR, to investigate the possible water saving techniques and the quality and safety of food produced when using treated waste water. The project involved 17 research and business part¬ners and 14 sites. Two main crops widely used in the world, namely potato and tomato, were selected. The project involved microbiologists and hygiene specialists, agronomists, wastewater treatment specialists, modellers, irrigation scientists, crop sci¬entists, <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>companies,</b> chemists, soil scientists and socio-economists. The two main objectives were how to save water without reduc¬ing the crop yield, and how to use treated waste water for irrigation, while investigating the impact on food quality and the safety of the food for human consumption. To meet the ﬁrst objective, deﬁcit irrigation which uses less water than full irrigation, where the full crop requirement is met, was considered. This included the use of the partial root drying method, PRD, where half of the vertical root zone is irrigated at any one time and alternated in the subsequent times. Deﬁcit irrigation was also considered with the classical drip, furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems by simply applying reduced ratios of the full crop water requirement. Water saving also included application of water below the surface in case of the subsurface drip irrigation to minimize the losses by evaporation. Small water treatment stations were installed at the top of the ﬁelds for waste water treatment were developed by the industrial partners and the water was checked for quality to ensure health standards were met before irrigation. This was followed by inves¬tigation of the microbial and chemical status of the soil, and of the tomato and potato crop in terms of quality and safety for human consumption. The following papers will discuss the results obtained under the project and will highlight the issues and bottlenecks. The papers will show that there is a possibility to save water through the use of deﬁcit irrigation, especially drip-PRD, if it is properly managed fol¬lowing root establishment. The socio-economic analysis papers will illustrate the ﬁnancial gains when using such water saving tech¬niques and the role of institutions in adopting those techniques and encouraging the use of treated waste water under controlled man¬agement. The papers will also show the treated waste water could be safely used, for at least 3 years, with no harmful impact on the human health and without negative effect on either fruit quality, soil microorganisms or soil properties, especially the heavy metals content. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{reviews the}} essence, nature, {{features}} and basic {{approaches to the}} interpretation of vertical integration. It proves {{that one of the}} key conditions for modernizing and neo-industrializing domestic economy and transforming Russia into an industrialized country is overcoming technological fragmentation of business entities, {{as was the case in}} the Soviet Union and is now observed in the developed countries. In this situation, it is vertical integration which can ensure the diversification and restructuring of the economy, the linkage between the extractive and processing industries. Based on the results of analyzing the activities of major multinational corporations (Royal Dutch Shell, Sinopec Corp., Valio Ltd. etc.) it has been proved that these integrated systems supply competitive products with high degrees of processing and serve as growth drivers in developed economies. To justify this, the author calculated the companies’ value added multiplier. Currently, vertically integrated systems such as PhosAgro PJSC, LUKOIL PJSC, Miratorg <b>agro-industrial</b> holding <b>company,</b> KamAZ OJSC, Arkhangelsk pulp and paper mill PJSC operate in various economic sectors. The article shows that most of these companies’ level of technological integration is still not optimal; the formation of a full production chain is an additional factor in their development and competitive recovery. Accordingly, the author believes that the key objective of federal and regional authorities should be the transformational change in the economy by eliminating its disintegration and restoring processing chains of value added in priority economic sectors. The example of metallurgical industries integration (Steel Manufacture PJSC) and machine-building integration (Mashinostroitel Corporation JSC) shows many positive internal and external impacts of this kind of association. The creation of vertically integrated systems implies the development of a public policy which, through the use of complex direct and indirect tools, would encourage businesses to participate in integration processes...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the rural}} {{population}} in Mozambique operates totally outside the reach of any financial sector operator. Nearly all {{of the rural}} districts have no formal banking facilities at all. The microfinance sector is small and has an urban and peri-urban orientation, while both the community-based financial arrangements and development credit institutions have a very limited outreach in rural areas. This institutional situation makes {{it very difficult for}} the financial sector to respond to the increasing demands for rural financial services in the country and today practically all seasonal agricultural credit to smallholders is provided by marketing and processing companies under interlocking arrangements. These interlocking arrangements vary from the contract farming to the farmers’ cooperatives. This study focuses on the contract farming type of coordination. It refers to a situation where the contractor agrees on providing inputs and extension services, and expects that the farmer in return provide the input for the agro-processing industry. The contractor can be from the small commercial entity to the enormous agro-processing industry. This arrangement has the potential, according to the literature reviewed, to alleviate the problems arising in the contractual arrangements, like moral hazard and asymmetric information that generates market failures. It also is considered as potential credit channel to the smallholders in rural areas, once they are targeted by the credit market failure. The operations and traditional production technology of the typical family farm, and its associated credit needs, are too small to warrant the economic extension of the formal credit system. In the short term it can not be expected that the commercial banks would reconsider their strategies of market expansion into agricultural commerce. This study aims to assess to what extent contract farming can be considered as one attenuating instrument of the hindered rural financial sector. The study draws upon the contract farming scheme practiced by the MLT – Mozambique Leaf Tobacco Ltd and DIMMON – Tabacos de Moçambique, in the Tete province. The data was collected using standard and simple, but credible, methodology. The data was obtained through the Ministry of Agriculture, Centro de Promoção de Investimentos (CPI) and some private institutions and individuals. For the confirmation and additional information on the CF scheme, the company’s management were contacted. In terms of the data analysis three main approaches were taken to gradually increase confirmation of the proposed hypothesis. One was a triangulation of positivism, post positivism and logical empiricism in order to consider both quantitative and qualitative information. Secondly, Econometrics approach was used. It helped to inspect the sample, through sample mean tests, student t-test and one-way analysis of variance. In addition to this, regression analysis were also used, namely Linear and Logistic (Logit), in order to assess the hypotheses derived for the topic of the study. And finally the case study method which allowed the analysis of a specific case from Mozambique, already mentioned above, being the case of the Tete province’s tobacco <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>companies.</b> The results it’s of the regressions ran, suggest that the location (district), the land proportion reserved for each type of crop, the hand tools endowment, level of credit in terms of value are important determinants for the success of the CF’s credit scheme as alternative source of credit for the tobacco growers of Tete province. The regressions showed also that there is a relation between the income per member of the household and their characteristic, but it is not as strong to support the idea that their characteristics explain why they are better off under the CF scheme. But it also does not reject the idea that growers characteristics, like the household size, their core activities, whether is farming or/and outside farming, do show some important effects on their well being. As to conclusions, the agro-industrial CF scheme was shown to be a good alternative to alleviate the credit constraint problem. The results also suggest that CF {{can be used as a}} way to link small-scale farmers with agribusiness, on condition that the correct governance structures, good relation between the parties and reduction of transaction cost are taken into account. But at the same time it is also clear that company credit is not, and does not aim to be, a substitute for the operations of the financial institutions. The range of financial services provided by the marketing companies is very narrow, consisting in most cases only of small in-kind seasonal loans. From different alternatives of coordination options that came up, it was clear that not a unique one of them could be considered as the most appropriate one in order to attenuate the problem analysed. The problem of the agriculture development goes beyond the credit issue to inputs and technology availability, access to markets, transportation and stocking facilities are few among the many existents. Thus there should by an integrated analysis of these issues in order to compute a strategic plan comprising both sectors, financial and agricultural, for the development of the agricultural sector...|$|R
40|$|The 57 th International Agricultural Machinery Show (SIMA) held in Paris from 9 th to 16 th March 1986 {{included}} a collective stand for small-scale manufacturers {{who are not}} usually represented at the show. At this stand visitors were given a good overview of all the machines which are exported to the tropics. In case anyone was taken in by the range and quantity of equipment on show, it should be made clear that very few of these are found on a wide scale in Africa. The only forms of machinery that are making real inroads and attracting {{a growing number of}} farmers are draught operated and postharvest equipment Very little farming is undergoing light or heavy tractorisation. Manual cultivation is still the norm in much of sub Saharan Africa: more than 80 % of the land is cultivated by hand. Countless {{attempts have been made to}} modernise this pattern of agriculture but the initiatives have largely been based on the European experience. They have usually proved ill-suited to the soil and crops of these countries and, above all, to the socio-economic conditions of the farmers Today, fortunately, there is a general move back towards solutions which are more closely tailored to the local situation. Most of these rely on draught animals, which increasingly appear to be an essential first step towards the development of smallscale motorised mechanization. that most people are seeking. South of the Sahara, draught animals are traditionally used in Ethiopie; at the moment they account for no more than 15 % of the land under cultivation; animals are used in the Sahel, particularly in areas where farming and pastoralism overlap. This method of cultivation is only practised, however, where crops bring in enough money for peasants to be able to make the investment pay. Draught-operated cultivation has not caught on in Guinea where trypanosomiasis is rife and where there is therefore no tradition of animal breeding. As the first stage in the process of agricultural mechanization, animal power has clear advantages, as is shown by the renewed interest it is arousing both at the research level and in terms of government policies. It provides a gradual introduction to the methods of preparing the land with straightforward, easy-to-maintain equipment, and it uses a form of energy produced on-the-spot. Animal power immediately increases to ten or twelve hectares the surface area each farmer can cultivate, and helps to assure their food self-sufficiency. A considerable amount of money can also be made out of the use of draught animals for transport and the sale of these animals for meat. Most of the draught-operated equipment in existence is designed for land preparation which remains the major constraint in manual cultivation. There were many examples of such equipment at SIMA: hoes ploughs, harrows, cultivators, toolbars and multi-purpose cultivators. Also on show were seeders, often combined with muck-spreaders; however, there is a growing tendency for these devices to be manufactured locally, since to be effective they need to be designed specifically for the local agricultural conditions and draught animals (cattle, horses or donkeys). One African manufacturer from Swaziland was represented at SIMA, having taken the sensible view that his robust, draught-operated equipment, tried and tested for years by farmers in that region, could be of interest to other African countries Motorised mechanization is nowhere near as widespread as animal power. Only 1 % of land is cultivated in this way. Before this percentage can be increased, a whole range of technical solutions will be needed to meet the needs of different forms of cultivation without going beyond the farmers' means. The last few years have seen efforts to adapt equipment for these countries, but the very small market which exists for this motorised equipment makes it impossible to produce it on-the-spot at an attractive price; although it may occasionally be put together in Africa, it is always manufactured outside the continent The most basic form of motorised land preparation is motorised cultivators, of which a few Chinese models were on show at SIMA, and motorised toolbars where the implements are placed between the front and back wheels of the apparatus. Motorised cultivators have yet to make an impact in Africa; they were not successful when introduced in areas of irrigated cultivation because it is hard for farmers to apply two new techniques (mechanization and irrigation) at the same time. These small devices, which can be very useful, need further testing and technical simplification to overcome maintenance problems in these countries. They would be very suitable for small-scale farming, particularly for vegetables, however their lack of power restricts their usage. As a result, for the past fifteen years, research workers and manufacturers have concentrated on a form of motorised mechanization referred to as intermediate, more powerful than these small machines, but not so powerful as conventional tractors; they have developed 20 to 30 HP tractors, designed for tropical crops, adapted so they can be used and maintained by small farmers and are not too expensive. The best known in Africa are the small hydrostatic Tinkabi tractor developed in Swaziland and the TE tractor introduced by the cotton industry in French-speaking Africa. The latter was on show at SIMA and is a simplified tractor with manual start and belt transmission, made up of pieces which are easy to take apart and replace. It was initially designed for use in cotton fields but has now been adapted for other crops. Since the end of the seventies 1500 TE tractors have been exported to Burkina Faso, Mali, Cameroon and, above all, to Ivory Coast (600 tractors). To date, they have only been introduced in cotton growing areas where animal traction had already started the process of crop mechanization and where maintenance and training can be provided. These small tractors make it possible to cultivate larger areas. Within a few years peasants are able to use the extra income generated to obtain equipment to tend their crops, and then start the process of intensification. However, the key factor in this process of intensification remains the use of fertilizers and improved varieties rather than the introduction of new methods of farming. Experience shows that at least 18 to 20 hectares are needed to make a tractor pay; scarcely 1 to 3 % of plots in West Africa reach this size, although, where feasible, villagers could group together to overcome this obstacle to intensification. Moreover in Guinea, where animals are not used for cultivation, the introduction of tractors requires a difficult technological and financial leap. The renewed interest in animal power and the development of intermediate forms of motorised mechanization are partly a result of the repeated failures of heavy tractorisation. After the Second World War the tractor, symbol of all that was powerful and modern, was seen as the answer to everything. Throughout Africa, from Guinea, where tractors brought from Rumania could never be used, to Ghana, to Madagascar and, on a smaller scale, in every other African country, thousands of tractors imported at great expense lie rusting, pathetic relics of a past age. FAO calculates that of the 25 million tractors currently in existence throughout the world, 150 000 of these are to be found in sub-Saharan Africa and many of these are unusable. High-powered tractors are too expensive, consume too much energy and are too difficult to maintain. Farmers cannot afford them, and the short rainy season makes it difficult for groups to use them collectively. Furthermore, using these tractors means denuding large areas of land of all natural vegetation, often harming the fragile African soil which is all too easily eroded. It is also very rare for farmers themselves to own and operate these conventional tractors. This only happens in the Highlands of East Africa where they were introduced many years ago by Europeans before being taken up by local farmers, in a few areas of heavy soil which cannot be cultivated manually and which respond well to intensification (irrigated or flooded rice plains, the savannas in the Sudan), as well as some major coffee, cocoa and banana plantations in Ivory Coast. Most of these tractors are owned by <b>agro-industrial</b> <b>companies</b> who alone can afford, maintain and make profitable use of them. Aid organisations and African governments are now aware of these problems and, on the whole, have abandoned the blanket goal of heavy 'tractorisation' preferring to leave the initiative to those who have the means in the private sector. To date, most research into tropical machinery has concentrated on the process of preparing the land while harvesting is still done by hand. Mechanization may well make it possible to increase the amount of land under cultivation per unit of effort, but harvesting this land by hand calls for a large labour force which is not always available in regions where urban drift is a growing trend. This agricultural bottleneck shifts as machinery is developed for the successful phases of agricultural development from preparing the land to tending the crops and harvesting. Furthermore, in the case of some crops such as rice, quick harvests allow a second crop to be grown. Draught-operated harvesting equipment is practically non-existent because of the lack of draught animals. However, a few intermediate motorised machines have started to appear. On show at SIMA was a rice harvester developed by C. E. E. M. A. T. (Centre for Study and Experimentation into Tropical Agricultural Machinery), Paris, France. This machine threshes rice on the spot leaving the straw behind in the field, thus harvesting and winnowing in a single operation. The 6 -to- 8 -horsepower machine was designed for small paddy fields. Having been tested in Senegal and Cameroon, it will soon be mass-produced. A more powerful and conventional machine, the Belin B 2200 combine harvester which was awarded the silver medal at SIMA this year, is specially designed for the tropics and can harvest different types of cereals and grasses. But its high price means it can only be used by entrepreneurs and in large plantations. While the tractorisation of land preparation has hardly begun and depends on a well organised system of credit and predictable agricultural prices, motorised equipment for post-harvest operations is making considerable inroads and does not entail the introduction of global development projects. Because these stationary machines are not subject to the same weather restrictions as machines worked in the fields, they can be bought and used collectively by groups of farmers, often women, villages or cooperatives, and no one needs to spend too much money. Because they make the job so much quicker and more pleasant their profitability is immediatly obvious to all. Faced with this expanding market, manufacturers are trying to diversify the range of equipment on offer and motorise all operations from harvesting through to food production. Different types of mills and grinders have of course been in existence for a long time, ranging from small, hand-operated cereal mills to big hammer mills which can grind both maize and cassava. These machines, which were on show at SIMA, have sold particularly well. But threshing, shelling and husking machines are also taking off; some recent models of these were on display at SIMA. They include the Ecomat threshing machines, with different models for rice and peanuts, and the Bamba machine on sale in French-speaking Africa which can be used for millet and sorghum, cowpeas, maize and rice. Other machines adapted for use in forested areas are more specifically designed to deal with maize. Several manufacturers have just developed husking machines for rice which should be on the market soon. This sector, which is certainly a growth area, affects both town and countryside. If urban dwellers are to be able' to consume local produce, less time must be spent on processing it and motorised equipment is essential. African agriculture needs to be mechanised and motorised if these countries are to increase their agricultural production to feed a population which is growing rapidly, particularly in the towns. The solutions put forward must of course meet the technical requirements, but they must also take into account the economic and social environment of each particular region because this will often determine the success or failure of programmes and projects designed to modernise agriculture in these countries Field of abandoned tractors in Ivorv Coast BIBLIOGRAPHY C E E M AT Manuel de motorisation des cultures tropicales 1974 2 volumes 120 FF C E E M A T.
