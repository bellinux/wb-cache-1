40|$|Testosterone plays a {{major role}} in male sexual development. Exposure of females to {{testosterone}} in utero can induce masculine characteristics such as anovulation, increased anogenital distance (AGD), <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>nipples,</b> retention of male-like tissues, and agenesis of the lower vagina. In addition, high levels of androgens during fetal development can lead to toxic effects such as reduced litter size and viability. The study of the effects of testosterone administration during sexual differentiation provides a foundation for understanding the effects of environmental androgens on fe-tuses, a sensitive subpopulation. In the current study, we investi-gated the ability of a range of concentrations of testosterone propionate (TP) administered prenatally to masculinize female and alter male offspring, and measured maternal and fetal T levels.

40|$|Masculinization is {{programmed}} by androgen exposure {{during a}} masculinization programming window (MPW). Deficiency in MPW androgen action results in reduced size of all reproductive organs and anogenital distance (AGD) and reproductive disorders. Although timing of MPW closing has been defined, what determines ‘opening’ and ‘closing’ of the MPW remains unknown. To test whether initiation of testosterone production/action defines {{the opening of}} the window, we first demonstrated that androgen receptor mRNA and protein are expressed prior to the MPW, and then investigated whether masculinization could be advanced or enhanced by treating pregnant rats with either 1 or 10 mg/kg/day dihydrotestosterone (DHT) prior to (early window, EW; e 11. 5 –e 14. 5) or during the MPW (e 15. 5 –e 18. 5), and then evaluating offspring in foetal life (e 18. 5, e 21. 5), early puberty (day 25) or adulthood (∼day 75). DHT treatment did not affect pregnancy duration, birth, litter or pup size. DHT exposure in either time window did not advance foetal male development (Wolffian duct coiling) and had no effect on AGD, testis, penis and ventral prostate (VP) size at any age when measured; there was a tendency towards smaller penis size. In contrast, exposure of females to 10 mg DHT in either time window induced varying degrees of masculinization, including stabilization of the Wolffian duct and increased AGD (e 21. 5, Pnd 25), VP formation, more male-like phallus structure, <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>nipples</b> and vaginal opening and, in some adult females, gross fluid distension of the uterus (hydrometrocolpos); these effects were generally more pronounced after exposure in the MPW than in the EW. In conclusion, exposure of the male rat foetus to additional androgens prior to or during the MPW does not advance or enhance any measured parameter of reproductive development. Therefore, androgen availability plays no role in determining timing of the MPW. Susceptibility of the female reproductive system to androgens may precede the MPW...|$|E

40|$|Ectopic or {{accessory}} {{breast tissue}} (EBT) is an uncommon residual tissue that persists from normal embryonic development, found in 2 - 6 % {{of the female}} population. EBT may occur anywhere along the embryonic mammary streak, but is most commonly located in the axillary region. EBT can consist of any or all components of the breast and may be functional or non-functional. The development of this tissue is hormone- dependent, similar to normal breast tissue. EBT presents as asymptomatic mass and {{may prove to be}} a diagnostic challenge in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> areola and <b>nipple.</b> The identification and distinction of EBT from other breast pathologies occurring in the area, both benign and malignant, is essential for proper management.

40|$|Background: Persistent nipple pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons given by mothers for ceasing {{exclusive}} breastfeeding. We aimed to determine the frequency <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain as a reason for consultation, the most common attributed aetiologies, and the effectiveness of the advice and treatment given. Methods: All consultations at the Breast Feeding Centre of Western Australia (WA) were audited over two six-month periods in 2011 (n = 469) and 2014 (n = 708). Attributed cause(s) <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain, microbiology results, treatment(s) advised, and resolution of pain were recorded. Results: Nipple pain was one of the reasons for consultation in 36 % of cases. The most common attributed cause <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> pain was incorrect positioning and attachment, followed by tongue tie, infection, palatal anomaly, flat or inverted nipples, mastitis, and vasospasm. Advice included correction of positioning and attachment, use <b>of</b> a <b>nipple</b> shield, resting the nipples and expressing breastmilk, frenotomy, oral antibiotics, topical treatments, and cold or warm compresses. Pain was resolving or resolved in 57 % of cases after 18 days (range 2 – 110).

Recent evidences have shown that involvement <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> areola complex in breast cancer have been over estimated in the past based on older concept of occult tumor in the region <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> and areola.

The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate that the use of a tightly rolled dermal graft is effective in the long-term maintenance <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> projection. MethodsNipple reconstruction was performed using the C-V flap technique. A dermal graft was harvested from the dog-ear portion of previous scars. The graft was rolled tightly into a compact cylinder and used to augment the nipple reconstruction. Postoperatively, stacked Allevyn dressing was used for protecting the nipple from compression for a minimum <b>of</b> two months. <b>Nipple</b> projection was measured at the time of surgery and at 12 months postoperatively. ResultsForty nipple reconstructions were performed using this technique. There were 19 transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flaps, 10 latissimus dorsi (LD) flaps, and 11 tissue-expanded breast mounds. At one year, the mean projection was 0. 80 cm (range, 0. 62 - 1. 22 cm). The twelve-month average maintenance <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> projection was 70. 2 % for the TRAM flap group, 76. 3 % for the LD flap group, and 61. 8 % for the tissue-expanded group. In two patients with previous irradiation of the reconstructed breasts, relatively poor maintenance <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> projection was noted (45. 7 %). No complications were noted, and all of the donor sites healed well primarily. ConclusionsOur results demonstrated that the use of a C-V flap with a tightly rolled dermal graft for nipple reconstruction improves the long-term maintenance <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> projection. Its advantages include reproducibility, technical simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and minimal donor site morbidity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Nipple adenoma is a {{relatively}} rare benign breast neoplasm, and cases of the disease arising from the axillary accessory breast have very seldom {{been reported in the}} English literature. We report a case <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> adenoma arising from axillary accessory breast including clinical and pathological findings. An 82 -year-old woman presented with the complaint of a small painful mass in the right axilla. Physical examination confirmed a well-defined eczematous crusted mass that was 8 mm in size. The diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> adenoma was made from an excisional specimen on the basis of characteristic histological findings. Microscopic structural features included a compact proliferation of small tubules lined by epithelial and myoepithelial cells, and the merging of glandular epithelial cells of the adenoma into squamous epithelial cells in the superficial epidermal layer. Because clinically nipple adenoma may resemble Paget’s disease and pathologically can be misinterpreted as tubular carcinoma, the correct identification <b>of</b> <b>nipple</b> adenoma {{is an important factor in}} the differential diagnosis for axillary tumor neoplasms.
