Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is well worth the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story.

5|$|Dr. Robert Roswell, a {{previous}} VA Undersecretary of Health and now Professor of Medicine at the University of Oklahoma, said that an <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> of VHA performance was not patient wait times, which were largely outside {{the control of}} the staff, because VHA employees do not control the number of patients seeking care. A better measure of performance, would for example, measure the efficient use of VHA resources, such as the number of no-show appointments.|$|E
25|$|Economists also {{debate the}} {{definition}} of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure.</b> The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting {{the use of the}} lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members.|$|E

25|$|When {{studying}} how diseases are caused, incidence rates {{are the most}} <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> of disease frequency as they assess risk directly. However, incidence {{can be difficult to}} measure with rarer chronic diseases such as autism. In autism epidemiology, point or period prevalence is more useful than incidence, as the disorder starts long before it is diagnosed, and the gap between initiation and diagnosis is influenced by many factors unrelated to risk. Research focuses mostly on whether point or period prevalence is increasing with time; cumulative incidence is sometimes used in studies of birth cohorts.|$|E
25|$|Careful {{matching}} of {{the discount}} rate to the <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> of economic income {{is critical to the}} accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, {{the discount rate}}s are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E
25|$|Peter Townsend {{transformed}} {{the conception of}} poverty, viewing it not simply as lack of income but as {{the configuration of the}} economic conditions that prevent people from being full members of the society (Townsend, 1979; Ferragina et al. 2016). Poverty reduces the ability of people to participate in society, effectively denying them full citizenship (as suggested by T.H. Marshall). Given that there are no universal principles by which to determine the minimum threshold of participation equating to full membership of society, Townsend argued that the <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> would necessarily be relative to any particular cultural context. He suggested that in each society there should be an empirically determinable 'breakpoint' within the income distribution below which participation of individuals collapses, providing a scientific basis for fixing a poverty line and determining the extent of poverty (Ferragina et al. 2016).|$|E

25|$|Like other TCAs, doxepin {{is highly}} toxic {{in cases of}} overdose. Mild {{symptoms}} include drowsiness, stupor, blurred vision, and excessive dryness of mouth. More serious adverse effects include respiratory depression, hypotension, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Urinary retention, decreased gastrointestinal motility (paralytic ileus), hyperthermia (or hypothermia), hypertension, dilated pupils, and hyperactive reflexes are other possible symptoms of doxepin overdose. Management of overdose is mostly supportive and symptomatic, and can include the administration of a gastric lavage so as to reduce absorption of the doxepin. Supportive measures to prevent respiratory aspiration is also advisable. Antiarrhythmic agents may be an <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> to treat cardiac arrhythmias resulting from doxepin overdose. Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine may reverse some of the toxic effects of overdose such as anticholinergic effects. Haemodialysis is not recommended due to {{the high degree of}} protein binding with doxepin. ECG monitoring is recommended for several days after doxepin overdose due to the potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|In much of macroecology, {{the use of}} EOO as {{a measure}} of range size may be appropriate; however, AOO is a more <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> when {{evaluating}} O–A relationships. In macroecological investigations that are primarily biogeographical in nature, the variables of interest can be expected to vary most from one extent of occurrence to the opposite, and less so through discontinuities contained within the total EOO. However, when investigating O-A relationships, the area occupied by a species is the variable of interest, and the inclusion of discontinuities within the EOO could significantly influence results. In the extreme case where occupied habitats are distributed at random throughout the EOO, a relationship between abundance and range size (EOO) would not be expected. Because O–A relationships have strong conservation implications, Gaston and Fuller have argued that clear distinctions need to be made as to the purpose of the EOO and AOO as measures of range size, and that in association with O-A relationships the AOO is the more useful measure of species abundance.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding happiness and leisure relies on subjective well-being (SWB) as an <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> of happiness. Research has demonstrated {{a wide variety of}} contributing and resulting factors in the relationship between leisure and happiness. These include psychological mechanisms, and the types and characteristics of leisure activities that result in the greatest levels of subjective happiness. Specifically, leisure may trigger five core psychological mechanisms including detachment-recovery from work, autonomy in leisure, mastery of leisure activities, meaning-making in leisure activities, and social affiliation in leisure (DRAMMA). Leisure activities that are physical, relational, and performed outdoors are correlated with greater feelings of satisfaction with free time. Research across 33 different countries shows that individuals who feel they strengthen social relationships and work on personal development during leisure time are happier than others. Furthermore, shopping, reading books, attending cultural events, getting together with relatives, listening to music and attending sporting events is associated with higher levels of happiness. Spending time on the internet or watching TV is not associated with higher levels of happiness as compared to these other activities.|$|E

500|$|Historian Louis Green {{writes that}} the Cronica was written with three general {{assumptions}} about morality which shaped {{the organization of the}} work, [...] " [...] events into recurring patterns of significance." [...] These general assumptions were that excess brings disaster, that history is governed by a struggle between right and wrong, {{and that there is a}} direct connection between the events of the natural world and the overriding, supernatural and divine will of God who intercedes in these events. For example, Villani described the story of Count Ugolini of Pisa, who at the height of attaining his ill-gotten wealth and power was overthrown and eventually starved to death along with his sons. Green writes that this story in the Cronica bears a resemblance to the ancient Greek story of Polycrates and his ring in the work of Herodotus. However, Green notes that Villani's [...] "cautionary tales" [...] disembarked from the Classical Greek tradition of the arrogant and haughty rich falling from fortune due to the Greek belief in equalizing forces determining one's unavoidable fate, which Green calls [...] "excessive good fortune having to be balanced by an <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> of sorrow." [...] Villani's adherence to Medieval Christianity allowed him to suggest retribution was delivered because of sin and insult to God. He stressed that those who gained prestige would fall prey to pride; confidence in their position would then lead them to sin, and sin would bring on a stage of decline. Villani wrote: ...|$|E

Furthermore, counsel argued that as far as the law was concerned, the Indian Act did not discriminate against Indian women.

[...] Rehnquist contended that the appropriate frame of analysis for the Court should be one that is deferential to the concerns of the legislature.

2500|$|George Devol {{applied for}} the first {{robotics}} patents in 1954 (granted in 1961). [...] The first company to produce a robot was Unimation, founded by Devol and Joseph F. Engelberger in 1956. Unimation robots were also called programmable transfer machines since their main use at first was to transfer objects from one point to another, less than a dozen feet or so apart. They used hydraulic actuators and were programmed in joint coordinates, i.e. the angles of the various joints were stored during a teaching phase and replayed in operation. [...] They were accurate to within 1/10,000 of an inch (note: although accuracy is not an <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> for robots, usually evaluated in terms of repeatability - see later). [...] Unimation later licensed their technology to Kawasaki Heavy Industries and GKN, manufacturing Unimates in Japan and England respectively. [...] For some time Unimation's only competitor was Cincinnati Milacron Inc. of Ohio. This changed radically in the late 1970s when several big Japanese conglomerates began producing similar industrial robots.|$|E
2500|$|People {{were once}} {{concerned}} that {{being exposed to}} more than one language would be confusing and cause bilinguals to lag behind their monolingual peers in language development, but multiple researchers have refuted this claim. Bilinguals appear to acquire the same milestones—including when they say their first word, when they say their first telegraphic phrase, and when they obtain a vocabulary of fifty words—within the [...] "normal range of variation" [...] of monolingual development in each language. This is an analysis of overall vocabulary in bilinguals, as this is the more accurate and <b>appropriate</b> <b>measure</b> of language development in bilinguals. Analyzing only one of a bilingual individual's languages would seriously underestimate their true vocabulary knowledge. Note that any vocabulary deficits in one language are likely filled by knowledge in the other language, suggesting a likelihood that bilinguals know more vocabulary words than monolinguals in general. To this effect, researchers emphasize the importance of assessing overall vocabulary in bilinguals because assessing only one is an underestimation of their true knowledge, and when assessed in overall vocabulary bilingual children were no different from monolingual children in terms of language development.|$|E
