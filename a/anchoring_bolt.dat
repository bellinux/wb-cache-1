30|$|Telue and Mahendran (2002) {{conducted}} {{experiments on}} cold-formed steel frames {{to investigate the}} behavior of plaster cover plates in the wall of these frames {{and concluded that the}} load-carrying capacity of the studs of wall panels would significantly increase if brace and cover plates were used. Fülöp and Dubina (2004) tested three X-braced screw-connected wall specimens (3.6  m long ×  2.44  m high) under in-plane lateral loading. Of the three wall specimens, one was tested monotonically and two cyclically. The walls were constructed of a cold-formed steel frame. The screw connection configuration was selected to facilitate yielding {{along the length of the}} brace, i.e., to avoid net section fracture of the strap through the screw holes. Chord members were constructed of double stud members, such that inelastic deformations and ultimate failure of the walls would be limited to the braces. U profiles were placed in the tracks at corner locations to increase the hold-down capacity and rigidity. Local buckling of the lower track was observed during loading with damage being concentrated in corner areas. Plastic elongation of the strap did take place; however because of the unexpected failure of the corners, the results of the experiments may not necessarily reflect the true ductility of a braced wall if yielding (and failure) had been limited to the straps. Fülöp and Dubina suggested that the ideal configuration of the corners would be such that the uplift force is directly transmitted from the brace or corner stud to the <b>anchoring</b> <b>bolt,</b> without inducing bending in the bottom track. Failure to strengthen the corners can have a significant effect on the initial rigidity of the system and can be the cause of larger than expected in-plane shear deformations of the wall and premature failure of the braced frame.|$|E

40|$|Generally, L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> {{system has}} been used {{for a long period of}} time in {{construction}} industry as one of the distributing load structures. However, there are some weaknesses in L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> which may straighten and pullup when charged with tensile load. Current practices prefer to use other types of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> systems, such as headed studs <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system to replace the L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design. There has been lack of studies to prove that it is more effective in terms of performance. A new T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> which was basically modified from headed studs <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> was proposed in this study to compare its performance of tensile loading in concrete failure to typical L design. This study aims to determine whether the T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system gives better performance as compared to an L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system. The performance was rated based on tensile loading on concrete failure pattern. A pullout test was conducted on two different <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> systems, namely L and T. The <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> embedded depth, h in concrete were varied according to their hook or bend radius. Each sample was repeated twice. There were totally eight samples. The hook or bend radius used were 50 mm and 57. 5 mm for sample L 1 and L 2, respectively. 90 -degree bend were used on sample T 1 and T 2. Based on test results, it can be seen that the performance of concrete failure pattern under tensile load on both L and T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design samples with 200 mm embedment depth was better than deeper embedment depth of 230 mm. But the L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design gives the best results as compared to T design. Although T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design shows higher resistance before first bond failure to the concrete sample. T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> was analysed and needed deeper embedment depth to allow formation of cone pull-out shape to acquire better performance...|$|R

The specimen used for the experiment have the real-sized diameters ranging from 120 mm to 180 mm.

In contrast, the bond strength of the bolt without studs tends to decrease with the increase in its diameter. An in-situ pull-out test of the bond-type <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> confirmed that the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> has a sufficient bond strength to be used in stead of the conventional <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt.</b> Based on the loading test on a 1 / 3 scaled pier base-to-footing connection with the bond-type <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts,</b> we examined the applicability of the component method to the prediction of the moment-rotation curve.

40|$|Abstract. Rock bolting {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods of rock reinforcement. To {{optimize}} bolt parameters for reasonably playing its properties under safe support condition, it’s a must to study the mechanical characteristics of roadway and bolt. This paper shows that <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> at the top of the rise side has the maximum force, middle of the two sides minimal. Middle of two sides has the largest displacement, top and bottom smallest by using flac 3 d to simulate the force of special-shaped roadway under the support of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts,</b> combined with field observance of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> force. Therefore, by optimizing <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> supporting parameters, we can effectively control the deformation of surrounding rocks and improve the whole stability through strengthening support and changing partial <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> supporting parameters...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> embedded in unreinforced concrete, monotonically loaded in shear is described. The <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> are embedded sufficiently {{to develop the}} minimum tensile strength of the bolt steel. Pairs of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> (double-bolt anchorages) with varying spacings and edge distances are loaded in shear in the direction perpendicular {{to the line of}} the bolts. Single-bolt anchorages are also tested in shear with varying edge distances and compared with the results of the double-bolt anchorage tests. Concrete failure with wedge cone is observed in most cases. The effects of the edge distance and bolt spacing on the shear resistance of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> are discussed. The ACI Committee 349 shear resistance formula has been found to give good estimates of the singlebolt anchorage tests. However, the concept of wedge cone interaction, commonly used for calculating the tensile pull-out capacity of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> groups, is found not directly applicable to double-bolt anchorages under shear. The influence of the support conditions of the concrete test blocks on <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> shear strengths is also investigated...|$|R

30|$|Effective lateral {{resistance}} of multiple anchorbolt joints was estimated by considering sill thickness or length/diameter ratios of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts.</b> Load-slip relationships of single <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> joints {{were analyzed by}} the stepwise linear approximation based on the generalized theory of a beam on an elastic foundation and the criterion of “fracture bearing displacement” for several sill thicknesses or length/diameter ratios of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts.</b> Monte Carlo simulations of the effective {{lateral resistance}} of multiple anchor-bolt joints were conducted using the analyzed load-slip curves of single anchor-bolt joints. Effective resistance ratios of multiple anchor-bolt joints were simulated for some combinations of length/diameter ratios of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts,</b> lead-hole clearances, and number of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts.</b> The simulated results are: (1) the influence of lead-hole clearance becomes more apparent as length/diameter ratios of single anchor-bolt joints decrease; (2) there is no obvious effect of number of anchor-bolts over the range of 5 to 15; (3) average effective resistance ratios can be adopted for allowable stress design; and (4) reduction of effective resistance ratios should be considered particularly for small length/diameter ratios of anchor-bolt joints.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> is a cast-in-place anchor. As {{seen in the}} figure, most designs {{consist of}} a standard bolt with a hexagonal head, which is cast in the wet concrete before it sets.

Cast-in-place <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> are the strongest type of fastener, but the casting is difficult, and they are usually only used for heavy machines mounted on poured concrete floors. Another use of this <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> is to connect the concrete foundation of a building to its wall. With this, the building is more resistant to earthquakes.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{focuses on}} the vibration response of the wind turbine tower–foundation system to identify and describe the stress state of the system. First, the movements of an existing wind turbine tower-foundation system were measured using accelerometers {{at the top and}} middle of a 20 m tower. Elastic behaviors of the tower and <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> that transfer motion to its foundation were verified using various strain gauges. The spectrum of the strain of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> generally agreed with the acceleration spectrum. Next, three-dimensional nonlinear FE analyses were performed to identify stress states of various parts of the system. The FE model was verified through data obtained from a field-based free vibration test. Then, the model was examined with a displacing obtained by processing the field measurement data. The obtained accelerations of the tower were consistent with the measured data; however, the calculated strain of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> was larger than the measured strain. Further analysis was conducted to predict the ultimate state at failure. The deformation and stress of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> suggested that the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> are the dominant load-carrying mechanism and failure mode of the tower-foundation system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are often}} used in {{concrete}} or steel structures. Nevertheless still empirical design procedures are used {{in order to determine}} the dimensions of the structure. Non linear fracture mechanics tries to describe fracture of heterogeneous materials like concrete. In the classical representation of concrete fracturing (figure 1. 1), cohesive forces in the micro-crack-zone (ahead of the cracktip) contribute to the carrying capacity of the structure and cause softening of concrete. This concretesoftening can also be explained by discontinuous cracks that grow along aggregate particles and cause bridging of the cracks (crack-face bridging, see Van Mier (1991)). Insight in non linear fracture mechanics as well as increasing computer techniques finally gave the opportunity to investigate the behaviour of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> embedded in concrete in a proper way. The main goal of this study is to improve the knowledge about pull-out <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts.</b> Therefore several tests and numerical simulations have been performed {{in order to determine the}} maximum load, the deflection of the upper end of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> and the load-deformation curve.

40|$|The {{research}} {{objectives for}} this project were to explicitly define the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion problem {{in the state of}} Georgia and recommend action to the Georgia Department of Transportation. The bearing assembly of concern is the plate bearing assembly, in which carbon steel and/or bronze plates are anchored by either carbon steel or stainless steel <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts.</b> Inspection report data revealed that <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> corrosion was ubiquitous for all environments in Georgia; the problem was reported for 27 % of the steel girder bridges throughout the state. Based on a synthesis of the field investigations, bolt failure analyses, laboratory experimental testing, and review of GDOT inspection report surveys, the corrosion of carbon steel <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> is caused universally by concentration cell corrosion. Other corrosion mechanisms of concern are galvanic and crevice corrosion, which are both enhanced by the current bearing design. Corrosion protection provided through zinc galvanization cannot sufficiently protect the carbon steel bolt for its entire service life. Corrosion potential and cyclic polarization data confirmed that ASTM Type 304, Type 316, Type 2101, and Type 2205 were protected from concentration cell and localized corrosion in the simulated bearing environment. Therefore, it is recommended that the stainless steel <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> of these types be use in future designs and that the bolts should be electrically separated from all dissimilar metals using a Nylon or Teflon washer to prevent preferential corrosion of carbon steel. It is further recommended that the bronze lube plate should be eliminated entirely and that the bearing type should be a reinforced elastomeric bearing. Maintenance of existing sliding plate bearings should include regular cleaning by brushing away debris from the bearing surfaces, and bridges with carbon steel <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> should be retrofitted to provide additional lateral restraint according to current maintenance procedures.
