50|$|The Slick 360 was {{designed}} {{to fill a gap}} in the light aerobatic <b>aircraft</b> <b>segment,</b> as the aircraft which dominate this segment, the Yak-55, Zlin Z-50 and Extra 230 have all ceased production, making them increasingly hard to obtain. While other Extras are still in production (260, 300, 300S, 300L and 330), they are fitted with six-cylinder (260/300 hp) engines and therefore not allowed to compete in the AWAC. New aircraft have been created in an attempt to replace these three, such as the One Design and the Cap 222, but they have failed to dominate, purportedly due to their excessively-high aileron roll rates, which, being faster than their flick roll rates, results in the flick roll scores being downgraded. In addition, their small size has made them difficult to judge. The result being that neither of the two new designs has yet managed to achieve better results than the older established designs, with the past five AWAC events being won by the Extra 230, Zlin Z-50 and Yak-55. This was borne out by the winner of 2003 AWAC, who was a French pilot who chose to fly an Extra 230 {{despite the fact that he}} had access to the French team's Cap 222.|$|E

The WSC aircraft is a type of Light-Sport aircraft that has certain characteristics that distinguish it from the more vague <b>aircraft</b> industry <b>segment</b> of Light-Sport <b>aircraft.</b> The WSC aircraft consists of three major, but simple parts: the wing, the carriage, and the pilot. Everything about this aircraft is based on simple, portable, and inexpensive concepts with very little use of modern technology. This keeps the costs down and maximizes the basics of aviation, to include calling on the skills and training of the pilot. Several manufacturers produce this commercial aircraft. They are Air Creation USA, Airborne, Evolution, Concept Aviation, Manta Aircraft S. A., and Northwing Design. This project has three objectives: (1) describe the WSC aircraft and its capabilities.

40|$|Commercial {{supersonic}} travel {{has strong}} business potential; however, {{in order for}} the Federal Aviation Administration to lift its ban on supersonic flight overland, designers must reduce aircraft sonic boom strength to an acceptable level. An efficient methodology and associated tools for designing aircraft for minimized sonic booms are presented. The computer-based preliminary design tool, RapidF, based on modified linear theory, enables quick assessment of an aircraft 2 ̆ 7 s sonic boom with run times less than 30 seconds on a desktop computer. A unique feature of RapidF is that it tracks where on the <b>aircraft</b> each <b>segment</b> of the of the sonic boom came from, enabling precise modifications, speeding the design process. Sonic booms from RapidF are compared to flight test data, showing that it is capability of predicting a sonic boom duration, overpressure, and interior shock locations. After the preliminary design is complete, scaled flight tests should be conducted to validate the low boom design. When conducting such tests, it is insufficient to just scale the length; thus, equations to scale the weight and propagation distance are derived. Using RapidF, a conceptual supersonic business jet design is presented that uses F-function lobe balancing to create a frozen sonic boom using lifting surfaces.

40|$|To meet aviation’s CO 2 {{emission}} reduction targets while maintaining mobility {{in the face}} of increasing effective fuel costs, technology innovation will be required. The single aisle commercial <b>aircraft</b> market <b>segment</b> is the largest by quantity and value, but has the longest running product lines. New aircraft programs offer the largest potential gains in fuel efficiency, but are risky and require large capital investments. Re-engining existing airframes reduces risk and capital requirements, but offers lower potential fuel burn improvements. Incremental improvements to existing aircraft lines may entail the lowest risk. It is hypothesized that competition has important effects on manufacturers’ decisions to innovate and that these effects must be considered when designing policies to reduce CO 2 emissions from aviation. An aircraft program valuation model is developed to estimate expected payoffs to manufacturers under different competitive scenarios. A game theory analysis demonstrates how the incentives for manufacturers to innovate may be altered by subsidies, technology forcing regulations, increased effective fuel costs, the threat of new entrants, and long-term competitive strategies. It is shown that increased competition may result in incumbent manufacturers producing re-engined aircraft while increased effective fuel costs may result in new aircraft programs. Incumbents’ optimal strategies may be to delay the entry into service of new single aisle aircraft until 2020 - 24, unless technology forcing regulations are implemented.

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} {{was that}} the MLS signals covered a very wide fan-shaped area {{off the end of}} the runway, allowing controllers to direct aircraft approaching from a variety of directions or guide <b>aircraft</b> along a <b>segmented</b> approach. In comparison, ILS could only guide the aircraft down a single straight line, requiring controllers to distribute planes along that line. MLS allowed aircraft to approach from whatever direction they were already flying in, as opposed to flying to a parking orbit before [...] "capturing" [...] the ILS signal. This was particularly valuable at larger airports, as it could allow the aircraft to be separated horizontally much closer to the airport. Similarly in elevation, the fan shaped coverage allows for variations in descent rate, making MLS useful for aircraft with steeper approach angles such as helicopters, fighters and the space shuttle.|$|R
