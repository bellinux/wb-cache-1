40|$|Natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>honeycomb</b> lattices are {{of great}} {{interest}} because the band structure of these lattices, if properly constructed, contains a Dirac point. Such lattices occur naturally {{in the form of}} graphene and carbon nanotubes. They have been created in the lab in the form of semiconductor 2 DEGs, optical lattices, and photonic crystals. We show that, over a wide energy range, gases (of electrons, atoms, or photons) that propagate through these lattices are Lorentz gases and the corresponding classical dynamics is chaotic. Thus, honeycomb lattices are also of interest for understanding eigenstate thermalization and the conductor-insulator transition due to dynamic Anderson localization.

This evanescent propagation is well described by a tight-binding model, very much like {{the propagation of}} electrons in graphene. We measure the density of states, as well as the wave function associated to each eigenfrequency. By changing the distance between the resonators, it is possible to modulate the amplitude of next-(next) -nearest-neighbors hopping parameters and to study their effect on the density of states. The main effect is the density of states becoming dissymmetric and a shift of the energy of the Dirac points. We study the basic elements: an isolated resonator, a two-level system and a square lattice. Our observations are in good agreement with analytical solutions for corresponding infinite lattice...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} finding of {{unidirectional}} electronic properties, analogous to a semiconductor diode, in two-dimensional <b>artificial</b> permalloy <b>honeycomb</b> lattice of ultra-small bond, with a typical length of 12 nm. The unidirectional transport behavior, characterized by the asymmetric colossal enhancement in differential conductivity at a modest current application of 10 - 15 μA, persists to T = 300 K in honeycomb lattice of thickness 6 nm. The asymmetric behavior arises without the application of magnetic field. A qualitative analysis of experimental data suggests the role of magnetic charge or monopoles in the unusual observations with strong implication for spintronics.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{mechanisms}} of the magnetic reversal of permalloy artificial spin ice arrays. The main research foci include the influence of domain wall propagation on the magnetic reversal of <b>honeycomb</b> <b>artificial</b> spin ice, the low temperature behaviour of <b>honeycomb</b> <b>artificial</b> spin ice and the classification of inverse permalloy opals as three dimensional artificial spin ice. Room temperature imaging of the magnetisation configuration of the nanobars through the magnetic reversal, via scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, photoemission electron microscopy and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, showed non random domain wall propagation through the frustrated vertices of the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>artificial</b> spin ice arrays. OOMMF simulations suggest that the origin of such non-randomness lies in the domain wall chirality. Boundary conditions necessary for domain wall injection into artificial spin ice arrays were investigated. A reduction of the edge nanobars width of 2 / 3 was needed to prevent random domain wall nucleation from the array edges. Electrical transport measurements showed evidence {{of a change in}} the magnetic reversal, driven by domain wall propagation, of <b>honeycomb</b> permalloy <b>artificial</b> spin ice below 15 K. The transition temperature was found to be proportional to the square of the saturation magnetisation of the ferromagnetic material used. The change in the magnetic reversal was associated with the non-random vertex domain wall positioning below the transition temperature due to the influence of vertex dipole interactions. Room temperature Lorentz transmission electron microscopy images and temperature dependent electrical transport measurements of three dimensional permalloy inverse opals showed the potential of magnetic inverse opals to act as three dimensional artificial spin ice systems.

40|$|We {{reveal the}} {{sophisticated}} and hierarchical structure of honeybee combs {{and measure the}} elastic properties of fresh and old natural honeycombs at different scales by optical microscope, environmental scanning electron microscope, nano/microindentation, and by tension and shear tests. We demonstrate that the comb walls are continuously strengthened and stiffened without becoming fragile {{by the addition of}} thin wax layers reinforced by recycled silk cocoons reminiscent of modern fiber-reinforced composite laminates. This is done to increase its margin of safety against collapse due to a temperature increase. <b>Artificial</b> engineering <b>honeycombs</b> mimic only the macroscopic geometry of natural honeycombs, but have yet to achieve the microstructural sophistication of their natural counterparts.

40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>honeycomb</b> lattices with Dirac cone {{dispersion}} {{provide a}} macroscopic platform {{to study the}} massless Dirac quasiparticles and their novel geometric phases. In this paper, a quadruple-degenerate state is achieved {{at the center of}} Brillouin zone (BZ) in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice phononic crystal, which is a result of accidental degeneracy of two double-degenerate states. In the vicinity of the quadruple-degenerate state, the dispersion relation is linear. Such quadruple degeneracy is analyzed by rigorous representation theory of groups. Using method, a reduced Hamiltonian is obtained to describe the linear Dirac dispersion relations of such quadruple-degenerate state, which is well consistent with the simulation results. Near such accidental degeneracy, we observe some unique wave propagating properties, such as defect insensitive propagating character and Talbot effect. Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures and 1 tabl...|$|E

40|$|The {{change in}} {{electrical}} resistance {{associated with the}} application of an external magnetic field {{is known as the}} magnetoresistance (MR). The measured MR is quite complex in the class of connected networks of single-domain ferromagnetic nanowires, known as "artificial spin ice", due to the geometrically-induced collective behavior of the nanowire moments. We have conducted a thorough experimental study of the MR of a connected <b>honeycomb</b> <b>artificial</b> spin ice, and we present a simulation methodology for understanding the detailed behavior of this complex correlated magnetic system. Our results demonstrate that the behavior, even at low magnetic fields, can be well-described only by including significant contributions from the vertices at which the legs meet, opening the door to new geometrically-induced MR phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic monopoles have stimulated a {{great amount}} of {{theoretical}} and experimental interest since their prediction by Dirac in 1931. To date, their presence has evaded detection in high energy experiments despite intensive efforts. Recently, entities that mimic magnetic monopoles have been observed in bulk and planar frustrated materials known as spin-ice materials, and artificial spin-ice materials, respectively. In this paper we discuss the formation of these so-called monopole defects within a cobalt <b>honeycomb</b> <b>artificial</b> spin-ice lattice. Experimental results and micromagnetic simulations show that monopole defects of opposite sign are created at the boundaries of the lattice, and move in opposing directions. Discrepancies between simulations and experimental results demonstrate the importance of quenched disorder. Furthermore, we show that controlled edge nucleated monopole defect formation can be realized with the use of soft magnetic injection pads, which is a very promising development for technological applications based upon magnetic charge...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the low-frequency spin wave dynamics {{involved in the}} magnetization reversal of a ‎Penrose P 2 tiling using the dynamical matrix method. This system consists of a two-dimensional, ‎connected wire network of elongated thin-film segments, whose complete reversal occurs as a cascade ‎of successive local segment reversals. Using soft mode theory, we interpret the reversal of an individual ‎segment as a first order magnetic transition, in which magnetization curve of the system suffers a small ‎discontinuity. In proximity of this discontinuity a specific mode of the spin wave spectrum goes soft (i. e., ‎its frequency goes to zero), triggering a local instability. We show that this mode is localized, and is at the ‎origin of the local reversal. We discuss the correlation of the mode spatial profile with the “reversal ‎mechanism”, which is {{the passage of a}} domain wall through the segment. This process differs from ‎reversal in periodic square or <b>honeycomb</b> <b>artificial</b> spin ices, where a cascade of reversing segments (e. g., ‎‎“Dirac string”) follows an extended (though irregular) path across the sample; here the spatial distribution ‎of successive segment reversals is discontinuous, but strictly associated with the area where a soft mode ‎is localized. The migration of the localization area across the P 2 tiling (during reversal in decreasing applied ‎fields) depends on changes in the internal effective field map. We discuss these results in the context of ‎spin wave localization due to the unique, low translational symmetry of the P 2 tiling. ...|$|R
40|$|Honeycomb {{structures}} {{have already}} fascinated mankind since ancient times. They {{were observed in}} various natural occurring phenomena, from {{the structure of the}} beehive of the honeybee that granted the structure its name, to the inner structure of butterfly wings, bones, and insect eyes. The honeycomb structure found many applications in engineering and design. Halfway last century it was predicted that atomic honeycomb structures have special electronic properties. With the rise of graphene in the last decade, many of these properties have been shown, and many new questions have risen. This has also sparked an interest in <b>artificial</b> <b>honeycomb</b> structures with length scales in the nanometer regime. This thesis describes the quest to structurally resolve honeycomb systems, both on the atomic and on the nanometer scale. The first part of this thesis deals with graphene: a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms. The graphene is grown epitaxially on an iridium (111) surface by means of chemical vapor deposition. The structure of this epitaxial graphene is studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Various contrast patterns observed with AFM could be explained in terms of tip reactivity and tip-sample distance. The lattice mismatch between graphene and iridium (111) gives rise to a moiré pattern and physical buckling of the graphene. This physical buckling is quantified using LEED, and local variations therein are studied by AFM. The buckling of the graphene is then used as a model system to study the influence of non-homogeneous backgrounds on the image mechanism of AFM using CO molecule modified tips. The work on graphene is concluded with a chapter on the electronic properties of nanometer-sized graphene islands. Using STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) it was shown that the charge carriers in the graphene islands behave as relativistic particles confined in a 2 -D box. The second half of the thesis deals with honeycomb structures prepared from semiconductor nanocrystals. First, it describes a binary superlattice with a novel crystal structure, prepared by self-assembly of PbSe and CdSe nanocrystals. Strictly speaking the structure is not a honeycomb, but it consists of stacked layers of PbSe nanocrystals with a kagome structure, i. e., hexagons connected by triangles, sandwiched by layers of CdSe nanocrystals. The full crystal structure is resolved by electron tomography, showing the value of this technique for nanocrystal research. Secondly, this part of the thesis describes the formation of atomically coherent honeycomb structures formed by oriented attachment of PbSe nanocrystals. The atomic and nanoscale crystal structure is resolved by a combination of high-angular annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), electron tomography, electron diffraction (ED), STM, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). From these techniques {{it was found that the}} honeycomb structure is buckled – the two sublattices have a different height – and exhibits octahedral symmetry. Then cation exchange was used to transform the honeycomb structures into CdSe, with a zinc blende atomic lattice. Finally, the thesis is concluded with an outlook into future research directions and possible applications of the presented research...|$|E
40|$|In 1935, Pauling {{estimated}} the residual entropy of water ice with remarkable accuracy {{by considering the}} degeneracy of the ice rule solely at the vertex level. Indeed, his estimate works well for both the three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice and the two-dimensional six-vertex model, solved by Lieb in 1967. The case of <b>honeycomb</b> <b>artificial</b> spin ice is similar: its pseudo-ice rule, like the ice rule in Pauling and Lieb's systems, simply extends a degeneracy which is already present in the vertices to the global ground state. The anisotropy of the magnetic interaction limits the design of inherently degenerate vertices in artificial spin ice, and the honeycomb is the only degenerate array produced so far. In this paper we show how to engineer artificial spin ice in a virtually infinite variety of degenerate geometries built out of non-degenerate vertices. In this new class of vertex models, the residual entropy follows not from a freedom of choice at the vertex level, but from the nontrivial relative arrangement of the vertices themselves. In such arrays, loops exist along which {{not all of the}} vertices can be chosen in their lowest energy configuration: these loops are therefore vertex-frustrated since they contain unhappy vertices. Residual entropy emerges in these lattices as configurational freedom in allocating the unhappy vertices of the ground state. These new geometries will finally allow for the fabrication of many novel extensively degenerate artificial spin ice...|$|R
