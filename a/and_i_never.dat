5|$|I hemmed and hawed {{about it}} for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> liked to do what {{everybody}} else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about it and I said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|E
5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E

25|$|Tina Brown {{was born}} in Maidenhead, England, {{and she and her}} elder brother, Christopher Hambley Brown (who became a movie producer) grew up in Little Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, a Thames village in the {{countryside}} west of London. Her father, George Hambley Brown, was active in the British film industry producing the early Miss Marple films in the series starring Margaret Rutherford, based on the character created by Agatha Christie. His other films included The Chiltern Hundreds (1949); Hotel Sahara (1951), starring Yvonne De Carlo; Guns at Batasi (1964), starring Richard Attenborough and Mia Farrow. In 1939, he had an early marriage to the actress Maureen O'Hara; according to O'Hara, it was never consummated, owing to her parents' intervention, and it was annulled. George later met and married Brown's mother, Bettina Iris Mary (Kohr), who was an assistant to Laurence Olivier. Brown's mother was of part Iraqi descent; she recounted, “She was dark <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> knew why.” In her later years, Bettina wrote for an English-language magazine for expatriates in Spain where she and her husband lived in retirement until moving to New York in the early eighties to be with their daughter and grandchildren.|$|E

500|$|Drawn and Quarterly {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the maturation comic books saw in the 1990s, publishing and promoting the works of adult-oriented Canadian and international artists. The publisher avoided genres like superheroes, which publisher Chris Oliveros saw as stifling comics' growth. These comics had artistic aspirations, and graphic novels became increasingly prominent, with Brown's autobiographical [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Never</b> Liked You, and Seth's faux-autobiographical It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken garnering considerable attention.|$|E

500|$|Ford was {{the only}} person to hold the {{president}}ial office without being elected as either president or vice-president. The choice of Ford to fulfill Spiro Agnew's vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. [...] "In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> heard him utter an unkind word," [...] said Martha Griffiths.|$|E
500|$|At the University of Chicago, {{where she}} earned an M.A. in 1936, Brodie lost {{her faith in}} {{religion}} entirely. In 1975, she recalled, [...] "It was like taking a hot coat off in the summertime. The sense of liberation I had at the University of Chicago was exhilarating.

500|$|After her {{departure}} from the adult film industry and transition to mainstream films, Lords got signed for a development deal with Capitol Records, but was later dropped due to disagreements {{between her and the}} label. [...] "They wanted to market me in the way that would make the most money. They wanted to make me the new Samantha Fox. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> wanted that.

500|$|Although Alice in Chains {{has been}} labeled grunge by the {{mainstream}} media, Jerry Cantrell identifies the band as primarily heavy metal. He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "We're {{a lot of different}} things... I don't quite know what the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> want it to".

500|$|Shankly's village {{team was}} called the Glenbuck Cherrypickers, a name {{probably}} derived from the 11th Hussars (the [...] "Cherry Pickers"), but Shankly said: [...] "the club was near extinction when I had a trial <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> actually played for them".

500|$|Brown had {{switched}} publishers to the Montreal-based Drawn and Quarterly {{by the time}} he completed his first autobiographical graphic novel, The Playboy, in 1992. At first, he intended The Playboy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Never</b> Liked You to form one story, but found it too complex to handle when he started to plan it out. [...] The Playboy deals with Brown's guilt over his teenage obsession with masturbating over pornography. [...] The book gained praise from fans, critics, and other cartoonists, and won a Harvey Award. It received criticism from those who saw it as objectifying women and glorifying pornography; [...] Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner wrote to Brown voicing concern that Brown would feel such guilt in a post-sexual revolution world.|$|E
