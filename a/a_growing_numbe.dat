Cd – Classical {{transport}} Abstract. - Explicit {{determination of}} the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for trapping problem on complex media is a theoretical challenge. In this paper, we study random walks on the Apollonian network with a trap fixed at a given hub node (i. e. node with the highest degree), which are simultaneously scale-free and small-world. We obtain the precise analytic expression for the MFPT that is confirmed by direct numerical calculations. In the large system size limit, the MFPT approximately grows as a power-law function {{of the number of}} nodes, with the exponent much less than 1, which is significantly different from the scaling for some regular networks or fractals, such as regular lattices, Sierpinski fractals, T-graph, and complete graphs. The Apollonian network is the most efficient configuration for transport by diffusion among all previously studied structure. Introduction. – Trapping is an integral major theme of random walks (diffusion) [1 – 3], which is relevant {{to a wide range of}} applications and has led to <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>numbe...</b>|$|E
40|$|No {{longer is}} the {{question}} whether autonomic computing will gain general acceptance but when. Experts like Alva Couch expect autonomic computing to be widely used within 10 years [1]. When it does become mainstream, how will autonomics change system administration and corporations, and will the change be for better or worse? The answer depends on how well we anticipate the limitations of what autonomic systems are suited to do, whether we can collectively address the vulnerabilities of autonomic approaches as we draw upon the advantages, and whether administrators, companies, partners, and users are prepared for the transition. This article presents some design considerations to address the first two issues and some suggested survival techniques for the third. I. What is Driving Autonomic Computing? Computing systems used to have reasonably well-defined borders, both geographically and logically. Today, corporate, educational, and even government computer-based systems coexist in an open mesh of overlapping infrastructures. The complexity of these networks and of the systems that comprise them {{have given rise to}} the need for more automation in their configuration and management.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to governance, the best policy {{practices}} may depend on a country’s stage of development. Appropriate labor market policies, for example, can depend on whether a workforce is low-skill, transitional, or high-skill and highly productive. The best family planning policies may depend on a country’s place in the demographic transition—from high birth and death rates to a transitional phase where death rates are falling ahead of birthrates to a final stage where birth and death rates are both low. Appropriate public education investments may depend on whether a nation’s population is largely urban and literate or still significantly rural and nonliterate. The same conditions apply for the governance of agriculture, nutrition, and health. Here the best approach may largely depend on a country’s stage in the dietary transition—from a diet low in both calories and micronutrients (accompanied by pervasive undernutrition) to a transitional diet that provides adequate basic energy for most but an inadequate balance of nutrients to an affluent diet that provides excessive calorie energy, accompanied by health problems linked to obesity. In Africa, many states have yet to leave {{the first stage of}} this transition, so chronic undernutrition remains pervasive. Most middle-income developing countries are moving through the second stage in this transition and are experiencing rapid dietary diversification. <b>A</b> <b>growing</b> <b>numbe...</b>|$|E

In {{the process of}} constructing many displays of abstract corporate data, we have distilled {{some aspects of the}} successful displays into a set of guidelines for creating perceptually effective visualizations. By describing our guidelines, illustrating their usage with several novel examples, and discussing our software infrastructure, we hope to further the progress of visualization from a craft into a production technology. 1 Introduction Visualization is a powerful link between the two most powerful information processing systems [...] the human mind and the modern computer. It is a key technology for extracting information, and therefore it {{is becoming more and more}} necessary in our increasingly information-rich society. Visualization techniques can enable us to navigate and explore the fast <b>growing</b> <b>numbe</b> [...] ...|$|R
