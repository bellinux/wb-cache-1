5|$|The {{existence}} of Soma Bringer was first hinted at when Nintendo filed a trademark {{for the title}} alongside others. It was officially announced in October that year at a Nintendo press conference. Published by Nintendo, Soma Bringer was the first Monolith Soft title to be released after its acquisition by Nintendo in April 2007. It was released on February 22, 2008. After positive impressions from previews during public gaming events in Japan, both IGN and 1UP.com voiced <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the game would receive a localization. Speaking in 2010, Saga said {{that she did not}} know whether it would be released outside Japan, or whether further games set in the Soma Bringer universe would be developed.|$|E
5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> all of the family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving {{on the surface of}} water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} {{was reported in}} September in Courrier de l'Égypte, the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the stone might one day {{be the key to}} deciphering hieroglyphs. In 1800, three of the Commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies of the texts on the stone. One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian Demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.|$|E

With the help of the statuette, the sorcerer brings Ramudu to his lair and tortures him in front of Indu with <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> she would succumb to his proposal to marry him. Posing as an assistant, Ramudu shaves the sorcerer's beard, making him lose his powers. Afterwards, Ramudu finds the statuette and wishes to bring the palace back to Ujjain. In a fight between Ramudu and the sorcerer mid-way in the sky, the latter dies when Ramudu throws him out. The palace is back in Ujjain and Surasena apologises to both Ramudu and Indu before uniting them. While Anji marries Indu's best friend, the film ends with the marriage of Ramudu and Indu with the elders' blessing.|$|E

25|$|The Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 {{followed}} by the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943 left islanders with <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the occupation would not last for ever. The funeral for HMS Charybdis and HMS Limbourne sailors in Guernsey in October 1943 gave an unexpected opportunity to show solidarity and defiance, 5,000 people, laying 900 wreathes, turned up for the funeral, boosting island morale and worried the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Early road {{construction}} was both hindered and helped by rail transport {{during the first}} half century of European settlement.

However, where railways were constructed, roads often either preceded them for construction or quickly followed it when the newly accessible land started to be settled more closely.|$|E

25|$|In {{the high}} Renaissance, in fact, there was <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> more direct {{knowledge}} of the wisdom of antiquity, including {{the writings of the}} Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish Kabbalah, would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement. With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought. One humanist, the Greek Orthodox Platonist Gemistus Pletho (1355–1452), based in Mystras, Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan polytheism.|$|E
25|$|In 1796 Napoléon Bonaparte {{invaded the}} Italian Peninsula, {{defeated}} the papal troops and occupied Ancona and Loreto.

Pius sued for peace, which was granted at Tolentino on February 19, 1797. The Treaty of Tolentino transferred Romagna to Bonaparte's newly formed Cispadane Republic (founded in December 1796 out of a merger of Reggio, Modena, Bologna and Ferrara) in <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the French would not further pursue the Papal lands. Several reforms {{were made in the}} French-controlled regions, where much property of the Church was confiscated.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} {{followed}} {{up by the}} EU Commission and the Danish authorities. Eventually the European Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, approved a dawn raid on SAS and Maersk, which took place on 15 June 2000. Maersk Air chose {{to cooperate with the}} Commission and surrendered a series of private papers not found in the raid, in <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> this would lower a potential fine. These summarized the negotiations and documented how the airlines had discussed abolishing all competing services. The commission issued a statement of objections in January 2001. It concluded among other things that SAS would make an additional €20-million profit per year if Maersk pulled out of the Copenhagen–Stockholm route.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September, {{forces of}} the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, expecting little {{resistance}}, landed against heavy German resistance at Salerno in Operation Avalanche; in addition, British forces landed at Taranto in Operation Slapstick, which was almost unopposed. There had been <b>a</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that,</b> with the surrender of the Italian government, the Germans would withdraw to the north, since at the time Adolf Hitler had been persuaded that Southern Italy was strategically unimportant. However, this was not to be; although, for a while, the Eighth Army {{was able to make}} relatively easy progress up the eastern coast, capturing the port of Bari and the important airfields around Foggia. Despite none of the northern reserves having been made available to the German 10th Army, it nevertheless came close to repelling the Salerno landing, due mainly to the cautious command of Clark. The main Allied effort in the west initially centred on the port of Naples: that city was selected because it was the northmost port that could receive air cover by fighter planes flying from Sicily.|$|E
