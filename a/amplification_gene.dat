30|$|In summary, local {{sequence}} {{comparisons of}} closely related grass genomes and of intraspecific haplotypes {{have begun to}} reveal the major mechanisms driving genome evolution. These include gene and genome duplication, gene silencing and eventual deletion of duplicated genes subsequent to polyploidization, transposable element <b>amplification,</b> <b>gene</b> movement mediated by transposition of mobile elements, unequal homologous recombination, and illegitimate recombination. All of these processes are quite variable even when comparing closely related species, so their differences in levels of activity (and, possibly, specificity) {{are responsible for the}} very different genomes found in flowering plants.|$|E
30|$|It {{is known}} that dysregulation of many RTKs, {{including}} c-MET, contributes to tumorigenesis [20]. Indeed, c-MET is activated {{in a variety of}} cancers, such as renal, ovarian, and lung. [8, 21]. Aberrant activation of c-MET results in proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis [19, 22, 23]. Conversely, downregulation of MET expression in tumor cells can lower their tumorigenic potential [24]. Studies indicated that c-MET in cancer is activated through both ligand-dependent autocrine or paracrine mechanisms and ligand-independent mechanisms including gene <b>amplification,</b> <b>gene</b> translocation, activating mutations, or transcriptional upregulation of the c-MET protein [25, 26]. Furthermore, in some studies, a synergistic effect for phosphorylation between c-MET and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER 2, HER 3, RAS, RON, or PDGFR was found in some cancer cells or transfected cancer cells, and these studies might have important significance for combination therapy in many cancers [27 – 32].|$|E
40|$|Deregulation of {{cell cycle}} {{control is a}} {{hallmark}} of cancer. The primary cyclins (A, B 1, D 1, D 3 and E) are crucial for cell cycle progression. Secondary cyclins (C and H) have putative indirect effects on cell cycle propulsion and are not previously evaluated in breast cancer. We have examined protein expression and <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> of cyclins in breast carcinomas and correlated the findings with clinical follow-up data. We have previously demonstrated that over-expression of cyclin A is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. In this study we wanted to evaluate the mechanisms behinde overexpression of cyclin A, {{as well as the}} impact of other cyclins, both at the gene level and at the protein level, on prognosis of breast cancer patients. The impact of TP 53 gene mutations on <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> of cyclins was also evaluated. Methods: Real-Time Quantitative PCR was used to detect <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> of cyclins in tumour tissue from 86 patients operated for invasive breast carcinomas, while immunohistochemistry was applied to detect protein expression of the same cyclins. Result: Of the 80 -breast tumour samples available for cyclin A <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> analyses, 26. 7 % (23 / 80) was defined to have cyclin A <b>gene</b> <b>amplification.</b> 37. 2 % (32 / 79) had cyclin B 1 <b>gene</b> <b>amplification,</b> 82. 6 % (71 / 82) of the samples harboured amplification of cyclin C gene, 74. 4 % (64 / 82) had cyclin D 1 <b>gene</b> <b>amplification,</b> 41. 9 % (36 / 86) had cyclin D 3 <b>gene</b> <b>amplification,</b> 29. 1 % (25 / 81) of the patients had cyclin E <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> and 9. 3 % (8 / 86) of the samples showed amplification of the cyclin H gene. When correlation between <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> and protein expression was evaluated, we observed a statistical significant correlation between <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> and protein expression of cyclin A (p = 0. 009) and cyclin D 3 (p < 0. 001). However, the correlation between <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> and protein expression of cyclin A, as well as the prognostic value of cyclin A overexpression, was affected by <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> of cyclin E. <b>Gene</b> <b>amplification</b> of none of the other cyclins was associated with patient prognosis. There was a statistical significant correlation between TP 53 gene mutations and <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> of cyclins A, D 3 and B 1. No correlation was observed between <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> of secondary cyclins (H and C) and TP 53 gene mutations. Conclusions: The overexpression of cyclin A is correlated to <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> of both cyclin A and cyclin E. Over-expression of cyclin A is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. When analysed in a multivariate analyses model, <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> as well as protein expression of none of the other cyclins than cyclin A are associated with patient prognosis in breast carcinomas.

40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the importance of}} epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein overexpression and <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> in carcinogenesis of glottic cancer. Method In order to evaluate EGFR expression at protein and gene level, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed on tissue microarrays of laryngeal tissue (145 samples) – 38 samples of normal mucosa, 46 samples of hyperplastic lesions, and 61 samples of cancerous lesions. Results Membranous (mEGFR) and cytoplasmic (cEGFR) EGFR expression was significantly different between the analyzed groups. The differences were most striking in the suprabasal-transforming zone. IHC evaluation showed that high and low mEGFR staining contributed to the differentiation of dysplastic lesions, simple hyperplasia, and cancerous tissue, {{as well as between}} different degrees of atypia in hyperplastic lesions (P < 0. 050). EGFR <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> was not found in simple and abnormal hyperplastic lesions, but it was confirmed in 2 / 21 atypical hyperplasias, indicating that <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> can facilitate identification of malignant potential in hyperplastic lesions. In cancerous tissue, EGFR <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> was found in 8 / 50 samples. EGFR <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> was found in preinvasive cancer in one patient. In invasive carcinomas, <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> was not associated with stage or grade.

40|$|Gene I {{of peanut}} {{chlorotic}} streak virus (PCISV), a caulimovirus, is homologous to gene I of other caulimoviruses and may encode a protein for virus movement. To evaluate {{the function of}} gene I, several mutations were created in this gene of an infectious, partially redundant clone of PCISV. Constructs with an in-frame deletion and a single amino acid substitution in gene I were not infectious. To test for replication of these mutants in primarily infected cells, an immunosorbent PCR technique was devised. Virus particles formed by mutants in plants were recovered by binding to antivirus antibodies on a solid matrix and DNase treated to discriminate against residual inoculum, and DNA of trapped virions was subjected to PCR <b>amplification.</b> <b>Gene</b> I mutants were shown to direct formation of encapsidated DNA as revealed by a PCR product. Control gene V mutants (reverse transcriptase essential for replication) did not yield a PCR product.

High concentrations of biogenic methane were observed in the Upper and Middle Ordovician formations. Total porosity values for the shale, shale hard bed and limestone samples were 7. 4 %, 2. 5 % and 1. 9 %, respectively. Hydrocarbon presence ranged from petroliferous shale, to bituminous layering in shale hard beds, to hydrocarbon odour in limestone. Organic carbon content ranged from 0. 5 to 2. 5 %, highest amount being present in the shale. Environmental DNA was extracted from core samples and PCR amplified using 16 S rDNA bacterial primers. PCR performed with archaeal 16 S rDNA and methanogen-specific (mcrA) primers did not yield DNA <b>amplification.</b> <b>Gene</b> analysis indicated that bacterial sequences similar to Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were present.

In the present study, we have evaluated {{the frequency of the}} CDK 4 <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> in sporadic breast cancer by applying a nonradioactive quantitative differential polymerase chain reaction based on fluorescent DNA technology. Fluorescent-labeled polymerase chain reaction products were analyzed with an automated DNA sequencer. Amplification of CDK 4 gene was detected in 15 (15. 8 %) of 95 breast cancers.

40|$|Although {{comparative}} {{genetic mapping}} studies show extensive genome conservation among grasses, recent data provide many exceptions to gene collinearity at the DNA sequence level. Rice, sorghum, and maize {{are closely related}} grass species, once sharing a common ancestor. Because they diverged at different times during evolution, they provide an excellent model to investigate sequence divergence. We isolated, sequenced, and compared orthologous regions from two rice subspecies, sorghum, and maize to investigate {{the nature of their}} sequence differences. This study represents the most extensive sequence comparison among grasses, including the largest contiguous genomic sequences from sorghum (425 kb) and maize (435 kb) to date. Our results reveal a mosaic organization of the orthologous regions, with conserved sequences interspersed with nonconserved sequences. Gene <b>amplification,</b> <b>gene</b> movement, and retrotransposition account {{for the majority of the}} nonconserved sequences. Our analysis also shows that gene amplification is frequently linked with gene movement. Analyzing an additional 2. 9 Mb of genomic sequence from rice not only corroborates our observations, but also suggests that a significant portion of grass genomes may consist of paralogous sequences derived from gene amplification. We propose that sequence divergence started from hotspots along chromosomes and expanded by accumulating small-scale genomic changes during evolution...|$|E
40|$|The Additional sex combs like 1 (Asxl 1) gene is 1 of 3 {{mammalian}} homologs of the Additional sex combs (Asx) gene of Drosophila. Asx {{is unusual}} {{because it is}} required to maintain both activation and silencing of Hox genes in flies and mice. Asxl proteins are characterized by an amino terminal homology domain, by interaction domains for nuclear receptors, and by a C-terminal plant homeodomain protein-protein interaction domain. A recent study of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) revealed {{a high incidence of}} truncation mutations that would delete the PHD domain of ASXL 1. Here, we show that Asxl 1 is expressed in all hematopoietic cell fractions analyzed. Asxl 1 knockout mice exhibit defects in frequency of differentiation of lymphoid and myeloid progenitors, but not in multipotent progenitors. We do not detect effects on hematopoietic stem cells, or in peripheral blood. Notably, we do not detect severe myelodysplastic phenotypes or leukemia in this loss-of-function model. We conclude that Asxl 1 is needed for normal hematopoiesis. The mild phenotypes observed may be because other Asxl genes have redundant function with Asxl 1, or alternatively, MDS or oncogenic phenotypes may result from gain-of-function Asxl mutations caused by genomic <b>amplification,</b> <b>gene</b> fusion, or truncation of Asxl 1...|$|E
40|$|Resistance to {{organophosphate}} (OP) insecticide in {{the mosquito}} Culex pipiens {{has been studied}} for ca. 30 years. This example of micro-evolution has been thoroughly investigated {{as an opportunity to}} assess precisely both the new adapted phenotypes and the associated genetic changes. A notable feature is that OP resistance is achieved with few genes, and these genes have generally large effects. The molecular events generating such resistance genes are complex (e. g., gene <b>amplification,</b> <b>gene</b> regulation) potentially explaining their low frequency of de novo occurrence. In contrast, migration is a frequent event, including passive transportation between distant populations. This generates a complex interaction between mutations and migration, and promotes competition among resistance alleles. When the precise physiological action of each gene product is rather well known, it is possible to understand the dominance level or the type of epistasis observed. It is however difficult to predict a priori how resistance genes will interact, and {{it is too early to}} state whether or not this will be ever possible. These resistance genes are costly, and the cost is variable among them. It is usually believed that the initial fitness cost would gradually decrease due to subsequent mutations with a modifier effect. In the present example, a particular modifier occurred (a gene duplication) at one resistance locus, whereas at the other one reduction of cost is driven by allele replacement and apparently not by selection of modifiers...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. According to {{clinical}} and epidemiological studies, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women. The causes {{of ovarian cancer}} remain largely unknown but various factors may {{increase the risk of}} developing it, such as age, family history of cancer, childbearing status etc. This cancer results from a succession of genetic alterations involving oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, which have a critical role in normal cell growth regulation. Mutations and/or overexpression of three oncogenes, c-erbB- 2, c-Myc and K-ras, and of the tumour suppressor gene p 53, have been frequently observed in a sporadic ovarian cancer. Objective. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze c-Myc and c-erbB- 2 oncogene alterations, specifically amplification, as one of main mechanisms of their activation in ovarian cancers and to establish a possible association with the pathogenic process. Methods. DNA was isolated from 15 samples of malignant and 5 benign ovarian tumours, using proteinase K digestion, followed by phenol-chloroform isoamyl extraction and ethanol precipitation. C-Myc and c-erbB- 2 amplification were detected by differential PCR. The level of gene copy increase was measured using the Scion image software. Results. The amplification of both c-Myc and c-erbB- 2 was detected in 26. 7 % of ovarian epithelial carcinoma specimens. Only one tumour specimen concomitantly showed increased gene copy number for both studied genes. Interestingly, besides <b>amplification,</b> <b>gene</b> deletion was also detected (26. 7 % for c-erbB- 2). Most of the ovarian carcinomas with alterations in c-Myc and c-erbB- 2 belonged to advanced FIGO stages. Conclusion. The amplification of c-Myc and c-erbB- 2 oncogenes in ovarian epithelial carcinomas is most probably a late event in the pathogenesis conferring these tumours a more aggressive biological behaviour. Similarly, gene deletions point to genomic instability in epithelial carcinomas in higher clinical stages as the result of clonal evolution and selection...|$|E
40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) {{remains the}} most {{aggressive}} and lethal brain tumor due to its molecular heterogeneity and high motility and invasion capabilities of its cells, resulting in high resistance to current standard treatments (surgery, followed by ionizing radiation combined with Temozolomide chemotherapy administration). Locus <b>amplification,</b> <b>gene</b> overexpression, and genetic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are hallmarks of GBM that can ectopically activate downstream signaling oncogenic cascades such as PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Importantly, alteration of this pathway, involved also in the regulation of autophagy process, can improve radioresistance in GBM cells, thus promoting the aggressive phenotype of this tumor. In this work, the endogenous EGFR expression profile and autophagy were modulated to increase radiosensitivity behavior of human T 98 G and U 373 MG GBM cells. Our results primarily indicated that EGFR interfering induced radiosensitivity according to a decrease of the clonogenic capability of the investigated cells, and an effective reduction of the in vitro migratory features. Moreover, EGFR interfering resulted in an increase of Temozolomide (TMZ) cytotoxicity in T 98 G TMZ-resistant cells. In order to elucidate {{the involvement of the}} autophagy process as pro-death or pro-survival role in cells subjected to EGFR interfering, the key autophagic gene ATG 7 was silenced, thereby producing a transient block of the autophagy process. This autophagy inhibition rescued clonogenic capability of irradiated and EGFR-silenced T 98 G cells, suggesting a pro-death autophagy contribution. To further confirm the functional interplay between EGFR and autophagy pathways, Rapamycin-mediated autophagy induction during EGFR modulation promoted further impairment of irradiated cells, in terms of clonogenic and migration capabilities. Taken together, these results might suggest a novel combined EGFR-autophagy modulation strategy, to overcome intrinsic GBM radioresistance, thus improving the efficacy of standard treatments. J.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Discrepant {{data have}} been {{published}} on the incidence and prognostic significance of ESR 1 gene amplification in early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor blocks were collected from women with early breast cancer participating in two HeCOG adjuvant trials. Messenger RNA was studied by quantitative PCR, ER protein expression was centrally assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ESR 1 gene copy number by dual fluorescent in situ hybridization probes. RESULTS: In a total of 1010 women with resected node-positive early breast adenocarcinoma, the tumoral ESR 1 /CEP 6 gene ratio was suggestive of deletion in 159 (15. 7 %), gene gain in 551 (54. 6 %) and amplification in 42 cases (4. 2 %), with only 30 tumors (3 %) harboring five or more ESR 1 copies. Gene copy number ratio showed a significant, though weak correlation to mRNA and protein expression (Spearman's Rho < 0. 23, p =  0. 01). ESR 1 clusters were observed in 9. 5 % (57 gain, 38 amplification) of cases. In contrast to mRNA and protein expression, which were favorable prognosticators, gene copy number changes did not obtain prognostic significance. When ESR 1 /CEP 6 gene ratio was combined with function (as defined by ER protein and mRNA expression) in a molecular classifier, the Gene Functional profile, it was functional status that impacted on prognosis. In univariate analysis, patients with functional tumors (positive ER protein expression and gene ratio normal or gain/amplification) fared better than those with non-functional tumors with ESR 1 gain (HR for relapse or death 0. 49 - 0. 64, p =  0. 003).

40|$|Purpose: The proteinases that cells {{employ to}} {{regulate}} the matrix include members of the zinc metalloproteinases; expression is likely to influence both the normal and injured human lens, which in tum can affect a number of biological functions e. g. migration. The current study therefore aimed to determine expression profiles in distinct regions ofthe human lens and following mechanical injury. Methods: For specific gene expression analyses the native human lens was dissected into three regions, using sham cataract surgical methods. Primary lens epithelial cell culture provided cells for analysis as a wounded lens system. Native lens capsular bags (CB) were cultured to assess short term wounding responses and ex vivo CBs (obtained with implanted intraocular lenses from cataract surgery sometime prior to death), were analysed to study the long term wounding responses. Total RNA extraction and reverse transcription technologies were developed for real time polymerase chain reaction <b>amplification</b> <b>gene</b> expression analysis. Protein expression was investigated using Western blotting techniques. Results: In the native lens, the overall MMP gene expression was low, while TIMP expression was high. Of the MMP family members, MTI-MMP was the most highly expressed in the epithelium, while MT 2 -MMP was the most abundant gene in the fibre cells. Moreover, the presence of unprocessed and activated MTI and MT 2 -MMP were confirmed by Western blotting. Selected adamalysin genes (ADAM- 9, - 10, - 15 and - 17) were highly expressed by all native lens regions. In the wounded lens and ex vivo samples transdifferentiation marker expression; alpha smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, {{was consistent with the}} different stages following cataract surgery. Significant elevation of specific gene expression was observed follo~ving injury, such as MMP- 2, MMP- 9, ADAM- 9, ADAM-IS and ADAMTS- 3. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that regional distribution of MMPs, TIMPs, ADAMs and ADAMTSs occurs within the human lens. In the native lens expression of matrix degrading proteinases is generally low, while inhibitor expression is high. Following surgical injury, a significant increase in levels of specific genes, such as MMP- 2 is observed; these particular genes are therefore likely to play key roles in the wound healing process after cataract surgery and are thus logical subjects for further investigation.

Many multiplex PCR assays have been reported for serotyping Salmonella based on O and H antigens. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply and improve the approach in differentiation and serotyping Salmonella enterica strains by combination of sequential multiplex PCRs targeting the O, H and Vi antigens of Salmonella, and this achieved by working on 126 strains. All the strains were purified on BSA and produced black colonies of Salmonella. The strains were confirmed by PCR <b>amplification</b> <b>gene</b> that targets the hilA. 122 of 126 strains produced the expected band size of 789 bp. A multiplex PCR (MPCR) for serogrouping targets O and Vi antigens was applied on the 122 strains: 28. 7 % (C 2, n= 35), 27. 1 % (B, n= 33), 22. 9 % (D, n= 29), 17. 2 % (E, n= 21), 1. 64 % (C 1, n= 2), and 1. 64 % (A, n= 2). Eight of the Salmonella strains from group D have the Vi antigen. A multiplex PCR for serotyping targets H 1 antigens was applied on the tested strains, and were Ha, Hb, and Hd antigens detected in 19 of 122 strains. S. Paratyphi A and S. Typhi correctly are identified by MPCR for H 1 antigens. The percentage of the strains were produced flagella antigens (H 1; a, b, and d) was 18. 1 % while the percentage of non-expressed strains was 81. 9 %. Therefore, due to the limited information provided by H 1 MPCR assay, additional primers for flagella antigens (both H 1 and H 2) were used. The optimization was carried out on the new primers by adjusting the concentration of buffer, time and denaturation and annealing temperature. The optimized PCR for H serotyping detected the expected amplicons of H 1 and H 2 antigens and further confirmation was done by DNA sequencing. The overall of multiplex PCRs of O and H results correctly serotyped 94 of 122 strains (77 %). The most frequent serovars encountered were S. Weltevrerden, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, S. Hadar and S. Typhi. Application of DNA based serogrouping and serotyping found to be robust, quick methods for differentiation of common Salmonella enterica...|$|E
40|$|Neuroblastoma {{is a very}} {{heterogeneous}} tumor, with {{a clinical}} course ranging from spontaneous regression to aggressive tumor growth. A proper stratification of the patients into different risk groups is therefore important {{in order to provide}} the most suitable treatment for each patient. The primary aim of this thesis was therefore to further characterize the genes and mechanisms important for neuroblastoma development using genome wide copy number data from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -arrays {{as a starting point for}} more detailed studies of interesting regions of the genome. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the clinical usefulness of SNP-arrays, both directly as a prognostic tool, and indirectly as a starting point for the generation of patient-specific assays. As to the genes and mechanisms important for neuroblastoma development, we have identified a chromosomal instability phenotype in the 11 q deleted subgroup, possibly caused by the DNA repair gene H 2 AFX located in the commonly deleted region. Furthermore, we have identified and characterized a small subgroup of neuroblastoma with amplification of two regions on 12 q, occasionally accompanied by 11 q <b>amplification.</b> <b>Gene</b> expression analysis and siRNA knockdown of the genes included in these amplicons indicate that CDK 4 and CCND 1 are possible drivers of this subgroup and we therefore suggest that this group of neuroblastoma is characterized by a cell cycle de regulation phenotype. Regarding the clinical usefulness, our results show that SNP-arrays are powerful tools for the stratification of neuroblastoma patients into different treatment groups. Not only is it possible to detect known prognostic markers such as MYCN amplification and 11 q deletion, but the genome-wide copy number profile in itself is also important, especially for the identification of patients with a favorable prognosis. Moreover, we show that the array-data can be used for detailed mapping of the rearrangement boundaries, which in combination with a multiplex PCR reaction makes it possible to detect tumor-specific fragments that span the junction of the rearranged DNA. These junction PCR assays were also tested for the detection of minimal residual disease, and were found to be sensitive enough to detect very small amounts of tumor DNA in the blood or bone marrow from patients during treatment or follow-up. To conclude, genome-wide techniques, such as SNP-arrays are useful not only for research purposes but also as a clinical tool. These arrays give valuable information for the risk group stratification of neuroblastoma patients, and provide a robust foundation for the development of a personalized treatment strategy for patients with neuroblastoma...|$|E

40|$|Homologous genetic {{recombination}} {{is a central}} feature of meiosis in most sexually dividing organism. It leads {{to the establishment of}} new linkage relationships between genes and is crucial for the successful completion of meiosis. It is also necessary for a variety of important cellular events like immunoglobulin rearrangement, repair of chromosome damage, gene <b>amplification,</b> <b>gene</b> expression and sister chromatid exchange. Knowledge of the mechanisms of homologous recombination has come from extensive genetic studies on fungi. These studies have led to the formulation of various models which explain the genetic observations. Analysis of the fate of transfected DNA molecules into cells have revealed the existence of additional recombinational pathways in eukaryotes. The biochemistry of homologous recombination has mainly focused on the isolation and characterisation of the recombinase activity from various systems. The E. cold RecA protein remains the best characterised recombinase or pairing protein till date and its reactions in vitro, in particular the strand-transfer reaction, have laid the framework for isolating such proteins from eukaryotic systems. However, limited success has been achieved in the purification and characterisation of pairing activities from mammalian cells. The objective {{of the present study was}} to isolate and characterise a pairing activity from, a meiotic tissue of a mammalian system - the rat testis. Meiosis constitutes one of the important phases of the process of spermatogenesis. In rat, the various stages of spermatogenesis (the meiotic stages and spermiogenesis) can be broadly demarcated by the age of the rat. The pachytene stage of meiosis in rat is spread over nine days. Rat testicular nuclear extracts from animals, aged 38 - 42 days (the stages of spermiogenesis were absent and a significant proportion of the cells were in the pachytene stage during this period), were fractionated sequentially on phosphocellulose, heparin-agarose and ssDNA-cellulose columns. Fractions were tested for the ssDNA-dependent formation of slow-moving products on an agarose gel, using the strand-transfer away with M 13 mp 19 RF III and ssDNA substrates. A partially purified fraction, which catalysed the formation of such products, was obtained from the ssDNA-cellulose column on eluting with 0. 6 M KCI. In order to characterise the products formed by this partially purified fraction, they were analysed by electron microscopy. The majority of the observed structures represented multimers of the linear substrate. A significant proportion of the products resembled forked (Y-branched) structures and paired (duplex-duplex paired and 6 s-duplex paired) structures. Length measurement of the multimers indicated the presence of a ligase activity in the partially purified fraction. The arms of the Y-branched structures were equal in length. The length of the molecule from the end of the stem to the end of either of the arms was the same as that of a monomer. The Y-branched structures were duplex in nature along their entire length. Exonucleases were not detected in the fraction; hence, these structures might actually represent paired structures. Typical r- and &-structures were not observed. The EM studies indicated that the slow-moving products, observed on the gel, might be ligated structures. The mobility of these products were found to be similar to those formed by a standard ligase - the T 4 DNA ligase. Restriction digestion of the junctions of the ligated products revealed that the ends were intact and there was no nucleotide loss, as seen in the case of ligases involved in nonhomologous recombination. In order to characterise the type of ligase present, radiolabelled a-ATP was used to form the ligase-AMP adduct which was then separated by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography revealed the presence of a major 100 kDa polypeptide (most probably DNA ligase I or 111), with a minor 65 kDa polypeptide (most probably DNA ligase 11). The latter, in turn, was found to be enriched in the ssDNA-cellulose fraction eluting with 0. 8 M KC 1. The formation of the ligated products was strictly dependent on the presence of ssDNA. Other characteristics of the ligase activity included the substitution of ATP by UTP. The ligase present in the 0. 8 M fraction was found to be inhibited by ssDNA. Experiments to test the heat - stability of the products revealed the presence of a ssDNA-aggregating activity in the partially purified fraction. This aggregation was found to be specific for linear ssDNA. In the strand-transfer assay, the first step involves the transfer of the ssDNA circle on the linear duplex substrate accompanied by the partial displacement of the non-complementary strand of the duplex. It was reasoned that the linear end generated (partially-displaced strand) would be aggregated by the linear ssDNA-aggregating activity, thereby preventing the progression of the reaction and accounting for the absence of V - and a-structures under the EM. The formation of such aggregates was therefore monitored on the gel, using radiolabelled linear dsDNA. The formation of theme aggregates was found to be dependent on ssDNA and homology. ATP was essential for the reaction, though ATP hydrolysis was not necessary, since ATPW could substitute for ATP in the reaction. This suggested the presence of a pairing activity in the partially purified fraction. The aggregating activity was found to be enriched in the 0. 5 M KCl-fraction from the ssDNA-cellulose column. The molecular weight of the enriched polypeptide was found to be similar to that of histone Hl. Western blot analysis of the polypeptide with monospecific antibodies against histone Hl a and a comparison of the protein fingerprinting pattern of the polypeptide with that of histone Hla revealed the identity of the polypeptide to be histone Hla. Formation of stable protein-free aggregates of linear ssDNA was found to be a common property of histone H 1 subtypes. This aggregation of linear ssDNA (non-complementary) did' not require ATP or Mg 2 +. Purified hietone H 1 subtypes, however, could not cause homology-dependent aggregation of the linear duplex substrate. This study thus indicates the presence of a pairing activity and a ligase activity in a partially purified fraction from rat testicular nuclear extracts. Unlike other eukaryotic pairing activities characterised so far, this preparation is free from exonucleases. The homology-dependent duplex DNA aggregates, observed in this study, may therefore represent intermediates actually generated by the pairing activity...|$|E
