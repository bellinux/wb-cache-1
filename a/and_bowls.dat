The smaller, adjoining, Manor Gardens combines both lawns and shady areas {{as well as a}} rose garden. Until 2005, Manor Gardens was the home of the Towner Gallery.

5|$|The hoard was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles <b>and</b> <b>bowls</b> were stacked inside each other, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount of disturbance was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the container, {{and the existence of}} the container itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{arts and}} crafts are {{produced}} throughout the country, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration. Woven baskets <b>and</b> <b>bowls</b> are especially common. Imigongo, a unique cow dung art, is produced in the southeast of Rwanda, with a history dating back to when the region {{was part of the}} independent Gisaka kingdom. The dung is mixed with natural soils of various colours and painted into patterned ridges to form geometric shapes. Other crafts include pottery and wood carving. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials; circular or rectangular mud homes with grass-thatched roofs (known as nyakatsi) are the most common. The government has initiated a programme to replace these with more modern materials such as corrugated iron.|$|E

As well as serving as a social club, it {{expanded}} to include other sports including hockey, tennis, <b>and</b> <b>bowls.</b> The club has been located on Moorside Road since 1870. Urmston Riding Club was established in 1956 on Southgate on the Urmston–Flixton border, and has approximately 150 members. AFC Urmston provides football coaching facilities, and has teams ranging from under 7s to under 17s. The club {{was founded in}} 1977, as Meadowside Athletic FC, and has won the Manchester County FA Youth Cup.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the destruction of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously with the arrival of so-called Naranjo style ceramics, which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. The Naranjo ceramic tradition is particularly characteristic of the western Pacific coast of Guatemala between the Suchiate and Nahualate rivers. The most common forms are pitchers <b>and</b> <b>bowls</b> with a surface that has been smoothed with a cloth, leaving parallel marks, and usually coated with a white or yellow wash. At the same time, the use of local Ocosito ceramics waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments {{in the second half of}} the Early Classic. The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style ceramics was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.|$|E
5|$|The pottery {{as well as}} iron {{mining and}} {{processing}} industries kept developing in Poland throughout the Roman periods, until terminated in the 5th century or so by the Great Migration. Clay pots were still often formed manually and these were more crude, while the better ones were made with the potter's wheel, used {{beginning in the early}} 3rd century. Some had inscriptions engraved, but their meaning, if any, is not known (Germanic people had occasionally used the runic alphabets). Wide-open, vase type Przeworsk culture urn from the 2nd century AD found in Biała, Zgierz County is covered with representations from Celtic and Germanic mythology, such as deer, horse riders, crosses and swastikas. The 3rd and 4th century buckets were made of wood and reinforced with bronze braces and sheets. Przeworsk culture's large globular clay storage containers from the 3rd and 4th century were 60cm to over one meter tall. The 4th and 5th century ceramic specimens from the late phase of this culture include pitchers, clay pails, beakers <b>and</b> <b>bowls.</b>|$|E

5|$|Technological {{advances}} proceeded in a {{range of}} areas. Watermills to grind grain had existed during most of the Anglo-Saxon period, using horizontal mill designs; from the 12th century on many more were built, eliminating the use of hand mills, with the older horizontal mills gradually supplanted by a new vertical mill design. Windmills began to be built in the late 12th century and slowly became more common. Water-powered fulling mills and powered hammers first appeared in the 12th century; water power was harnessed to assist in smelting by the 14th century, with the first blast furnace opening in 1496. New mining methods were developed and horse-powered pumps were installed in English mines {{by the end of the}} Middle Ages. The introduction of hopped beer transformed the brewing industry in the 14th century, and new techniques were invented to better preserve fish. Glazed pottery became widespread in the 12th and 13th centuries, with stoneware pots largely replacing wooden plates <b>and</b> <b>bowls</b> by the 15th century. William Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde began using the printing press during the late 15th century. Transport links were also improved; many road bridges were either erected or rebuilt in stone during the long economic boom of the 12th and 13th centuries. England's maritime trade benefited from the introduction of cog ships, and many docks were improved and fitted with cranes for the first time.|$|E
