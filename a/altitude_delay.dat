30|$|During the June–August 2015 Mt Raung eruption, alert {{levels were}} issued by local {{authorities}} (Fig.  4 f), {{and changes in}} these levels appeared to lag behind actual changes in activity, such as the start of lava effusion. One {{of the reasons for}} this lag was the difficulty associated with making continuous observations of the caldera floor, which is located at a high <b>altitude.</b> <b>Delays</b> in issuing changes in the alert level may result in disasters for hikers or people residing {{in the vicinity of the}} volcano. If we can quickly access information about the state of activity obtained from high-frequency observations using the Himawari- 8 AHI, we might be able to minimalize these delays and issue alert levels with appropriate timing. Currently, in our prototype system, we can check the images of targeted volcanoes within 2  h after scanning of the full disk has been done by Himawari- 8.|$|R
40|$|Algorithms for {{generating}} minimum fuel or minimum cost vertical profiles are derived and examined. The option for fixing {{the time of}} flight {{is included in the}} concepts developed. These algorithms form the basis for the design of an advanced on-board flight management system. The variations in the optimum vertical profiles (resulting from these concepts) due to variations in wind, takeoff mass, and range-to-destination are presented. Fuel savings due to optimum climb, free cruise <b>altitude,</b> and absorbing <b>delays</b> enroute are examined...|$|R

In ISS planning, NASA examined options including returning the station to Earth via shuttle missions (deemed too expensive, as the USOS is not designed for disassembly and this would require at least 27 shuttle missions), natural orbital decay with random reentry similar to Skylab, boosting the station to a higher <b>altitude</b> (which would <b>delay</b> reentry) and a controlled targeted de-orbit to a remote ocean area.|$|R
5|$|The {{flowers of}} the Tasmanian waratah provide ample nectar and hence are a food source for bird {{visitors}} to the garden. The species can be propagated by seed, though seedlings may succumb to damping off. Growing in a natural shady location delays flowering by two to four weeks, while growing in a cooler conditions (due either to latitude or <b>altitude)</b> can <b>delay</b> flowering by up to six weeks. Pruning flower heads can promote subsequent growth of leaves and branches. It grows best in a cool climate with ample water and good drainage, and has done well in cultivation in England. The Royal Horticultural Society gave it an Award of Merit in 1934 and a First Class Certificate in 1938. The relationship between light duration and intensity, temperature, vegetative growth and flower production is poorly known. Yellow forms in cultivation were originally propagated from a plant found on Mount Wellington.|$|R
40|$|For decades, deep cumulus {{convection}} {{was viewed}} as consisting partly of undilute plumes that do not interact with their surrounding environment in order to explain their observed tendency to reach or penetrate the tropical tropopause. This behavior was built into all cumulus parameterizations used in terrestrial global climate and numerical weather prediction models, and it still persists in some models today. In the past decade, though, some embarrassing failures of global models have come to light, notably their tendency to rain over land near noon rather than in late afternoon or evening as observed, and the absence in the models of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), {{the major source of}} intraseasonal (30 - 90 day) precipitation variability in the Indian Ocean, West Pacific, and surrounding continental regions. In the past decade it has become clear that an important missing component of parameterizations is strong turbulent entrainment of drier environmental air into cumulus updrafts, which reduces the buoyancy of the updrafts and thus limits their vertical development. Tropospheric humidity thus serves as a throttle on convective penetration to high <b>altitudes</b> and <b>delays</b> the convective response to large-scale destabilizing influences in the environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{regional}} {{climate model}} {{coupled with a}} dust module was used to simulate dust aerosol distribution {{and its effects on}} the atmospheric heat source over the TP, East Asian summer monsoon onset, and precipitation in East Asia modulated by the uplift of the northern TP. We carried out four experiments, including a modern (i. e., high-mountain) experiment with (HMD) and without (HM) the major deserts in Northwest China and a low-mountain experiment with (LMD) and without (LM) the deserts. The results show that dust greatly increases in the Taklamakan Desert accompanied with the uplift of the northern TP, and the increase exceeds 150  µg kg− 1 in spring. A strong cyclone in the Tarim Basin produced by the uplifted northern TP enhances dust emissions in the Taklamakan Desert in summer. Meanwhile, the dust loading over the TP also increases induced by the uplift of the northern TP, causing the heat source over the TP decreased. Under the condition of the northern TP uplift to present <b>altitude,</b> dust <b>delays</b> the East Asia summer monsoon onset by two pentads and one pentad, respectively, in the southern and northern monsoon regions and greatly suppresses precipitation in East Asia compared with results in the low terrain experiments...|$|R
40|$|Metering and spacing (M & S) system's {{algorithms}} described assume {{an aircraft}} two dimensional are navigation capability. The three navigation systems compared were: {{very high frequency}} omnidirectional range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) and ILS, VOR/DME and + or - 40 MLS, and VOR/DME and + or - 60 MLS. Other factors studied were M & S tentative schedule point location, route geometry effects, and approach gate location effects. Summarized results are: the MLS offers some improvement over VOR/DME and ILS if all approach routes contain computer assisted turns; pilot reaction to moving the gate closer to the runway threshold may adversely affect M & S performance; and coupling en route metering to terminal scheduling transfers most of the terminal holding to more full efficient, higher <b>altitude</b> en route <b>delay...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aspects of tile {{breeding}} {{biology of}} the Common Frog, Rana temporaria temporaria L., were studied {{in relation to}} altitude. Work centred on 55 breeding ponds in northern England, ranging in altitude from 86 to 838 m. A chemical temperature integration technique {{was used to measure}} pond and soil temperatures at a series of sites. The temperature fell by approximately 0. 4 C for every l 00 m increase in altitude. Between 1974 and 1977 spawning was always later at higher <b>altitudes.</b> By <b>delaying</b> spawning, highland embryos were less likely to encounter lethally low temperatures. Highland female frogs were about five per cent smaller in snout-vent length than lowland females and produced 707 eggs on average, less than half the mean number of 1, 586 eggs produced by lowland frogs. These differences were thought to be due to the short growing season and possibly to the lack of food at higher altitudes. At 6 C the eggs from highland females developed four per cent faster than those from lowland females. Highland eggs had a lower lethal limit for normal development of 2. 8 C; one Celsius degree below the limit for lowland eggs. The mucopolysaccharide capsules covering the eggs of Common Frogs act as insulators, keeping the embryos warmer on average than the surrounding water. This is thought to be of importance as Common Frogs breed early in the year when pond temperatures are often close to the lower lethal limit. The volume of the capsules and their insulating efficiency varied in different pond waters. The concentration of the ions in the pond water used as the culture medium was found to be the major factor influencing capsular swelling, but the valency of the ions, the temperature and pH of the water were also important. These findings were discussed in terms of their adaptive significance...|$|R
40|$|Speed {{reduction}} {{strategies have}} proved to be useful to recover delay if air traffic flow management regulations are cancelled before initially planned. Considering that for short- haul flights the climb and descent phases usually account for a considerable percentage of the total trip distance, this paper extends previous works on speed reduction in cruise to the whole flight. A trajectory optimization software is used to compute the maximum airborne delay (or linear holding) that can be performed without extra fuel consumption if compared with the nominal flight. Three cases are studied: speed reduction only in cruise; speed reduction in the whole flight, but keeping the nominal cruise altitude; and speed reduction for the whole flight while also optimizing the cruise <b>altitude</b> to maximize <b>delay.</b> Three representative flights have been simulated, showing that the airborne delay increases significantly in the two last cases with nearly 3 -fold time for short-haul flights and 2 -fold for mid- hauls with the first case. Results also show that fuel and time are traded along different phases of flight in such a way the airborne delay is maximized while the total fuel burn is kept constant.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the human growth curve is characterized primarily by an attenuation of childhood, followed by a relatively brief, intense adolescent spurt. The primary selective pressure underlying this evolutionary trend is not certain; however, the extended period of biological immaturity relative to other mammalian species is associated with high environmental sensitivity and growth plasticity. The sensitivity of human growth to the environment is demonstrated both by the processes of stunting and wasting in response to poor nutrition and of compensatory growth during environmental improvements following episodes of stress. There are many common environmental influences on growth of children and adolescents. Known environmental factors that influence growth, body size, and body composition of children post-natally include nutrition, infection, psychosocial stress, food contaminants, pollution, and hypoxia. Most of these factors are conditioned historically, culturally, and politically by poverty and socio-economic status. Adolescent growth is sensitive to nutritional deficit and surfeit, although the impacts of infection are of much lesser importance, because the immune system has matured and adaptive immunity is largely in place by adolescence. The two exceptions are HIV- 1 and Heliobacter pylori infections. Exposure of adolescents to environmental pollutants also influences pubertal development in differing ways, while many high <b>altitude</b> populations experience <b>delayed</b> sexual maturation. In the latter case, the importance of hypoxia to delayed skeletal and sexual maturation is low relative to nutritional stress. Known impacts of psychological stress on pubertal growth include advanced pubertal growth and earlier age at menarche. © Smith-Gordon: London, UK, 2009.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} a mixed integer 0 - 1 {{programming}} approach to time-based metering in air traffic management. In time-based metering we assign scheduled arrival times to aircraft at predefined points in the airspace, meter fixes and runway. The problem is one of assigning scheduled times of arrival to the aircraft at above points such that minimum separation between the aircraft are followed, no overtake is issued if the aircraft belong to same stream (set of aircraft which a controller separate from each other), time window restrictions are followed, and aircraft do not exceed allowable maximum delay times (AMDT) in a sector. Under above constraints, we minimize the total delays of aircraft at the runway. The problem is solved optimally using Gams/Cplex software. ^ We also present a mixed-integer 0 - 1 programming formulations of an existing sequencing technique called constrained position shifting. Other techniques such as FCFS sequencing are also discussed. Computational results of proposed approach and the existing sequencing techniques are compared {{for a number of}} test problems involving up to 35 aircraft. ^ The computational results demonstrate that the proposed approach prevent overtaking in the same stream. The other three approaches may result in infeasible solutions (i. e., via allowing overtake) upstream of terminal area. In the proposed approach excess delays are absorbed at higher <b>altitude</b> and the <b>delay</b> get reduced as we go upstream whereas the excess delays in other approaches are not only absorbed at lower altitude but also has higher values. ^ The proposed optimization model {{can be used as a}} benchmark to compare the quality of solutions obtained from different real-time air traffic planning tools such as Multi-center Traffic Management Advisory (McTMA). The quality of solution would be assessed in terms of how close the solutions provided by such software tools are to the optimal solution. ...|$|R
40|$|The data {{needed for}} air traffic flow {{management}} decision support tools {{is provided by}} the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS). This includes both the tools that are in current use and the ones being developed for future deployment. Since the quality of decision support provided by all these tools will be influenced by the quality of the input ETMS data, an assessment of ETMS data quality is needed. Motivated by this desire, ETMS data quality is examined in this paper in terms of the unavailability of flight plans, deviation from the filed flight plans, departure <b>delays,</b> <b>altitude</b> errors and track data drops. Although many of these data quality issues are not new, little is known about their extent. A goal {{of this paper is to}} document the magnitude of data quality issues supported by numerical analysis of ETMS data. Guided by this goal, ETMS data for a 24 -hour period were processed to determine the number of aircraft with missing flight plan messages at any given instant of time. Results are presented for aircraft above 18, 000 feet altitude and also at all altitudes. Since deviation from filed flight plan is also a major cause of trajectory-modeling errors, statistics of deviations are presented. Errors in proposed departure times and ETMS-generated vertical profiles are also shown. A method for conditioning the vertical profiles for improving demand prediction accuracy is described. Graphs of actual sector counts obtained using these vertical profiles are compared with those obtained using the Host data for sectors in the Fort Worth Center to demonstrate the benefit of preprocessing. Finally, results are presented to quantify the extent of data drops. A method for propagating track positions during ETMS data drops is also described...|$|R
