40|$|Along {{with the}} current trend of {{wireless}} technology innovation, wideband, compact size, low-profile, lightweight and multiple functional antenna and array designs are becoming more attractive in many applications. Conventional wireless systems utilise omni-directional or sectored antenna systems. The disadvantage of such antenna systems is that the electromagnetic energy, required by a particular user located in a certain direction, is radiated unnecessarily in every direction within the entire cell, hence causing interference to other users in the system. In order to limit this source of interference and direct the energy to the desired user, smart antenna systems have been investigated and developed. This thesis presents the design, simulation, fabrication and full implementation of a novel smart antenna system for future mobile applications. The design and characterisation of a novel antenna structure and four-element liner array geometry for smart antenna systems are proposed {{in the first stage}} of this study. Firstly, a miniaturised microstrip-fed planar monopole antenna with Archimedean spiral slots to cover WiFi/Bluetooth and LTE mobile applications has been demonstrated. The fundamental structure of the proposed antenna element is a circular patch, which operates in high frequency range, for the purpose of miniaturising the circuit dimension. In order to achieve a multi-band performance, Archimedean spiral slots, acting as resonance paths, have been etched on the circular patch antenna. Different shapes of Archimedean spiral slots have been investigated and compared. The miniaturised and optimised antenna achieves a bandwidth of 2. 2 GHz to 2. 9 GHz covering WiFi/Bluetooth (2. 45 GHz) and LTE (2. 6 GHz) mobile standards. Then a four-element linear antenna array geometry utilising the planar monopole elements with Archimedean spiral slots has been described. All the relevant parameters have been studied and evaluated. Different phase shifts are excited for the array elements, and the main beam scanning range has been simulated and analysed. The second stage of the study presents several feeding network structures, which control the amplitude and phase excitations of the smart antenna elements. Research begins with the basic Wilkinson power divider configuration. Then this thesis presents a compact feeding network for circular antenna array, reconfigurable feeding networks for tuning the operating frequency and polarisations, a feeding network on high resistivity silicon (HRS), and an ultrawide-band (UWB) feeding network covering from 0. 5 GHz to 10 GHz. The UWB feeding network is used to establish the smart antenna array system. Different topologies of phase shifters are discussed in the third stage, including ferrite phase shifters and planar phase shifters using switched delay line and loaded transmission line technologies. Diodes, FETs, MMIC and MEMS are integrated into different configurations. Based on the comparison, a low loss and high accurate Hittite MMIC <b>analogue</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> has been selected and fully evaluated for this implementation. For the purpose of impedance matching and field matching, compact and ultra wideband CPW-to-Microstrip transitions are utilised between the phase shifters, feeding network and antenna elements. Finally, the fully integrated smart antenna array achieves a 10 dB reflection coefficient from 2. 25 GHz to 2. 8 GHz, which covers WiFi/Bluetooth (2. 45 GHz) and LTE (2. 6 GHz) mobile applications. By appropriately controlling the voltage on the phase shifters, the main beam of the antenna array is steered ± 50 ° and ± 52 °, for 2. 45 GHz and 2. 6 GHz, respectively. Furthermore, the smart antenna array demonstrates a gain of 8. 5 dBi with 40 ° 3 dB bandwidth in broadside direction, and has more than 10 dB side lobe level suppression across the scan. The final stage of the study investigates hardware and software automatic control systems for the smart antenna array. Two microcontrollers PIC 18 F 4550 and LPC 1768 are utilised to build the control PCBs. Using the graphical user interfaces provided in this thesis, it is able to configure the beam steering of the smart antenna array, which allows the user to analyse and optimise the signal strength of the received WiFi signals around the mobile device. The design strategies proposed in this thesis contribute to the realisation of adaptable and autonomous smart phone systems...|$|E

40|$|A new active LO <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> was {{introduced}} and implemented in a 2 x 2 wide band MIMO receiver. The chip was designed with STMicroelectronics 90 nm technology. The main {{advantages of the}} proposed <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> over previous works included a wide band range, high resolution and small area. The <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> {{is based on the}} dependency of the inverter propagation delay on the load capacitance. Simply, by changing the load capacitance of an inverter, a different propagation delay is generated. A number of these controllable delay cells are cascaded to provide the required phase-shift. In order for the delay cells to reduce the required amount of phase-shifting the I&Q swap circuit is introduced. The I&Q swap circuitry reduces the phase-shifting by one fourth of the original range. The wide band <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is suitable for multi-standard radios, since just one <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is needed to support all standards. This capability of the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> could potentially reduce the size of the die and simplify the design. The measurement shows that the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is able to provide 360 ˚ of phase-shifting at the output base band signal when the LO is varying from 1. 5 GHz to 6 GHz. A wider range of the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is achievable by reducing the capacitance load and increasing the number of cascaded delay cells. The proposed <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is capable of achieving a very high resolution. The resolution of the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> {{is a function of the}} inverter current capability and the load capacitance. The measurements show the average resolution of the proposed <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is about 1. 32 ps. Passive components usually take up a large area on the chip. A MOS capacitor is used as the load to reduce the area of the proposed <b>phase</b> <b>shifter.</b> A method is proposed to improve the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> stability over the temperature and process variations. This method is based on the fact that the propagation delay of an inverter is inversely proportional to the power supply. Therefore, the phase shifters’ power supply must be varied to maintain a relatively constant <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> resolution over the temperature and process variations...|$|R

Ku-band <b>phase</b> <b>shifter.</b> The K-band <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> exhibits 6. 5 - 13 degrees of RMS phase error at 15 - 26 GHz. The average insertion loss is from - 4. 6 to - 3 dB at 15 - 26 GHz. The input P- 1 dB of the K-band <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> is - 0. 8 +/- 1. 1 dBm at 24 GHz. For both <b>phase</b> <b>shifters,</b> the core size excluding all the pads and the output 50 Omega matching circuits, inserted for measurement purpose only, is very small, 0. 33 x 0. 43 mm(2). The total current consumption is 5. 8 mA in the X- and Ku-band <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> and 7. 8 mA in the K-band <b>phase</b> <b>shifter,</b> from a 1. 5 V supply voltage...|$|R
50|$|Most antenna <b>phase</b> <b>shifters</b> {{operating}} at PRF above 1 kHz introduce spurious phase shift unless special provisions are made, such as reducing <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> settling {{time to a}} few dozen nanoseconds.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> {{based on a}} silicon slot waveguide infiltrated with liquid crystal. We achieve a phase shift of 73 pi for a 5 V drive voltage, with a voltage-length product of 0. 022 V. mm around 1 V. We can drive the <b>phase</b> <b>shifter</b> directly with a 1 V, duobinary pulse-width-modulated signal, allowing direct digital CMOS control of an analog optical <b>phase</b> <b>shifter...</b>|$|R
