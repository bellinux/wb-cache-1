5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia {{in which}} each swimming style {{is associated with a}} vivid experience of a color.

50|$|Swim diapers can be {{reusable}} and disposable. They are {{not intended}} to be absorbent. Typically, it is assumed that <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> diaper should be absorbent, or contain urine, like a regular diaper. However, the purpose of <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> diaper is only to contain solid waste; the lack of absorbency prevents the swim diaper from swelling up with water.|$|R

40|$|Closely {{related species}} can exhibit {{different}} behaviours despite homologous neural substrates. The nudibranch molluscs Tritonia diomedea and Melibe leonina swim differently, yet their nervous systems contain homologous serotonergic neurons. In Tritonia, the dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) {{are members of}} the swim central pattern generator (CPG) and their neurotransmitter serotonin is both necessary and sufficient to elicit <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> motor pattern. Here it is shown that the DSI homologues in Melibe, the cerebral serotonergic posterior-A neurons (CeSP-As), are extrinsic to the swim CPG, and that neither the CeSP-As nor their neurotransmitter serotonin is necessary for swim motor pattern initiation, which occurred when the CeSP-As were inactive. Furthermore, the serotonin antagonist methysergide blocked the effects of both the serotonin and CeSP-As but did not prevent the production of <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> motor pattern. However, the CeSP-As and serotonin could influence the Melibe swim circuit; depolarization of a cerebral serotonergic posterior-A was sufficient to initiate <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> motor pattern and hyperpolarization of a CeSP-A temporarily halted <b>an</b> ongoing <b>swim</b> motor pattern. Serotonin itself was sufficient to initiate <b>a</b> <b>swim</b> motor pattern or make <b>an</b> ongoing <b>swim</b> motor pattern more regular. Thus, evolution of species-specific behaviour involved alterations in the functions of identified homologous neurons and their neurotransmitter...|$|R

5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. <b>A</b> <b>swimming</b> pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
