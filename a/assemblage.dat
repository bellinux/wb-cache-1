5|$|M. nigrocincta {{was first}} {{identified}} by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858, after syntype workers were collected and described {{in his work}} Catalogue of hymenopterous insects {{in the collection of}} the British Museum part VI. In a study on phylogenetic relationships among species group of the genus Myrmecia, four species with an occipital carina including M. nigrocincta were found to form a paraphyletic and basal <b>assemblage,</b> while other Myrmecia species lacking an occiptal carina were shown to have a supported monophyletic <b>assemblage.</b> The type specimen is located in the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific <b>assemblage</b> of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This <b>assemblage</b> is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life <b>assemblage</b> of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E

5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide <b>assemblage.</b> However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated <b>assemblage</b> at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone {{that prevented}} preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B. Misra's discovery of fossiliferous ash-beds at the Mistaken Point <b>assemblage</b> in Newfoundland changed all {{this as the}} delicate detail preserved by the fine ash allowed the description of features that were previously undiscernible.|$|E
5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks {{are part of the}} Franciscan <b>Assemblage,</b> uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as greenstone. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of the}} creek, schist and other metamorphic rocks {{can be found}}, while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan <b>Assemblage</b> are located on the east bank.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} details the Hulk <b>Assemblages</b> Project, undertaken by Museum of London Archaeology, with {{input from the}} Thames Discovery Programme and the Nautical Archaeology Society. The aim {{of the project was}} to create a method for quantifying known hulk <b>assemblages</b> in England, and to create a nationwide database of hulk <b>assemblages,</b> {{that could be used to}} identify thematic, geographic and temporal gaps in the known data. A comprehensive survey of hulks or hulk <b>assemblages</b> in England has not previously been conducted. This project brings together data from multiple sources, including Historic Environment Records, the National Record of the Historic Environment, Rapid Coastal Zone Assessments, the National Historic Ships Register, and that held by specialist societies and research groups. A total of 199 hulk <b>assemblages</b> have been identified, ranging in size from two to more than 80 vessels; nine <b>assemblages</b> contained more than 20 vessels. <b>Assemblages</b> are most likely to be found in estuaries, creeks and harbours, however their distribution around England is biased by past recording, especially systematic recording done by local maritime and nautical archaeology societies and university departments. The study has revealed much variation in how hulks are recorded in Historic Environment Records, and in how they are described. Obvious geographic gaps in the distribution of <b>assemblages</b> are apparent. Densities of <b>assemblages</b> often coincide with areas where local specialist societies are active. These asset densities and gaps provided the basis for a number of general research priorities, such as known <b>assemblages</b> that have not been subject to detailed survey, and areas that would benefit from field survey to discover new <b>assemblages...</b>|$|R
5|$|Ediacaran-type fossils are {{recognised}} globally in 25 localities and {{a variety}} of depositional conditions, and are commonly grouped into three main types, known as assemblages and named after typical localities.

40|$|Larval fish <b>assemblages</b> were sampled using {{replicated}} oblique bongo net tows along a five-station transect {{extending from}} inshore (18 m depth) to offshore waters (1000 m depth) off temperate south-western Australia. A total of 148 taxa from 93 teleost families were identified. Larvae of Gobiidae and Blenniidae were abundant inshore, while larvae of pelagic and reef-dwelling families, such as Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Carangidae and Labridae were common in continental shelf waters. Larvae of oceanic families, particularly Myctophidae, Phosichthyidae and Gonostomatidae, dominated offshore <b>assemblages.</b> Multivariate statistical analyses revealed larval fish <b>assemblages</b> {{to have a}} strong temporal and spatial structure. <b>Assemblages</b> were distinct among seasons, and among inshore, continental shelf and offshore sampling stations. Inshore larval fish <b>assemblages</b> were the most seasonal, in terms of species composition and abundance, with offshore <b>assemblages</b> the least seasonal. However, larval fish <b>assemblages</b> were most closely correlated to water mass, with species distributions reflecting both cross-shelf and along-shore oceanographic processes and events. Similarity profile (SIMPROF) analysis suggested the presence of twelve distinct larval fish <b>assemblages,</b> largely delineated by water depth and season. The strength and position of the warm, southward flowing Leeuwin Current, and of the cool, seasonal, northward flowing Capes Current, were shown to drive much of the variability in the marine environment, and thus larval fish <b>assemblages...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the Clactonian <b>assemblages</b> of Middle Pleistocene souther Britain. By exploring other non-biface <b>assemblages</b> (NBAs) reported from elsewhere in Europe it seeks to illuminate our understanding of the British <b>assemblages</b> by viewing them in a wider context. It sets out how the historical and geopolitical context of Palaeolithic research has influenced what is investigated and how, as well as interpretations of <b>assemblages</b> without handaxes. A comparative study of the <b>assemblages</b> themselves based upon primary data gathered specifically for that purpose concludes that while {{there are a number of}} non-biface <b>assemblages</b> elsewhere in Europe the Clactonian <b>assemblages</b> do appear to be a phenomenon unique to the Thames Valley in early MIS 11. However, traditional explanations for this phenomenon, such as cultural variation, cultural migration and pioneer populations are challenged and a new interpretation centred on the concept of a default flaking pattern is proposed.

40|$|This study reexamines {{the current}} {{understanding}} of Pleistocene stone-artifact <b>assemblages</b> in island Southeast Asia. A differentiation {{has long been}} made between <b>assemblages</b> of large-sized 2 ̆ 2 core tools 2 ̆ 2 and <b>assemblages</b> of small-sized 2 ̆ 2 flake tools. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Core tool 2 ̆ 2 <b>assemblages</b> are often argued to be the handiwork of early hominin species such as Homo erectus, while small-sized 2 ̆ 2 flake tool 2 ̆ 2 <b>assemblages</b> {{have been attributed to}} Homo sapiens. We argue that this traditional Southeast Asian perspective on stone tools assumes that the artifacts recovered from a site reflect a complete technological sequence. Our analyses of Pleistocene-age artifact <b>assemblages</b> from Flores, Indonesia, demonstrate that large pebble-based cores and small flake-based cores are aspects of one reduction sequence. We propose that the Flores pattern applies across island Southeast Asia: large-sized 2 ̆ 2 core tool 2 ̆ 2 <b>assemblages</b> are in fact a missing element of the small-sized flake-based reduction sequences found in many Pleistocene caves and rock-shelters. We conclude by discussing the implications of this for associating stone-artifact <b>assemblages</b> with hominin species in island Southeast Asia...|$|R

40|$|The stratigraphic and biogeographic {{distribution}} {{of more than}} 170 species of deep-water agglutinated benthic foraminifers (DWAF) from the North Atlantic and adjacent marginal seas has been compared with paleoenvironmental data (e. g. paleobathymetry, oxygenation of the bottom waters, amount of terrigenous input and substrate disturbance). Six general types of <b>assemblages,</b> in which deep water agglutinated taxa occur, are defined from the Turonian to Maastrichtian times: 1. High latitude slope <b>assemblages</b> 2. Low to mid latitude slope <b>assemblages</b> 3. Flysch-type <b>assemblages</b> 4. Deep water limestone <b>assemblages</b> (,,Scaglia,,-type) 5. Abyssal mixed calcareous-agglutinated <b>assemblages</b> 6. Abyssal purely agglutinated <b>assemblages</b> Latitudinal differences in faunal composition are observed, {{the most important of}} which is the lack or extreme paucity of calcareous forms in high latitude <b>assemblages.</b> East-to-west differences appear to be of comparatively minor importance. Most DWAF species occur in all studied regions and are thus considered as cosmopolitan. Biostratigraphic turnovers in the taxonomic content of <b>assemblages</b> are observed in the lowermost Turonian, mid-Campanian and in the upper Maastrichtian to lowermost Paleocene. These datum levels correspond to inter-regional and time-constant paleooceanographic events, which probably also affected the deep-water benthic biota. This allows us to use deep-water agglutinated foraminifers for biostratigraphy in the North Atlantic sequences deposited below CCD and to geographically extend the currently used zonal schemes which have been established in the Carpathian and Alpine areas...|$|R
40|$|Opaline phytoliths are {{important}} microfossils used for paleoecological and archaeological reconstructions that are primarily based on relative ratios of specific morphotypes. Recent {{studies have shown}} that phytolith <b>assemblages</b> are prone to post-depositional alteration involving partial dissolution, however, the manner in which partial dissolution affects morphotype composition is poorly understood. Here we show that morphotype <b>assemblages</b> from four different plant species subjected to controlled partial dissolution are significantly different from the original <b>assemblages,</b> indicating that the stability of various morphotypes differs, mainly depending on their surface area to bulk ratios. This underlying mechanism produces distorted morphotype compositions in partially dissolved phytolith <b>assemblages,</b> bearing vast implications for morphotype-based paleoecological and archaeological interpretation. Together with analyses of phytolith <b>assemblages</b> from a variety of archaeological sites, our results establish criteria by which well-preserved phytolith <b>assemblages</b> can be selected for accurate paleoecological and archaeological reconstructions...|$|R

40|$|We {{collected}} modern foraminiferal {{samples to}} characterize the foraminiferal environments and investigate the role that temporal and spatial variability may play in controlling the nature and significance of foraminiferal <b>assemblages</b> of the mangroves of Kaledupa, Wakatobi Marine National Park, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The study of foraminiferal live and dead <b>assemblages</b> indicates that dead <b>assemblages</b> are least prone to vary in time and space, and furthermore, they accurately represent the subsurface <b>assemblages</b> that {{are the focus of}} paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Further analyses of the dead <b>assemblages</b> indicate a vertical zonation of foraminifera within the intertidal zone. Zone D-Ia is dominated by agglutinated foraminifera Arenoparrella mexicana, Miliammina fusca, M. obliqua and Trochammina inflata. Zone D-Ib has mixed agglutinated/calcareous <b>assemblages</b> with species such as T. inflata and Ammonia tepida. Zone D-II is dominated by numerous calcareous species including A. tepida, Discorbinella bertheloti, Elphidium advenum and Quinqueloculina spp. Zone D-Ia is found to be the most accurate sea-level indicator and its <b>assemblages</b> are omnipresent world-wide.
