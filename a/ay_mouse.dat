40|$|Agouti lethal yellow (<b>Ay)</b> <b>mice</b> express agouti ectopically {{because of}} a genetic {{rearrangement}} at the agouti locus. The agouti peptide is a potent antagonist of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC 4 R) expressed in neurons, and this leads to hyperphagia, hypoactivity, and increased fat mass. The MC 4 R signals through Gs and is thought to stimulate the production of cAMP and activation of downstream cAMP effector molecules such as PKA. Disruption of the RIIβ regulatory subunit gene of PKA results in release of the active catalytic subunit {{and an increase in}} basal PKA activity in cells where RIIβ is highly expressed. Because RIIβ is expressed in neurons including those in the hypothalamic nuclei where MC 4 R is prominent we tested the possibility that the RIIβ knockout might rescue the body weight phenotypes of the <b>Ay</b> <b>mice.</b> Disruption of the RIIβ PKA regulatory subunit gene in mice leads to a 50 % reduction in white adipose tissue and resistance to diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia. The RIIβ mutation rescued the elevated body weight, hyperphagia, and obesity of <b>Ay</b> <b>mice.</b> Partial rescue of the Ay phenotypes was even observed on an RIIβ heterozygote background. These results suggest that the RIIβ gene mutation alters adiposity and locomotor activity by modifying PKA signaling pathways downstream of the agouti antagonism of MC 4 R in the hypothalamus...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: CXCL 14 is a {{chemoattractant}} for macrophages and immature dendritic cells. We {{recently reported}} that CXCL 14 -deficient (CXCL 14 (-/-)) female mice in the mixed background are protected from obesity-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The decreased macrophage infiltration into visceral adipose tissues {{and the increased}} insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle contributed to these phenotypes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we performed a comprehensive study for the body weight control of CXCL 14 (-/-) mice in the C 57 BL/ 6 background. We show that {{both male and female}} CXCL 14 (-/-) mice have a 7 - 11 % lower body weight compared to CXCL 14 (+/-) and CXCL 14 (+/+) mice in adulthood. This is mainly caused by decreased food intake, and not by increased energy expenditure or locomotor activity. Reduced body weight resulting from the CXCL 14 deficiency was more pronounced in double mutant CXCL 14 (-/-) ob/ob and CXCL 14 (-/-) <b>A(y)</b> <b>mice.</b> In the case of CXCL 14 (-/-) <b>A(y)</b> <b>mice,</b> oxygen consumption was increased compared to CXCL 14 (+/-) <b>A(y)</b> <b>mice,</b> in addition to the reduced food intake. In CXCL 14 (-/-) mice, fasting-induced up-regulation of Npy and Agrp mRNAs in the hypothalamus was blunted. As intracerebroventricular injection of recombinant CXCL 14 did not change the food intake of CXCL 14 (-/-) mice, CXCL 14 could indirectly regulate appetite. Intriguingly, the food intake of CXCL 14 (-/-) mice was significantly repressed when mice were transferred to a novel environment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated that CXCL 14 is involved in the body weight control leading to the fully obese phenotype in leptin-deficient or <b>A(y)</b> mutant <b>mice.</b> In addition, we obtained evidence indicating that CXCL 14 may {{play an important role in}} central nervous system regulation of feeding behavior...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{data have}} {{identified}} leptin as an afferent signal in a negative-feedback loop regulating {{the mass of}} the adipose tissue. High leptin levels are observed in obese humans and rodents, suggesting that, in some cases, obesity is the result of leptin insensitivity. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the response to peripherally and centrally administered leptin among lean and three obese strains of mice: diet-induced obese AKR/J, New Zealand Obese (NZO), and Ay. Subcutaneous leptin infusion to lean mice resulted in a dose-dependent loss of body weight at physiologic plasma levels. Chronic infusions of leptin intracerebroventricularly (i. c. v.) at doses of 3 ng/hr or greater resulted in complete depletion of visible adipose tissue, which was maintained throughout 30 days of continuous i. c. v. infusion. Direct measurement of energy balance indicated that leptin treatment did not increase total energy expenditure but prevented the decrease that follows reduced food intake. Diet-induced obese mice lost weight in response to peripheral leptin but were less sensitive than lean mice. NZO mice were unresponsive to peripheral leptin but were responsive to i. c. v. leptin. <b>Ay</b> <b>mice</b> did not respond to subcutaneous leptin and were 1 / 100 as sensitive to i. c. v. leptin. The decreased response to leptin in diet-induced obese, NZO, and <b>Ay</b> <b>mice</b> suggests that obesity in these strains is the result of leptin resistance. In NZO mice, leptin resistance {{may be the result of}} decreased transport of leptin into the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas in <b>Ay</b> <b>mice,</b> leptin resistance probably results from defects downstream of the leptin receptor in the hypothalamus...|$|R

Herein, we estab-lished apoE-deficient genetically obese <b>Ay</b> (apoE/;Ay/) <b>mice.</b> ApoE deficiency in <b>Ay</b> <b>mice</b> prevented the develop-ment of obesity, with decreased fat accumulation in the liver and adipose tissues. ApoE/;Ay/ mice exhibited better glucose tolerance than apoE/;Ay/ mice.

These metabolic phenotypes were reversed by adenoviral replen-ishment of apoE protein, indicating circulating apoE to be involved in increased adiposity and obesity-related meta-bolic disorders.

40|$|AbstractThe Mahogany/Attractin gene (Atrn) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a downstream mediator of Agouti signaling because yellow hair color and obesity in lethal yellow (<b>Ay)</b> <b>mice</b> are suppressed by the mahogany (Atrnmg) mutation. The present study examined the distribution of Atrn mRNA {{in the brain and}} spinal cord by in situ hybridization. Atrn mRNA was found widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, with high levels in regions of the olfactory system, some limbic structures, regions of the brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord. In the hypothalamus, Atrn mRNA was found in specific nuclei including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, the medial preoptic nucleus, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and the arcuate nucleus. These results suggest a broad spectrum of physiological functions for the Atrn gene product...|$|R
40|$|Ellipsoid and {{spheroid}} melanosomes {{similar to}} those found in the hair matrix melanocytes of eumelanic C 57 BL <b>mice</b> and pheomelanic <b>Ay</b> <b>mice,</b> respectively, have been shown to coexist in the same human melanocyte. The difference in the three-dimensional ultrastructure of these melanosomes of the human hair matrix melanocyte has been determined by high-voltage transmission electron microscopy using a goniometer. By energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, sulfur, one of the main characteristic chemical properties of pheomelanin, is detected in a significant amount in each spheroid melanosome, but is absent in ellipsoid melanosomes. Furthermore, the internal structure of the spheroid melanosomes is dissolved by treatment with 0. 5 N NaOH solution, whereas the ellipsoid melanosomes are not affected. We proposed that in normal human melanocytes pheo- and eumelanogenesis occurs in spheroid and ellipsoid melanosomes, respectively. J Invest Dermatol 100 : 172 S– 175 S, 199...|$|R
40|$|The mouse coat color mutant mahoganoid (md) darkens coat {{color and}} {{decreases}} the obesity of <b>Ay</b> <b>mice</b> that ectopically overexpress agouti-signaling protein. The phenotypic effects of md {{are similar to}} those of the recently identified coat color mutant mahogany (Atrnmg). We report the positional cloning of mahoganoid, encoding a novel 494 –amino acid protein containing a C 3 HC 4 RING (really interesting new gene) domain that may function as an E 3 ubiquitin ligase. The mutations in the mahoganoid allelic series (md, md 2 J, md 5 J) are all due to large retroviral insertions. In md and md 2 J, the result is minimal expression of the normal size transcripts in all tissues examined. Unlike Atrnmg/Atrnmg animals, we observe no evidence of neurological deficit or neuropathology in md/md mice. Body weight and body mass index (a surrogate for adiposity) measurements of B 6. C 3 H-md-A md/+ and md/md animals on 9 % and 45 % kcal fat diets indicate that mahoganoid does not suppress body weight in B 6. C 3 H animals in a gene dose-dependent fashion...|$|R

40|$|Leucine may {{function}} as a signaling molecule to regulate metabolism. We have previously shown that dietary leucine supplementation significantly improves glucose and energy metabolism in diet-induced obese mice, suggesting that leucine supplementation could potentially be a useful adjuvant therapy for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Since the underlying cause for obesity and type 2 diabetes is multifold, we further investigated metabolic effects of leucine supplementation in obese/diabetes mouse models with different etiologies, and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Leucine supplementation {{was carried out in}} NONcNZO 10 /LtJ (RCS 10) - a polygenic model predisposed to beta cell failure and type 2 diabetes, and in B 6. Cg-Ay/J (Aʸ) - a monogenic model for impaired central melanocortin receptor signaling, obesity, and severe insulin resistance. Mice in the treatment group received the drinking water containing 1. 5 % leucine for up to 8 months; control mice received the tap water. Body weight, body composition, blood HbA 1 c levels, and plasma glucose and insulin levels were monitored throughout and/or {{at the end of the}} study period. Indirect calorimetry, skeletal muscle gene expression, and adipose tissue inflammation were also assessed in Aʸ mice. Leucine supplementation significantly reduced HbA 1 c levels throughout the study period in both RCS 10 and Aʸ mice. However, the treatment had no long term effect on body weight or adiposity. The improvement in glycemic control was associated with an increased insulin response to food challenge in RCS 10 mice and decreased plasma insulin levels in Aʸ mice. In leucine-treated Aʸ mice, energy expenditure was increased by ~ 10 % (p < 0. 05) in both dark and light cycles while the physical activity level was unchanged. The expression levels of UCP 3, CrAT, PPAR-alpha, and NRF- 1, which are known to regulate mitochondrial oxidative function, were significantly increased in the soleus muscle of leucine-treated <b>Ay</b> <b>mice</b> whereas the expression levels of MCP- 1 and TNF-alpha and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue were significantly reduced. Chronic leucine supplementation significantly improves glycemic control in multiple mouse models of obesity and diabetes with distinct etiologies. The metabolic benefits of leucine supplementation are likely mediated via multiple mechanisms in different tissues, but are not necessarily dependent of weight reduction...|$|R
40|$|Endothelin 3 (Edn 3) encodes a ligand {{important}} to developing neural crest cells and is allelic to the spontaneous mouse mutation occurring at the lethal spotting (ls) locus. Edn 3 ls/ls mutants exhibit a spotted phenotype due to reduced numbers of neural crest-derived melanocyte precursors in the skin. In this study, {{we show that}} when Edn 3 {{is driven by the}} keratin 5 promoter and thereby placed proximal to melanocyte lineage cells, adult mice manifest pigmented skin harboring dermal melanocytes. Using a tetracycline inducible system, we show that the postnatal expression of Edn 3 is required to maintain these dermal melanocytes, and that early expression of the Edn 3 transgene is {{important to}} the onset of the hyperpigmentation phenotype. Crosses into Edn 3 ls/ls mutants demonstrate that the Edn 3 transgene expression does not fully compensate for the endogenous expression pattern. Crosses into tyrosine kinase receptor KitWv mutants indicate that Edn 3 can partially compensate for Kit's role in early development. Crosses into <b>Ay</b> mutant <b>mice</b> considerably darkened their yellow coat color suggesting a previously unreported role for endothelin signaling in pigment switching. These results demonstrate that exogenous Edn 3 affects both precursors and differentiated melanocytes, leading to a phenotype with characteristics similar to the human skin condition dermal melanocytosis...|$|R
40|$|Decreased sulfotransferase SULT 1 C 2 gene {{expression}} in DPT-induced polycystic kidney. BackgroundThe pathogenesis of {{polycystic kidney disease}} (PKD) remains unclear despite {{the identification of the}} genes responsible for hereditary PKD. In this study, we investigated the alteration of {{gene expression}}s in an acquired PKD model induced by 2 -amino- 4, 5 -diphenylthiazole (DPT) using the differential display method. MethodsKidney mRNA from a Sprague-Dawley rat fed with 1 % DPT for 4 days and from a control rat was compared by the RT-PCR differential display method. Differentially expressed bands were re-amplified and subcloned. Using these subclones as probes, the changes in gene expressions were confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Subsequently, mouse kidney cDNA library was screened. ResultsThe isolated 1. 5 -kb cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding 296 amino acids, which shared 94. 3 % identity with rat SULT 1 C 2 sulfotransferase, and was considered to be its mouse ortholog (GenBank Accession No. <b>AY</b> 005469). <b>Mouse</b> SULT 1 C 2 mRNA was abundant in the kidney and stomach among normal mouse tissues. The expression of SULT 1 C 2 mRNA was decreased in the rat kidney after DPT feeding but not in the stomach. Mouse SULT 1 C 2 was expressed successfully using pET plasmid vector and E. coli. The recombinant 34 -kD protein was capable of catalyzing the sulfation of p-nitrophenol at a Km of 3. 1 mmol/L, by utilizing 3 ′-phosphoadenosine 5 ′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as the sulfate donor. ConclusionsAlthough the physiological substrate and function of SULT 1 C 2 have yet to be elucidated, its down-regulation could be involved in the cystic changes of tubules by decreasing the sulfation of the tubular basement membrane components...|$|R
40|$|The {{mahogany}} (mg) locus {{originally was}} identified as a recessive suppressor of agouti, a locus encoding a skin peptide that modifies coat color by antagonizing the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor or MC 1 -R. Certain dominant alleles of agouti cause an obesity syndrome when ectopic expression of the peptide aberrantly antagonizes the MC 4 -R, a related melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor expressed in hypothalamic circuitry and involved in the regulation of feeding behavior and metabolism. Recent work has demonstrated that mg, when homozygous, blocks not only the ability of agouti to induce a yellow coat color when expressed in the skin of the lethal yellow <b>mouse</b> (<b>AY),</b> but also the obesity resulting from ectopic expression of agouti in the brain. Detailed analysis of mg/mg AY/a animals, presented here, demonstrates that mg/mg blocks the obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and increased linear growth induced by ectopic expression of the agouti peptide. Remarkably, however, mg/mg did not reduce hyperphagia in the AY/a mouse. Furthermore, mg/mg induced hyperphagia and an increase in basal metabolic rate in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse in the absence of AY. Consequently, although mahogany is broadly required for agouti peptide action, it also appears {{to be involved in the}} control of metabolic rate and feeding behavior independent of its suppression of agouti...|$|R
40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} overexpression of agouti-signaling protein (ASP), a paracrine-signaling molecule {{that regulates}} pigment-type switching {{in the hair}} follicle of the mouse, {{is responsible for the}} obesity and yellow pelage of the Yellow <b>mouse</b> (<b>Ay).</b> Mahogany (Attractin, Atrn/mg) and mahoganoid (Mahogunin Ring Finger- 1, Mgrn 1 /md) are mutations epistatic to Ay. These mutations have been described as suppressors of ASP action, blocking its antagonizing effects on the melanocortin 1 and 4 receptors (MC 1 R and MC 4 R) in the skin and the brain, respectively, via unknown mechanisms. Here, we describe the molecular bases for the md- and mg-dependent rescue of the Ay phenotype at the MC 4 R. We show that overexpression of ASP inhibits the rise in cAMP levels in response to α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, an MC 4 R agonist, by blocking ligand binding and by directing MC 4 R trafficking to the lysosome. Loss-of-function of either attractin or MGRN 1 blocks ASP-dependent MC 4 R degradation and promotes increased trafficking of internalized MC 4 R to the cell surface, but it does not restore α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-dependent cAMP signaling. We propose that MGRN 1 and attractin are components of an evolutionarily conserved receptor trafficking pathway and that the md and mg mutations rescue the Ay phenotypes by a primarily cAMP-independent mechanism promoting trafficking of MC 4 R and likely MC 1 R away from the lysosome toward the cell surface...|$|R

"Well, sirs, the Cimaroons {{after that}} went away from us, {{swearing}} revenge (for which we cared little enough), and we rowed {{up the river}} {{to a place where}} three streams met, and then up the least of the three, some four days' journey, till it grew all shoal and swift; and there we hauled the pinnace upon the sands, and Mr. Oxenham asked the men whether they were willing to carry the gold and silver over the mountains to the North Sea. Some of them at first were loath to do it, and I and others advised that we should leave the plate behind, and take the gold only, for it would have cost us three or four journeys at the least. But Mr. Oxenham promised every man 100 pezos of silver over and above his wages, which made them content enough, and we were all to start the morrow morning. But, sirs, that night, as God had ordained, came a mishap by some rash speeches of Mr. Oxenham's, which threw all abroad again; for when we had carried the treasure about half a league inland, and hidden it away in a house which we made of boughs, Mr. O. being always full of that his fair lady, spoke to me and William Penberthy of Marazion, my good comrade, and a few more, saying, 'That we had no need to return to England, seeing that we were already in the very garden of Eden, and wanted for nothing, but could live without labor or toil; and that it was better, when we got over to the North Sea, to go and seek out some fair island, and there dwell in joy and pleasure till our lives' end. And we two,' he said, 'will be king and queen, and you, whom I can trust, my officers; and for servants we will have the Indians, who, I warrant, will be more fain to serve honest and merry masters like us than those Spanish devils,' and much more of the like; which words I liked well,--my mind, alas! being given altogether to carnal pleasure and vanity,--as did William Penberthy, my good comrade, on whom I trust God has had mercy. But the rest, sirs, took the matter all across, and began murmuring against the captain, saying that poor honest mariners like them had always the labor and the pain, while he took his delight with his lady; and that they would have at least one merry night before they were slain by the Cimaroons, or eaten by panthers and lagartos; and so got out of the pinnace two great skins of Canary wine, which were taken in the Lima prize, and sat themselves down to drink. Moreover, there were in the pinnace a great sight of hens, which came from the same prize, by which Mr. O. set great store, keeping them for the lady and the little maid; and falling upon these, the men began to blaspheme, saying, 'What a plague had the captain to fill the boat with dirty live lumber for that giglet's sake? They had a better right to a good supper than ever she had, and might fast awhile to cool her hot blood;' and so cooked and ate those hens, plucking them on board the pinnace, and letting the feathers fall into the stream. But when William Penberthy, my good comrade, saw the feathers floating away down, he asked them if they were mad, to lay a trail by which the Spaniards would surely track them out, if they came after them, as without doubt they would. But they laughed him to scorn, and said that no Spanish cur dared follow on the heels of true English mastiffs as they were, and other boastful speeches; and at last, being heated with wine, began afresh to murmur at the captain. And one speaking of his counsel about the island, the rest altogether took it amiss and out of the way; and some sprang up crying treason, and others that he meant to defraud them of the plate which he had promised, and others that he meant to desert them in a strange land, and so forth, till Mr. O., hearing the hubbub, came out to them from the house, when they reviled him foully, swearing that he meant to cheat them; and one Edward Stiles, a Wapping man, mad with drink, dared {{to say that he was}} a fool for not giving up the prisoners to the negroes, and what was it to him if the lady roasted? the negroes should have her yet; and drawing his sword, ran upon the captain: for which I was about to strike him through the body; but the captain, not caring to waste steel on such a ribald, with his fist caught him such a buffet behind the ear, that he fell down stark dead, and all the rest stood amazed. Then Mr. Oxenham called out, 'All honest men who know me, and can trust me, stand by your lawful captain against these ruffians.' Whereon, sirs, I, and Penberthy my good comrade, and four Plymouth men, who had sailed with Mr. O. in Mr. Drake's ship, and knew his trusty and valiant conditions, came over to him, and swore before God to stand by him and the lady. Then said Mr. O. to the rest, 'Will you carry this treasure, knaves, or will you not? Give me an answer here.' And they refused, unless he would, before they started, give each man his share. So Mr. O. waxed very mad, and swore that he would never be served by men who did not trust him, and so went in again; and that night was spent in great disquiet, I and those five others keeping watch about the house of boughs till the rest fell asleep, in their drink. And next morning, when the wine was gone out of them, Mr. O. asked them whether they would go to the hills with him, and find those negroes, and persuade them after all to carry the treasure. To which they agreed after awhile, thinking that so they should save themselves labor; and went off with Mr. Oxenham, leaving us six who had stood by him to watch the lady and the treasure, after he had taken an oath of us that we would deal justly and obediently by him and by her, which God knows, gentlemen, we did. So he parted with much weeping and wailing of the lady, and was gone seven days; and all that time we kept that lady faithfully and honestly, bringing her the best we could find, and serving her upon our bended knees, both for her admirable beauty, and for her excellent conditions, for she was certainly of some noble kin, and courteous, and without fear, as if she had been a very princess. But she kept always within the house, which the little maid (God bless her!) did not, but soon learned to play with us and we with her, so that we made great cheer of her, gentlemen, sailor fashion--for you know we must always have our minions aboard to pet and amuse us--maybe a monkey, or a little dog, or a singing bird, <b>ay,</b> or <b>mice</b> and spiders, if we have nothing better to play withal. And she was wonderful sharp, sirs, was the little maid, and picked up her English from us fast, calling us jolly mariners, which I doubt but she has forgotten by now, but I hope in God it be not so;" [...] and therewith the good fellow began wiping his eyes.|$|R
