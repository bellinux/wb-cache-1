5|$|Alone, Williams {{had more}} rushing yards {{than all of}} Tennessee's players combined. Tennessee's leading rusher was Montario Hardesty, who carried the ball 18 times for 39 yards and a touchdown. Hardesty had 1,345 rushing yards on the season, the fourth-highest season total for any player in Tennessee's history. Tennessee's No. 2 rusher was Tauren Poole, who gained 15 yards on 3 carries. Collectively, Tennessee had just five yards net rushing, the second-least ever in <b>a</b> <b>Tennessee</b> bowl game and the least allowed by Virginia Tech in a bowl game. Most of Tennessee's rushing gains were negated when quarterback Jonathan Crompton was sacked six times, losing 55 yards.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, most of {{the former}} Overhill sites were {{submerged}} by the impoundment of the Little Tennessee River in <b>a</b> <b>Tennessee</b> Valley Authority project. But, archaeologists conducted extensive excavations prior to this, during which they identified {{most of the}} Overhill towns and extracted thousands of artifacts, helping them develop volumes of invaluable information regarding the region's Cherokee and pre-Cherokee inhabitants. Different cultures of indigenous peoples had lived along the river for 12,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Manning's first start, <b>a</b> <b>Tennessee</b> {{homecoming}} {{game against}} Washington State, {{resulted in a}} 109 win. Things got progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole loss was a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The loss was merely a bump in the road, however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{both parties}} were {{concerned}} {{with the growth of}} the power of trusts and monopolies, {{and one of the first}} acts of the 51st Congress was to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act, sponsored by Senator John Sherman of Ohio. The Act passed by wide margins in both houses, and Harrison signed it into law. The Sherman Act was the first Federal act of its kind, and marked a new use of federal government power. While Harrison approved of the law and its intent, his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it. However, the government successfully concluded a case during Harrison's time in office (against <b>a</b> <b>Tennessee</b> coal company), and had initiated several other cases against trusts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Tennessee {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty, pushing the Volunteers back toward their goal line. <b>A</b> <b>Tennessee</b> rush was stopped for no gain, then Stewart picked up eight yards on a running play. Needing eight yards for a first down, Manning threw an 11-yard pass to Kent for the first down. On the next play, Manning completed a 43-yard toss to Kent, driving the Volunteers into the Virginia Tech half of the field. Manning's next throw was a 35-yard touchdown throw to Marcus Nash. The extra point was good, and Tennessee took a 140 lead with 1:08 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Though {{ineffective}} on the ground, Crompton outperformed Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor in {{the passing}} game. Crompton completed 15 of 26 pass attempts for 235 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Crompton finished the season with 27 touchdown passes, third-most in school history, and had the fourth-most pass attempts, ninth-most completions, and eighth-most yards for <b>a</b> <b>Tennessee</b> season. Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed 10 of 17 passes for 209 yards and one interception.|$|E

5|$|Following Tennessee's touchdown, the {{two teams}} traded possessions, each going three and out. Virginia Tech regained the ball after <b>a</b> <b>Tennessee</b> punt to its 20-yard line with 7:31 {{remaining}} in the quarter. After a Tech fumble that was recovered by the Hokies, Tech running back Dwayne Thomas ran nine yards for the first Tech first down of the game. After an incomplete pass, DeShazo and Thomas connected on an eight-yard pass before Thomas broke free for an 11-yard run and another first down. Thomas continued advancing the ball, picking up eight yards on two rushing plays. DeShazo then completed a four-yard pass for a first down at the Tennessee 39-yard line. There, however, Tennessee's defense stiffened and did not allow the Hokies another first down. The Tech punt was downed at the Tennessee 7-yard line, where the Volunteers began their third possession of the game.|$|E
5|$|The Volunteers' kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 22-yard line, and the Hokies began another drive. On the first play of the drive, however, Maurice DeShazo scrambled for a ten-yard gain but fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by <b>a</b> <b>Tennessee</b> defender, and the Volunteers took over on offense from the Tech 32-yard line. Branndon Stewart came out onto the field in place of Manning, and completed an eight-yard pass to James Stewart to begin the drive. James Stewart then ran to the 20-yard line for a first down. On the next play, Tennessee executed a trick play in which James Stewart received the ball via a hand-off, imitating a running play, but threw the ball instead. The pass was caught by James Kendrick for a touchdown, and after the extra point, Tennessee had a 357 lead with 2:08 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{was born}} in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until {{the final days of}} the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was {{initially}} employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing electric utilities, and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C, and announced plans for <b>a</b> <b>Tennessee</b> Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C's property for a good price, and gained public esteem.|$|E
