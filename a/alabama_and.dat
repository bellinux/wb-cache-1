5|$|Although {{the assault}} {{is known to}} popular history as Pickett's Charge, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett {{was one of his}} {{division}}al commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault (or, less frequently, Longstreet's Assault) to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, <b>Alabama,</b> <b>and</b> Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from <b>Alabama</b> <b>and</b> Florida.|$|E
