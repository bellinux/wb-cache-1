40|$|Guardianship laws in most Western {{societies}} provide decision-making {{mechanisms for}} adults with impaired capacity. Since {{the inception of}} these laws, the principle of autonomy and {{recognition of human rights}} for those coming within guardianship regimes has gained prominence. A new legal model has emerged, which seeks to incorporate ‘assisted decision-making’ models into guardianship laws. Such models legally recognise that an adult’s capacity may be maintained through assistance or support provided by another person, and provide formal recognition of the person in that ‘assisting’ role. This article situates this latest legal innovation within a historical context, examining the social and legal evolution of guardianship laws and determining whether modern <b>assisted</b> <b>decision-making</b> models remain consistent with guardianship reform thus far. It identifies and critically analyses the different <b>assisted</b> <b>decision-making</b> models which exist internationally. Finally, it discusses a number of conceptual, legal and practical concerns that remain unresolved. These issues require serious consideration before assisted decisionmaking models are adopted in guardianship regimes in Australia...|$|E

40|$|Guardianship {{laws which}} provide legal {{mechanisms}} for decision-making {{on behalf of}} adults with limited or impaired capacity to make decisions have become a feature of most Western jurisdictions. In the UK, the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and the English and Welsh Mental Capacity Act 2005 have established a comprehensive framework for authorising medical, financial and welfare decisions to be taken on behalf of adults {{who are unable to}} take any or all such decisions themselves. One feature of guardianship regimes has been their tendency to evolve over time. Legal reforms have been instigated by the changes in philosophical views about how society should engage with adults with a decision-making impairment and also modern views about the role human rights play in guardianships regimes. The latest ideas in guardianship regimes around the Western world centre on the possibility of legal recognition of the concept of <b>assisted</b> <b>decision-making</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} an {{exploratory}} research study {{to examine the}} effectiveness of health impact assessments in Wales. Through the review of five case study health impact assessments the research {{identified a number of}} benefits of the process in terms of skills and knowledge development amongst participants. The indirect contributions to decision-making were also evident including the way in which health impact assessment provided useful insights into the local community's perspective and raised awareness about the wider determinants of health. The process was also useful in establishing a dialogue between different stakeholders, which indirectly <b>assisted</b> <b>decision-making</b> and implementation. The direct links between health impact assessment and decision-making were more difficult to trace and this paper puts forward a number of suggestions for making those links more transparent. Suggestions include integrating decision-makers and clarifying the intended links to decision-making {{at the start of the}} health impact assessment process. Mainstreaming health impact assessment so that it is triggered as a routine part of all decision-making would help ensure it stands the best chance of informing decisions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{responsible}} {{management of}} product return flows in production and inventory environments is a rapidly increasing requirement for companies. This {{can be attributed}} to economic, environmental and/or regulatory motivations. Mathematical modeling of such systems has <b>assisted</b> <b>decision-making</b> processes and provided {{a better understanding of the}} behavior of such production and inventory environments. Therefore, this paper reviews the literature on the modeling of reverse logistics inventory systems that are based on the economic order/production quantity (EOQ/EPQ) and the joint economic lot size (JELS) settings, so as to systematically analyze the mathematics involved in capturing the main characteristics of related processes. The literature is surveyed and classified according to the specific issues faced and modeling assumptions. Special attention is given to environmental issues. In addition, there are indications of the need for the mathematics of reverse logistics models to follow current trends in ‘greening’ inventory and supply-chain models. Finally, the modeling of waste disposal, greenhouse-gas emissions and energy consumption during production is considered as the most pressing priority for the future of reverse logistics models. An illustrative example for modeling reverse logistics inventory models with environmental implications is presented...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To pilot a single-patient trials (SPTs) {{service in}} general practice, {{designed}} to improve decision-making about long-term medications for chronic conditions. Design: 12 -week within-patient, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover comparison of ibuprofen with paracetamol for osteoarthritis, involving three pairs of two-week treatment periods for each participating patient. Setting and patients: Patients attending an academic general practice with a clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis, with pain {{of at least a}} month 2 ̆ 7 s duration severe enough to warrant consideration of long-term non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Main outcome measures: Pain and stiffness; measures of overall arthritis compared with previous fortnight; preference for NSAID {{at the end of each}} two-week treatment period; use of escape analgesia; side effects; and management changes as a result of the SPTs. Results: Eight of 14 patients completed SPTs. One was a clear responder to NSAIDs, five were non-responders, and two were indefinite. Of the five who were using NSAIDs before the SPT, two continued and three ceased using them. Clinically useful information <b>assisted</b> <b>decision-making</b> for all eight participants. Medication management changed for six. Conclusions: Single-patient trials can be successfully implemented in general practice and might be a valuable method for GPs to identify patients who respond to medication for chronic stable conditions such as osteoarthritis, in which individual response to medication is variable...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{incorporating}} {{the results of}} pile load tests into pile design using the Bayesian approach and <b>assisting</b> <b>decision-making</b> {{on the outcome of}} load tests. The analysis is carried out in the framework of Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), since this methodology is being seriously considered to eventually replace the conventional Allowable Stress Design (ASD). The first-order, second-moment reliability method is used to develop resistance factors for pile design using statistics of the pile capacity distribution that has been updated using the Bayesian method. A criterion of minimum acceptable test outcome is proposed for <b>assisting</b> <b>decision-making</b> in load tests. To illustrate the methodology, results associated with the design method for driven piles using information from the standard penetration test (SPT) are presented. Parametric studies are performed to evaluate the effect of number of load tests and outcome of the load tests on the updated resistance factors. For the same test outcome, the Bayesian approach allows for higher resistance factors or shorter pile length than those interpreted from the ASD approach...|$|R
40|$|Advance {{directives}} (ADs) {{are legal}} statements or documents, which allow {{a person to}} outline treatment preferences and other life choices prior to a mental health crisis. This thesis examines the issues arising {{in relation to the}} introduction of a legal framework for ADs in Irish mental health care from an international, comparative and national perspective. Ireland currently lacks legislative provisions for ADs, but it is proposed to incorporate legislative provisions into the <b>Assisted</b> <b>Decision-Making</b> (Capacity) Bill 2013 (2013 Bill) in the near future. This thesis reviews the literature on ADs and considers the legal, ethical and implementation issues associated their use under international, comparative and domestic frameworks and from the perspective of key stakeholders. The views and preferences of Irish stakeholders are addressed through an original empirical study. The international research considers the introduction of ADs under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The CRPD requires a new approach to decision-making in mental health care {{and the development of a}} range of support strategies. The thesis will consider the implications of the CRPD on the conceptual foundation of ADs and their role under new human rights frameworks. The thesis also includes a comparative study into an innovative approach to the implementation of ADs in the State of Virginia in the United States. The aim of the empirical research is to determine the views and preferences of Irish service users and consultant psychiatrists towards the proposed use of ADs and the extent to which they will be supported in Ireland. The empirical research found broad support for ADs among Irish stakeholders, but varying implementation preferences. The research makes recommendations for the introduction and implementation of an appropriate legal framework for mental health ADs in Ireland and other jurisdictions under international human rights frameworks. 2018 - 12 - 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} research project examines {{the topic of}} self-neglect among the elderly in Ireland. Self-neglect is a hidden and undeniably complex problem and presents a serious public health issue. A {{detailed analysis of the}} literature reveales multiple themes such as the adverse health outcomes of older people who self-neglect, their refusal of services and interventions, and the ethical challenges faced by health and social care professionals. A qualitative research paradigm was utilised for the purpose of data collection, with two separate practitioners from the Health Service Executive being interviewed in order to ascertain their perspectives on self-neglect, given their extensive professional experience of the phenomenon. The findings of the research project underscores the significance of self-neglect among the older population, highlighting how it is far from being a straightforward problem with an easy solution. Although the prevalence of self-neglect based on both participants’ estimations of their caseloads was corroborated by the literature, cases which come to the attention of professionals are generally not deemed to be representative of the true extent of self-neglect within the population due to self-neglect behaviours remaining hidden, often times only coming to the attention of others when there is a crisis in the older person’s medical presentation or something happens publicly. The study findings also revealed that instances of self-neglect can occur simultaneously with elder abuse, whereby family members could be depriving the older person of the resources they need to adequately provide for themselves. Other findings highlighted the lack of any formal self-neglect assessment tool among public health nurses, making identification of self-neglect subjective and not standardised; the convoluted process of referrals in relation to accessing certain multidisciplinary services; and the major challenges in making a medical determination of capacity, an area which may become even more compounded with the introduction of the <b>Assisted</b> <b>Decision-Making</b> (Capacity) Act 2015. However, more study is needed in this particular area especially when the new legislation becomes operational. Finally, the study findings revealed that self-neglect has both good and bad outcomes, with good ones being summed up as a complete ‘turn-around’ in the older person’s condition. Bad outcomes were described as especially difficult because the self-neglect persists and the risk persists while professionals are left trying to positively engage and build relationships with the older person who is denying service intervention and does not see their own behaviour as problematic. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} offers {{three studies}} on criminal behavior and criminal risk forecasting. The first two chapters present theoretical models and empirical {{evidence on the}} nature and motives of criminal behavior among high risk and high rate offenders and the implications these models have for criminal justice policy. The third chapter is a study of judicial and administrative decision-making with regard to assessments of crime and violence risk. Chapter 1 gives {{an account of the}} 1970 s and 80 s rise and dominance of the policy of incapacitation through incarceration. The chapter describes the deterministic model of criminal behavior underpinning the theory and policy of incapacitation, and the policy implications of recent re-conceptualizations that view criminal behavior much more like other human choices - a question of contingencies and opportunities. The chapter focuses on Franklin Zimring's (2011) account of the New York City crime decline as evidence against the notion that criminal propensities are fixed and predictable over periods of years. Rather, it appears, relatively modest and superficial changes in circumstances and environmental features can lead to vastly different rates of criminal engagement. The second chapter turns to a particular aspect of the New York City crime decline and the question of future criminal risk prediction. Specifically, the chapter examines the more than two decade drop in the rate of prison return for a new felony among New York City offenders. The chapter assesses whether the declining prison return rate is indeed an indicator of significant behavior change, or is a reflection of changes in criminal justice system actor practices. Further, {{to the extent that the}} statistics are an indicator of behavior change, the chapter evaluates whether this can interpreted as the result of the changing New York City crime environment over the last two and a half decades, or is better understood as a reflection of changes in the individual criminal propensities of those leaving prison over this period. To tease apart these competing accounts, the chapter analyzes a unique dataset involving individual records of four cohorts of prisoners from New York City released in the years 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2008. The analysis suggests a mixed picture - all three accounts are at work. Finally, the third chapter of the dissertation turns from models of criminal behavior and criminal decision-making, to judges and administrator decisions regarding criminal risk. The chapter uses machine-learning procedures for prediction and causal estimation to analyze release decisions in California Parole hearings for inmates serving life sentences with the possibility of parole. Using an original dataset generated from all parole suitability hearings conducted since 2011 (over 8, 000 transcripts), the chapter offers an empirical analysis of the current system, evaluating the rationality, uniformity, and defensibility of the criteria and decision-making applied to each claim for release. Finally, using the parole analysis as proof of concept, the chapter considers the promises and pitfalls of algorithmic <b>assisted</b> <b>decision-making</b> in the criminal justice system...|$|E
