5|$|In September 1947, Hull, Russell, who was {{designated}} test director on 14 October, and Joint Task Force 7's scientific director, Darol K. Froman from the Los Alamos Laboratories, set out with <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> and military officers to examine various proposed test {{sites in the}} Pacific. Enewetak Atoll {{was chosen as the}} test site on 11 October. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg lived most of {{his later}} life in Lafayette, California, where he devoted himself to editing and {{publishing}} the journals that documented both his early life and later career. He rallied <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> who criticized the science curriculum {{in the state of}} California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and not nearly focused enough on hard science. California Governor Pete Wilson appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California's science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{earthquake}} swarms can be dangerous, {{scientists are}} able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> investigated {{the possibility that a}} volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 earthquake swarm at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Railly gives {{a lecture}} about the Cassandra complex to <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists.</b> At the post-lecture book signing, Dr. Peters points out to Railly that apocalypse alarmists {{represent}} the sane vision, while humanity's gradual {{destruction of the}} environment is the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her {{to take him to}} Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. When they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the group and says that in 1990 Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines' virologist father.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> {{from the}} CRISM team {{reported}} on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals {{formed in the}} presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, kaolinite, prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the US Department of Energy and conducted by Oregon State University, the Idaho National Laboratory, and other colleges beginning in 2000. At the time, Oregon State's nuclear department had been developing passive water-circulation techniques for cooling in nuclear plants. The research grant ended in 2003, but <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> at Oregon State University continued the work. They built a test lab at one-third the actual scale of the technology and inherited related patents from the university in 2007, {{in exchange for a}} small equity in the company. NuScale was founded that same year. Its first funding round was in January 2008 for an undisclosed sum. It began seeking certification with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 2008.|$|E

These included the affidavits by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a cover note explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to the DOE, which classified it.|$|E
