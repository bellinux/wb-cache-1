40|$|<b>Arteriviruses</b> are positive-stranded RNA viruses with an {{efficiently}} organized, polycistronic genome. A short region {{between the}} replicase gene and {{open reading frame}} (ORF) 2 of the equine arteritis virus (EAV) genome was previously assumed to be untranslated. However, here we report that this segment of the EAV genome contains the 5 * part of a novel gene (ORF 2 a) which is conserved in all <b>arteriviruses.</b> The 3 * part of EAV ORF 2 a overlaps with the 5 * part of the former ORF 2 (now renamed ORF 2 b), which encodes the GS glycoprotein. Both ORF 2 a and ORF 2 b appear to be expressed from mRNA 2, which thereby constitutes the first proven example of a bicistronic mRNA in <b>arteriviruses.</b> The 67 -amino-acid protein encoded by EAV ORF 2 a, which we have provisionally named the envelope (E) protein, is very hydrophobic and has a basic C terminus. An E protein-specific antiserum was raised and used to demonstrate {{the expression of the}} novel gene in EAV-infected cells. The EAV E protein proved to be very stable, did not form disulfide-linked oligomers, and was not N-glycosylated. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies showed that the E protein associates with intracellular membranes both in EAV-infected cells and upon independent expression. An analysis of purified EAV particles revealed that the E protein is a structural protein.

Together with toroviruses, <b>arteriviruses,</b> and roniviruses the coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales. So far antivirals are hardly available to combat infections with viruses of this order. Therefore, various antiviral strategies to counter nidoviral infections are under evaluation. Lectins, which bind to N-linked oligosaccharide elements of enveloped viruses, can be considered as a conceptionally new class of virus inhibitors. These agents were recently evaluated for their antiviral activity towards a variety of enveloped viruses and were shown in most cases to inhibit virus infection at low concentrations. However, limited knowledge is available for their efficacy towards nidoviruses. In this article the application of the plant lectins Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), Cymbidium sp. agglutinin (CA) and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) as well as non-plant derived pradimicin-A (PRM-A) and cyanovirin-N (CV-N) as potential antiviral agents was evaluated. Three antiviral tests were compared based on different evaluation principles: cell viability (MTT-based colorimetric assay), number of infected cells (immunoperoxidase assay) and amount of viral protein expression (luciferase-based assay). The presence of carbohydrate-binding agents strongly inhibited coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, feline coronaviruses serotypes I and II, mouse hepatitis virus), <b>arteriviruses</b> (equine arteritis virus and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus) and torovirus (equine Berne virus).

We experimentally infected a group of boars with PRRSV 12068 - 96, a virulent field strain.

The PRRSV testicular replication in testis centers on two types of cells: (i) epithelial germ cells of the seminiferous tubules, primarily spermatids and spermatocytes, and (ii) macrophages, which are located in the interstitium of the testis. Histopathologically, hypospermatogenesis, formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs), and abundant germ cell depletion and death were observed.

40|$|The innate immune {{response}} constitutes {{the first line}} of defense against viral infection and is extensively regulated through ubiquitination. The removal of ubiquitin from innate immunity signaling factors by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) therefore provides a potential opportunity for viruses to evade this host defense system. It was previously found that specific proteases encoded by the unrelated arteri- and nairoviruses resemble the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) family of DUBs. In arteriviruses, this domain has been characterized before as a papain-like protease (PLP 2) that is also involved in replicase polyprotein processing. In nairoviruses, the DUB resides in the polymerase protein but is not essential for RNA replication. Using both in vitro and cell-based assays, we now show that PLP 2 DUB activity is conserved in all members of the <b>arterivirus</b> family and that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling when overexpressed. The potential relevance of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling for the innate {{immune response}} against <b>arterivirus</b> infection is supported by our finding that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the production of beta interferon primarily depends on the recognition of <b>arterivirus</b> RNA by the pattern-recognition receptor MDA 5. Interestingly, we also found that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination upon overexpression, suggesting that both MDA 5 and RIG-I have a role in countering infection by arteriviruses.

SHFV was previously shown to also cause a rapid onset fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in macaques. Infection of macaques {{with a new}} isolate of SHFV from persistently infected baboon sera, that showed high nucleotide identity with the lab strain LVR, resulted in viremia, pro-inflammatory cytokine and tissue factor production, and symptoms of coagulation defects. Primary macrophages and myeloid dendritic cell cultures from disease-susceptible macaques efficiently replicated SHFV and produced pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL- 6 and TNF-α, as well as tissue factor. Cells from disease resistant baboons produced low virus yields and the immunomodulatory cytokine IL- 10. IL- 10 treatment of macaque cells decreased IL- 6 levels but {{had no effect on}} TNF-α levels, tissue factor or virus production suggesting that IL- 10 plays a role in modulating immunopathology in disease-resistant baboons but not in regulating the efficiency of virus replication. SHFV {{is a member of the}} family Arteriviridae. The SHFV genome encodes 8 minor structural proteins. Other <b>arteriviruses</b> encode 4 minor structural proteins. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that the four additional SHFV minor structural proteins resulted from gene duplication. A full-length infectious clone of SHFV was constructed and produced virus with replication kinetics comparable to the parental virus. Mutant infectious clones, each with the start codon of one of the minor structural proteins substituted, were analyzed. All eight SHFV proteins were required for infectious virus production.

Only one or two PLP domains are present in other <b>arteriviruses</b> but SHFV has three PLP domains. Analysis of in vitro proteolytic processing of C- and N-terminally tagged polyproteins indicated that the PLP in each of the three SHFV nsp 1 proteins is active.

Today PRRS is the most significant swine disease worldwide in spite of intensive immunological interventions.

Since then, both type 1 and type 2 have spread geographically, radiated genetically, and acquired new phenotypic characteristics, especially increased virulence. Here, we explore various hypotheses that might account for rapid expansion and diversification of PRRSV, including mechanisms specific to PRRSV and other <b>arteriviruses,</b> cellular modification processes, and immunological selection. Phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV has provided a broadly applicable means to relate diverse isolates, but it does not explain biological variation in virulence or immunological cross-protection. We present other methods of classification and review their limitations.
