5|$|<b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> I Saw It on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E

Geisel's birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an {{initiative}} on reading created by the National Education Association.|$|E

25|$|Geisel's {{earliest}} elephants {{were for}} advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do. With <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> I Saw It on Mulberry Street! (1937) and Horton Hatches the Egg (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like angel wings and thus {{appropriate to the}} saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons. Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.|$|E
25|$|Geisel {{was born}} and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. All four of his {{grandparents}} were German immigrants. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{the couple}} were {{returning}} from an ocean voyage to Europe when {{the rhythm of the}} ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> I Saw It on Mulberry Street. Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers. According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press. Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.|$|E

500|$|They were {{accompanied}} by a teacher Pound had met in hospital, Marcella Spann, 40 years his junior, ostensibly acting as his secretary and collecting poems for an anthology. The four women soon fell out, vying for control over him; Canto CXIII: alluded to it: [...] "Pride, jealousy and possessiveness / 3 pains of hell." [...] Pound {{was in love with}} Spann, seeing in her his last chance for love and youth. He wrote about her in Canto CXIII: [...] "The long flank, the firm breast / and to know beauty and death and despair / <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> what has been shall be, / flowing, ever unstill." [...] Dorothy had usually ignored his affairs, but she used her legal power over his royalties to make sure Spann was seen off, sent back to America.|$|E
500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{conceived}} {{the core of}} Mulberry Street {{in the summer of}} 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I saw it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E
500|$|Under Burton's direction, Broyles wrote another draft, but his {{script was}} {{projected}} at a $200 million budget. Fox {{wanted to cut}} it to $100 million. In August 2000, two months before principal photography, Fox brought Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal for rewrites. Broyles [...] "had {{a lot of respect}} with the work they [...] did. <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> given what I'd done and given what Tim wanted, they navigated the right course." [...] One of the considered endings had Leo Davidson crash-landing at Yankee Stadium, witnessing apes playing baseball. Various alternatives were considered before the filmmakers decided on the final one. The production of Planet of the Apes was a difficult experience for Burton. This was largely contributed by Fox's adamant release date (July 2001), which meant that everything from pre-production to editing and visual effects work was rushed.|$|E

500|$|Swift's friend, Anderson, portrayed {{herself in}} the video. The love {{interests}} of both Swift and Anderson were cast by Swift after she received images of them via e-mail. The video was filmed in two days. The first day consisted of actors, including Swift and Anderson, filming before a green screen. On the set, White presented Swift with caricature drawings depicting the music video, in order to guide herself. Swift was impressed by Anderson's acting skills, considering her lack of experience, and called it [...] "prolific". On the second day, scenes {{at a high school}} were filmed; artificial rain was made. Afterward, White and a team of visual effect artists created the setting. [...] "If you watch just the offline edit of this video, it's just green. It's just Taylor walking around a giant green screen. <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> every single thing in that video was created is amazing, 'cause a lot of people worked really hard on it", White said. The visual effects team were at work for the video for some time, sometimes staying overnight in the office to produce the video. The direction was to make the video seem [...] "magical". Some of the props used when filming were recreated using digital animation, such as the door and the desks. Because extras were filmed separately, White was meticulous to find the right shots to make the scene more cohesive. White believed the finished product had a sense of innocence.|$|E
2500|$|Geisel {{adopted the}} name [...] "Dr. Seuss" [...] as an {{undergraduate}} at Dartmouth College and {{a graduate student at}} the University of Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, most notably for Flit and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper PM. He published his first children's book <b>And</b> <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> I Saw It on Mulberry Street in 1937. During World War II, he took a brief hiatus from children's literature and worked in an animation department of the United States Army where he produced several short films, including Design for Death, which later won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.|$|E
