5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be <b>aware</b> of the premonitory urge. Children may be less <b>aware</b> of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming <b>aware</b> of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not <b>aware</b> they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
