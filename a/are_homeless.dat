25|$|People who <b>are</b> <b>homeless</b> {{tend to be}} {{socially}} isolated, which contributes negatively to their mental health. Studies have correlated that those who <b>are</b> <b>homeless</b> and have a strong support group {{tend to be more}} physically and mentally healthy. Aside from the stigma received by the homeless population, another aspect that contributes to social isolation is the purposeful avoidance of social opportunity practiced by the homeless community out of shame of revealing their current homeless state. Social isolation ties directly to social stigma in that homeless socialization outside of the homeless community will affect how the homeless are perceived. This is why homeless individuals talking with those who are not homeless is encouraged since it can combat the stigma that is often associated with homelessness.|$|E
