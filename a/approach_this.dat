5|$|Moncton is {{a bilingual}} city. About {{two-thirds of its}} {{residents}} are native English speakers, while the remaining is French-speaking. Almost all Monctonians speak English (64.6%) or French (31.9%) as first languages; 1.6% speak both languages as a first language, and 6.9% speak another language. About 46% of the city population is bilingual and understands both English and French; the only other Canadian cities that <b>approach</b> <b>this</b> level of linguistic duality are Ottawa, Sudbury, and Montreal. Moncton became the first officially bilingual {{city in the country}} in 2002. The adjacent city of Dieppe is about 73% Francophone and has benefited from an ongoing rural depopulation of the Acadian Peninsula and areas in northern and eastern New Brunswick. The town of Riverview meanwhile is heavily (95%) Anglophone.|$|E

5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton was not prepared to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to <b>approach</b> <b>this</b> coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{helicopter}} {{operations were}} {{taken over by}} Norsk Helikpoter (later renamed Bristow Norway) when they opened their base on 11 November 2004. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Hammerfest was the second airport to receive SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based landing system, when it was installed in 2007. SCAT-I allows aircraft with the system installed to make a safer and less fuel-consuming landings using a gliding instead of step-down <b>approach.</b> <b>This</b> was followed up with an upgrade to the runway safety area and runway lights in 2008 and 2009.|$|E

25|$|The {{first such}} device, the AN/APA-46 Adapter Assembly, allowed the {{operator}} to sight through the Norden at four (or five {{depending on the}} model) locations during the <b>approach.</b> <b>This</b> was quickly replaced by the APA-47, which updated the Norden continuously.

25|$|The hyperreals can be {{developed}} either axiomatically or by more constructively oriented methods. The essence of the axiomatic approach is to assert (1) the existence {{of at least one}} infinitesimal number, and (2) the validity of the transfer principle. In the following subsection we give a detailed outline of a more constructive <b>approach.</b> <b>This</b> method allows one to construct the hyperreals if given a set-theoretic object called an ultrafilter, but the ultrafilter itself cannot be explicitly constructed.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} driver mount is a {{flat panel}} (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength {{longer than the}} baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation {{from the rear of}} the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can <b>approach</b> <b>this</b> behavior.|$|E
