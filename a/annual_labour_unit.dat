40|$|We {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} effective welfare programme parameters on the labour supply of single female household heads - the primary group of welfare recipients in the USA. Our panel of data {{is derived from the}} US Census Bureau's Current Population Survey for the years 1979 to 1990 inclusive. Behavioural impacts from a range of economic variables are consistent in sign with predictions made by economic theory. We find that effective welfare guarantee levels and the effective tax rate on earned income both significantly decrease labour supply. The marginal effects of these welfare programme parameters are economically small: a US 1000 increase in the expected welfare guarantee level reduces <b>annual</b> <b>labour</b> supply by about 36 hours; a 10 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate on earned income reduces <b>annual</b> <b>labour</b> supply by about 7. 5 hours...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{establish}} midwives’ perception of ethical and professional malpractices in <b>labour</b> <b>units</b> and to enhance the awareness of ethical behaviour and professional practice by midwives. Design: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and cross sectional design was followed to explore the midwives understanding of and experiences of ethical practice and professional malpractices in <b>Labour</b> <b>Units</b> of Tshwane, Gauteng Province. A non-probability purposive sampling was used to draw a sample from midwives with two or more years of experience working in <b>Labour</b> <b>Units.</b> Data collection: Individual in-depth interviews using open ended questions were used to collect data. Interviews were recorded using an audio tape recorder, which was later transcribed verbatim. Data collection was continuous until saturation was reached with the eight (n= 8) participant. Findings: the results of the study revealed that midwives do understand the ethical code of conduct. However, due to challenges such as shortage of staff; shortage of material resources; non-compliance of midwives to policies and guidelines; fear of decision-making; and lack of management support, all this makes ethical conduct more challenging. It is hoped that the findings of this research will make contributions to midwifery training and practice. Health StudiesM. A. (Health Studies...|$|R
