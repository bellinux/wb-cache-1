Although <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four principles have been identified as important: (1) feedforward processing, (2) divergence and convergence, (3) modularity, and (4) plasticity.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the Everglades region for {{thousands}} of years. Within the past 100years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.|$|E

25|$|Historical ecology is a {{research}} program {{that focuses on the}} interactions between humans and their environment over long-term periods of time, typically over the course of centuries. In order to carry out this work, historical ecologists synthesize long-series data collected by practitioners in diverse fields. Rather than concentrating on one specific event, historical ecology aims to study and understand this interaction across both time and space in order to gain <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> its cumulative effects. Through this interplay, humans adapt to and shape the environment, continuously contributing to landscape transformation. Historical ecologists recognize that humans have had world-wide influences, impact landscape in dissimilar ways which increase or decrease species diversity, and that a holistic perspective is critical to be able to understand that system.|$|E

The public failure of the meeting, which {{came to be known as}} the Baldwin–Kennedy meeting, underscored the divide between the needs of Black America and the understanding of Washington politicians. However, the meeting also provoked the Kennedy administration to take action on the civil rights for African-Americans. On June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation—the law which eventually became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That night, Mississippi activist Medgar Evers was murdered in his own driveway, further escalating national tension around the issue of racial inequality.|$|E

The team was in a four-way tie for first place. The Hawks however failed to reach the MCAL Finals. The Hawks were the #6 seed in the NCS playoffs. The Hawks faced the MCAL champions in a NCS playoff game and came away with a convincing 10-3 victory. After a come from behind 11-7 victory in the semi-finals against #2 seeded Miramonte, the Hawks were headed to the NCS Division III championship at the Oakland Coliseum. The Hawks would lose 4-0.

500|$|The cleared, {{underlying}} rock {{foundation of}} the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a grout curtain. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as [...] into the rock, and any cavities encountered were {{to be filled with}} grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit [...] "uplift"—upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due {{to the beginning of the}} concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled. After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the canyon's geology. New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock. It took nine years (1938–47) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain.|$|E
500|$|In his conclusion, Smith states {{his belief}} that modern {{politicians}} and military leaders use force where it has no utility and commit military forces without fully defined political and strategic objectives. He believes that politicians and generals remain in the mindset of industrial war, which leads them {{to prepare for a}} decisive confrontation that never happens, and he condemns them for failing to recognise the shift in the way wars are fought. Discussing humanitarian interventions, such as those in the Balkans, Smith does not argue against intervention, but believes that the intervention must be based on <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the conflict and a clear strategy with defined objectives. According to Smith, [...] "no act of force will ever be decisive" [...] because the aim of modern conflicts is to win the will of the people, which will not be achieved by battlefield victory alone. He argues that whereas, in the industrial war paradigm, war led to victory and thus to peace, in the modern paradigm confrontation leads to conflict, which then reverts to confrontation. He asserts that force {{is only part of the}} solution to modern conflicts; they require complex political and military solutions, which will subdue but not necessarily permanently end the conflict.|$|E
500|$|Ben Krohn Hawkins is {{the protagonist}} in Carnivàle. He begins {{the story as}} a young Oklahoma farmer and chain gang {{fugitive}} who is {{picked up by a}} traveling carnival when his mother dies. Ben has displayed inexplicable healing powers since childhood, and with the beginning of the series, he has begun to suffer dreams and visions of people unknown to him. As Ben learns from staying with the carnival, he seems to be related to Henry Scudder, a man who once worked at the carnival. He also learns that his powers come with a price [...] to give life, he must take life; to raise the dead, he has to deliberately kill someone else. When the beginning of season two makes the mysterious happenings in the carnival clearer, Ben is told to find the preacher of his dreams to prevent an unfolding chain of catastrophic events. Henry Scudder, at this point revealed to be Ben's father, allegedly knows the preacher's name, and after a number of near misses and harrowing encounters, Ben is able to bring Scudder before the carnival's Management. A fight ensues in which Ben is forced to kill Management, leaving him <b>a</b> <b>full</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> his powers.
