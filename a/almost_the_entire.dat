5|$|The castle, and {{an outer}} {{enclosure}} of which little trace remains, originally took up <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> area of Castle Island. The present wooded, and considerably larger, island {{was formed in}} the early 19th century when the canalising of the outflow of the River Leven, which enters the Firth of Forth at the town of Leven, led to a substantial lowering of the water level.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most James Bond films {{featuring}} {{various locations}} around the world, <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> film is set in one country and several minutes are devoted to an elaborate Japanese wedding. This {{is in keeping with}} Fleming's original novel, which also devoted a number of pages to the discussion of Japanese culture. Toho Studios provided soundstages, personnel, and the female Japanese stars to the producers.|$|E

5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise {{was the target of}} <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense anti-aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, {{in a desperate attempt to}} disrupt their attacks. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th Légère, renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> day, and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy {{were used by}} many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E
50|$|Anderton <b>almost</b> missed <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> 1905-06 season too, {{but made}} {{his return to}} the team on 14 April 1906, with four league games remaining. He {{appeared}} in only one more of those four games, however.|$|R

5|$|By the 1990s, Suharto's {{government}} came to {{be dominated}} by civilian politicians such as Habibie, Harmoko, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, and Akbar Tanjung, who owed their position solely to Suharto. As sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> fleet of the disbanded East German Navy in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} {{named the}} peak Skinner Butte, after Alonzo A. Skinner, the Rogue Valley Indian agent between 1851 and 1853.

5|$|Even though Lanley {{succeeds in}} winning over <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> town, his salesmanship fails to {{convince}} Marge, who is {{frustrated with the}} town's purchase because she (correctly) believes the monorail is unsafe and that Lanley is a conman. While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he attend Lanley's institute of monorail conducting, which is a transparent effort to make even more money from the con. Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer at random from among his classmates to be the monorail conductor.|$|E
50|$|Bertoli is a youth {{exponent}} from Brescia Calcio. He {{made his}} debut on 30 August 2014 against Frosinone Calcio in a Serie B game. He <b>almost</b> played <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> game, before being substituted after 89 minutes for Mario Gargiulo.|$|R

5|$|Federer {{began the}} season by {{changing}} rackets {{for the first}} time in his career, from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches. He had long been at a comparative disadvantage in equipment as <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> tour, including his top rivals Nadal and Djokovic, used more powerful frames of between 95 and 100 square inches. At the Australian Open, Federer defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Andy Murray to reach his 11th consecutive semifinal in Melbourne, before losing to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.|$|E
5|$|Former All Black Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain.

They remained in playoff contention for <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> season, sitting 8–4 at one juncture, before slumping under an injury cloud {{at the end of the}} year to finish 8th on the table.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} of the Pakistani Navy and <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Pakistan Naval fleet was based at Karachi Harbour. It is also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, meaning that a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan’s economy. The defence of Karachi harbour was therefore paramount to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes, including cover from strike aircraft based at two airfields in the area.|$|E

This included <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> mintage from 1876 (about 10,000) and created {{one of the}} great American numismatic rarities, the 1876-CC twenty-cent piece. Fewer than two dozen are known; one sold at auction for $564,000 in 2013, making it the record-holder for the denomination. In her 2003 article, numismatist Michele Orzano suggests that the few survivors were souvenirs obtained by visitors to the mint.|$|E
5|$|It occurs along <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> eastern {{coast of}} Australia, from Geelong, Victoria to Proserpine, Queensland. There was an {{isolated}} population on Long Island, Tasmania in 1999, and an 1876 record allegedly from King Island, {{although there has}} been speculation that that specimen was actually collected in the Furneaux Group. The species no longer occurs at any of these Tasmania locations, and has been declared extinct in Tasmania under that state's Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The range of latitude is thus about 20 to 38°S.|$|E
5|$|Obsolescent by the {{beginning}} of World War I, Carlo Alberto was not very active during the war. She spent <b>almost</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> war based in Venice. The ship began conversion into a troop transport there in 1917. This required the removal of her armor, the addition of a new deck and internal modifications to suit her new role. The work was finished in Taranto early the next year; she was recommissioned with the new name of Zenson on 4 April 1918. The ship was discarded on 12 June 1920 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
