40|$|One {{promising}} {{approach for}} building ASR systems for lessresourced languages is cross-lingual adaptation. Tandem ASR is particularly {{well suited to}} such adaptation, as it includes two cascaded modelling steps: feature extraction using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), followed by modelling using a standard HMM. The language-specific tuning can be performed by adjusting the HMM only, leaving the MLP untouched. Here we examine the portability of feature extractor MLPs between an Indo-European (English) and a Finno-Ugric (Hungarian) language. We present experiments which use both conventional phone-posterior and articulatory feature (<b>AF)</b> <b>detector</b> MLPs, both trained on a much larger quantity of (English) data than the monolingual (Hungarian) system. We find that the cross-lingual configurations achieve similar performance to the monolingual system, and that, interestingly, the AF detectors lead to slightly worse performance, despite the expectation {{that they should be}} more language-independent than phone-based MLPs. However, the cross-lingual system outperforms all other configurations when the English phone MLP is adapted on the Hungarian data.

40|$|This study {{describes}} an atrial fibrillation (<b>AF)</b> <b>detector</b> whose structure is well-adapted both for detection of subclinical AF episodes and for implementation in a battery-powered device {{for use in}} continuous long-term monitoring applications. A key aspect for achieving these two properties {{is the use of}} an 8 -beat sliding window, which thus is much shorter than the 128 -beat window used in most existing AF detectors. The building blocks of the proposed detector include ectopic beat filtering, bigeminal suppression, characterization of RR interval irregularity, and signal fusion. With one design parameter, the performance can be tuned to put more emphasis on avoiding false alarms due to non-AF arrhythmias or more emphasis on detecting brief AF episodes. Despite its very simple structure, the results show that the detector performs better on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation database than do existing detectors, with high sensitivity and specificity (97. 1 % and 98. 3 %, respectively). The detector can be implemented with just a few arithmetical operations and does not require a large memory buffer thanks to the short window...|$|E
40|$|As the Internet of Things (IoT) era emerges {{the need}} for {{ultra-low}} power (ULP) devices is becoming more eminent. A research-proven approach to achieve ULP consumption is to aggressively lower the supply voltage (VDD) below or {{in the vicinity of}} the transistor threshold voltage (Vth) and operate the transistors in the subthreshold (sub-Vth) region. Operating below or near the threshold voltage, i. e., near threshold (near-Vth), incurs exponentially degrade performance, however, if tolerable, leads to a more energy efficient operation. In this doctoral thesis memory design for near-Vth and sub-Vth operation is explored using standard-cell based memories (SCMs) where the storage element, which accounts for ∼ 2 / 3 of total memory area, is replaced by a full-custom designed alternative. The designed memories are used in a biomedical circuit for atrial fibrillation detection. Paper I presents an ULP synthesizable memory using commercial standard-cells complemented with a low-leakage full-custom developed D-Latch with integrated 3 -state output buffers as read-logic. Paper II presents two ULP synthesizable memories which use a full-custom developed dual-Vth D-Latch, where PMOS transistors are implemented using a lower-Vth than NMOS transistors. The read-logic is implemented using complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) multiplexers in one of the memories and a mixture of 3 -state buffers and CMOS multiplexers in the second memory. Paper III presents a synthesizable memory using an area-optimized full-custom pass-latch where the pass transistors are implemented using a lower-Vth than the remaining transistors. Paper IV explores the use of a general purpose (GP) process option [instead of low power (LP) ] to achieve a higher maximum frequency at ultra-low voltage (ULV) and presents a coherent summary of the different trade-offs for SCMs, i. e., area, leakage power, access speed, access energy and retention voltage. Paper V presents a wide operating range synthesizable memory designed in a 28 nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) process that takes advantage of the body bias capabilities to compensate for a slow corner using forward body bias (FBB). Paper VI is a case study of an atrial fibrillation (<b>AF)</b> <b>detector</b> designed for sub-Vth operation combined with an ULP memory using standard-cells. The detector is aimed to be operated together with a pacemaker on a single battery charge for 10 years.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an automated real-time atrial fibrillation (AF) detection approach {{that relies on}} the observation of two characteristic irregularities of AF episodes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The results generated after the analysis of these irregularities are subsequently analyzed in real-time using a new fuzzy classifier. We have optimized this novel AF classification framework to require very limited processing, memory storage and energy resources, which makes it able to operate in real-time on a wearable wireless sensor platform. Moreover, our experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed on-line approach shows a similar accuracy to stateof-the-art off-line <b>AF</b> <b>detectors,</b> achieving up to 96 % sensitivity and 93 % specificity. Finally, we present a detailed energy study of each component of the target wearable wireless sensor platform, while executing the automated AF detection approach in a real operating scenario, in order to evaluate the lifetime of the overall system. This study indicates that the lifetime of the platform is increased by using the proposed method to detect AF in real-time and diagnose the patient with respect to a streaming application that sends the raw signal to a central coordinator (e. g., smartphone or laptop) for its ulterior processing.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to present a method based on {{asymmetric}} flow-field-flow-fractionation coupled on-line to a static light scattering (<b>AF</b> 4 -UV-SLS) <b>detector</b> to characterize self-assembled nanofibers (NFs). The method developed herein allows the determination of both the length distribution of the NFs {{as well as the}} distribution in terms of aggregation number per unit length (Agg). Given the remaining synthetic challenges of better controlling the structural homogeneity and particle dimensions, the NF length and aggregation number per unit length are becoming essential for the improvement and control of their chemical processes and a better understanding of their properties. The results obtained with this AF 4 -UV-SLS method indicate that a well-resolved NF length distribution characterization and Agg determination were attained. These results provide critical information concerning the physical properties of the investigated NFs and {{open the door to the}} characterization of new self-assembled polymers with various asymmetrical architectures...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{asymmetrical}} flow field-flow fractionation (AF 4) coupled online with UV, multiangle light scattering (MALS), and fluorescence (FS) <b>detectors</b> (<b>AF</b> 4 -UV-MALS-FS) was employed for separation and characterization of egg yolk plasma. AF 4 provided separation of three major {{components of the}} egg yolk plasma i. e. soluble proteins, low density lipoproteins (LDL) and their aggregates, based on their respective hydrodynamic sizes. Identification of LDL was confirmed by staining the sample with a fluorescent dye, Nile Red. The effect of carrier liquids on aggregation of LDL was investigated. Collected fractions of soluble proteins were characterized using sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Moreover, the effect of heat and enzymatic treatment on egg yolk plasma was investigated. The results suggest that enzymatic treatment with phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) significantly enhances the heat stability of LDL. The results show that AF 4 -UV-MALS-FS is {{a powerful tool for}} the fractionation and characterization of egg yolk plasma components...|$|R
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. It often starts with asymptomatic and short episodes, which are difficult to detect without the assistance of automatic monitoring tools. The vast majority of methods proposed for this purpose are based on quantifying the irregular ventricular response (i. e., RR series) during the arrhythmia. However, although AF totally alters the atrial activity (AA) reflected on the electrocardiogram (ECG), replacing stable P-waves by chaotic and time-variant fibrillatory waves, this information has still not been explored for automated screening of AF. Hence, a pioneering <b>AF</b> <b>detector</b> based on quantifying the variability over time of the AA morphological pattern is here proposed. Results from two public reference databases have proven that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms, reporting accuracy higher than 90 %. A less false positive rate in the presence of other arrhythmias different from AF was also noticed. Finally, the combination of this algorithm with the classical analysis of RR series variability also yielded a promising trade-off between AF accuracy and detection delay. Indeed, this combination provided similar accuracy than RR-based methods, but with a significantly shorter delay of 10 beats...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), {{the most}} frequent cause of cardioembolic stroke, is increasing in prevalence as the population ages, and presents with {{a broad spectrum of}} symptoms and severity. The early identification of AF is an essential part for preventing the possibility of blood clotting and stroke. In this work, a real-time algorithm is proposed for accurately screening AF episodes in electrocardiograms. This method adopts heart rate sequence, and it involves the application of symbolic dynamics and Shannon entropy. Using novel recursive algorithms, a low-computational complexity can be obtained. Four publicly-accessible sets of clinical data (Long-Term AF, MIT-BIH AF, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Databases) were used for assessment. The first database was selected as a training set; the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed, and the best performance was achieved at the threshold of 0. 639 : the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and overall accuracy (ACC) were 96. 14 %, 95. 73 %, 97. 03 % and 95. 97 %, respectively. The other three databases were used for independent testing. Using the obtained decision-making threshold (i. e., 0. 639), for the second set, the obtained parameters were 97. 37 %, 98. 44 %, 97. 89 % and 97. 99 %, respectively; for the third database, these parameters were 97. 83 %, 87. 41 %, 47. 67 % and 88. 51 %, respectively; the Sp was 99. 68 % for the fourth set. The latest methods were also employed for comparison. Collectively, results presented in this study indicate that the combination of symbolic dynamics and Shannon entropy yields a potent <b>AF</b> <b>detector,</b> and suggest this method could be of practical use in both clinical and out-of-clinical settings...|$|E
40|$|Object {{detection}} aims at {{high speed}} and accuracy simultaneously. However, fast models are usually less accurate, while accurate models cannot satisfy our need for speed. A fast model can be 10 times faster but 50 % less accurate than an accurate model. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Feeding (AF) to combine a fast (but less accurate) detector and an accurate (but slow) detector, by adaptively determining whether an image is easy or hard and choosing an appropriate detector for it. In practice, we build a cascade of <b>detectors,</b> including the <b>AF</b> classifier which make the easy vs. hard decision and the two <b>detectors.</b> The <b>AF</b> classifier can be tuned to obtain different tradeoff between speed and accuracy, which has negligible training time and requires no additional training data. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO and Caltech Pedestrian datasets confirm that AF {{has the ability to}} achieve comparable speed as the fast detector and comparable accuracy as the accurate one at the same time. As an example, by combining the fast SSD 300 with the accurate SSD 500 <b>detector,</b> <b>AF</b> leads to 50 % speedup over SSD 500 with the same precision on the VOC 2007 test set.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} methods of starch dissolution {{with the aim}} of finding an optimum method to completely dissolve starch granules to form a molecularly dissolved starch solution without degradation of the polymers. Glycogen was used as a model molecule for amylopectin, to identify the dissolution conditions under which the degradation of the polymers was limited or not present. Dissolution was performed in water with temperatures up to 200 °C, facilitated by the use of heating in an autoclave or a microwave oven, or in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 100 °C. Waxy maize starch was chosen due to its high content of amylopectin and very low content of amylose. The degree of starch dissolution under different conditions was determined enzymatically. The effect of different dissolution conditions on the molar mass and root-mean-square radius of the polymers was determined with asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation coupled to multi-angle light scattering and differential refractive index (<b>AF</b> 4 -MALS-dRI) <b>detectors</b> under aqueous conditions. The results suggest that reliable and accurate size separation and characterization of amylopectin can be obtained by dissolution of starch granules in an aqueous environment at 140 °C by autoclaving or in DMSO at 100 °C. The results also clearly show an upper limit for heat treatment of starch, above which degradation cannot be avoided...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{asymmetrical}} flow field-flow fractionation (AF 4) coupled with UV/Vis, multi-angle light scattering (MALS), and differential refractive index (dRI) <b>detectors</b> (<b>AF</b> 4 -UV-MALS-dRI) was employed {{for analysis of}} glutamate decarboxylase (LbGadB) from Lactobacillus brevis (L. brevis). AF 4 provided molecular weight (MW) (or size) -based separation of dimer, hexamer, and aggregates of LbGadB. The effect of pH on oligomerization of LbGadB was investigated, and then AF 4 results were compared to those from molecular modeling. The MWs measured by AF 4 -UV-MALS-dRI for dimeric and hexameric forms of LbGadB were 110 and 350 kDa, respectively, which are in good agreements with those theoretically calculated (110 and 330 kDa). The molecular sizes determined by AF 4 -UV-MALS-dRI were also in good agreement with those obtained from molecular modeling (6 and 10 nm, respectively, for dimeric and hexameric from AF 4 -UV-MALS-dRI and 6. 4 × 7. 6 and 7. 6 × 13. 1 nm from molecular modeling). The effects of temperature, salt type, and salt concentration on oligomerization of LbGadB were also investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS). It {{was found that the}} hexameric form of LbGadB was most stable at pH 6 and in presence of NaCl or KCl.

If the fire alarm has been enlarged, it was not working. With a fairly large fire conditions would cause confusion for the victim to find a way out. Therefore, this project will provide an information system that makes it a sign of the victim to escape. Singlehop serial communications using RS 485 serial is capable for take data from node either under normal conditions and when there is a fire. This system consists of several nodes that are connected in multidrop. Node with LM 35 temperature sensor, smoke sensor AF- 30, and the water detector will be placed on parts of the building in order to monitor the location of each building. The data collection process undertaken by a sub master after receiving a request from the master. Data received by each node will be collected in advance by the master, and then data will be sent to the server. Master will wait for a response from the server, if within a period of 20 seconds the server does not respond then the master will request back to the sub-master. But if there is a response from the master server sends the response to sub-master for immediate execution. The system implemented is able to provide information solutions with 90 % success rate. Node with LM 35 temperature sensor, smoke sensor AF- 30, and water detector can be used as the information level of the building fire. Inter-node communication system supports data retrieval process by taking in one cycle time of 1. 5 second. The retrieval of data between nodes using a baud rate of 19 200.
