5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for them}} to breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E

Functional residual capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> a maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity. The total lung capacity depends on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres. Females {{tend to have a}} 20â€“25% lower capacity than males. Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons tend to have a larger capacity, and capacity can be increased by physical training as much as 40%.|$|E
5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for fire, for instance, will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> fire much sooner than {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E

25|$|The theory {{suggests}} that an anaerobic cell probably ingested an aerobic bacterium but failed to digest it. The aerobic bacterium flourished within the cell because the cell's cytoplasm was abundant in half-digested food molecules. The bacterium digested these molecules with oxygen and gained great amounts of energy. Because the bacterium had so much energy, it probably leaked some of it as adenosine triphosphate into the cell's cytoplasm. This benefited the anaerobic cell because it was now <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> aerobically, which means more potential for energy gain. Eventually, the aerobic bacterium could no longer live independently from the cell, and it, therefore, became a mitochondrion. The origin of the chloroplast {{is very similar to}} that of the mitochondrion. A cell must have captured a photosynthetic cyanobacterium and failed to digest it. The cyanobacterium thrived in the cell and eventually evolved into the first chloroplast. Other eukaryotic organelles may have also evolved through endosymbiosis; it has been proposed that cilia, flagella, centrioles, and microtubules may have originated from a symbiosis between a Spirochaete bacterium and an early eukaryotic cell, but this is not widely accepted among biologists.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Respiration {{exercises}} {{are an important}} part of the pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients. Furthermore, there is evidence that showing feedback about their respiration pattern helps them <b>to</b> improve their <b>breathing</b> skills. This study tests the feasibility of monitoring respiration using the Wiimote's infrared camera and showing BPM (breaths per minute) as feedback. A summary of the challenges addressed to achieve such a solution can also be found here. METHODS: A prototype was developed in order to study the viability of using the Wiimote <b>to</b> capture the <b>breathing</b> rate for creating applications to provide guidance to patients. RESULTS: The system implemented was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> acquire <b>breathing</b> data and provide feedback to the patient consisting in its breaths per minute. It is a non-invasive, low cost system, composed of a normal computer, a Wiimote, some markers and an infrared illuminator. It is also a comfortable solution without wires, batteries or any kind of electronics, the patients only wear passive markers. DISCUSSION: Despite the system was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> acquire <b>breathing,</b> it has some important limitations. The user has to be as immobile as it can, otherwise the system will fail. Some other issues found are discussed for future work. Although there exist these problems, the prototype had good outcomes when the subjects were resting of their exercise. They presented less than 15 % of maximum error and the RMSE was lower than 6 % in all the tests. This study establishes the basis to develop a Wiimote-based system to acquire respiration signals and present feedback or game-based rehabilitation...|$|R

25|$|Development of {{the mature}} kidney begins between weeks 5 and 7 of gestation. Fetal urine {{production}} begins in early gestation and comprises {{the majority of}} the amniotic fluid {{in the second and third}} trimesters of pregnancy. The fetus continuously swallows amniotic fluid, which is reabsorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and then reintroduced into the amniotic cavity by the kidneys via urination. Oligohydramnios occurs if the volume of amniotic fluid is less than normal for the corresponding period of gestation. The fetal urine is critical to the proper development of the lungs by aiding in the expansion of the airways - alveoli, by means of hydrodynamic pressure and by also supplying proline which is a critical amino acid for lung development. Alveoli are the small sacs in the lungs that exchange oxygen with the blood. If the alveoli, and thereby the lungs, are underdeveloped at the time of birth the infant will not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> air properly and will go into respiratory distress shortly after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs). This is the primary cause of death to Potter sequence infants secondary to renal failure. The fetal urine also serves to cushion the fetus from being compressed by the mother's uterus as it grows.|$|E

Ariel gives Kilala an aquamarine gemstone as token to their friendship, which turns {{out to be one of}} the magic gems to be acquired by the Tiara. Kilala's parents come home from Paradiso after their long absence, only to tell Kilala that the kingdom is under attack and they barely got out.

As a lifelong fan of superheroes, Inaba's aim was to combine traditional Japanese tokusatsu with American comic books. The character designs created by Kumiko Suekane were inspired specifically by 1960s and 1970s Japanese-costumed tokusatsu television shows such as Kamen Rider and Ultraman.
