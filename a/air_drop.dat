He gathered a scratch force of two companies of airborne soldiers and 150 military clerks and moved them in to displace the few Kong Le paras {{left in the}} capital. Kouprasith's men seized the radio station and various strategic points in the town. He announced his allegiance to Souvanna Phouma, and his opposition to Kong Le.

Production reached 61,000 tonnes in 1947. A 4 December 1948 explosion killed fifteen miners. A trial postal <b>air</b> <b>drop</b> took place in 1946, and regular services were provided from 1949. Weather observations were carried out in 1950 to 1953, and again after 1961. The mine flooded on 26 April 1949 and it took half a year to empty it. On 7 January 1951 {{there was an explosion}} in the Ester V Mine, killing nine men.|$|E

On {{the night of}} 1 February, the PAVN mortared the fort's defensive perimeter, then launched a human wave assault that overwhelmed Royalist defenses and almost overran the fort. By 2 February, BV 46 had dwindled to 250 men, and was exhausted {{to the point of}} desertion. With the besieged Royalists unwilling or unable to appear outside walls to repair the perimeter defenses destroyed in the human wave attack, the barbed wire was replenished via air sowing from C-123s. <b>Air</b> <b>drop</b> specialists cut the binding on rolls of wire being flung into the aircraft's slipstream so the wire would unreel; although dropped in irregular patterns, its coils proved suitably obstructive when seeded with aerial area denial ordnance.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{set about}} arming the {{resistance}} and training them in methods of warfare. He had {{been instructed to}} avoid arming the communists where possible, his superiors fearing for their actions after the war, but finding the communists {{to be the most}} organised and well-motivated group in his area proceeded to arm them anyway. He arranged an <b>air</b> <b>drop</b> of arms and explosives, and led the partisans on several railway sabotage expeditions. Clark later recalled that [...] "blowing up railway engines was very great fun". For his work with the partisans he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the third-highest award for gallantry in the Royal Navy. Clark was betrayed and captured by a German patrol in December 1944 whilst trying to hide in a haystack with four partisans.|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} weapons systems are used, {{including}} the M4A5 carbine, HK417, and SR-25 rifles. Sidearms include the USP Tactical and L9A1 Browning High Power. The Heckler and Koch MP5 submachine gun {{is used in}} the counter-terrorist role. Sniper rifles include the Barrett M82A1, AW50F and Blaser Tactical 2. Support weapons include both the Mk48 Maximi Modular and Para Minimi, as well as the MAG 58. Direct and indirect fire support weapons used include 66mm M72 rockets, 84mm M3 MAAWS, FGM-148 Javelins, M2-QCB Browning [...]50 calibre machine guns, Mk 47 Striker grenade launchers, and 81mm mortars. The Long Range Patrol Vehicle will soon be replaced by the Special Operations Vehicle – Commando (SOV-Cdo), based on Supacat's HMT Extenda Mk2, 89 of which are currently being acquired (including several SOV-Logistics variants). The Australian designed Bale Defence Industries lightweight Rough Terrain Vehicle (RTV) is being trialled.

The first Nary was delivered in 2008 {{but due to}} technical problems the vehicles did not enter service until 2011, replacing the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) which had seen extensive service in Afghanistan and Iraq. New SOV-Logistics trucks are being acquired to replace the Mercedes-Benz Unimog for supply, support and recovery of the SOV-SR. A lighter, less protected vehicle, more akin to the LRPV—the Polaris Defense DAGOR (Deployable Advanced Ground Off-road)—was being trialled in 2015. Motorcycles are also used for long range strategic reconnaissance seeing service in Afghanistan. Polaris six-wheel all-terrain vehicles are also used, seeing service in Afghanistan. Heavily modified up-armoured Toyota Land Cruiser four wheel drive vehicles designated SOV-Support are used for domestic counter-terrorism and special recovery. The USMI 11m Naval Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat designated <b>Air</b> <b>Drop</b> Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (ADRHIB) is used for domestic counter-terrorism and special recovery.

500|$|MacArthur {{had flown}} from Japan {{to watch the}} drop from the air, and after observing the landing aboard an American bomber {{accompanied}} {{by a number of}} war correspondents, he subsequently flew to Pyongyang where he announced to the press that the operation had achieved complete surprise. Estimating that 30,000 North Korean troops—perhaps half of those remaining in North Korea—had been caught between the US 187 RCT in the north and the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Division to the south at Pyongyang, he predicted that they would soon be destroyed or captured by the UN advance. Yet, while the <b>air</b> <b>drop</b> itself had been a success, despite MacArthur’s optimistic predictions the operation came too late to intercept any significant North Korean elements and the American landings initially met little resistance. Indeed, most of the North Korean Army had succeeded in withdrawing north, and had crossed the Chongchon River, or {{were in the process of}} doing so, while the government and most important officials had moved to Kanggye in the mountains [...] southeast of Manpojin on the Yalu River. Most of the American and South Korean prisoners had also been moved to more remote parts of North Korea, and were unable to be rescued.|$|E
500|$|The {{first shot}} {{was a test}} of Pendant, a fission bomb boosted with solid lithium hydride {{intended}} as a primary for a thermonuclear bomb. Rather than being dropped from a bomber, this bomb was suspended from a string of four vertically stacked barrage balloons. This was chosen over an <b>air</b> <b>drop</b> because the bomb assembly could not be fitted into a dropable casing, but it introduced a host of problems. A balloon shot had been tried only once before by the British, during Operation Antler at Maralinga in October 1957. William Saxby from Aldermaston was placed {{in charge of the}} balloon crews, who commenced training at RAF Cardington in Bedfordshire in January 1958. Inflating the balloons required 1,200 cylinders of hydrogen gas, and there were no reserves. If another balloon test were required, then the empty cylinders would have to be returned to the United Kingdom for refilling, and then shipped out again. An important consideration was how they could be shot down if they broke loose of their moorings with a live hydrogen bomb. The cargo ship SS Tidecrest arrived at Christmas Island on 20 July, but the firing harness was lost at San Francisco International Airport on 1 August, and a replacement had to be flown out. The Pendant fissile core arrived by air on 12 August, and the weapon was assembled with its external neutron initiator unit. On 22 August 1958 it was lifted [...] in the air, and it detonated at 09:00. The yield was assessed at [...]|$|E
500|$|According to Duff Hart-Davis, the British {{mercenary}} leader Jim Johnson {{had originally}} considered buying their own aircraft, a Lockheed Constellation 749. He then flew to Teheran {{to try to}} persuade the Iranians to do an <b>air</b> <b>drop.</b> Hart-Davis further claims that success was finally achieved by an adviser to the mercenaries, the MP Neil [...] "Billy" [...] McLean, who privately (without the British government's knowledge) flew to Tel Aviv to meet Moshe Dayan, defense minister, and Meir Amit, head of Mossad. According to [...] "Haaretz" [...] newspaper, Tony Boyle contacted David Karon, the head of the Middle East department in the Tevel (Cosmos) section of the Mossad, and met with IAF commander Ezer Weizman and his officers. It was decided that the airdrops would be made. Haaretz suggested the crew of the airdrops were British; while according to Hart-Davis the crew were Israeli (including the pilot named Arieh Oz), with Tony Boyle on board as an observer. Three decades after the war, former Mossad director, Shabtai Shavit, and Ariel Sharon both said Israel had been clandestinely involved in Yemen, though both remained vague concerning the nature and scale of the involvement. The airlifts were originally codenamed [...] "Operation Gravy", but were later renamed [...] "Operation Porcupine". The IAF's largest transport plane, a Stratofreighter, was recruited for the British operation. According to Jones, what is clear however {{is that some of the}} mercenary air drops to the royalists (code-named [...] "Mango") were organized by the British using an aircraft, which were contracted privately from IAF to the British mercenary operation and were either using Israeli air bases or Israeli transport planes themselves making the drops.|$|E

500|$|No. 37 Squadron {{was awarded}} the Gloucester Cup for {{proficiency}} in March 2013. It celebrated its 70th Anniversary on 17July, undertaking a two-ship flight over Sydney and the Blue Mountains. That November, the squadron deployed to the Philippines to participate in humanitarian relief operations {{in the wake of}} Typhoon Haiyan. In August 2014, aircraft from No.37 Squadron based in the Middle East were involved in the airdrop of humanitarian supplies to civilians in Iraq following an offensive by Islamic State forces. The first drop occurred on the night of 13/14August, when one of the squadron's C-130Js took part in a 16-aircraft mission including US C-17s and C-130Hs and a British C-130J that delivered supplies to Yezidi civilians trapped on Mount Sinjar. According to the Australian Department of Defence, it was the RAAF's [...] "most complex operational humanitarian <b>air</b> <b>drop</b> mission in more than a decade". A second drop was conducted to deliver supplies to isolated civilians in the northern Iraqi town of Amirli. By September 2014, the RAAF's C-130Js had accumulated over 100,000 flying hours. Later that month, a C-130J took part in the airlift of arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq; the involvement of RAAF transport aircraft in operations in Iraq is ongoing. From 7 to 10December 2015, a C-130J of No.37 Squadron flying out of Guam joined American and Japanese aircraft in Operation Christmas Drop, a humanitarian aerial supply operation in the west Pacific and Micronesia.
