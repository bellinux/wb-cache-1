40|$|AbstractHow many {{matchings}} on the vertex set V={ 1, 2,…, 2 n} <b>avoid</b> a given {{configuration of}} three edges? Chen, Deng and Du {{have shown that}} the number of matchings that <b>avoid</b> three nesting edges is equal to the number of matchings <b>avoiding</b> three pairwise crossing edges. In this paper, we consider other forbidden configurations of size three. We present a bijection between matchings <b>avoiding</b> three crossing edges and matchings <b>avoiding</b> an edge nested below two crossing edges. This bijection uses non-crossing pairs of Dyck paths of length 2 n as an intermediate step. Apart from that, we give a bijection that maps matchings <b>avoiding</b> two nested edges crossed by a third edge onto the matchings <b>avoiding</b> all configurations from an infinite family M, which contains the configuration consisting of three crossing edges. We use this bijection to show that for matchings of size n> 3, it is easier to <b>avoid</b> three crossing edges than to <b>avoid</b> two nested edges crossed by a third edge. Our results on pattern-avoiding matchings can be regarded as an extension of previous results on pattern-avoiding permutations...|$|R
