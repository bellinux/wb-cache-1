5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau {{had become}} widely {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, {{partly due to}} her role <b>as</b> <b>Mother</b> Superior and {{partly due to the}} endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community.|$|E

It is the second game of the Mother series, {{and the only one}} to be released in the English language until its predecessor was released under the name EarthBound Beginnings in 2015 as part of Wii U's Virtual Console. EarthBound released in Japan in August 1994, and in North America the next June.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Cresswell (c. 1625– c. 1698), {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>Mother</b> Creswell and Madam Cresswell of Clerkenwell, {{was one of}} the most {{successful}} prostitutes and brothel keepers of the English seventeenth century. Starting with houses in Bartholomew Close, in the City of London and St Leonard's, Shoreditch, she built a widespread network of brothels across London, supplied with girls and women from across England. Her employees included the wives of soldiers pressed into service for Charles II and gentlewomen who had supported the Cavalier cause during the English Civil War and had since fallen on hard times. Her bawdy houses were favoured by King Charles and his court as well as powerful figures in government and city guilds. This position gave her a measure of immunity from prosecution and added to her profile as a caricature of iniquity and corruption.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Needham (died 3 May 1731), {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>Mother</b> Needham, was an English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th-century London, {{who has been}} {{identified}} as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first plate of William Hogarth's series of satirical etchings, A Harlot's Progress. Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded of her life, and no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran afoul of the moral reformers of the day and {{died as a result of}} the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to stand in the pillory.|$|E

5|$|In 1533, {{at the age}} of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, {{second son}} of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Throughout his reign, Henry {{excluded}} Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena <b>as</b> <b>mother</b> of the frail fifteen-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine {{played a key role in}} the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life.|$|E
5|$|In April 2003, a Japanese {{television}} advertisement {{revealed that}} both Mother 3 and a combined Mother 1+2 cartridge were in {{development for the}} handheld Game Boy Advance.

It became a bestseller upon its Japanese release in 2006, yet did not receive a North American release {{on the basis that}} it would not sell. Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi stated that he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, <b>as</b> <b>Mother</b> 1, Mother 1+2 and Mother 3 were not released outside Japan. Despite this, Ness's recurrence in the Super Smash Bros. series signaled favorable odds {{for the future of the}} Mother series.|$|E

5|$|The best attested sibling of Heraclius the Younger {{was arguably}} Theodore. Maria, sister of Heraclius the Younger, is {{mentioned}} by Nikephoros I and identified <b>as</b> <b>mother</b> of Martina, whom Heraclius the Younger {{would go on}} to marry. It should be noted, however, that both Kedrenos and Michael the Syrian consider Martina to have been a daughter of an unnamed brother of Heraclius the Younger, thus casting some doubt on the precise relation. Finally, Theophanes briefly mentions another Gregoras as a brother of Heraclius the Younger {{on the occasion of the}} former's death at Heliopolis (modern Baalbek) circa 652/653. This is the only mention of this sibling. Theophanes, however, might have misunderstood the relation between Gregoras and the emperor.|$|E

The new Mother 3 abandoned the Nintendo 64 version's 3D graphics, but kept its plot. The game was developed by Brownie Brown and HAL Laboratory, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan on April 20, 2006, whereupon it became a bestseller.

5|$|They {{may also}} serve as {{religious}} symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: יוֹנָה, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, {{as in the case}} of the common peacock, which is perceived <b>as</b> <b>Mother</b> Earth by the Dravidians of India. In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.|$|E
5|$|During the 1880s, Evans printed two {{to three}} Greenaway books a year, {{including}} a run of 150,000 copies of Kate Greenaway's Birthday Book (1880), as well <b>as</b> <b>Mother</b> Goose (1881), The Language of Flowers (1884), Marigold Garden (1885), The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1887), and King Pepito (1889). From the mid-1880s to the mid-1890s Evans printed, and Greenaway illustrated, nine almanacs—one each year. Greenaway benefitted from her association with Evans. As the leading publisher of children's books, Routledge provided Greenaway with a commercial base she may not have achieved without Evans' influence. Children's literature scholar Anne Lundin claims the distinctive quality of Evans' printing, as wells as his popularity as a children's book printer, linked Greenaway's name with his, thereby increasing her commercial appeal. Greenaway often visited the Evans family, played with their three daughters and continued to visit Evans after his move to Ventnor. During her career as an illustrator, Greenaway used Evans as sole engraver and printer.|$|E
5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act <b>as</b> <b>mother</b> to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E

5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life <b>as</b> <b>mother</b> of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{had wanted}} to cast Sabu Dastagir, a Hollywood star of Indian origin, as Birju. Dastagir {{travelled}} to India from Los Angeles, stayed in a hotel in Mumbai (then known as Bombay) and received a retainer. However, delays and obstacles in beginning shooting and getting a work permit for Dastagir led to his dismissal from the project. Dilip Kumar, an established actor in the Hindi film industry, had originally {{expressed an interest in}} playing Birju, which Khan found agreeable; Dilip Kumar agreed to play Shamu as well. However, Nargis objected that the public would not accept their casting <b>as</b> <b>mother</b> and son because she had done several romantic films alongside him. Sunil Dutt—with the experience of just one film—was finally cast, after Mukri, a comedian in the film, introduced him to Khan. Sajid Khan, the actor who portrayed the young Birju, was unknown at the time, and was from a poor family from the Mumbai slums. Sajid's salary in the film was 750. He was later adopted by Mehboob Khan. Subsequently, Raaj Kumar was cast as Shamu and Rajendra Kumar as Ramu. Mother India was the first successful film and {{a turning point in the}} careers of Dutt, Raaj Kumar and Rajendra Kumar.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people of}} the Carnivàle are closely related. Apollonia and Sofie are {{introduced}} <b>as</b> <b>mother</b> and daughter working as fortunetellers. Sofie grew up not knowing her father, but has {{a vision of the}} Tattooed Man raping her mother later in the first season. In the season 2 opening episode, Management, the mysterious leader of the carnival, reveals himself as Lucius Belyakov, the Russian soldier of Ben's dreams. Moments before his death several episodes later, Belyakov learns that his son Alexei (Brother Justin) did not die in a train accident, as he had previously believed. In the meantime, Sofie has become the Crowes' maid. When she has a chat with Iris about her childhood, Iris has a vision of Brother Justin as a young man raping Apollonia during his seminary studies in Saint Paul. Although Iris only informs Norman of her suspicions, Sofie sees Brother Justin's tattooed chest in the final episode of season 2 and has implicit visions insinuating Brother Justin as her father. Future seasons of Carnivàle would have expanded the Belyakov genealogy, making a fusion with the Scudder genealogy possible.|$|E

40|$|Mental health {{research}} across {{the discipline of}} psychology has been extensive. Much research relating to motherhood has focussed on {{the mental health of}} mothers and increasingly on the impact of this upon the welfare of children. The focus in this study was on the narratives of these children when they themselves become mothers. The aim was to gain qualitative insight into these women’s experiences of mothering, and the role that they considered that their own childhood might play in their experiences <b>as</b> <b>mothers.</b> This qualitative study used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to explore the experiences of nine mothers at various stages of their motherhood journey, who had experienced the ‘enduring mental health difficulties’ (EMHD) of their own mothers in their childhoods. The IPA analysis of semi-structured interviews revealed a complex interplay of themes. Narratives evolved across a natural timeline in which participants discussed their own journey <b>as</b> a <b>mother</b> over four main themes. They offered context from their childhood and also pre-pregnancy thought and experience, and presented their current sense of themselves <b>as</b> <b>mothers</b> and their reflections of their journey. This research offers further insights into some of the possible experiences and difficulties these daughters might face <b>as</b> <b>mothers.</b> It suggests that they may be particularly at risk of exhaustion and ensuing mental health issues, perhaps less because of the genetic factors that may be present, but more because of their desperation, in a global sense, to undo, or not to repeat their childhood experiences for their own children. Further research is needed not only into their struggles but into their incredible strengths <b>as</b> <b>mothers,</b> so that those to whom this research is most poignant can take inspiration from further accounts, and both therapists and society can best support daughters with this lived experience as children, as adults, and potentially <b>as</b> <b>mothers...</b>|$|R
