40|$|Medicines have adverse effects, but {{sometimes}} {{these are only}} identified when the product is already in use. Pharmacovigiliance, i. e. the monitoring of the safety of medicines and taking action to reduce risk and increase benefit, is therefore of tremendous importance. In the project "Assessment of the European Community System of Pharmacovigilance", which {{was funded by the}} European Commission, it was empirically studied how well the national medicines agencies, the European Medicines Agency <b>and</b> marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>holders</b> collaborate to improve the safety of medicines.

40|$|The current {{implementation}} of post market environmental monitoring (PMEM) requires improvement. Monitoring possible changes {{due to the}} cultivation of genetically modified plants is highly important to protect our environment. The obligatory pre-release risk assessment of GMO products might not address all open questions and possible effects, due for instance {{to the complexity of}} receiving environments. Post market environmental monitoring (PMEM) (see figure) of GMO-induced changes is therefore crucial {{for the protection of the}} environment and mandatory in most European countries. However, the currently implemented PMEM plans do not meet the standards set by legal bases and existing guidelines, and need substantial improvement. PMEM must be appropriate to monitor environmental impacts of GMO. To achieve this goal, scientifically sound PMEM based on reliable data should be implemented in all receiving environments that might be affected by GM plants. The monitoring design, sampling methodology and data analysis have to comply with fundamental quality criteria like correctness, comparability <b>and</b> reproducibility. <b>Authorisation</b> <b>holders</b> as well as developers of PMEM guidelines need to consider all relevant protection goals (biodiversity, water and soil) in order to warrant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} several years, a number of design {{approaches}} in wireless mesh networks have been introduced to support the deployment of wireless mesh networks (WMNs). We introduce a novel wireless mesh architecture that supports authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> functionalities, giving {{the possibility of a}} seamless WMN integration into the home’s organization authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> infrastructure. First, we introduce a novel authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> mechanism for wireless mesh nodes. The mechanism is de-signed upon an existing federated access control approach, i. e. the AAI infrastructure that is using just the credentials at the user’s home organization in a federation. Second, we demonstrate how authentication <b>and</b> <b>authorisation</b> for end users is implemented by using an existing web-based captive portal approach. Finally, we observe {{the difference between the two}} and explain in detail the process flow of authorized access to network resources in wireless mesh networks. The goal of our wireless mesh architecture is to enable easy broadband network access to researchers at remote locations, giving them additional advantage of a secure access to their measurements, irrespective of their location. It also provides an important basis for the real-life deployment of wireless mesh networks for the support of environmental research.
