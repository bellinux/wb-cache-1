40|$|When the {{position}} of a test mass in one dimension is measured with picometer accuracy, angular <b>alignment</b> <b>jitter</b> inevitably couples noise into the measurement. We present recent sensitivity measurements of the LISA technology package interferometer with articulated mirrors as test masses, actuated by piezo-electric transducers. The required longitudinal displacement resolution of 9 pm/√(Hz) above 3 mHz has been demonstrated with an angular noise that corresponds to the expected for on-orbit operation. The excess noise contribution of this test mass jitter onto the sensitive displacement readout was completely subtracted by fitting the angular interferometric data streams to the longitudinal displacement measurement. Thus, this cross-coupling constitutes no limitation to the required performance of the LISA technology package interferometry...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a detailed study {{of the performance of}} superlattice avalanche photodiodes (SAPDs) and the implications for high bit rate direct-detection optical fibre communication systems. In these advanced detectors the electron to hole ionisation rate ratio is artificially enhanced through selective heating of the electron distribution to reduce the excess noise associated with the randomness of the avalanche multiplication and to ensure high gain-bandwidth product. Thus SAPDs are suitable for long wavelength applications (1. 3 - 1. 6 pm) where most compound semiconductor materials otherwise have comparable electron and hole ionisation rates. A comprehensive discrete ionisation model is developed to assess the performance of SAPDs; emphasis being placed on the gain, excess noise factor, gain moment generating function (MGF), and gain-bandwidth product. The model is quite flexible and it is found that other device impairments such as dark current and the number of ionisations per stage caused by the injected carrier can be readily incorporated into the formulation. The performance of optical receivers employing SAPDs is examined using a Gaussian approximation (GA) and taking into account the influence of various device impairments. To assess the accuracy of GA a rigorous statistical analysis is developed using a MGF formulation. New signal designs for optical communications devised specifically for APD receivers are described. These signals achieve simultaneously both zero intersymbol interference and zero telegraph distortion with respect to a depressed optimum threshold and are thus well suited to untimed transmission. Importantly, they also offer improved tolerance to <b>alignment</b> <b>jitter</b> when they used in conventional fully retimed receivers...|$|E
40|$|A new CLIC Test Facility (CTF 3) at CERN {{will serve}} {{to study the}} drive beam {{generation}} for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). CTF 3 has to accelerate a 3 : 5 A electron beam in almost fully-loaded structures. The pulse contains more than 2000 bunches, one in every second RF bucket, and has a length {{of more than one}} s. Different options for the lattice of the drive-beam accelerator are presented, based on FODO-cells and triplets as well as solenoids. The transverse stability is simulated, including the effects of beam <b>jitter,</b> <b>alignment</b> and beam-based correction. ...|$|R

40|$|The Clementine {{spacecraft}} {{was developed}} to demonstrate the performance of BMDO 2 ̆ 7 s lightweight sensor suite. The suite consisted of five different sensors (Star Trackers, UV/Vis, HiRes, NIR, LWIR) and a UDAR (Laser Impulse Detection And Ranging) system. The worst-case sensor operating requirements for the Clementine mission were: interface temperature with - 20 to 2 ° C, alignment to +/- 100 µRad, and jitter kept below 40 Rad in 40 msec. The average hear dissipation of the suite was over 100 Watts while operating {{for two of the}} five hour lunar orbit. To accomplish the mission the sensor suite was integrated onto a single-substrate sensor bench within the spacecraft. The bench met the stringent thermal, <b>alignment,</b> and <b>jitter</b> requirements of the sensors, and concurrently isolated the sensors from outside spacecraft contamination, as well as thermal and structural flexure. Also taken into account were the mission design drivers of hot thermal environment in lunar orbit, limited volume in the spacecraft, minimal weight, limited budget, and a six month schedule from concept to delivery of a flight bench. The design and development of the sensor bench will be discussed. Three different types of heat pipes were used to transport the heat of the sensors to radiators located {{on the side of the}} spacecraft. A beryllium metal block was used as a thermal capacitor during peak heat loads. Thermal straps connected sensors to heat pipes to keep thermal gradients as little as 3 ° C per inch across the interface. The bench was fastened in a quasi-kinematic fashion to eliminate the transfer of spacecraft structural loads and thermal flexing, and yet was rigid enough to keep alignment through launch. The bench substrate itself was made out of aluminum honeycomb. The alignment mechanism consisted of a nut-on-nut method to attain and keep the 100 µRad requirement. Volume and alignment constraints dictated sensor location on the bench. Development of the bench involved rigorous testing to insure requirements were met. These tests involved development alignment checks, vibration testing at the sensor bench level, system level qual vibes and TDVT, system level jitter testing, as well as the flight system vibe, TV AC and functional. Lessons learned will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimated}} the sensitivity for detecting {{a row of}} collinear target elements (usually dots) by measuring the maximum density of randomly positioned noise elements that allowed 75 % correct detection of the orientation of alignment (binary choice: horizontal versus vertical) of the target elements. We varied the number of target elements, their mode of generation, and their accuracy of positioning. As reported previously (Moulden (1994) Higher-order processing in the 6 isual system. Ciba Foundation Symposium 184. Chichester: Wiley), target detection improved rapidly until the number of target elements reached about seven, and then improved more slowly beyond this point. However, this break was reduced (and often removed entirely) when the target array was formed by repositioning pre-existing noise elements lying close to the target location, rather than by superimposition of additional target elements onto the noise array. This almost linear slope of improvement, coupled with the observation that target detection was disrupted more by random jitter of target elements {{at right angles to}} their axis of <b>alignment</b> than by <b>jittering</b> along this axis, argues against a two-stage process of perceptual grouping (Moulden, 1994) and supports instead an explanation based on the operation of a single mechanism. This single mechanism explanation is further supported by the observation that intrinsic positional uncertainty (estimated from the results of jitter experiments) was independent of target element number. Additional experiments showed that target detection is facilitated by aperiodic noise dots that fall close to the target axis. Th...|$|R
