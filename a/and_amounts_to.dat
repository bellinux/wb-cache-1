The flooding, which exceeds the 100-year flood return period, kills two and causes record-breaking river levels across the state. Hundreds of roads, railroad lines, and bridges are closed or destroyed, trapping dozens due to flooded vehicles. The winds uproot hundreds of trees, leaving 25,000 homes and businesses without power for 3days. Floyd damages 171 homes, 44 severely, and destroys 33 in New Castle County.
