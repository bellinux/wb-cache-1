In this program the multipole-mixing ratio parameter, A, for the mixed multipole transition in the cascade is varied and the theoretical correlation is calculated for one hundred fifty-seven values of the mixing ratio for each trial spin sequence. The normalized chi-square test, Q 2, is used to compare the theoretical and experimental results. The study of the effect of the multipole-mixing ratio and the <b>attenuation</b> <b>factors</b> on gamma-gamma directional correlation shapes has been investigated forsequence sets. The study has been separated into two parts: first, the effect of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>factors</b> when the multipole-mixing ratio is fixed; second, the effect of the multipole-mixing ratio for fixed <b>attenuation</b> <b>factors.</b> The results show the smoothing effect of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>factors</b> on the correlation function and it is illustrated graphically.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Noise induced {{hearing loss}} {{is a subject}} of growing concern. Over the past 15 years, several {{well-documented}} studies have been completed which express the relationships between industrial noise exposure and damage to normal and pathological ears. This research has provided knowledge of considerable importance to developing successful hearing conservation programs. Many studies have presented the necessity of proper use of personal hearing protection devices. However, the accuracy of procedures for testing hearing protection devices remains questionable. The {{purpose of this study}} was to document a need for increased research on hearing conservation and offer additional information which may help in developing more accurate testing procedures for personal hearing protection devices. The question investigated in this study was: Can the <b>attenuation</b> <b>factors</b> of personal hearing protection devices be measured with probe-ear microphone measurement instruments, with the same accuracy as the present accepted method ANSI standard (ANSI S 3. 19 - 1974) ? The test procedure used three insert type personal hearing protection devices on 15 human subjects (30 ears), ages 18 - 41. Each subject was tested with both the subjective test method and the objective test method for each of the three types of hearing protection used. Data collected for each test method was then compared with group mean, as well as the manufacturer's published specifications, to compare accuracy between test methods. This study determined that the present ANSI S 3 - 1974, subjective test method, provided results which were closer to the manufacturer's published <b>attenuation</b> <b>factors</b> than that data which was recorded using the objective probe-ear microphone instrument. It was noted, even though the mean <b>attenuation</b> <b>factors</b> for the objective test method, that were considerably lower than that of the subjective method, that the overall consistency of data appeared to be more accurate using the objective method. It is recommended that further studies be conducted to provide a better procedure for using the probe-ear microphone evaluation for measuring the <b>attenuation</b> <b>factors</b> of personal hearing protection devices...|$|R
