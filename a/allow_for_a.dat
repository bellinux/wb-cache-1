Of the three, Cray was normally least aggressive on the last; his designs tended to use components that were already in widespread use, as opposed to leading-edge designs.|$|E

The budget did not <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain {{worked together to}} plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E

Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E

They would also travel to the Swiss village of Neuchâtel, to visit the family of her daughter's governess. Contradicting her vow of eternal anonymity, she suggested a meeting. Balzac agreed immediately, and began to make preparations for the journey. Also, sometime in 1833, Balzac wrote his first confession of love to her, despite being at that time in another relationship.|$|E

He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as to <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as possible {{so that they could}} be close to the nearby captured airfields around Dobodura, where they would not be subject to the vagaries of weather over the Owen Stanley Range. Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait. Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February.|$|E
5|$|King Thomas, {{raised as}} a member of the Bosnian Church, {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in c. 1445; Stephen Tomašević later stated that he had been baptized into the Roman Catholic Church as a child, and that he had been taught Latin letters. At about that time, likely in order to <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> peaceful solution to his protracted war with the magnate Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, King Thomas requested from Pope Eugene IV an annulment of his union with Stephen's mother. Open warfare ended in 1446 with the marriage of Stephen's father to Kosača's daughter Catherine, by whom Stephen had a half-brother named Sigismund and a half-sister named Catherine.|$|E

5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life.

Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E
