The research findings show that there is a significant degree of discrepancies between the results of learning of the two classes. The level of significance ^ 0; = 0. 05 with a degree of independence of 66 yields a ttest greater than the ttable (5. 4418 > 2. 000).

50|$|In {{addition}} to greater accuracy {{and ease of}} use, Decca was also more suitable for use over land. Delays due to refraction can {{have a significant effect}} on pulse timing, but much less so for phase changes. Decca thus found itself in great demand for helicopter use, where runway <b>approach</b> <b>aids</b> like ILS and VOR were not suitable for the small airfields and essentially random locations the aircraft were used. One serious disadvantage to Decca was that it was susceptible to noise, especially from lightning. This was not a serious concern for ships, who could afford to wait out storms, but made it unsuitable for long-range air navigation where time was of the essence. Several versions of Decca were introduced for this role, notably DECTRA and DELRAC, but these did not see widespread use.|$|E

In 1946, PDS was disbanded and a successor organisation, the Radio Introduction Branch (RIB), was formed at RAF Medmenham.
