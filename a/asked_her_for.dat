5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> her hand, {{he told her he}} wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it was}} on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{spent the}} rest of her life in Normandy, often acting as Henry's {{representative}} and presiding over the government of the Duchy. Early on, Matilda and her son issued charters in England and Normandy in their joint names, dealing with the various land claims that had arisen during the wars. Particularly in the initial years of his reign, the King drew on her for advice on policy matters. Matilda was involved in attempts to mediate between Henry and his Chancellor Thomas Becket when the two men fell out in the 1160s. Matilda had originally cautioned against the appointment, but when the Prior of Mont St Jacques <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> a private interview on Becket's behalf to seek her views, she provided a moderate perspective on the problem. Matilda explained that she disagreed with Henry's attempts to codify English customs, which Becket was opposed to, but also condemned poor administration in the English Church and Becket's own headstrong behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{is still}} in a dilemma in who to choose from between CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) and his high school {{sweetheart}} Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore). Avery decides not to be Jack's date to Cerie's wedding, and that while she is gone, Jack should think about whether or not he wants to be with her. As soon as Avery leaves, Nancy shows up at the 30 Rock building unannounced, and decides to spend the weekend with Jack. Liz tries {{to talk him out of}} going on a date with Nancy, after he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> advice. He decides to keep things platonic with Nancy, so that no problem ensues in his decision to choose between them, but Jack ends up sleeping with Nancy. The next morning, Nancy admits that the two spending the night together was a big deal, as Jack was the first man she slept with after her divorce. At Floyd's wedding, Jack tells Nancy about Avery, and as a result, Nancy threatens to leave him forever once the ceremony is over. While Liz gives a reading, Jack texts her to stall, resulting in Liz reading inappropriate scripture recitations at the wedding.|$|E

25|$|Many abbots and abbesses <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> {{prayers and}} {{opinions}} on various matters. She traveled widely during her four preaching tours. She had several fanatical followers, including Guibert of Gembloux, who {{wrote to her}} frequently and became her secretary after Volmar's death in 1173. Hildegard also influenced several monastic women, exchanging letters with Elisabeth of Schönau, a nearby visionary.|$|E

He was <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> a sign, any kind of sign,--ten years in the Soudan entitles them to a sign,--and Zena was plucking a white rose, just one, from her hair, when she would hear her father's step on the piazza and make a grab for the Pioneers of Tecumseh Township, and start reading it like mad.|$|R

25|$|At {{the onset}} of puberty, Chikatilo {{discovered}} that he suffered from chronic impotence, worsening his social awkwardness and self-hatred. He was shy {{in the company of}} women; his first crush, at age 17, had been on a girl named Lilya Barysheva, with whom he had become acquainted through his school newspaper, yet he was chronically nervous in her company and never <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> a date. The same year, Chikatilo jumped upon an 11-year-old friend of his younger sister and wrestled her to the ground, ejaculating as the girl struggled in his grasp.|$|E
25|$|Only 20 {{minutes after}} escaping, Straffen came up a private drive in Crowthorne and {{approached}} Mrs. Doris Spencer, {{who was in}} her garden. He <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> a drink of water, which she gave him and then discussed the proximity of Broadmoor {{and the likelihood of}} escapes. After 10 minutes, he left. An hour and a half later, he reached Farley Hill, and at about five o'clock, Straffen came to the point where 5-year-old Linda Bowyer was riding her bicycle around the village. Within half an hour, Bowyer was dead.|$|E

25|$|By May 2011, {{the police}} had put up wanted posters seeking {{information}} about Jaishankar, in public places across Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. On the night of 4 May 2011, Jaishankar reached Elagi village in Karnataka, on a stolen motorcycle. He approached a woman, Chandrakala Hotagi, who was working alone in a field, and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> water and food. He then tried to rape her, but Chandrakala raised the alarm. Her husband Prakash Hotagi and a friend came to her rescue. Jaishankar tried to flee, but was caught by Prakash and other villagers. The locals {{brought him to the}} Zalaki police station. He was handed over to the Chitradurga police on 5 May 2011.|$|E
500|$|Following Jackson's death, {{reports of}} {{his use of}} {{pethidine}} (Demerol) surfaced. Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> unspecified [...] "products for sleep." [...] On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, [...] "Michael, {{the only problem with}} you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not going to wake up." [...] Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe. He did not name the doctor. [...] An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E
500|$|When Lisa Edelstein (Dr. Cuddy) heard {{she had to}} do a strip {{scene in}} the episode, she called actress Sheila Kelley, wife of Richard Schiff (with whom Edelstein had worked {{previously}} on The West Wing and Relativity). Kelley had worked on a movie about strippers long ago and Edelstein <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> her advice on the choreography of the striptease. On the episode itself, Edelstein commented: [...] "It is very interesting what happens {{in the first half of}} the finale in terms of learning about how House sees people and getting the world from his point of view entirely". Before the filming of the scene started, Edelstein showed the dance to Hugh Laurie, who, according to Edelstein, was [...] "incredibly supportive, like a cheerleader". Edelstein commented that after the scene was filmed she, [...] "felt beautiful, and it ended up being a really lovely experience".|$|E

500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just knew that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.' I always thought that was a nice way to say, 'Once more.|$|E
500|$|Morgan {{admitted}} giving Figard a lift on {{the afternoon}} of 19 December 1995. He claimed that the pair had consensual sex after chatting and flirting, developing a rapport and halting at a lay-by where he made her a cup of tea and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> what he described as a [...] "Christmas kiss". He said afterwards he drove her to Southampton, where they exchanged contact details before he left her, and that she was [...] "smiling and happy". He did not come forward after police appealed for details of the driver who had given her a lift because he did not want his wife to learn of his infidelity. He claimed her photographs and other belongings were in his possession because she had left them in his truck, and the mattress had become stained with blood because a man had lain on it after gashing his leg while the vehicle was on loan to another driver in 1994.|$|E
500|$|The song {{itself was}} {{recorded}} at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles. In {{an interview with}} Noisey, Oh Land spoke with Kim Taylor Bennett who <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> further clarification on the lyrics. Bennett interpreted the lyrics as a [...] "girl who is perhaps incapable of love and commitment" [...] {{but by the end}} of the song, it is revealed that [...] "it's the guy who is the asshole", to which Oh Land confirmed and said, [...] "Yeah, so it's like, 'fuck you!'". She also described it as a song that [...] "fast-forwards a bit" [...] and inspires her because she believes that she [...] "will do everything better when [...] get older". Oh Land discusses loving someone to a deeper extent as she ages: [...] "I will wrap my arms around you and keep you from the cold / I will love you better when I'm old". Several music critics described [...] "Love You Better" [...] as a ballad. The Guardians Paul MacInnes called the song an [...] "acoustic ballad", while Leonie Cooper from NME felt it was a [...] "folk ballad".|$|E

500|$|When a {{majority}} of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would {{be in charge of the}} deed; she of the word. Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes. Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), she mused: [...] "She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?" [...] Once on the street, she caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have [...] "the knack," [...] and told her to quit the business. She was [...] "too astounded for speech". She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> fifteen dollars.|$|E
500|$|Thus began {{a bitter}} {{dispute between the}} two, {{involving}} many of their friends and Veronica's own sister. Lucan again began to watch his wife's movements. He recorded some of their telephone conversations with a small Sony tape recorder and played excerpts to any friends prepared to listen; he also told them—and his bank manager—that Lady Lucan had been [...] "spending money like water". He continued to pay her £40 a week and may have cancelled their regular food order with Harrods. He delayed payment to the milkman and—knowing that Veronica was required by the court to employ a live-in nanny—the childcare agency. With no income of her own, Veronica took a part-time job in a local hospital. A temporary nanny, Elizabeth Murphy, was befriended by Lucan, who bought her drinks and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> information on his wife. He instructed his detective agency to investigate Murphy, looking for evidence that she was failing in her duty of care to his children. This they found; he dispensed with the detective agency's services when they presented him with bills amounting to several hundred pounds. Murphy was later hospitalised with cancer. Another temporary nanny, Christabel Martin, reported strange telephone calls to the house, some with heavy breathing and some from a man asking for non-existent people. Following a series of temporary nannies, Sandra Rivett started work in late 1974.|$|E
500|$|The Constitution was not adopted without {{dissent in}} the Commonwealth itself, either. Magnates who had opposed the {{constitution}} draft from the start, namely Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, Seweryn Rzewuski, and Szymon and Józef Kossakowski, asked Tsarina Catherine {{to intervene and}} restore their privileges such as the Russian-guaranteed Cardinal Laws abolished under the new statute. To that end these magnates formed the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation's proclamation, prepared in St. Petersburg in January 1792, criticized the constitution for contributing to, in their own words, [...] "contagion of democratic ideas" [...] following [...] "the fatal examples set in Paris". It asserted that [...] "The parliament... has broken all fundamental laws, swept away all liberties of the gentry and on the third of May 1791 turned into a revolution and a conspiracy." [...] The Confederates declared an intention to overcome this revolution. We [...] "can do nothing but turn trustingly to Tsarina Catherine, a distinguished and fair empress, our neighboring friend and ally", who [...] "respects the nation's need for well-being and always offers it a helping hand", they wrote. The Confederates aligned with Tsarina Catherine and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>for</b> military intervention. On 18 May 1792 Russian ambassador to Poland, Yakov Bulgakov, delivered {{a declaration of war}} to the Polish Foreign Minister Joachim Chreptowicz. Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania on the same day, starting the war.|$|E
