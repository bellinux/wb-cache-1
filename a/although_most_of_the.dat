5|$|All in all, the Soviet period saw a {{significant}} increase in population (799,000 in 1970 vs. 15,000 in 1913), <b>although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the railroads and the sea coast. Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the urbanized areas were used for deer herding. In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character's {{specifications}} {{could be}} customized, some elements {{were to be}} determined by the game's two character types, Legendary and Dreaded.

Each character type had unique features that shaped the way the game was experienced, including how the environment and non-playable characters interacted with the player.|$|E

5|$|It is salient to {{note that}} in {{taxonomy}} and binomial nomenclature, the genus name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is Progne, a Latinized form of Procne.

Coincidentally, <b>although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depictions of the nightingale and its song in art and literature are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine {{had said}} that {{thirteen}} songs had been written in the sessions for the album, though only twelve were originally contracted for the album (one of which being a bonus track intended only for the Japanese market).

The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{publication of}} Theory of Literature consists of twenty chapters set in five sections based on thematic similarities; one chapter and section was removed in later editions.
