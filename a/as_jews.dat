5|$|His {{father was}} by all {{accounts}} a cold and jealous man. Both parents were Jewish, but decided against raising the boys <b>as</b> <b>Jews.</b> Reich and his brother, Robert, were brought up to speak only German, were punished for using Yiddish expressions and forbidden from playing with the local Yiddish-speaking children.|$|E
5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status <b>as</b> <b>Jews.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rademacher {{envisioned the}} {{founding}} of a European bank that would ultimately liquidate all European Jewish assets {{to pay for the}} plan. This bank would then play an intermediary role between Madagascar {{and the rest of the}} world, <b>as</b> <b>Jews</b> would not be allowed to interact financially with outsiders.

5|$|The Germans invaded Hungary on Sunday, 19 March 1944, meeting no resistance. Following Hungary's {{annexation}} in 1941 {{of parts}} of Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, there were 725,000 Jews in the country, as well as over 60,000 Jewish converts to Christianity and others the Nazis counted <b>as</b> <b>Jews,</b> according to Yehuda Bauer. Most were liberal Jews and fully assimilated, nearly 30 percent were Orthodox, and a small minority were Zionists.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{immigration}} to Puerto Rico {{began in the}} 15th century {{with the arrival of}} the anusim (variously called conversos, Crypto-Jews, Secret Jews or marranos) who accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second voyage. An open Jewish community did not flourish in the colony because Judaism was prohibited by the Spanish Inquisition. However, many migrated to mountainous parts of the island, far from the central power of San Juan, and continued to self-identify <b>as</b> <b>Jews</b> and practice Crypto-Judaism.|$|E
5|$|The Nuremberg Laws had a {{crippling}} {{economic and social}} impact on the Jewish community. Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed {{due to lack of}} customers. <b>As</b> <b>Jews</b> were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, <b>as</b> <b>Jews</b> were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 it was almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the Madagascar Plan proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann did {{not make}} policy, but acted in an {{operational}} capacity. Specific deportation orders came from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Eichmann's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area, organising the seizure of their property, and arranging for and scheduling trains. His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office, <b>as</b> <b>Jews</b> of conquered nations such as France could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths. Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members {{working in the field}} and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos. His wife, who disliked Berlin, resided in Prague with the children. Eichmann initially visited them weekly, but as time went on, his visits tapered off to once a month.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Ministry {{estimated}} {{there were}} 750,000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 (studies done {{after the war}} put the number of Mischlinge at around 200,000). <b>As</b> <b>Jews</b> {{became more and more}} excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own. Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed. Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.|$|E
5|$|The Umayyads were {{followed}} by the Abbasid dynasty which came to power {{with the help of}} Iranian Muslims. The persecution of Zoroastrians increased significantly under the Abbasids, temples and sacred-fire shrines were destroyed. Also during Abbasid rule, the status of Zoroastrians in Persian lands was reduced from zimmi (or dhimmi, people who were protected by the state and generally considered 'People of the Book') to 'kafirs' (non-believers). As a result, Zoroastrians were not granted the same rights and status <b>as</b> <b>Jews</b> and Christians. Iranian Muslims were welcomed to the court, but not Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians were denied access to bathhouses on the grounds that their bodies were polluted.|$|E

5|$|The congregation's {{membership}} was in {{the thousands}} in the 1940s, but by the early 2000s had declined to around 40, <b>as</b> <b>Jews</b> {{moved out of the}} Lower East Side.

In January 2006, the synagogue's roof collapsed, and the building was demolished two months later.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{differences}} and tensions {{could make it}} difficult to design inclusive war memorials. In US, {{the separation of church and}} state meant that crosses were discouraged. Despite being banned from onwards 1905, many French monuments were explicitly Catholic in character, including a Catholic cross. Australia also minimised the use of crosses, partially for similar reasons, but also because over concerns about excluding their Jewish community. Decisions to incorporate Christian imagery into memorials in Britain could also exclude minority groups, such <b>as</b> <b>Jews,</b> from participating in a memorial. In Britain, the religious differences between Anglicans, Nonconformists and Roman Catholics were frequently played out at a local level in arguments over the location and symbolism to be used in memorials. In Canada, where these differences were overlaid across the English and French speaking national divide, war memorials attempted to reunify the country; the Cross of Sacrifice memorial in Montreal, for example, was deliberately situated in between the Catholic and Protestant war cemeteries. This was only partially successful – inauguration ceremony and the military parade resulted in shouted arguments between French and English speaking parts of the crowd.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{many of the}} Bnei Menashe started {{studying}} normative Judaism. Hundreds emigrated to Israel, some completing the required formal conversions there to be accepted <b>as</b> <b>Jews.</b> Critics thought the government's policy of settling the Bnei Menashe immigrants in the unstable Judea, Samaria and Gaza Strip {{was part of a}} recruiting campaign to help increase Israel's population. Others criticised these people as economic migrants, and not true Jews. In 2005, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel accepted them <b>as</b> <b>Jews</b> due to the devotion displayed by their practice through the decades, but still required formal ritual conversion to be accepted <b>as</b> <b>Jews.</b> Later that year, Israel began to refuse to issue visas to these peoples after India objected to Israeli teams entering the northeast states to perform mass conversions and arrange aliyah.|$|E
