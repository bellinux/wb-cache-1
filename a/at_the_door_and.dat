5|$|Katy {{has been}} hired {{to take care of}} Hector and Tabitha's mansion while the two go out for the evening. They usually never leave the house, but have a rare event to attend. Tabitha greets Katy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{explains}} that the house is always kept at −3°C as Hector and Tabitha's disabled brother, Andras, needs the air to be at this temperature. The paintings on the house's walls depict the Harrowing of Hell. After meeting Hector, Katy is disturbed by Tabitha's descriptions of Andras, who, it is claimed, does not have a mouth. He instead keeps a bell, which he never uses, beside his bed. Katy is told not to go upstairs.|$|E
5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which {{took him to the}} town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|All nine gliders {{carrying}} the troops assigned to Group Steel landed {{next to the}} bridge at Veldwezelt at 05:20, the barbed-wire wrapped around the landing skids of the gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt. The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed {{some distance from the}} bridge, and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian pillbox, which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small-arms fire. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the pillbox whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> detonated it, allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle. Simultaneously, Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to the bridge until two men were able to reach the canal bank and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison. Thus the airborne troops prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge, though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders. The defenders held on until a platoon of German reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village. However, the assaulting force's small-arms fire could not overcome two field-guns located five hundred metres from the bridge, thus forcing Altmann to call for air support. Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns. Group Steel was to be relieved by 14:30, but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21:30. During the fighting, the attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded.|$|E

A call was placed at 8:54p.m. from Weissman's cell phone to Gerry's Italian Kitchen, a Watertown restaurant, for {{delivery}} of three dinner entrees. When a delivery woman arrived at 9:14p.m., there was no answer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> no one answered when the restaurant called Weissman's cell phone.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August 1819 Smith was {{released}} from King's Bench Prison in London, a debtor's prison. He returned to his home of fourteen years at 15 Buckingham Street to find a bailiff <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> his home and property seized. Smith then worked as an itinerant surveyor for many years until one of his employers, Sir John Johnstone, recognised him and took steps to gain for him the respect he deserved. Between 1824 and 1826 he {{lived and worked in}} Scarborough, and was responsible for the building of the Rotunda, a geological museum devoted to the Yorkshire coast. The Rotunda was re-opened as 'Rotunda– The William Smith Museum of Geology', on 9 May 2008 by Lord Oxburgh; however, the Prince of Wales visited the Rotunda as early as 14 September 2007 to view the progress of the refurbishment of this listed building.|$|E

25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer a knock <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: {{when he opened the}} door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon {{back and forth in the}} doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E

Epstein and Taylor {{bypassed}} the line of fans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> heard a welcome message announced over the club's public-address system by Wooler: [...] "We have someone rather famous in the audience today, Mr. Brian Epstein, the owner of NEMS..." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{were due}} to perform a lunchtime concert in The Cavern Club on 9 November 1961. According to club owner Sytner, Epstein had visited the club quite a few times {{previously}} on Saturday nights, once asking Sytner to book a group for his twenty-first birthday party. Epstein asked Harry to arrange for Epstein and his assistant Taylor to watch the Beatles perform. The club allowed Epstein and Taylor to enter without queuing. They bypassed the line of fans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> heard Bob Wooler, the resident DJ, announce a welcome message over the club's public address system: [...] "We have someone rather famous in the audience today.

She comes to the gate– the gate is closed with a human leg; she goes into the yard– there a barrel full of blood; she goes up the stairs– there dead {{children}}; the porch is closed with an arm; on the floor– arms, legs; the door is closed with a finger. Baba Yaga comes to meet her <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> asks her, “Have you seen anything, my dear, {{on your way to}} my house?” “I saw,” the girl answers, “the gate closed with a leg.” “That is my iron latch.” “I saw a barrel in the yard full of blood.” “That is my wine, my darling.” “I saw children lying on the stairs.” “Those are my pigs.” “The porch is closed with an arm.” “That is my latch, my golden one.” “I saw in the house a hairy head.” “That is my broom, my curly one,” said Baba Yaga, then got angry with her prying goddaughter and ate her.|$|E
25|$|Yellow flowers such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and marsh {{marigold}} were placed at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows {{and sometimes they}} were made into bouquets, garlands or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and butter making. It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.|$|R

500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was a knock <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E
500|$|Saiz {{wanted to}} keep the video mostly in the moment without much narrative; he said, [...] " [...] wanted it to be more about the girls, doing the {{performance}} with Beyoncé taking a backseat as a kind of madam character"; in order to convey that idea, the singer does not sing the song's lyrics in the video. He envisioned the clip as being [...] "sexy and provocative, but not so overt", leaning to more sophisticated visuals. In an interview with New York magazine, Saiz affirmed that there are many references to 1990s eroticism and the 1995 video for [...] "Human Nature" [...] by American singer Madonna in the clip for [...] "Yoncé". Elaborating further on the video shoot, Saiz told BuzzFeed, [...] "The girls were incredible. Everyone kind of checked whatever ego <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> we were all there to make something fun and special." [...] He described the cast as being [...] "spontaneous and not at all contrived". Joan Smalls revealed during an interview that the crew did not follow a certain script while filming and added it was [...] "up for interpretation" [...] - she mentioned the scene where she licks Beyoncé's breast as her own idea, getting inspiration from the song's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{expected}} to follow Armine to the University of Oxford, but the family's finances took {{a turn for the}} worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in rupees; fluctuation against the pound reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, [...] "The wolf was not actually whining <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> there was always a little something in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash". Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a junior position in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in Chelsea and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles about school sports for Public School Magazine. In November 1900 his first comic piece, [...] "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings," [...] was accepted by Tit-Bits. A new magazine for boys, The Captain, provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.|$|E

500|$|... "The Raven" [...] {{was praised}} by fellow writers William Gilmore Simms and Margaret Fuller, {{though it was}} denounced by William Butler Yeats, who called it [...] "insincere and vulgar... its {{execution}} a rhythmical trick". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson said, [...] "I see nothing in it." [...] A critic for the Southern Quarterly Review wrote in July 1848 that the poem was ruined by [...] "a wild and unbridled extravagance" [...] and that minor things like a tapping <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> a fluttering curtain would only affect [...] "a child who had been frightened to the verge of idiocy by terrible ghost stories". An anonymous writer going by the pseudonym [...] "Outis" [...] suggested in the Evening Mirror that [...] "The Raven" [...] was plagiarized from a poem called [...] "The Bird of the Dream" [...] by an unnamed author. The writer showed 18 similarities between the poems and was made {{as a response to}} Poe's accusations of plagiarism against Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It has been suggested Outis was really Cornelius Conway Felton, if not Poe himself. After Poe's death, his friend Thomas Holley Chivers said [...] "The Raven" [...] was plagiarized from one of his poems. In particular, he claimed to have been the inspiration for the meter of the poem as well as the refrain [...] "nevermore".|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{text was}} {{provided}} by Erdmann Neumeister, published in Geistliche Poesien in Frankfurt in 1714. He began and ended his work with a hymn stanza. [...] "" [...] is the main hymn for Advent, which Martin Luther had derived from the Latin [...] Its melody is based on Medieval chant and supplies a [...] "dark, imposing character". For the conclusion, Neumeister chose the second part, the , of the seventh and final stanza of Philipp Nicolai's [...] "". The librettist quoted the Book of Revelation in the fourth movement: [...] ""– [...] "Behold, I stand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> knock. Anyone that hears My voice and opens the door, to him I will enter and keep the evening meal {{with him and he}} with me." [...] (...) [...] The poet combined the ideas of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his promise to return with an invitation to enter the heart of the individual Christian. He developed his thoughts like a sermon, as the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr notes: mentioning that the arrival of Jesus brings blessing every day (movement 2), a prayer that Jesus may come to his congregation (movement 2), and in response to his statement of being at the door (movement 4) the opening of the heart of the individual Christian who knows about his sinfulness (movement 5). Bach had set one text by Neumeister before, possibly by 1713, in his cantata Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18.|$|E
