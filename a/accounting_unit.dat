However, although its value rose dramatically relative to the pengő (finally reaching 2 pengő), the adópengő nevertheless suffered severely from inflation.

2500|$|According to BSA {{records and}} Reports to Congress, BSA {{overseas}} councils {{were referred to}} as [...] "Extra Regional"—being outside the BSA's then-twelve Scouting regions in the states, which were consolidated in 1973 to six and again to the current four in 1993. Overseas councils were organized in the Panama Canal Zone (1923), Peking, China (1923), Philippines (1924), and Guam (1947). The [...] "Direct Service Council" [...] was formed in 1956, {{as a result of}} conversations within the BSA's national office in New Jersey. [...] Several Scouting associations, on behalf of their American citizens living in those countries, wanted to have American Scouts and Scouters to serve as part of their associations while overseas. In fact, the high commissioners in Japan, Europe, and Panama invited BSA to send commissioned Scout executives to help create a program for Americans living overseas. International Scouting accords discouraged such memberships except via wartime criteria that allowed for a small number of youth to take part in local programs when no program of their own host nation existed. The BSA's response was to create within the International Division a [...] "local Council equal" [...] which would do many if not all the services which the BSA provides to communities {{in other areas of the}} world and within the United States. These services include membership <b>accounting,</b> <b>unit</b> chartering and rechartering, advancement reporting and filing, insignia and badge issuance, certification of awards and advice on where to conduct Scouting-related activities (mostly camping or ways that the BSA's requirements to [...] "visit community agencies", for instance, could be met while in Zaire or the Isle of Man or in Peru). [...] Direct Service Council did not include Transatlantic, Far East, Aloha, or Canal Zone Councils which had BSA charters to operate as councils since the early 1950s.|$|E

Land ownership within the basin breaks down into the following: about 90,000 acres are controlled by tribal reservations, 6.2 million acres are managed by public agencies (including the Bureau of Land Management, National Forests, National Wildlife Refuges, and National Park Service), and 3.7 million is privately owned. Of the privately owned land, 557,000 acres are used for farming 80% of which is irrigated farmland. Nearly half of irrigated land utilizes water from the BLM’s Klamath Irrigation Project.
