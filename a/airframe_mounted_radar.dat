5000|$|Later the MG 08's {{receiver}} {{would be}} lightened by being [...] "stepped down" [...] at its upper rear and lower forward corners {{as the more}} refined and lighter weight LMG 08/15 version was developed, using the same <b>airframe</b> <b>mounting</b> geometry as the earlier ordnance to allow interchangeability between the earlier lMG 08 and later LMG 08/15 models, with the still well-perforated cooling jacket reduced to a 92.5 mm diameter. The LMG 08/15 was introduced in 1917.|$|R
50|$|Only one {{production}} variant was built, {{the standard}} An-22. Prototypes, {{such as the}} one first featured at the 1965 Paris Air Show had fully glazed noses that lacked the nose <b>mounted</b> <b>radar</b> of production models. Those aircraft had the <b>radar</b> <b>mounted</b> below the right wheel well fairing, forward of the wheels.

50|$|The Delimara Lighthouse is {{an active}} {{lighthouse}} {{on the island of}} Malta. It is the second lighthouse to be built on the Delimara point near Marsaxlokk {{at the southern end of}} the island. The original lighthouse which was built in the mid 19th century still exists alongside the modern rectangular tower which opened in 1990. This newer two storey building has observation windows, with roof <b>mounted</b> <b>radar</b> and aerials, and is used for coastal traffic control.|$|R
50|$|IAI {{installed}} one PW1120 in {{the starboard}} nacelle of an F-4E-32-MC of the IDF/AF (Number 334/66-0327) {{to explore the}} airframe/powerplant combination for an upgrade program of the F-4E, known as Kurnass 2000 ("Heavy Hammer") or Super Phantom and {{to act as an}} engine testbed for the Lavi. The powerplant was more powerful, and more fuel efficient than the General Electric J79-GE-17 turbojet normally installed in the F-4E. The structural changes included modifying the air inlet ducts, new powerplant attachment points, new or modified powerplant baydoors, new <b>airframe</b> <b>mounted</b> gearbox with integrated drive generators and automatic throttle system. It also included a modified bleed management and air-conditioning ducting system, modified fuel and hydraulic systems, and a powerplant control/airframe interface. It was first flown on 30 July 1986.|$|R
50|$|The BPD Traffic unit used {{to operate}} Harley Davidson Electra Glide-Police and BMW R1200RT-P {{motorcycles}} in standard {{black and white}} configuration with Motorola communication radios, Blue Check handheld fingerprint scanners, and E-cite citation devices. As of 2013, the motor traffic unit had been disbanded. Traffic enforcement is now carried out with standard patrol cruisers with dash <b>mounted</b> <b>radar</b> and hand held Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) units. Traffic units are also equipped with license plate detectors which are used to locate stolen vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} boasts breath-taking {{scenes of}} Marsascala and Birżebbuġa which is found opposite the lighthouse. It {{is also a}} stone’s throw away from Saint Peter’s Pool that {{is famous for its}} natural beauty. The original 1850s lighthouse is still present and it is enriched by a contemporary rectangular two storey tower that was inaugurated in 1990. As might be expected the modern building is equipped with aerials, roof <b>mounted</b> <b>radar</b> and surveillance windows. Its function is to control coastal traffic.|$|R
50|$|They were {{designed}} to ship three twin 40 mm /60 Bofors mounts STAAG Mark II, but the midships one was later replaced by the lighter and more reliable twin Mount Mark V. This meant that the Darings could engage two targets at long range and two at close range under fully automatic radar directed-control, an enormous improvement over their predecessors. Two of the Australian Darings were instead fitted with two twin and two single Bofors <b>mounts.</b> <b>Radar</b> Type 293 was carried on the foremast for target indication.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mount</b> Fuji <b>Radar</b> System is a {{historic}} weather radar system located on the summit of Mount Fuji, Japan. It was completed on August 15, 1964 , and is now recorded {{on the list of}} IEEE Milestones in electrical engineering. When first built, the <b>Mount</b> Fuji <b>Radar</b> System was the world's highest weather radar (elevation 3776 meters), and could observe major weather phenomena, such as destructive typhoons, at a range of more than 800 kilometers. It was designed by the Japan Meteorological Agency and built by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|The HQ-6 ("Red flag-6") was {{the second}} member of the LY-60/PL-10/HQ-6/6D/64/DK-10 family developed, but it entered service before the air-to-air version PL-10, despite an earlier start by the PL-10. The entire SAM system {{consists}} of four truck <b>mounted</b> <b>radars</b> (one search/surveillance radar and three tracking/fire control radars), one power supply truck, and six transporter erector launchers (TEL)s.

50|$|Piper {{continued}} {{operations in}} Lock Haven throughout World War II, building military versions of its J-3 Cub as the L-4 Grasshopper. A total of 5,941 powered aircraft were {{built by the}} company for the US armed forces during the war, as well as training gliders, and aircraft components for other manufacturers, but its main contribution {{to the war effort}} was in the fabrication of steel masts for <b>mounting</b> <b>radar</b> antennas. In 1946, the company opened a new factory in Ponca City, Oklahoma and transferred production of the Cub from Lock Haven. That year, Piper led the American industry in light aircraft production. Almost 7,800 of the 35,000 civil aircraft built in the United States that year were Pipers, but a strike led to a shortage of steel tubing, interrupting production, and 1,900 workers had to be suspended as a result.|$|R
