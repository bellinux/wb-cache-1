40|$|Over {{the past}} several years the term oil-free {{turbomachinery}} has been used to describe <b>a</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>support</b> system for high speed turbomachinery that does not require oil for lubrication, damping, or cooling. The foundation technology for oil-free turbomachinery is the compliant foil bearing. This technology can replace the conventional rolling element bearings found in current engines. Two major benefits are realized with this technology. The primary benefit is the elimination of the oil lubrication system, accessory gearbox, tower shaft, and one turbine frame. These components account for 8 to 13 percent of the turbofan engine weight. The second benefit that compliant foil bearings offer to turbofan engines is the capability to operate at higher rotational speeds and shaft diameters. While traditional rolling element bearings have diminished life, reliability, and load capacity with increasing speeds, the foil bearing has a load capacity proportional to speed. The traditional applications for foil bearings have been in small, lightweight machines. However, recent advancements in the design and manufacturing of foil bearings have increased their potential size. An analysis, grounded in experimentally proven operation, is performed to assess the scalability of the modern foil bearing. This analysis was coupled to the requirements of civilian turbofan engines. The application of the foil bearing to larger, high bypass ratio engines nominally at the 120 kN (approx. 25000 lb) thrust class has been examined. The application of this advanced technology to this system was found to reduce mission fuel burn by 3. 05 percent...|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of <b>a</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>supported</b> in journal bearings is highly concerned in the practice. The change in oil temperature {{or some other}} disturbances, e. g. earthquake, fluctuations in the net voltage, can bring the rotor in unstable motion. The in{{stability of}} <b>a</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>supported</b> in journal bearings, however may not completely be avoided by a bearing design or choice. Hence, it is desirable to suppress the instability of <b>a</b> <b>rotor</b> at any time, when some disturbances occur. The vibration of <b>a</b> <b>rotor</b> excited by imbalance is stationary and periodic. It should be suppressed by balancing the rotor, but not by a control system. To this end, an active control method is applied to <b>a</b> <b>rotor</b> running in journal bearings, which only activates when {{the motion of the}} rotor tends to be unstable, but doesn't interfere with the stationary periodic motion resulting from imbalance. In this way both the vibration of the rotor and the forces transmitted to foundation will be reduced. In this work, at first the dynamic behaviour of the rotor running in journal bearings is summarized, so that one can easily understand the background of the problem. Then the so-called Phase-Locked Delayed Feedback control method is introduced, using a one-degree of freedom system as object. The control method is applied to <b>a</b> Jeffcott <b>rotor</b> <b>supported</b> in journal bearings and the control parameters are acquired according to the characteristic equation or to an optimal process. The control system will enlarge the stability boundary of the rotor, when it activates. (orig.)
