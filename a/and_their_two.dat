5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J.

A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat of a lawsuit from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|In {{worsening}} health, Smetana {{continued to}} compose. In June 1876 he, Bettina <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> daughters left Prague for Jabkenice, {{the home of}} his eldest daughter Žofie where, in tranquil surroundings, Smetana was able to work undisturbed.

In Jabkenice Smetana composed four more movements, the complete cycle being first performed on 5November 1882 under the baton of Adolf Čech. Other major works composed in these years were the E minor String Quartet, From My Life, a series of Czech dances for piano, several choral pieces and three more operas: The Kiss, The Secret and The Devil's Wall, all of which received their first performances between 1876 and 1882.|$|E
