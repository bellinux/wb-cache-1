50|$|In mid-1991, Gqozo {{formed the}} <b>African</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Movement</b> {{to counter the}} {{influence}} of the African National Congress in the region. In December of that year, he formed part of the delegation at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) to discuss South Africa's new political dispensation. In March 1992 Gqozo accused the African National Congress of planning to remove him from power in Ciskei.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Tripartite Accord, the African National Congress (ANC), the Marxist-leaning guerrilla/freedom {{movement}} conducting guerrilla {{attacks in}} South Africa to end apartheid, would remove its bases from Angola and no longer received support from the Angolan MPLA movement. The ANC moved their operations to Zambia and Uganda. Later the ANC also dropped their Marxist philosophy. They were accepted into the wider South <b>African</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Movement,</b> which supported political change in the country. After the government repealed a ban on ANC activities, eventually ANC won democratic elections in South Africa. It became the ruling party of a multi-party, democratic South Africa; it supports a capitalist, free market economy.|$|E
50|$|With multi-racial {{democratic}} elections as the likely {{outcome of the}} negotiations, the ANC wished to organise and mobilise its supporters in the Ciskei, particularly as it lay in the Eastern Cape area, a traditional stronghold for ANC supporters. However, its military leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo resisted this and prevented the ANC from organising. In 1991, Gqozo formed the <b>African</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Movement</b> to counter the ANC in Ciskei. In December of the same year, {{he was part of}} the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) negotiations. Codesa was a forum made up of government (National Party) and non-government interest groups to negotiate a new constitution and the transition to democracy in South Africa. In March 1992, Gqozo accused the ANC of planning to overthrow him and in August he stopped ANC marchers from entering Ciskei from King William’s Town, a town in South Africa, although close enough to Ciskei.|$|E

A motion of no-confidence was called for, but four SV deputes sided with the government and the motion was defeated. One of those four deputies was Maurice Yaméogo, who joined the <b>African</b> <b>Democratic</b> Rally.|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, many {{leaders of}} former Bantustans or Homelands {{have had a}} role in South African {{politics}} since their abolition. Some had entered their own parties into the first multiracial election while others joined the ANC. Mangosuthu Buthelezi was chief minister of his KwaZulu homeland from 1976 until 1994. In post-apartheid South Africa he has {{served as president of the}} Inkatha Freedom Party and Minister of Home Affairs. Bantubonke Holomisa, who was a general in the homeland of Transkei from 1987, has served as the president of the United Democratic Movement since 1997. General Constand Viljoen, an Afrikaner who served as chief of the South African Defence Force, sent 1,500 of his militiamen to protect Lucas Mangope and to contest the termination of Bophuthatswana as a homeland in 1994. He founded the Freedom Front in 1994. Lucas Mangope, former chief of the Motsweda Ba hurutshe-Boo-Manyane tribe of the Tswana and head of Bophuthatswana is president of the United Christian Democratic Party, effectively a continuation of the ruling party of the homeland. Oupa Gqozo, the last ruler of Ciskei, entered his <b>African</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Movement</b> in the 1994 elections but was unsuccessful. The Dikwankwetla Party, which ruled Qwaqwa, remains a force in the Maluti a Phofung council where it is the largest opposition party. The Ximoko Party, which ruled Gazankulu, has a presence in local government in Giyani. Similarly, the former KwaNdebele chief minister George Mahlangu and others formed the Sindawonye Progressive Party which is one of the major opposition parties in Thembisile Hani Local Municipality and Dr JS Moroka Local Municipality (encompassing the territory of the former homeland).|$|E
40|$|Although {{the history}} of the Eastern Cape has been {{recorded}} from the eighteenth century, virtually nothing {{has been written about the}} political entity known as the independent Republic of Ciskei (1981 – 1994). This hiatus in our history, coupled with the fact that many of the official records of that period have been destroyed, make it imperative that the role-players of the period be contacted and their evidence be recorded before it is lost to prosperity. This need has motivated the writing of the thesis. The thesis commences with a brief description of the early history and constitutional development of Ciskei. It then has a substantial chapter on Lennox Sebe, the ruler of Ciskei from 1973 to 1990, who is described as the catalyst of Gqozo’s coup d’état. This is followed by a short personal biography of Oupa Gqozo, and his rise to the position of Brigadier in the Ciskei army. On 4 March 1990 Gqozo led the coup by the Ciskei Defence Force that dethroned Sebe. At the outset he ruled in an exemplary manner, but after being misled by South African agents he turned against the African National Congress and his own people. When he established his own party, the <b>African</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Movement,</b> and re-instated the hated headman system, civil war followed in Ciskei. Separate chapters in the thesis relate the various traumatic events that occurred during Gqozo’s reign: the killing of Anton Guzana and Charles Sebe; the dismissal of the senior officers of the CDF; the strife during 1991 / 2; the Bhisho Massacre; its aftermath; the mutiny by the security forces and Gqozo’s resignation on 22 March 1994. The thesis concludes that although Brigadier Gqozo respected the rule of law, and was free of corruption, he was devoid of the necessary academic qualifications, experience and ability, including the necessary insight and foresight, to rule a country. He became paranoid about his own safety and the possible overthrow of his government, and he was too easily swayed by others. In short, Gqozo was inept, rather than evil...|$|E
