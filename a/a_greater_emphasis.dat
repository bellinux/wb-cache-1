5|$|Budget and {{management}} {{reforms in the}} 1980s and 1990s saw a change in budgeting, including <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on outcomes, and decreasing emphasis on inputs. This has been reflected {{in the activities of}} Senate committees, with Senators' questions being increasingly focussed on the 'results of government activities and away from a concern with inputs'.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell Froude, was attacking the Church's move towards {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided a serious challenge to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to Roman Catholicism. Although Froude was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on Newman and the Oxford Movement), he ultimately repudiated his beliefs.|$|E

The paper presents {{the origins of}} so called Open Access idea, putting <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on its role in Poland. The report includes the analysis of OA journal home market {{based on data from}} the DOAJ service and WWW publishers’ pages. <b>A</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> was put on the status of OA journal editors, the availability of journals, the cost of the article publication and the issues connected with the copyrights...|$|R
5|$|Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person {{view and}} {{gameplay}} places <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on finding items and solving riddles than combat. Psychological aspects {{such as the}} gradual disappearance of Mary's letter {{were added to the}} game. More humanoid than their counterparts in the preceding game, some of the monsters were designed to reflect James' subconscious. References to history, films and literature can also be found in the game.|$|E
5|$|Terns are {{protected}} by international legislation such as the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the US-Canada Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Parties to the AWEA agreement are required {{to engage in a}} wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although there is <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on protection.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{justice system}} was {{maintained}} by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became county magistrates. Song magistrates {{were encouraged to}} apply both their practical knowledge {{as well as the}} written law in making judicial decisions that would promote societal morality. Advancements in early forensic science, <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.|$|E
50|$|Survival is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> in {{gameplay}} as enemies will {{fire blankets}} of pulse shots across the screen, some larger than others and some taking on wide intricate patterns.|$|R
50|$|The {{shopping}} mall has <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on fashion and wardrobe with (as of 2008) 58 shops {{in that category}} {{out of a total}} of 123 shops in the mall.|$|R

5|$|The {{restaurant}} had 37 {{locations in}} 2002, 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises. The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.|$|E
5|$|The series {{chronicles the}} {{missions}} of space-faring bounty hunter Samus Aran, who protects the galaxy from the depredations of the Space Pirates and {{their attempts to}} harness {{the power of the}} eponymous Metroids. Metroid combines the platforming of Super Mario Bros. and the exploration aspect of The Legend of Zelda with a decidedly darker atmosphere and <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on nonlinear gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E

50|$|Fierce {{competition}} between railway operators put <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on efficiency, possibly {{more so than}} safety. Some think the Amagasaki rail crash in 2005, which killed more than 100 passengers, {{is the result of}} such a trend.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Aquinas, {{the father}} of Thomism, was immensely {{influential}} in Catholic Europe; he placed <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on reason and argumentation, {{and was one of}} the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, the Government {{released}} a new Defence White Paper, Defence 2000 – Our Future Defence Force that placed <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed {{to improve the}} ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year; in the event, expenditure increased by 2.3% per annum in real terms in the period to 2012–13. In 2003 and 2005, the Defence Updates emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and led to an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.|$|E
5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of Jacobite risings by undermining the power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> {{on the role of the}} father.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields {{at a higher}} rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
50|$|Some {{progressive}} Mennonite Churches place <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the Mennonite tradition's teachings on {{peace and}} non-violence. Some progressive Mennonite Churches {{are part of}} moderate Mennonite denominations (such as the Mennonite Church USA) while others are independent congregations.|$|R

50|$|The Yes for Wales {{organisation}} placed <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on grassroots {{involvement in}} the campaign and established local branches throughout Wales. It also managed the difficult job of pulling together campaigners and politicians with very different perspectives who previously fought each other tooth and nail.|$|R
5|$|Some Western {{academics}} cautiously {{view the}} hadith collections as accurate historical sources. Scholars such as Madelung do not reject the narrations {{which have been}} compiled in later periods, but judge them {{in the context of}} history and {{on the basis of their}} compatibility with the events and figures. Muslim scholars on the other hand typically place <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the hadith literature instead of the biographical literature, since hadiths maintain a verifiable chain of transmission (isnad); the lack of such a chain for the biographical literature makes it less verifiable in their eyes.|$|E
5|$|The Second Boer War had {{alerted the}} army to the dangers posed by fire zones that were covered by long-range, magazine-fed rifles. In the place of volley firing and frontal attacks, there was <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on {{advancing}} in extended order, the use of available cover, the use of artillery to support the attack, flank and converging attacks and fire and movement. The Army expected units to advance {{as far as possible}} in a firing line without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{major source of}} {{information}} on the games is Cassius Dio who lived in the latter second and early third centuries. His History of Rome spans 80 books written in 22 years, but much of which are only fragments. He is noted for his attention to detail in administrative affairs, but for major events his writing can be merely impressionistic, with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> put on his interpretation of the events' significance within the wider historical context rather than reporting details. His sources are varied: he relies on many of the major commentators but also seems to have paid close attention to public records. His account of the Titus games is not sourced.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} the late 1970s and the {{beginning}} of the 1980s that the factor “quality” drastically shifted and became a strategic approach created by Harvard professor David Garvin. This approach focuses on preventing any mistakes and, also, puts <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on customer satisfaction.|$|R
50|$|Youfit places <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on {{environmental}} responsibility.

To encourage its members to adopt eco-friendly habits, Youfit holds annual Earth Day events at its locations.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{theological}} traditions {{within the}} Christian Church {{can be described}} as more heavily Christocentric. Notably, the teachings of Augustine of Hippo and Paul of Tarsus, which have been very influential in the West, place <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the person of Jesus in the process of salvation.|$|R
5|$|The {{unexpected}} deployment to East Timor in 1999 led {{to significant}} changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment {{was the first time}} a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF's ability to mount and sustain such operations. In response, the 2000 Defence White Paper placed <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Australian government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF to 57,000 full-time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year.|$|E
5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed. The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on hyperbolic fun.|$|E
5|$|Castle Wolfenstein, {{originally}} {{available on}} the Apple II in 1981, also employed stealth elements as a focus of the gameplay. Players were charged with traversing the levels of Castle Wolfenstein, stealing secret plans and escaping. Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves and walk by guards undetected. Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, released in 1984, included some additions to its predecessor, such as a dagger for close-range kills and <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>emphasis</b> on disguising in enemy uniform. id Software's technically updated 1992 remake Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to feature some of the original's stealth gameplay, such as body hiding, but this was cut to make the game faster paced. This Wolfenstein game would ironically {{pave the way for}} quite a few later 3D action games, specifically first-person shooters.|$|E
40|$|Interactions between Orthodox Jewish {{patients}} {{at the end of}} life and medical practitioners are frequently difficult. Orthodox Jewish law places <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> on extending life, and many Orthodox Jews assume - sometimes incorrectly - that they must pursue aggressive care under all circumstances according to Jewish law...|$|R
50|$|The {{curriculum}} of sexuality education within Cyprus {{is referred to}} as Sexuality Education and Interpersonal Relationship Education. The curriculum is taught through the instruction of biology, home economics, and religion educators in which <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> is placed on the importance of family relationships and development, rather than sexuality.|$|R
2500|$|The {{monochrome}} Chinese {{tradition has}} used ink on silk or paper since its inception, with <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>emphasis</b> {{on the individual}} brushstroke to define the ts'un or [...] "wrinkles" [...] in mountain-sides, and the other features of the landscape. Western watercolour is a more tonal medium, even with underdrawing visible.|$|R
