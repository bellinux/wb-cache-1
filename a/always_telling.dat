However, his cousin Donnel Feaster, an alumnus of John Bartram High School, recommended that Garland attend his alma mater.

500|$|Early in 1925, Disney {{hired an}} ink artist, Lillian Bounds. They married in July of that year. The {{marriage}} was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney's biographer Neal Gabler {{she did not}} [...] "accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was <b>always</b> <b>telling</b> people 'how henpecked he is'." [...] Lillian {{had little interest in}} films or the Hollywood social scene and she was, {{in the words of the}} historian Steven Watts, [...] "content with household management and providing support for her husband". Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously). Within the family, neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people outside the family raised the point. The Disneys were careful to keep their daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the Lindbergh kidnapping; Disney took steps to ensure his daughters were not photographed by the press.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is <b>always</b> <b>telling</b> you what to do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, a feud arose {{between the}} {{producer}} and R singer Ginuwine, after Timbaland {{failed to make}} an appearance at the singer's music video shoot of [...] "Get Involved". Later in April, Timbaland released a new single featuring T-Pain and Billy Blue titled [...] "Talk That". In June 2010, when questioned by RWD magazine about the UK music scene he made the bold {{claim to be the}} inspiration for the dub-step music scene. [...] "The UK scene... they’re <b>always</b> <b>telling</b> me that I started it. You have Dub-bass...". When questioned further about it he went on to say: [...] "It’s funny cos they went back to some of my old music that really created that sound and just, instead of going fast, they went slow with more bass." [...] In August 2010, a [...] "possible suicide attempt" [...] APB was put out for Timbaland after his home was burgled. When his family were unable to contact him, they called 911 and a manhunt began. Police eventually found his car and brought him back home, where paramedics examined him, before declaring he was not a threat to himself. When questioned, Timbaland said he only took a drive to think about the burglary, as he thought the possible thief could have been someone close whom he trusted.|$|E
500|$|Crace {{was pleased}} with public {{reaction}} to the mother-daughter storyline, commenting prior to the reveal: [...] "Everyone seems desperate to know why Danielle hasn't told Ronnie yet, so I'm taking that as a sign they're enjoying the story. Viewers are <b>always</b> <b>telling</b> me that they love it when Danielle and Ronnie have a scene together – I think they're {{on the edge of}} their seats, waiting to see when Danielle is finally going to admit the truth about her identity." [...] Danielle's death received a mixed reaction from viewers, with 90% of viewers polled by The Sun opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake. The decision was defended by Santer, who stated: [...] "We acknowledge that we didn't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for, and that for some people this was upsetting. We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending. EastEnders – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines, both happy and sad. We’re proud of the episode, the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it." [...] Following Danielle's final episode, regulator Ofcom confirmed they had received a number of complaints from the public about the [...] "violent nature of the show and the horrific death at the end", and the fact it was broadcast before the 9p.m. watershed.|$|E

When she won the 2007 Pattaya Women's Open, {{it was the first time}} in eighteen years that a mother won on tour, after Laura Arraya in 1989. Her daughter, Tina, was a frequent regular in the crowd. Bammer said of her daughter, [...] "She is <b>always</b> <b>telling</b> other people to be quiet because mommy is concentrating." [...] She is notable for her 2-0 head-to-head against Serena Williams, one of the only players to ever have a winning record against the American.|$|E
2500|$|His {{role in the}} {{censorship}} process reportedly earned Georgescu personally {{the hostility}} of poet Ion Barbu, a modernist from Lovinescu's circle, whose political opinions and artistic tenets had made him virtually unpublishable. According to Valeriu Râpeanu, Barbu {{came up to the}} critic in Bucharest's Casa Capşa restaurant, and defiantly questioned the logic and effectiveness of censorship. Barbu's argument compared the regime with parents who fuss over the possibility of their child masturbating to the point where that child becomes determined to try it, and concluding: [...] "That's what you communists are doing, by <b>always</b> <b>telling</b> poets not to imitate Ion Barbu, [...] 'don't follow up on Ion Barbu's poetry, be very careful because it's decadent poetry'. They will start to seek me out and read me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn {{entered the}} 1993 season anticipating {{that he would}} be better after his past two surgeries, and he had also {{incorporated}} Williams' advice into his swing. The Padres lost 101 games that year for the team's worst record during his career. They finished last in the division, behind even the Colorado Rockies, who were an expansion team in their inaugural season. San Diego that season had traded most of its star players—including Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, and Tony Fernández—in fire sales. Gwynn finished with a [...]358 average, the then-second best average of his career, but Colorado's Andrés Galarraga won the title at [...]370. He batted [...]587 on pulled balls, compared to his [...]315 in 1991 before Williams' pointers. Gwynn was affected early in the season by a sprained thumb, but he hit [...]400 (76-for-190) over {{the second half of the}} season. On June 10, he missed the opportunity to hit for the cycle when Manager Jim Riggleman replaced him in the seventh inning of a 14–2 rout against the Dodgers after he had hit for a home run, double, and triple in his three prior at-bats. Riggleman was not aware that he needed a single to complete the cycle. Still wary of Clark's earlier criticism that he was selfish, Gwynn did not contest his removal, which angered his manager when he found out after the game. On August 4 against the Giants, Gwynn had the only six-hit game of his career. He might have gone 7–for–7 if not for an excellent play at first base by Will Clark. Gwynn recorded his 2,000th hit with a single off Colorado lefthander Bruce Ruffin on August 6. His last game was September 5 before undergoing arthroscopic surgery to clear [...] "loose bodies" [...] from his knee. It was the fourth consecutive year his season ended early, and the third straight season it was due to left knee surgery. After the season, Gwynn's father, Charles, died young at the age of 57 from heart problems. Two days earlier, Charles had argued with Gwynn that he should leave San Diego, questioning the Padres' commitment to winning. Gwynn eventually concluded, [...] "No, I like it here, I should stay." [...] He contemplated leaving baseball after his father's death; however, he recalled his father <b>always</b> <b>telling</b> him to [...] "never be a quitter, work hard".|$|E
