5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
500|$|Washbrook then {{attempted}} another hook from Johnston towards deep square leg. Connecting {{with the}} middle of the bat, he imparted much power on the ball, which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground. Harvey quickly moved in across the outfield from the square leg fence <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to catch the ball at his ankles while still on the run. Fingleton called it [...] "the catch of the seasonor, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ". O'Reilly doubted [...] "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it". He further said the [...] "hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic".|$|E
500|$|England then {{progressed to}} 0/129 {{in their second}} innings before Harvey intervened. On 65, Cyril Washbrook {{attempted}} a hook from Bill Johnston. Connecting with {{the middle of the}} bat, he imparted much power on the ball, which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground, but Harvey quickly ran across the ground <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to catch the ball at ankle height while still on the run. Jack Fingleton said that it [...] "was the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ". O’Reilly doubted [...] "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it". He added that the [...] "hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic". Later in the day, captain Yardley was caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot from Johnston.|$|E
60|$|SIR James {{brushed past}} Julius <b>and</b> hurriedly <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the fallen woman.|$|R
60|$|But, the {{question}} {{reminded him of}} his work, <b>and</b> he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> it again.|$|R
60|$|The Emperor {{sprang from}} his horse <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> down <b>over</b> the dead man.|$|R
500|$|Australia {{lost the}} {{services}} of Toshack after he broke down {{with a knee injury}} in the first innings, increasing the burden on the remaining bowlers as England sought to extend their lead on the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. After reaching 50, Washbrook hooked a short ball from Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take the catch. However, Washbrook soon repeated the shot from the bowling of Johnston with fatal results. The ball again went in the air, and Neil Harvey quickly ran across the ground <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> to catch it at feet height while on the run, removing the opener for 65. Fingleton said that Harvey’s effort [...] "was the catch of the seasonor, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ". O’Reilly doubted [...] "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it". He further said the [...] "hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic".|$|E
2500|$|Also {{invited to}} speak was the priest of nearby Catholic church Saint-Pierre d'Ariane. Father Patrick Bruzzone said, [...] "My brothers... I say 'my brothers' because, today more than ever, when one man is hurt, {{the whole of}} {{humanity}} is hurt." [...] He proceeded to the coffins <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> them, as if embracing them. Those in the gathering responded in unison, Allahu akbar.|$|E
2500|$|... "Satchel Ass" [...] or [...] "Bucket Butt" [...] or [...] "My Fat-assed Kid". That's how he {{introduced}} me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over.</b> Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E
60|$|Breckenridge {{told him}} as {{concisely}} as he could, <b>and</b> Cheynes <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the silent {{figure on the}} bed.|$|R

60|$|Raleigh gently {{laid his}} hand on her arm, and lifted her up, while Yeo <b>and</b> Amyas <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> the corpse.|$|R
2500|$|The {{change in}} {{wardrobe}} {{was a factor}} Hendrickson especially needed to become accustomed to. [...] "On my first day, Maggie was wearing a miniskirt," [...] she said. [...] "In one of the scenes, Bianca fainted to the floor, {{and we had to}} do a few takes. The one that they [...] was when I went to catch her <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> <b>over,</b> forgetting that I was wearing a miniskirt. When I realized, I turned to everyone and was like, ' Oh, my goodness! I flashed the entire set. Sorry, guys. I'm not used to wearing miniskirts on the show [...] I'm used to wearing baggy pants!.'" [...] Though the change in wardrobe was a different feel, Hendrickson welcomed the new look. [...] "I used to get a little frustrated with what I wore as Frankie; I was sick of looking like a rugrat," [...] she stated. [...] "But now, I really like my wardrobe. I'm excited that Maggie wears skirts all the time!" ...|$|E

60|$|Not a {{word was}} spoken, {{not a sound}} was made. She stood, like a spirit, beside him, <b>and</b> he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his work.|$|R

6000|$|... "Come, now, Billy, my dear little fellow, let's {{make it all}} up;" [...] <b>and</b> she <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his knees, looking bewitchingly up at him, {{with her}} irresistible eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don Carlos! Stewart in his power! O God!" [...] Madeline sank down, almost overcome. Then {{two great}} hands, powerful, thrilling, clasped her shoulders, <b>and</b> Nels <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{whispered the}} ferryman, winking. [...] "Mark me! Sir Daniel shall down. His time is out. He shall down. Mum!" [...] <b>And</b> he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> his oars.|$|R
