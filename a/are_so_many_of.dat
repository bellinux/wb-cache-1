25|$|This is not {{the first}} time girls have been burned alive in the city. Every week I must learn of the {{untimely}} death of one of my sister workers. Every year thousands of us are maimed. The life of men and women is so cheap and property is so sacred. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us for one job it matters little if 146 of us are burned to death.|$|E
500|$|Reportedly, a Carthaginian officer named Gisgo {{commented on}} how much larger the Roman army was. Hannibal replied, [...] "Another thing that has escaped your notice, Gisgo, is even more amazingâ€”that {{although}} there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, {{there is not one}} among them called Gisgo".|$|E
60|$|FLORRIE. Yes, {{but then}} there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, one never looks, I suppose.|$|E
25|$|The Wheelocks {{were likely}} {{the first family}} of Carlisle Indian School, because there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, and they were {{mentioned}} prominently in Carlisle publications.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} youth and {{good health and}} good spirits in your favour. If all our {{patients}} took things as cheerfully as you do, there would not <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them slip through our hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{knew that}} there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> you, and that was all. Brothers never talk of their sisters, I suppose. But I seem to know you now so well! You have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> kind to me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} get them, Giant. But I don't know if it will do any good---there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them. One or two less won't count." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] she said, [...] "that where there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> {{you in the}} same boat, you might manage to get ashore somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us, of them, I mean,' said Miss Willoughby, and Merton gave a small sigh. 'Not much larkiness here,' he thought, {{and asked}} a {{transient}} waiter for champagne.|$|E
6000|$|... "There used to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them," [...] said Irene gaily. [...] "I used to {{get them}} mixed up with each other, and I couldn't tell them from the poets. Should {{you want to have}} poetry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess there's {{plenty more}} {{stewards}} on Sydney beach," [...] {{the captain said}} briskly. [...] "And I guess I haven't forgotten old days, when I hired them like so much dirt, yes, by Jinks, so much dirt, there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lucia from Heroine TV {{said that}} this was another amazing episode: [...] "...this show just keeps getting better and better. Yes, I know that I say that every week, shut up. I was enthralled by every scene {{featuring}} Damon and Stefan together, and there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very true," [...] says she, [...] "but {{since the}} year '46 there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the honest Scots abroad that I {{will be doing}} very well, I thank you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> {{the girls}} who would only be too pleased to go with him," [...] Zoe continued, in a terrified undertone. [...] "I can't think why he bothers me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a difficulty," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{not sure}} he would admit the {{existence}} of all the Powers you believe in. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them. One would fancy that faith was necessary." ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{a man in}} {{the entire}} army was more than six inches high, and all were made of pewter--just like the boxes of {{soldiers}} you buy at the toy shops; but they marched like real live soldiers, and there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them that it was actually an impressive sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a {{nice little}} touch in School," [...] {{interposed}} Charles Bellingham, [...] "where the girl says to the fellow who was at Inkerman, 'I should think you would <b>be</b> <b>so</b> proud of it,' and he reflects a while, and says, 'Well, the fact is, you know, there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us.'" ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} of the Los Angeles City Oil Field, no single firm had a dominant share. Drillers started their own companies, flooding the local stock exchange with shares of start-up oil firms. There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these that the Los Angeles Stock Exchange had to open a separate facility just to deal with oil stocks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "indeed, I've {{no doubt of}} it; but visitors, you know, often require so much accommodation. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the bishop's {{relatives}} who always bring their own horses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{but there}} <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us, and {{all have a}} hankering after terra firma. Might I just say, that I have your permission, to ask Captain Stowel, to {{let me have a}} run on the cliffs?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gisborne sniffed, and {{produced}} a pocket handkerchief from the early Victorian reticule. She applied the handkerchief to her eyes in silence. Merton observed her with pity. 'We need the money so; there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us,' said the lady.|$|E
60|$|Meinik {{rose and}} {{followed}} Stanley and Captain Cooke. There were houses scattered {{all along the}} roadside. These were now all occupied by officers and troops, and there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them {{that it had not}} been necessary to place any of the men under canvas--an important consideration, during the almost continuous rain of the last three months.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the notable}} deaths of 2006 {{was that of}} American {{economist}} John Kenneth Galbraith on 29 April. Galbraith was famous as possibly the most read economist in history (after Marx, whose numbers were enhanced by compulsion?). An extraordinary number of obituaries were published. Why <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> those in the financial and right wing press suffused with poison? asks Evan Jones...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But we {{must not}} forget the others,' she said at last, and began to {{transform}} the fishes to their proper shapes. There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them that it took quite a long time. Just as she had finished there arrived the little dwarf from the Deer's Leap in a car drawn by six cockchafers, which once had been the six stone eggs.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the {{evaporation}} {{from the}} big lagoons--there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them," [...] McCoy explained. [...] "The evaporation upsets the whole system of trades. It even causes the wind to back up and blow gales from the southwest. This is the Dangerous Archipelago, Captain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't think Aunt Mary {{will ever}} let them, she hates the country; {{and though she}} likes {{to have a place}} for the name of the thing, she does not want to live there, {{especially}} where there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us; and then, Felix's situation!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's not his turn, Miss, to be {{recommended}} {{when the}} next applications come to the couriers' office. You see, there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them out of employment just now. If he could be privately recommended--' She stopped, and left the unfinished sentence to speak for itself.|$|E
60|$|And so they sauntered hand in {{hand through}} the sunny days and were happy exceedingly. Least of all did they allow the rumours which reached them from the great Boer {{gathering}} at Paarde Kraal to disturb their serenity. There had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these reports of rebellion that folk were beginning to regard them as a chronic state of affairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can have}} no {{possible}} objection, Mr. Hilliard. I know that you did good service with Colonel Parsons, and {{it is quite possible}} that we shall find ourselves in as tight a place as he <b>was.</b> <b>So</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> our white officers have been sent down, with fever, that I am very short-handed, and shall be glad if you will temporarily serve as my assistant." ...|$|R
50|$|As a statistician, he <b>was,</b> like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest}} of us, self-taught, on a good {{background}} of physics and mathematics.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see,' {{continued}} Lawford, in {{the same}} quiet, dispassionate undertone, 'I wouldn't mind {{if it was only}} myself. But there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us, so many selves, I mean; and they all seem to have a voice in the matter. What is the reality to this infernal dream?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, I can imagine," [...] said Mrs. Taft, {{keeping the}} number of thirty {{stitches}} carefully in her mind all the while; [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his irons, trying to make people straight when the Almighty had made them crooked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then pity 'tis, 'tis true," [...] cried she, {{as if in}} Miss Bullace's words. [...] "But please, Miss M., it must be {{the briefest}} of adieus. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> my friends who would enjoy your company--and those {{delightful}} recitations. Walter, will you see that everything's quite--er--convenient?" ...|$|E
25|$|Because there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> types <b>of</b> insects, it's not {{feasible}} {{to devise a}} single protocol for their treatment. Case-by-case understanding is required.|$|R
5000|$|Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4.2/5 {{and stated that}} [...] "Episodes like this <b>are</b> <b>so</b> welcome - when {{almost all of the}} cast gets a small but meaty role to play. ... Frankly, I had a problem with the outcome of the [...] "Dead Rose Slasher" [...] case. The show was {{otherwise}} light and a bit surprising with all of the relational subplots - and there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them." ...|$|R
50|$|Brita Olovsdotter {{was also}} active as a forger, and {{acquired}} {{large amounts of}} money by the forging seals of both living and dead people. Legend say that there <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, that at one occasion, the secretary of her spouse was to have thrown an abundance of them in the water stream outside Hammersta manor. It is not known whether the stories of her forgery affairs are true or not.|$|R
