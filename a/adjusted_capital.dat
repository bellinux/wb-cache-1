40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} pricing of liquidity risks in London Stock Exchange. Liquidity <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Capital</b> Asset Pricing Model i. e. LCAPM developed by Acharya and Pedersen (2005) is being applied {{to test the}} influence of various liquidity risks on stock returns in London Stock Exchange. The Liquidity <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Capital</b> Asset Pricing model provides a unified framework for the testing of liquidity risks. All the common stocks listed and delisted {{for the period of}} 2000 to 2014 are included in the data sample. The study has incorporated three different measures of liquidity – Percent Quoted Spread, Amihud (2002) and Turnover. The reason behind the application of three different liquidity measures is the multi-dimensional nature of liquidity. Firm fixed effects panel regression is applied for the estimation of LCAPM. However, the results are robust according to Fama-Macbeth regressions. The results of the study indicates that liquidity risks in the form of (i) level of liquidity, (ii) commonality in liquidity (iii) flight to liquidity, (iv) depressed wealth effect and market return as well as aggregate liquidity risk are priced at London Stock Exchange. However, the results are sensitive to the choice of liquidity measures...|$|E

We suggest a financing needs-induced adjustment framework to examine the dynamic process by which firms <b>adjust</b> their <b>capital</b> structures. We find that most adjustments occur when firms have above-target (below-target) debt with a financial surplus (deficit).

40|$|This paper investigates how firms {{dynamically}} {{adjust their}} use of capital, labor, energy, and materials using the Colombian Census of Manufacturing. This Census contains data at the establishment level and provides evidence of a mix of smooth and lumpy adjustments and of interrelated factor adjustments. Based on this evidence, I propose a dynamic firm model that incorporates five key features: disruption of the production process and reallocation of internal resources when firms <b>adjust</b> <b>capital</b> and labor; partial irreversibility of investment; fixed costs of installing capital and creating or discontinuing a job vacancy; a convex cost component, aimed at capturing smooth adjustments; and congestion effects, which means {{that it is more}} costly for firms to <b>adjust</b> <b>capital</b> and labor at the same time than it is to adjust them separately. As result, when firms are hit by demand or productivity shocks, they decide to <b>adjust</b> either <b>capital</b> or labor alone or both, depending on the initial capital to labor ratio and on the magnitude of the shocks. Using a simulated method of moments, the study finds empirical support for the existence of disruption costs for capital and labor, the existence of convex costs for capital but not for labor, and the existence of congestion effects...|$|R
40|$|Analyzing the {{database}} made {{available by the}} European Central Bank (ECB) we evaluate the Comprehensive Assessment (asset quality review and stress test). We provide some insights on the supervisory approach of the ECB and on banking regulation. In a nutshell the main results are: i) risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> ratios are negatively related to the asset quality review shortfall {{but not to the}} stress test shortfall, instead the leverage ratio always plays a significant role; ii) the comprehensive assessment was mainly concentrated on the traditional credit activity rather than on the financial assets of the banks; iii) there is evidence of manipulation in the computation of risk weighted assets by the use of internal rating based models; iv) the comprehensive assessment seems to be characterized by double standards: non-core countries have been penalized by the asset quality review; medium size banks are either more risky or have been penalized in both exercises; a non diversification-home bias effect (including government bonds) has penalized banks in the asset quality review; the use of national discretion helped core countries and was not of help for peripheral countries. As far as the methodology is concerned, several pitfalls emerge. However, we show that the capital adjustment performed by the stress test is positively related to a market based risk measure (historical volatility) and that the leverage ratio post adjustment, but not before the adjustment and not the risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> ratio, is related to it...|$|E

The analysis encompasses 25, 000 individual stocks from 48 developed and emerging {{countries around the world}} from 1988 to 2004. Though we cannot find evidence that the liquidity <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> asset pricing model of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) holds in international financial markets, cross-sectional as well as time-series tests show that liquidity risks arising from the covariances of individual stocks' return and liquidity with local and global market factors are priced. Furthermore, we show that the US market is an important driving force of world-market liquidity risk. We interpret our evidence as consistent with an intertemporal capital asset pricing model (Merton (1973)) in which stochastic shocks to global liquidity serve as a priced state variable. ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{methods are}} known {{for the purpose of}} capital allocation. There are some {{properties}} that allocation methods should satisfy. These are full allocation, core compatibility, riskless allocation and suitability for performance measurement (compatible with Return on Risk <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Capital</b> calculation). When we think about practical application we should also consider simplicity of the methods. We examine six methods {{from the point of view}} if they are satisfying the mentioned criteria and try to find out if there is any of them fulfilling both five properties. Our main question is the fulfillment of core compatibility that we test using simulation. We find that the Expected Shortfall based Euler method satisfies all the above given criteria but symmetry (that is not anyways desirable as we will point out) and also very easy to calculate. All this enables us to suggest this method for practical applications. ...|$|E

In this article we consider several applications of the Euler capital allocation. First, we propose visual tools to present the diversification and the line-wise performance for a given loss portfolio so that the risk managers can understand the interactions among the lines. Secondly, on theoretical side, we prove that the Euler allocation is the directional derivative of the marginal or incremental allocation method, an alternative capital allocation rule in the literature. Lastly, we establish the equivalence between the mean-shortfall optimization and the RORAC optimization when the risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> is the expected shortfall, and show how to construct the optimal insurance business mix that maximizes the portfolio RORAC.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} implicit guarantees and capital regulations {{on the behavior of}} a bank and on the expected losses for its depositors. I show that implicit guarantees increase the incentives of the bank to enhance leverage and/or risk taking and that this leads to higher expected losses for its depositors. To reduce the adverse effects of moral hazard, policy measures have to be taken. However, a simple leverage ratio is likely to increase expected losses further and risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> requirements do not necessarily affect highly leveraged banks with very low risk assets. A combination of both requirements can be successful. Positive long-term effects can be achieved by a reduction of moral hazard and informational imperfections. However, it is difficult to achieve these reductions and potentially severe short-term effects have to be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{shows that}} for certain {{classes of insurance}} risks, pricing can be based on expected values under a probability measure ℙ* amounting to quasi risk-neutral pricing. This probability measure is unique and optimal {{in the sense of}} minimizing the relative entropy with respect to the actuarial probability measure ℙ, which is a common approach in the case of incomplete markets. After expounding the key elements of this theory, an application to a set of industrial property risks is developed, assuming that the severity of losses can be modeled by "Swiss Re Exposure Curves”, as discussed by Bernegger (1997). These curves belong to a parametric family of distribution functions commonly used by pricing actuaries. The quasi risk-neutral pricing approach not only yields risk exposure specific premiums but also Risk <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Capital</b> (RAC) values on the very same level of granularity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{systematically}} analyze the equity risk module of Solvency II, the new regulatory framework in the European Union. The particularly interesting aspect of this module is that it contains a symmetric adjustment mechanism commonly known as equity dampener which shall reduce procyclicality and thus systemic risk in the insurance industry. We critically review the equity risk module in three steps: we first analyze the sensitivities of the equity risk module with respect to the underlying technical basis, then work out potential basis risk (i. e., deviations of the insurers actual equity risk from the Solvency II equity risk), and—based on these results—measure the impact of the symmetric adjustment mechanism on the goals of Solvency II. The equity risk module is backward looking in nature and a substantial basis risk exists if realistic equity portfolios are considered. Also, the <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> stress substantially deviates from the proposed 99. 5 % confidence level.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between illiquidity level and illiquidity risk and the size, value and momentum anomalies for US stocks 1931 - 2012. In contrast to statistical factors both illiquidity level and illiquidity risk have a solid theoretical foundation in the liquidity <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> asset pricing model (LCAPM). A horse race between the LCAPM and the CAPM shows that the LCAPM outperforms the CAPM in terms of ability to explain risk premiums of size and value sorted test portfolios. The outrun comes mostly from the illiquidity level premium while the illiquidity risk premium is overall less important.

The premiums related to size can to large extent be explained as a compensation for illiquidity level. The premiums related to momentum are essentially explained by the high illiquidity (both level and risk) of the portfolios with little momentum. The premiums related to value can to some extent be interpreted as compensation for illiquidity risk {{and to some extent}} as compensation for illiquidity level but cannot fully explain the value anomaly...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of inter-firm {{relationships}} on a firm’s incentive to <b>adjust</b> its <b>capital</b> structure. We predict that firms with tight business relationships with other firms have less incentive to <b>adjust</b> their <b>capital</b> structure because their information would be propagated through the inter-firm relationships and they could seek assistance {{when they had a}} problem with liquidity. We use multiple measurements of interfirm relationships in the Japanese economy, such as industry group (keiretsu) membership, president’s council (shacho-kai) membership, and cross-shareholding. Using three measurements of the inter-firm relationships, we find that the firms that have tight relationships with others have higher financial leverage both in terms of book and market leverage. Furthermore, we estimate the adjustment speed of capital structure by dynamic panel estimations and find that the adjustment speed of firms with tight relationships is slower than that of those without such relationships. Lastly, we explore whether the adjustment speed increased after Japan’s financial market was deregulated. The speed increased after the series of deregulations of the stock market. These results are consistent with our prediction that inter-firm relationships affect a firm’s incentive to <b>adjust</b> its <b>capital</b> structure...|$|R

40|$|Capital {{allocation}} is {{used for}} many purposes in financial institutions and for this purpose several methods are known. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review possible methods (we present six of them) and to help financial companies to choose between the methods. There are some properties that an allocation method should satisfy: full allocation, core compatibility, riskless allocation, symmetry and suitability for performance measurement (compatibility with Return on Risk <b>Adjusted</b> <b>Capital</b> calculation). If we think about practical application we should also consider simplicity of the methods. First we examine the methods from the point of view if they are satisfying core compatibility. We test this with simulation where we add to the existing literature that we test core compatibility with different assumptions on returns: on normal and t-distributed returns and also on returns generated from a copula. We find that if we measure risk by a coherent risk measure, the Expected Shortfall there are two methods satisfying core compatibility: the Euler method (that always fulfills the criteria) and cost gap method (obeys it around in about 99 %). As Euler method is very easy to calculate even for many players while cost gap method becomes very complicated as the number of the players increases we examine further the properties of Euler method. We find that it fulfills all the above given criteria but symmetry and as aforementioned it is also very easy to calculate. Therefore we believe that the method might be suggested for practical applications. Capital Allocation, Coherent Measures of Risk, Core, Simulation...|$|E

The {{first half of this}} master’s thesis discusses the comparisons between the performance of family and non-family firms according to existing literature. I present the results of previous studies about family firm’s performance and how active or passive control can affect it. The investigation of stock liquidity is also based on current literature. I discuss liquidity measures and liquidity <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> asset pricing model. The second half of this master’s thesis consists of the empirical part. I use a regression analysis in which firm value is measured with Tobin’s q or the P/E-ratio. Share liquidity is measured with the Amihud liquidity measure. Finally I investigate a Finnish family firm, Lemminkäinen, and find out how the results that I get in my empirical analysis can be applied to their case. My dataset is a panel of 108 firms listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange from 1997 to 2008. I restrict the panel to non-financial firms only. I found that Finnish family firms are worse market performers than non-family firms. The coefficient estimate for family firms is statistically significant at the one-percent level. I also found a strong negative relationship between a family firm’s share illiquidity and firm value. The coefficient estimate for a family firm’s share illiquidity is statistically significant at the one-percent level as well. However, I did not find a statistically significant effect of a non-family firm’s share illiquidity on firm value. As a conclusion, it is evident that family firms suffer the effect of share illiquidity on firm value...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} statistical techniques in credit portfolio management, with emphasis on actuarial and risk theoretic pricing and reserving measures. The bank corporate loan portfolio is envisaged as an insurance collective, with margins charged for credit risk forming premium income, provisions made forming claims outgo, and variation over time in provisioning and profitability producing a need for reserves. The research leads to the computation of portfolio specific measures of risk, and suggests that a value-at-risk (VAR) based reserve computation has several advantages over current regulatory reserving methodology in bank capital adequacy regulation (CAR) with respect to non-residential private sector loan portfolios. These latter, current CAR practices are invariably used by banks to compute the respective capital adequacy backing required on loans. A loan pricing model is developed that allocates capital required by reference to observed provisioning rates across a total of 64 differing combinations of rating factors. This represents a statistically rigorous return on risk <b>adjusted</b> <b>capital</b> (RORAC) approach to loan pricing. The suggested approach is illustrated by reference to a particular portfolio of loans. The reserving and pricing measures computed are portfolio specific, but the methodology developed and tested on the specific portfolio (dataset) of loans has a wider, more general applicability. A credit market comprising portfolios which are both more and less risky than the original particular portfolio is hypothesised, and existing regulation is compared to VAR regulation {{in the context of}} the hypothesised credit market. Fewer insolvencies are observed using the VAR framework than under existing regulation, and problem portfolios are identified earlier than under existing regulation. For the particular portfolio of loans, existing algorithm-based loan pricing is compared with the proposed loan pricing model. Significant differences are observed in loan pricing by reference to gearing and collateral, and the elimination of observed inefficiencies in pricing is recommended. Although the proposed model has some limitations, it is argued to be an improvement on existing regulatory and banking practice...|$|E
