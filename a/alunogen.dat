(Central Poland), are considered a large complex of mid-Cambrian strata (Alexandrowicz 1972). In a 2 -km long exposure of the Pieprzowe Mts succession, along the Vistula River bank near the town of Sandomierz, shales, quartz-mica shales, quartzites, sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates are outcropping. All shaly facies are enriched in pyrite. The occurrence of secondary minerals in the weathering zone of the mid-Cambrian shale formation in the Pieprzowe Mts. is known for an extended period of time. Differences in color eff lorescence observed on the weathered surface were considered as alum incrustations; hence, the term “alum shale” has been used with reference to these rocks. The phase composition of fine-crystal aggregates was determined by Kuhl (1931). Based on observations under polarizing microscope, he interpreted them as a composition of mirabilite, epsomite and <b>alunogen,</b> thus contradicting his earlier hypothesis about pickeringite occurrence. Pickeringite is a sulphate mineral owing its origin to oxidation of pyrite in low pH conditions (Kruszewski 2013) and is a member of the halotrichite group with theoretical formula MgAl 2 (SO 4) 4 ∙∙ 22 H 2 O. However, chemically pure pickeringite is rare as most of its occurrences form transitional phases between pickeringite and halotrichite (Parafiniuk 1991). This mineral is usually observed in aggregates with other sulphates; the most common association consists of <b>alunogen</b> and epsomite. Crystallization and preservation of pickeringite depend on air humidity, which results from its high solubility in water (Balcerzak et al. 1992, Parafiniuk 1991). The aim of this study is to describe conditions of pickeringite crystallization in the weathering zone of the Pieprzowe Mts. shale formation. SEM-EDS analysis made it possible to detect three types of sulphide minerals occurring within aggregates. The most common is pickeringite forming elongated crystals with smooth surfaces, which demonstrate absence of dissolution processes. Fibers of pickeringite are associated with a mineral of tabular shape named <b>alunogen</b> – Al(SO 4) 3. Epsomite was detected in subordinate quantities. XRD analysis confirmed the polymineral character of efflorescenes. The main ref lex for pickeringite (ca. 4. 80 Å) is fragmented into two peaks: (1) 4. 8061 Å and (2) 4. 7958 Å. These values are reduced as compared to ICDD data, which could result from admixtures of other sulphates, alunogene and epsomite. Another options is that this reduction means that pickeringite is forming transitional phase into halotrichite, which has its maximum reflex at 4. 81 Å. This could be confirmed by chemical composition (Fe impurities). The Pieprzowe Mts. shale formation presents specific conditions favouring evaporation of pickeringite. The elements required for pickeringite crystallization originate from the host rocks. The source of Al 3 +could be kaolinite, which is common as a product of alteration processes as well as an authigenic compound. Processing of micas transformation causes environmental enrichment in Mg 2 +. The published sources indicate that the presence of pyrite is a key-factor for pickeringite crystallization. However, this mineral is also typical for shales present in the Carpathian rock units, where as a product of pyrite oxidation jarosite and gypsum are common. This suggests that some other initiator is required for the formation of pickeringite. It has been suggested that surface evaporation of groundwater causes the precipitation of sulphates (Cody & Briggs 1973 vide Parnell & Roderic 1982). The Pieprzowe Mts. shale formation contains dense network of veins so it is possible that waters from deeper layers are able to migrate into the subsurface. Some documented occurrences of pickerigite are related to arid regions. Certainly, an important role is played by humidity – southern exposure and poor plant cover of the Pieprzowe Mts. could be the reason why pickeringite may not only crystalize but also exist there. Most of the pickeringite occurrences in Poland are associated with rocks of old units (mid-Cambrian in age in the Pieprzowe Mts., Proterozoic in Wieściszowice and in Krobica quarry). Older rocks are poor in carbonates so it could mean that pH is a more important factor conditioning pickeringite crystallization than pyrite occurrence. Pickeringite was found also on burning coal-mining dumps in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (Kruszewski 2013), what confirm that pH determines crystalization of this mineral. Correlation between pickeringite and other sulphates is also interesting. <b>Alunogen</b> associated with pickeringite crystalize when the delivery of Mg 2 +is reduced. Paragenesis consisting of alunogene, epsomite and pickeringite could be a result of different solubility of these phases or changing of Mg 2 +and Al 3 +ions during evaporation processes. The following sequence of crystallization is proposed: alunogene-pickeringite-epsomite. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: quartz-mica shale, quartzite, sandstone...|$|E

Over {{the last fifteen years}} there has been detailed geoarchaeological prospections and chemical/mineralogical analyses allowed to identify some of these minerals in their recorded places, essentially of origin largely on volcanic islands in the Aegean (Photos-Jones & Hall, 2011). The medicinal minerals of antiquity are now understood to consist primarily of layered silicates, sulphates and metal oxides/sulphides (Photos-Jones et al., 2015). Recent studies have been also focused on (1) processing methods by which raw materials could have been converted to finished products, i. e. the medicinals, and (2) assaying for purity (Hall and Photos-Jones 2005; 2009; Photos-Jones and Hall 2010). Moreover microbiological work on layered silicates from some volcanic islands in the Aegean (Samos) and stamped archaeological earths (terra sigillata) (Lemnos) has shown them to be antibacterial (Photos-Jones et al., 2015). The present research focuses on the second group of medicinal minerals, namely sulphur and sulphates and in particular solfataric alum efflorescences from two volcanic landscapes, in Greece and Italy, i. e. Melos (Western Cyclades) and Campi Flegrei (Naples), respectively. Both regions are known to have been exploited in antiquity and later periods. The chemistry and mineralogy of a small number of geological samples collected from each are examinated. For Melos, some samples have undergone field-based heating and processing while other samples have been used in microbiological testing. The results suggest that solfataric alum consists primarily of the minerals <b>alunogen</b> and K-alum with strong antibacterial (but not antifungal) properties. It is suggested that Greco-Roman medicinal minerals are likely to reflect long established geophagic practices incorporated within medical prescriptions, the antiquity of which may predate, by far, the historical periods. In addition, given that currently 'extreme' landscapes are the focus for the discovery of new drugs, an understanding of the nature and properties of the Greco-Roman medicinal minerals deriving from volcanic landscapes might be relevant to both antiquity and today.

40|$|Efflorescences in the {{geothermal}} field of SE Melos, Greece, contain {{significant amounts of}} hydrated Al sulphate, <b>alunogen,</b> which could represent the Melian alumen exploited in Roman times and commended by Pliny. The efflorescences at subaerial fumaroles are explained as follows: Sulphur crystallizes on oxidation of H 2 S emanating from depth. Weathering produces sulphuric acid enhancing groundwater alteration of volcanic rocks. The high geothermal gradient and arid climate stimulate efflorescences. Salts are recycled during wet and dry weather leading to Al-enrichment on loss of Fe(II,III) and other cations. d 34 S % V-CDT values for sulphur in fumarole sublimates, solfatara soils and ‘veins ’ range from 0. 3 to 6. 4 %, mean 3. 8 % (n = 8) while Al, Ca and Mg-sulphates in diverse settings range from 4. 1 to 6. 8 % (n = 16). The values for sulphur indicate that the initial H 2 S had an igneous source and the signature is largely inherited by the sulphates. This study aims to underpin research into the exploitation of industrial minerals in the Roman period.

The pH values in 1 : 1 solutions of deionized water of the studied minerals, excluding epsomite, range from 1. 94 to 4. 82. Therefore, segregations of secondary minerals in themselves are significant microenvironmental reservoirs of acid that can be mobilized during precipitation events.

40|$|To support {{research}} into both precious metal exploration and environmental site characterization {{a combination of}} high spatial/spectral resolution airborne visible, near infrared, short wave infrared (VNIR/SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) image data were acquired to remotely map hydrothermal alteration minerals around the Geiger Grade and Comstock alteration regions, and map the mineral by-products of weathered mine dumps in Virginia City. Remote sensing data from the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), SpecTIR Corporation's airborne hyperspectral imager (HyperSpecTIR), the MODIS-ASTER airborne simulator (MASTER), and the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) were acquired and processed into mineral maps based on the unique spectral signatures of image pixels. VNIR/SWIR and TIR field spectrometer data were collected for both calibration and validation of the remote data sets, and field sampling, laboratory spectral analyses and XRD analyses were made to corroborate the surface mineralogy identified by spectroscopy. The resulting mineral maps show the spatial distribution of several important alteration minerals around each study area including alunite, quartz, pyrophyllite, kaolinite, montmorillonite/muscovite, and chlorite. In the Comstock region the mineral maps show acid-sulfate alteration, widespread propylitic alteration and extensive faulting that offsets the acid-sulfate areas, {{in contrast to the}} larger, dominantly acid-sulfate alteration exposed along Geiger Grade. Also, different mineral zones within the intense acid-sulfate areas were mapped. In the Virginia City historic mining district the important weathering minerals mapped include hematite, goethite, jarosite and hydrous sulfate minerals (hexahydrite, <b>alunogen</b> and gypsum) located on mine dumps. Sulfate minerals indicate acidic water forming in the mine dump environment. While there is not an immediate threat to the community, there are clearly sources of acidic drainage that were identified remotely...|$|E

Blue alpersite, which is isostructural with melanterite (FeSO 4 • 7 H 2 O), is overlain by a light blue to white layer dominated by pickeringite, <b>alunogen,</b> and epsomite. X-ray diffraction data (MoKα radiation) from a single crystal of alpersite were refined in P 21 /c, resulting in wR = 0. 05 and cell dimensions a = 14. 166 (4), b = 6. 534 (2), c = 10. 838 (3) Å, β = 105. 922 (6) °, Z = 4. Site-occupancy refinement, constrained {{to be consistent with}} the compositional data, showed Mg to occupy the M 1 site and Cu the M 2 site. The octahedral distortion of M 2 is consistent with 72 % Cu occupancy when compared with the site-distortion data of substituted melanterite. Cuprian pentahydrite, with the formula (Mg 0. 49 Cu 0. 41 Mn 0. 08 Zn 0. 02) SO 4 • 5 H 2 O, was collected from an effl orescent rim on a depression that had held water in a large waste-rock area near Miami, Arizona. After dissolution of the efflorescence in de-ionized water, and evaporation of the supernatant liquid, alpersite precipitated and quickly dehydrated to cuprian pentahydrite. These observations are consistent with previous experimental studies of the system MgSO 4 -CuSO 4 -H 2 O. It is suspected that alpersite and cuprian pentahydrite are widespread in mine wastes that contain Cu-bearing sulfi des, but in which solubilized Fe 2 + is not available for melanterite crystallization because of oxidation to Fe 3 + in surface waters of near-neutral pH. Alpersite has likely been overlooked in the past because of the close similarity of its physical properties to those of melanterite and chalcanthite. Alpersite is named after Charles N. Alpers, geochemist with the United States Geological Survey, who has made significant contributions {{to our understanding of the}} mineralogical controls of mine-water geochemistry...|$|E
40|$|Weinvestigated sulfur-bearing {{minerals}} fromthe Campi Flegrei caldera, southern Italy, {{in relation}} to the increase of hydrothermal activity phenomena since 2006, aimed at providing insights into the volcanic system dynamics. Mineral encrustations and muds were sampled between 2013 and 2015 at the long-standing degassing crater of the Solfatara tuff cone and its recently restless north-eastern Pisciarelli slope. Deep-seated sulfides were further separated from two drill cores (AGIP's Mofete boreholes: 1500 m and 2695 m depth). The mineral assemblage and texture of sampled encrustations were determined by X-ray diffraction, optical and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis by energy dispersive spectrometry. Native sulfur and alunite dominate among the newly formed mineral phases. Other minerals are mostly <b>alunogen,</b> and locally pickeringite, potassium alum, hematite and pyrite. Mereiterite and amarillite sporadically occur. The mud pools are rich in gypsum, potassium alum and pyrite. Quartz and argillic phases, locally with analcime, are dispersed in the outcropping rocks. δ 34 S valueswere determined for shallow subsurface native sulfur (− 5. 5 to 0. 0 ‰) and alunite (− 1. 7 to− 0. 2 ‰), aswell as for the deep-seated pyrite (3. 3 to 7. 4 ‰in the depth range: 1500 – 2695 m). δ 18 O values were measured for shallow native alunite (4. 2 to 7. 0 ‰). Pisciarelli alunite was finally analyzed for its 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios (0. 707517 ± 6 and 0. 512459 ± 6, respectively). Textural and isotopic data constrain the genesis of alunite at the expense of K-feldspars through rock alteration by hydrothermal fluids. We suggest that the caldera is a low-sulfidation system hosting acid-sulfate deposits in its active degassing area. The acid-sulfate environment developed on an argillitic facies that thins outwards and is characteristic for steam-heated and magmatic-steamenvironments. These environments developed {{in relation to}} the fractured settings that facilitates the gas emissions from deeper levels and the meteoric infiltration fromsurface to depth. Newly determined δ 34 S data are lower than previously published values, suggesting a progressive decrease in the sulfur isotopic composition through time at least since 1956. The isotopic variation is associated with a lowering of the SO 2 /H 2 S ratio and thewidening of the surface of CO 2 degassing, in the absence of significant changes in the average CO 2 flux values and in the carbon and heliumisotope compositions. Native sulfur and sulfates move from sulfur isotope equilibrium to disequilibrium. We ascribe this transition to enhanced SO 2 scrubbing due to a high rock permeability that facilitates a faster gas ascent rate in the shallow crust...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of the Robinson Deep mine residue deposit in Johannesburg was assessed by evaluating the water chemistry and surface precipitates, thereby identifying the processes responsible for forming the contamination footprint. Precipitates were compared to a documented paragenetic sequence of mineral formation associated with sulphide rich mine waste. PHREEQC, a geochemical modelling tool, was utilized to predict the formation of precipitates from evaporation ponds. The chemistry of the leachate was analysed and compared to water quality standards {{in order to determine}} the possible {{environmental impact}}. The chemistry of the water emanating from the mine residue deposit reveals that an Fe-SO 4 dominant chemistry persists, this is consistent with acid mine drainage environments. The most toxic cations and anions contained in the water are Fe, Al, Mn, Ca, As, Mg, Cu, Zn, Pb and SO. It is predicted that the impact of toxic metals identified in the water decreases further from the mine residue deposit due to dilution and co-precipitation with different mineral phases such as goethite. Precipitates identified include jarosite group minerals, goethite, melanterite, copiapite, Mg-copiapite, halotrichite, pickeringite, gypsum and <b>alunogen.</b> These secondary minerals may be used as indicator minerals of acid mine drainage. Assessment and prediction of the stage of contamination and possible environmental impact, may, therefore be pursued when comparing the indicator minerals to predicted paragenetic sequences. For example, the precipitation of melanterite is consistent with an early stage of acid mine drainage development. The presence of melanterite thus suggests that oxidation of sulphides is an ongoing process on the Robinson Deep mine residue deposit. Evaporation of water in the evaporation ponds aids in increasing the concentration, hence allowing the predominant precipitation of jarosite group minerals. Alternatively, rainfall dilutes the water allowing dissolution of minerals located on the banks of the evaporation ponds to predominate. This mechanism of precipitation and dissolution is seasonal; formation of precipitates predominates during the dry season, while dissolution is most prominent during the wet season. The development of hardpans indicates that the main mechanism of formation of the associated phases is through capillary action at the sediment surface. Leaching of Fe 2 +-rich water from the mine residue deposit containment area is indicated by the presence of copiapite, while jarosite and goethite formation tend to form part of a hardpan layer. Goethite is an indication of a late stage mineral predominant at lower sulphate and higher pH conditions. Results of predicted formation of precipitates by PHREEQC are not in very good agreement with actual field observations. This is mainly due to the lack of thermodynamic data for many of the sulphate minerals observed. Hence, precipitates associated with acid mine drainage may be utilized as indicator minerals. Consequently, there identification may facilitate in environmental monitoring and risk assessment. Prof. J. M. Huizenga Prof. J. Gutzme...|$|E

Both areas present a similar mineralization, standing out for its economic interest the bearing Ag galena, sphalerite and pyrite assemblage, with other sulphides and sulphosalts as minor phases. However, the geological setting in which mineralizations occur is very different. So, in S. Almagrera de wall-rocks of the veins are schists and micaschists of "Alpujarride complex", while in the Mazarron area the orebodys occur within the calcalkaline volcanic materials, developed during Tertiary in the SE of Spain. The weathering processes of these two areas have not sufficiently known, from a mineralogial and geochemical point of view. In this paper, a preliminary note over these processes is pointed out. Such weathering processes can be studied in two different groups. The first one, developed over the veins and wall-rocks and the second one, related to the dumps. The second group corresponds to the most developed weathering processes, which are convergent on both two areas. The mineralogical association is similar and the main phases are: jarosite, <b>alunogen,</b> halotrichite, melanterite, coquimbite and other soluble sulphates.

40|$|Acid sulfate soils {{occur in}} dynamic and geomorphologically complex inland and coastal landscapes that are {{inherently}} susceptible to natural and human induced changes. These changes {{can lead to}} environmental degradation and loss of infrastructure through acidification of soil and water and metal mobilisation. This study has identified and described the interrelationships between acid sulfate soil materials and their geomorphic environment, composition (pedology, mineralogy), redox status and geochemistry, and potential environmental hazards, within a complex estuarine landscape in the Barker Inlet region, north of Adelaide, South Australia. For this purpose two study sites were chosen within Barker Inlet, namely Gillman and St Kilda. The Gillman site was chosen because it was known to have problem acid sulfate soils with sulfuric material and was ideally suited for comparative research because it contained “paired sites” with intertidal soils abutting an area that had been reclaimed for industrial development. The reclaimed land at Gillman was non-tidal due {{to the construction of}} bund walls 75 years ago. An intertidal site at St Kilda was selected as a control site and to assess the influence of tidal variations on soil properties. The aims of this study were to: (i) conduct detailed field and laboratory examinations to characterise the range of soil types occurring across the tidal and disturbed (formerly tidal) landscapes, (ii) construct detailed soil maps to relate the data spatially to hazards associated with soil types and landscape features within the study sites, and (iii) construct descriptive and predictive conceptual soil-regolith models to validate and increase understanding of environmental degradation processes occurring within these complex acid sulfate soil landscapes. A review of the natural history and previous research work was conducted in conjunction with a preliminary soil survey of the Gillman and St Kilda study sites and these indicated that areas most vulnerable to contamination and acidification were geomorphically controlled. Detailed soil surveys were then conducted to target the typical landscape features at the study sites (i. e. focus areas). Detailed acid sulfate soil characterisation and mapping of soil types within the focus areas allowed surface cover types from aerial photography {{to be used as a}} surrogate for accurately mapping acid sulfate soil types. Soil maps were produced, in this manner, covering the two study sites. For management purposes, this enabled map units to be assigned descriptive properties that included ‘hazard classes’ and ‘acid sulfate soil treatment categories’. New, in-situ soil redox monitoring methods were developed to reliably measure Eh in 14 selected soil profiles over extended periods of time within contrasting tidal and non-tidal environments. Redox data loggers continuously recorded redox measurements at depth increments ranging from + 10 cm (surface water) to 2 m below the soil surface. Results showed that significant changes in redox status occurred at sub-hourly timeframes in both tidal and non-tidal soils. Tidal environments were characterised by large, cyclic fluctuations in redox conditions, which were proportional to the timing and strength of tidal currents. When freely draining mangrove soils were exposed at low tide, redox conditions generally became more oxidising. However, soil that remained submerged in tidal creeks during low tide become more reducing due to less movement and mixing of surface water. Storm events and seasonal variations influenced soil and water redox conditions for non-tidal environments (i. e. reclaimed land at the Gillman site). Redox conditions within some sulfuric materials alternated seasonally between oxidising and strongly reducing, causing oxidation and subsequent re-formation of pyrite. Storm-related disturbance of subaqueous soils at Gillman initially caused redox potential (Eh) in the water column to decrease, due to the dispersion of monosulfidic material. Developing the ability to link soil and water contaminant issues to soil map units was particularly important for the non-tidal area at Gillman because elevated concentrations of potentially toxic elements (As, Ba, Co, Cu, Pb, V and Zn) were identified and these were related to historic land use (industrial) and landforms. Results indicated that trace metals were concentrated in surface soil layers of the more elevated areas containing sulfuric material as well as in low lying areas containing monosulfidic material. Trace metals were more concentrated at depth in soil profiles at Gillman that were subjected to seasonal flooding. This is due to redox conditions in the upper portion of the soil profile alternating seasonally from oxidising to reducing, and causing trace metals to accumulate at the summer redox front where iron sulfides remain stable as well as form during wet months. Acidic soil conditions promoted migration down the profile of trace elements, which were scavenged by salt efflorescences that formed on soil surfaces near the water table. Dissolution of salt efflorescences following rain events negatively impacted drainage water quality, mainly by release of Al, Fe and acidity. Salt efflorescence mineralogy was a result of characteristic Mediterranean type climate, hydrogeology, saline seepages, and salt crusting formed in drains above sandy sulfuric, hypersulfidic and hyposulfidic materials. This study documented the first occurrence of sideronatrite [Na₂Fe(SO₄) ₂(OH). 3 H₂O], tamarugite [NaAl(SO₄) ₂. 6 H₂O] and <b>alunogen</b> in coastal acid sulfate soils in Australia. They formed together with starkeyite, pentahydrite, gypsum and some halite on the exposed face of soil pits and drains at Gillman. These Fe/Al oxyhydroxysulfate and oxyhydroxide minerals are indicators of very acidic soil conditions (i. e. indicate the presence or former presence of oxidised pyrite), and as such their identification provides an important environmental indicator of acid sulfate soil processes. Descriptive and predictive soil regolith models were constructed to describe and explain the origin of these minerals at the Gillman study site. The models were tested by constructing experimental drains through sulfuric material at the Gillman site. Micromorphological studies helped to identify features indicative of contemporary and relic processes within acid sulfate soils and verify soil characteristics within tidal and non-tidal environments. The results indicated that micro-environments of pyrite oxidation can control bulk soil pH, particularly in sandy soil profiles with little buffering capacity. The varied morphology and composition of pyrite crystals and framboids, and goethite pseudomorphs after pyrite, were used as palaeo-indicators of the soil physio-chemical conditions. The morphology and composition of pyrite oxidation products indicated oxidation rates and carbonate availability. Microanalysis of sulfidic materials and sulfide oxidation products (including salt efflorescences) assisted in identifying migration pathways of trace elements through the landscape. The preservation of pyrite crystals within oxidising environments was identified to occur by armouring with clay coatings and by pyrite framboids being overgrown by (or included within) gypsum and halite crystals. Armouring of pyrite in soils has implications for the characterisation of acid sulfate soil types using ageing experiments, as well as for hazard assessment and management, by underestimating the potential sulfidic acidity of some soil materials. The development of descriptive and predictive conceptual soil-regolith models was based on the integration of all results to provide a holistic understanding of the coastal landscape and the impact of acid sulfate soils on the environment. The information and mapping techniques developed here were used to construct local and regional scale acid sulfate soil hazard maps. This information was used in the production of Coastal Protection Board policy documents and educational material underpinning risk-based acid sulfate soil management options for coastal developments in South Australia, and was specifically integrated into new master development plans for the Gillman area.
