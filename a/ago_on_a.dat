25|$|In {{northern}} British Columbia, {{remnants of}} a shield volcano are found throughout the western Cassiar Mountains. This prehistoric shield volcano, known as Maitland Volcano, was erupted from five to four million years <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mature eroded surface as thin hawaiite and basaltic lava flows engulfed the surrounding landscape. Remnants of this prehistoric shield volcano include a cluster of 14nbsp&volcanic plugs and scattered cliff-bounded basaltic lava flows.|$|E
500|$|The region drained by the Congo River covers one {{eighth of}} Africa, {{including}} both {{tropical rain forest}} and savanna, {{much of it in}} a huge, shallow basin. The present system of rivers seems to date from around five million years ago, not long <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> geological time scale. At that time the Atlantic continental margin was lifted up and formed a barrier between the basin and the sea. A large lake formed before the Congo River broke through this barrier, running through a narrow, rocky channel about [...] long from Kinshasa to Matadi. The river is navigable both above and below this stretch, called the lower Congo.|$|E
500|$|Mount Tehama {{originated}} in the Lassen volcanic complex, an area of active volcanism {{for more than three}} million years. It formed during a period of eruptive activity approximately 600,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> series of faults; the largest of these eruptions was about 50 times as powerful as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. During the Pleistocene, constantly renewed lava of andesite flowed from the caldera of the volcano, eventually becoming [...] "interbedded" [...] and heightening the mountain. By the time it reached its peak size, the volcano was immense, measuring at its base between [...] and [...] wide and more than [...] tall. Activity at Tehama lasted for approximately 200,000 years. Eruptions varied from ejection of pyroclastic material to andesitic lava flows built of olivine and other minerals.|$|E

2500|$|An eye is {{essentially}} a darkened chamber with a small hole in front that allows light to enter. The lens, just behind the pupil’s aperture, is perfectly clear but appears black because the interior space behind it is dark. Rays of light pass through the lens, producing an upside-down image on the retina. [...] The brain reorients the image. This optical process of projecting an inverted image {{is known as a}} camera obscura (from the Latin, meaning dark room). The first pinhole/camera obscura eyes evolved about 540 million years <b>ago</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sea mollusk, known as a nautilus, during the Cambrian period. The camera obscura principle is primordial, and life on earth has evolved to take advantage of it.|$|E
2500|$|While the Genesis and Super NES {{versions}} {{were generally}} held in high regard, {{some of the}} other versions were more poorly received. The PlayStation port, which contained the same content as the original releases, received a poor review [...] "3/10" [...] score from Computer and Video Games, due to there being no significant improvements despite the obviously more powerful hardware of the PlayStation. Similarly, Sega Saturn Magazine described Earthworm Jim 2 as an excellent game but derided the lack of advancements in the Saturn version, and summarized it as [...] "A great game - a year <b>ago.</b> <b>On</b> <b>a</b> different console." [...] A Next Generation critic was more forgiving of the lack of major enhancements, contending that [...] "the title is amazingly fun even on a machine designed for 3D gaming", though he acknowledged that those who had already played the Genesis or Super NES version would have no reason to play the game again on the Saturn. GamePros Major Mike disagreed, contending that changes such as the new backgrounds, remixed music, and loading screens make the game feel fresh and new.|$|E
