Internals began the 6xx series with the release of the 600n, multi-protocol card that supported TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, DLC/LLC, and AppleTalk over a token-ring network; along with the 1760x series external print server - also multi-protocol. An Ethernet version of the 600n was released in 1998. In 1999, the Jetdirect <b>autoswitch</b> was introduced.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the following question: Is {{it possible to}} migrate TCP/IP flows between different networks on modern mobile devices, without infrastructure support or protocol changes? To answer this question, we make three research contributions. (i) We report a comprehensive characterization of IP traffic on smartphones using traces collected from 27 iPhone 3 GS users for three months. (ii) Driven by {{the findings from the}} characterization, we devise two novel system mechanisms for mobile devices to support seamless flow migration without network support, and extensively evaluate their effectiveness using our field collected traces of real-life usage. Wait-n-Migrate leverages the fact that most flows are short lived. It establishes new flows on newly available networks but allows pre-existing flows on the old network to terminate naturally, effectively decreasing, or even eliminating, connectivity gaps during network switches. Resumption Agent takes advantage of the functionality integrated into many modern protocols to securely resume flows without application intervention. When combined, Wait-n-Migrate and Resumption Agent provide an unprecedented opportunity to immediately deploy performance and efficiency-enhancing policies that leverage multiple networks to improve the performance, efficiency, and connectivity of mobile devices. (iii) Finally, we report an iPhone 3 GS based implementation of these two system mechanisms and show that their overhead is negligible. Furthermore, we employ an example network switching policy, called <b>AutoSwitch,</b> to demonstrate their performance. <b>AutoSwitch</b> improves the Wi-Fi user experience by intelligently migrating TCP flows between Wi-Fi and cellular networks. Through traces and field measurements, we show that <b>AutoSwitch</b> reduces the number of user disruptions by an order of magnitude. In contrast, we show that brute-force switching would significantly increase user disruptions. 1...|$|E
40|$|Prediction {{uncertainty}} {{has rarely}} been integrated into traditional soft sensors in industrial processes. In this work, a novel <b>autoswitch</b> probabilistic soft sensor modeling method is proposed for online quality prediction of a whole industrial multigrade process with several steady-state grades and transitional modes. It is different from traditional deterministic soft sensors. Several single Gaussian process regression (GPR) models are first constructed for each steady-state grade. A new index is proposed to evaluate each GPR-based steady-state grade model. For the online prediction of a new sample, a prediction variance-based Bayesian inference method is proposed to explore the reliability of existing GPR-based steady-state models. The prediction can be achieved using the related steady-state GPR model if its reliability using this model is large enough. Otherwise, the query sample can be treated as in transitional modes and a local GPR model in a just-in-time manner is online built. Moreover, to improve the efficiency, detailed implementation steps of the <b>autoswitch</b> GPR soft sensors for a whole multigrade process are developed. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated and compared with other soft sensors in an industrial process in Taiwan, in terms of online quality prediction...|$|E
