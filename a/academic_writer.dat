Quantitative and textual analyses reveal that the American <b>academic</b> <b>writers</b> (AWs) preferred to be visible in their texts by employing a lot more hedges and boosters, while Turkish <b>academic</b> <b>writers</b> (TWs) opted to be invisible, preferring their studies to speak for themselves. Our results indicate, among other things, the influence of rhetorical practices, and epistemological beliefs, and the cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds of <b>academic</b> <b>writers</b> on their use of hedges and boosters. The findings of the study are discussed in relation to these aspects. ...|$|R

Critical theorist Douglas Kellner affirmed that with Sex [...] "Madonna became herself, an artifact of pop culture". French <b>academic</b> <b>writer</b> Georges Claude Guilbert (author of three books about Madonna) described Sex {{as one of the}} most successful publicity stunts in history whereas Russell W. Belk, author of Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, mentioned that the book is a quality product in marketing. In 1992, Madonna had generated more than US$500million ($ in [...] dollars) to Time Warner in sales of both albums and the Sex book, despite the negative feedback. However, Taraborrelli commented in his book, , that those [...] "who knew Madonna well at that time, knew what was really going on with her: the Sex book—and the outrageous antics that preceded it and would follow it—was really just something she used as a barrier between her and the rest of the world." [...] For years it had seemed to Madonna that both her personal and professional life was extremely scrutinized by the public and media, and although she had started this scrutinizing by her provocative works, she was tired of it. Being vexed at this interest in her personal life, Madonna fought back by creating the persona of a renegade, something so outrageous as to defy explanation, something found objectionable by most people. Taraborrelli said that in Madonna's view, [...] "she had no other way of fighting back". The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert analyzed the singer's provocative attempt in an article published in the newspaper: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Chinese studies expert Johan Lagerkvist, {{scholars}} Pierre Bourdieu and Michel de Certeau {{argue that}} this culture of satire is a weapon of resistance against authority. [...] This is because criticism against authority often resulted in satirical parodies that “presupposes and confirms emancipation” of the supposedly oppressed people. [...] <b>Academic</b> <b>writer</b> Linda Hutcheon argues that some people, however, may view satirical language used to criticize the government as “complicity,” which can “reinforce rather than subvert conservative attitudes.” Chinese experts Perry Link and Xiao Qiang, however, oppose this argument. They claimed that when sarcastic terms develop into common vocabulary of netizens, these terms would lose their sarcastic characteristic. They then become normal terms that carry significant political meanings that oppose the government. Xiao believes that the netizens’ freedom to spread information on the Internet has forced the government to listen to popular demands of netizens. For example, the Ministry of Information Technology’s plan to preinstall mandatory censoring software called Green Dam Youth Escort on computers failed after popular online opposition against it in 2009, {{the year of the}} 20th anniversary of the protest.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} builds upon {{empirical studies}} exploring {{the relationship among}} writing, gender, and identity {{in order to understand}} how women perceive themselves as <b>academic</b> <b>writers</b> and how they use their academic writing identities to help shape academic discourse communities. Specifically, I examine how women construct identities as <b>academic</b> <b>writers</b> within the sociopolitical climate of graduate education. Employing a feminist, praxis-oriented research design, I collaborated with four women in different graduate disciplines at a large, Northeastern research university to examine our experiences as women writing in graduate school and the identities we construct for ourselves as <b>academic</b> <b>writers.</b> Our relationships originated in the university Learning Center and data was gathered through a combination of learning instruction sessions, individual interviews, group conversations, and interviews with faculty members from each woman 2 ̆ 7 s academic department. ^ My analysis indicates that writing in graduate school is a contested space that students and faculty read through various interpretive frames, including (1) students 2 ̆ 7 authoritative identities, (2) students 2 ̆ 7 goals for graduate study, (3) student and faculty perceptions of academic discourse, and (4) student and faculty expectations for working relationships. As the co-researchers and I negotiated these diverse, often competing, discourses, we constructed our identities as <b>academic</b> <b>writers.</b> Through a combination of rhetorical strategies and social networks, we positioned ourselves along a continuum of reproducing or reconstructing dominant ways of knowing and being known. Based on my findings, I conclude that women who model their discourse practices on exemplary texts, and identify mentors who share their values, styles, and agendas as <b>academic</b> <b>writers,</b> are best able to construct writing identities that reflect their personal values and goals. ^ The findings of this study have implications for students, faculty, and academic support staff. Although this inquiry focuses specifically on women writing in graduate school, both men and women benefit from understanding the circumstances and choices that shape their identities as <b>academic</b> <b>writers.</b> I also explore implications for advising services and conversations that might facilitate meaningful dialogue between professors and students about writing in their disciplines. Finally, I offer suggestions for how academic support staff can engage students in reflective conversations and help them develop writing strategies that may enhance their academic writing identities. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Metadiscourse markers as rhetorical devices {{refer to}} ‘self-reflective {{linguistic}} expressions’ (Hyland, 2004) {{that make the}} writers more powerful in interaction. Since metadiscourse is a rhetorical device, it could be different based on the user’s culture and mother tongue. In this study, three groups of research articles including native English (NE), native Persian (NP), and non-native English (NNE) articles (written by Iranian academics) were analyzed based on Hyland and Tse’s (2004) taxonomy plus two metadiscourse strategies by Abdi et al. (2010). The {{difference between the two}} cultures of English and Persian represented in texts was examined in terms of the impact of English as L 2 on the non-native English research articles written by Iranian <b>academic</b> <b>writers.</b> To find the significant difference among the three corpora, the researchers used chi-square test. The findings of analyzing about 9000 lines of 26 published research articles on ELT and theoretical linguistics revealed the native Persian <b>academic</b> <b>writers</b> used interactive metadiscourse markers in their L 1 writings more than the native English and non-native English <b>academic</b> <b>writers</b> (Iranian) whereas they used the least number of interactional metadiscourse (with the exception of self mentions). It was interesting that Persian <b>academic</b> <b>writers</b> used the most number of interactional metadiscourse markers when they wrote in L 2 (English). Regarding the other variable of the study i. e. gender, the findings further proved no relevance between gender and metadiscourse marker...|$|R
