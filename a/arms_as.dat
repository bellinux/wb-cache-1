5|$|As Sovereign, Victoria {{used the}} royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom. Before her accession, she {{received}} no grant of <b>arms.</b> <b>As</b> she could not succeed to the throne of Hanover, her arms did not carry the Hanoverian symbols that were used by her immediate predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on the throne.|$|E
5|$|Plain arms {{also often}} {{function}} as a disguise for major characters. In the Chrétien de Troyes' Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, Lancelot bears plain red <b>arms</b> <b>as</b> a disguise.

5|$|Ashmole {{became one}} of the {{founding}} Fellows of the Royal Society in 1661, but he was not very active in the society. His most significant appointment was to the College of <b>Arms</b> <b>as</b> Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary in June 1660.

5|$|Carnotaurus {{is one of}} the best-understood genera of the Abelisauridae, {{a family}} of large theropods {{restricted}} to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana, replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents. Several notable traits that evolved within this family, including shortening of the skull and <b>arms</b> <b>as</b> well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae, were more pronounced in Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{every citizen}} {{has the right}} to {{petition}} the Crown for a grant of arms. Canadians who have been appointed to the Order of Canada are automatically entitled to receive an award of arms including the ribbon of the Order, or should they already be armigerous, to encircle their extant arms with the ribbon. Amongst others, all members of the Privy Council are entitled to supporters in their <b>arms,</b> <b>as</b> are the Speakers of the House of Commons and the Senate, Companions of the Order of Canada, Commanders of the Orders of Military Merit, Merit of the Police Forces, and of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E

5|$|In the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, {{the most}} senior non-commissioned ranks wear the 1957 version of the coat of <b>arms</b> <b>as</b> a badge of rank, {{representing}} {{the fact that they}} have received the Queen's warrant (as opposed |to the Queen's commission for officers). The revised 1957 and 1994 Arms of Canada are both protected official government symbols used to represent the state under the Federal Identity Program. Permanent resident cards issued from 2015 feature a holographic representation of the 1957 version of the coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's fame {{within his}} own {{lifetime}} was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his <b>arms</b> <b>as</b> he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 handgun ban {{violated}} {{the right to}} keep and bear <b>arms</b> <b>as</b> protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E

5|$|Roman Catholic {{bishops in}} England {{historically}} used only their personal <b>arms,</b> <b>as</b> dioceses {{established by the}} See of Rome {{are not part of}} the official state Church of England and cannot be recognized in law, though in Scotland the legal situation has been different and many Roman Catholic dioceses have arms. If a suffragan or auxiliary bishop has a personal coat of arms, he does not combine it with the arms of the diocese he serves.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his <b>arms</b> <b>as</b> a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
