25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its <b>average</b> <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> To get an {{intuitive}} understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new information; these are just different ways of saying that the a priori entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.|$|E

40|$|Fuzzy logic-based {{histogram}} equalization (FHE) is proposed for image contrast enhancement. The FHE {{consists of two}} stages. First, fuzzy histogram is computed based on fuzzy set theory to handle the inexactness of gray level values {{in a better way}} compared to classical crisp histograms. In the second stage, the fuzzy histogram is divided into two subhistograms based on the median value of the original image and then equalizes them independently to preserve image brightness. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of proposed FHE algorithm are evaluated using two well-known parameters like <b>average</b> <b>information</b> <b>contents</b> (AIC) and natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) index for various images. From the qualitative and quantitative measures, it is interesting to see that this proposed method provides optimum results by giving better contrast enhancement and preserving the local information of the original image.

The effect of this variable is tested on the data from nine typologically diverse languages while controlling for a number of other well-known parameters: word frequency and average word predictability based on the preceding and following words.

The equivalence between global optimization by convolution smoothing and the convolution by the kernel in Parzen windowing is also discussed.

We have analyzed three established lexica of affective word usage in English, German, and Spanish, to verify that these lexica have a neutral, unbiased, emotional content. Taking into account the frequency of word usage, we find that words with a positive emotional content are more frequently used. This lends support to Pollyanna hypothesis [3] {{that there should be}} a positive bias in human expression. We also find that negative words contain more information than positive words, as the informativeness of a word increases uniformly with its valence decrease. Our findings support earlier conjectures about (i) the relation between word frequency and information content, and (ii) the impact of positive emotions on communication and social links.|$|E
30|$|The left {{column of}} Figure 3 shows how valence {{decreases}} with {{the estimation of}} the information content for each context size.

The color of each bar represents the average valence of the binned words. The decrease of average valence with information content is similar for estimations using 2 -grams and 3 -grams. For the case of 4 -grams it also decreases for English and Spanish, but this trend is not so clear for German. These trends are properly quantified by Pearson’s correlation coefficients between valence and information content for each context size (Table 1). Each correlation coefficient becomes smaller for larger sizes of the context, as the information content estimation includes a larger context but becomes less accurate.|$|E
40|$|The {{stretched}} exponential function, [-(t/τ_K) ^β], describes various relaxation processes {{while it}} has been suggested that the power exponent, β is derived from the non-uniformity of the process. In this paper, we attempted to estimate this non-uniformity by introducing Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy evaluates the <b>average</b> <b>information</b> <b>contents</b> of the distribution function, which reflects statistical homogeneity. We investigated the relaxation process of shear induced multilamellar system, which is described with the stretched exponential function. Three types of shear (constant, square, sine) at different frequencies are attempted in order to determine their effects on the relaxation process. We found that the Shannon entropy to which the first moment was introduced is maximized at β = 1 : a single exponential. The Shannon entropy of sine shear experiments exhibited the frequency dependence. Thus it is interpreted that the increase of the intensity of shearing and the thermodynamic entropy are reflected on the Shannon entropy. We discussed the meaning of the maximum Shannon entropy in terms of various points of view, it was found that it corresponds to the diffusion process free from the restriction such as geometrical constraints. The constraints and the non-uniformity of process were successfully estimated by Shannon entropy. This study gives a new insight of entropy in general...|$|R
