5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{troubles}} delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials {{worried that}} high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds {{to complete the}} Green Line, forcing Maryland to pay these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation had created a $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget. By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> repeated delays in building the Green Line. In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the Green Line be sped up.|$|E

But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater.

5|$|During filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, {{the local}} mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest {{because he was}} <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> filmmakers' {{portrayal}} of the Antofagasta Region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area. Michael G. Wilson explained that Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems, and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific. In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper La Segunda, 75% of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image of Chile they felt it presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film {{in the country in}} the future.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{a visionary}} who {{produced}} designs and ideas {{far ahead of}} their time. He {{was the first to}} describe vapor-compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805, but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example. Similarly, he drew up designs for a solar boiler, machine gun, steam-carriage gearshift, dough-kneading machine, perpetual baking oven, marine salvage process, quadruple-effect evaporator, and a scheme for urban gas lighting, ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death. Evans had influential backers and political allies, but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers. Disappointed and then <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> perceived lack of recognition for his contributions, Evans became combative and bitter in later years, which damaged his reputation and left him isolated. Despite the importance of his work, his contributions were frequently overlooked (or attributed to others after his death) so he never became a household name alongside the other steam pioneers of his era.|$|E
5|$|In 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on {{the death}} of Charles Stewart Parnell. His father was <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{treatment}} of Parnell by the Catholic church, the Irish Home Rule Party and the British Liberal Party and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the British Conservative Party to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce. The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the Vatican Library. In November of that same year, John Joyce was entered in Stubbs' Gazette (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Waters contributed {{songs and}} a score to the soundtrack of the {{animated}} movie When the Wind Blows, {{based on the}} Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band. In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who {{has the ability to}} physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. <b>Angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> state {{of the world in which}} he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 860, {{along with}} Karbeas, ʿUmar {{launched}} a major raid into Anatolia which reached the Black Sea port of Sinope, returning with over 12,000 head of captured livestock. Three years later, {{he was part}} of a major Abbasid force that invaded Anatolia through the Cilician Gates. After splitting off from the main force and repulsing a Byzantine army under Emperor Michael III at Mardj al-Usquf ("Bishop's Meadow") in Cappadocia, ʿUmar with his men headed north to sack the port city of Amisos. On his return, however, he was encircled by the Byzantines and killed at the Battle of Lalakaon on September 3, 863. Only a splinter of his army escaped under his son, but was then defeated and captured by the commander of the Charsianon district. According to al-Tabari, when the news of ʿUmar's death, along with that of another celebrated leader, Ali ibn Yahya al-Armani, arrived in Iraq, they provoked riots among the populace of Baghdad, Samarra, and other cities, <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid government's perceived incompetence.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season as a {{full-time}} MLB umpire, West umpired the game in which Willie McCovey hit his 500th career home run. In the same year, he was at first base when Pete Rose tied the NL record for most consecutive games with a hit, {{and he was the}} home plate umpire when Rose broke it the following day. In 1981, West worked first base for Nolan Ryan’s fifth career no-hitter. On October 13, 1981, West was 28 when he became the youngest NL umpire to call an LCS. In 1983, West was suspended for three days and fined US$500 after a shoving incident with Atlanta Braves manager Joe Torre. The manager became <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of a game and followed West into the walkway outside the umpires dressing room. West then shoved Torre. On appeal, NL President Chub Feeney reduced West's fine to $300. Torre also received a fine stemming from the incident.|$|E

She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off.

She was taken to a police building in nearby Fountainbridge for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street. She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much of the blame for the murders on Hare.|$|E

5|$|Herbert de Losinga was {{appointed}} a papal legate in 1093 by Pope UrbanII {{to investigate the}} matter of Thomas' profession of obedience to Lanfranc. Herbert seems to have done nothing about investigating the issue. Also in 1093, King WilliamII gave the Archbishops of York the right to appoint the Abbot of Selby Abbey in compensation {{for the loss of}} York's claim to the Diocese of Lincoln. While Anselm was in exile after quarrelling with the King in 1097, Thomas consecrated Herbert de Losinga as Bishop of Norwich, Ralph de Luffa to the See of Chichester, and Hervey le Breton as Bishop of Bangor, an unusual step because these dioceses were in Canterbury's province, and it was Anselm's right to consecrate the new bishops. In 1100 after the sudden death of King WilliamII and the seizure of power by the King's younger brother Henry, Thomas arrived in London too late to crown HenryI, as the ceremony had already been performed by Maurice, Bishop of London, in the absence of both archbishops. Anselm at this time was still in exile. Thomas was initially <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> slight, until it was explained to him that the King had worried over the chance of disorder in the kingdom if there was a delay. To mollify him, Thomas was allowed to crown the King publicly at a church council held soon after the coronation.|$|E
