5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his life}} Whorf was a {{chemical}} engineer by profession, {{but as a}} young man he took up an interest in linguistics. At first this interest drew him to the study of Biblical Hebrew, but he quickly went on to study the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica on his own. Professional scholars were impressed by his work and in 1930 he received <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> study the Nahuatl language in Mexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the language at linguistics conferences.|$|E
5|$|To {{help the}} Apalachicola Bay {{shellfish}} industry recover, special regulations {{were put in}} place to monitor harvests, and $2 million was designated toward rehabilitation efforts. Using a portion of the funds, out-of-work oyster catchers were employed to repopulate crucial reefs. The state of Florida also issued <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> help individuals in the crippled seafood industry make necessary payments. Efforts to help newly unemployed individuals in the shellfish industry continued in the months following the storm; local Tallahassee musicians organized a benefit concert in January 1986 to raise money for families of oystermen in Franklin County.|$|E

5|$|York City F.C. ceased {{ownership}} of their Bootham Crescent {{ground in the}} summer of 1999, after the club's real property assets were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings. The club secured a £2million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) to buy the ground in February 2004. The terms of this loan required the club to identify a site for a new stadium by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. Once plans for a new stadium were in place, the loan would turn into <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> assist in funding the relocation.|$|E
5|$|As {{dozens of}} newly {{unemployed}} professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their {{colleagues in the}} United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them.

5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th {{and early}} 13th centuries the advowson (the right to appoint the vicar) {{of the church}} was held jointly by two local landowning families, the deBolbec (or deBolebec) and Sifrewast families; as a very large parish (generally {{considered}} {{to have been the}} largest parish in Buckinghamshire) twin administrations suited the needs of the parish. Following the civil wars of the reign of King Stephen(1135–1154) England underwent a major upsurge in religious activity and saw a significant growth of monasteries. At some point prior to 1221 the deBolbec family had included their half of the advowson in <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> the Cistercians of Woburn Abbey, and the Sifrewasts had granted their half to the Augustinian Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis in Leicester. From then on, Woburn and Leicester were to share the patronage, each appointing their own vicars to the parish, known as Chesham Woburn and Chesham Leicester.|$|E
5|$|Morgan married George Beavis in 1965 and {{had three}} daughters, {{all of whom}} enjoyed {{swimming}} victories at school and district level. After her marriage, she lived in the Outback towns of Griffith and Orange for six years before returning to Sydney. She experimented with coaching, but found the competition unappealing and became a schoolteacher. In 1978, she began teaching handicapped children to swim in her backyard pool, and was given a government grant to continue her work. She then ran a swimming school at Bonnet Bay for 15 years and worked at the Bates Drive Special School, receiving <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> teach preschool handicapped children swimming.

5|$|Only twenty originals, copies, or {{abstract}} {{versions of}} royal charters of {{the kings of}} the Crovan dynasty are known. Of these, only three date to the reign of Magnúsone of which, <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> Conishead Priory in 1256, is the only original royal charter of the dynasty in existence. Important devices attached to royal charters were double-sided waxen seals, used to authentic such instruments. Although no seals of the dynasty now survive, there exists several seventeenth- and eighteenth-century descriptions and depictions of ones believed to have belonged to Magnús' uncle Rǫgnvaldr, and brother Haraldr. This limited evidence suggests that, in the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries, the kings of the dynasty bore a sailing ship upon their seals, which would have likely represented the clinker-built galley utilised in the Isles at the time. Borne by men whose strength lay {{in the power of}} armed galley-fleets, such a symbol would have represented their authority in the Isles.|$|E
5|$|The National Assembly for Wales {{announced}} on 6 November 2007 {{that it was}} {{to pay off the}} outstanding loan of £13.5million from HSBC and also increase the annual funding.

This grant however does not include a grant of a badge, supporters or a standard, their inclusion into the grant requires extra fees. The fees mainly go towards commissioning the artwork and calligraphy on the vellum Letters Patent, which must be done by hand and in a sense a work of art in itself, plus other administrative costs borne by the heralds and for the upkeep of the College.|$|E

The Badge is blazoned A Tortoise displayed the shell circular Azure charged with two concentric annulets Argent. The grant is formulated to provide the College, the Boat Club, and the Oriel Society (Oriel's Alumni society) use of the badge in relation to Tortoise Club alumni activities; the Tortoise Club is not itself an incorporated entity and does not bear Arms in its own right; therefore {{it could not be}} granted such a heraldic Badge directly.|$|E
5|$|Dolan was {{dismissed}} in May 2003, the new board citing financial {{reasons for his}} departure. At 27 years, York player Chris Brass was appointed player-manager in June 2003, which made him the youngest Football League managerial appointment since 1946. The club's lease of Bootham Crescent was extended to May 2004, and plans proceeded to develop Huntington Stadium ahead of a possible move, but problems bringing the ground to Football League standards were encountered. The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent, and they bought the site in February 2004 {{after six months of}} negotiations. The deal came after York were lent £2million by The Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF), with which they bought 75.89% of BCH shares and all of the 20,000 shares owned by Persimmon. Once plans for a new stadium were settled, the loan would be converted <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>to</b> help fund the move. York equalled a club record by winning the first four matches of 2003–04, and by mid January 2004 were 10th in the table. They won none of their final 20 fixtures, garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division. York were relegated to the Conference National after 75 years of Football League membership. Beck renounced his title of chairman in September 2004 because he favoured a more democratic approach for a fan-owned club. The board was restructured and Jason McGill became the managing director.|$|E
