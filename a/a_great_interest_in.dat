5|$|Though Parry had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> music, {{he had no}} {{opportunity}} to study it until there was a temporary closure of the Rough and Ready Iron Works. Some of his co-workers were also musicians, and they offered music lessons while the iron works was closed. Parry joined a music sight-reading class taught {{by one of the}} men. He continued to study harmony with another co-worker, and learned how to read and write while he was learning about harmony.|$|E
5|$|Britten's {{other works}} range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and {{instrumental}} {{as well as}} film music. He took <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera Noye's Fludde, a Missa Brevis, and the song collection Friday Afternoons. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears; others included Kathleen Ferrier, Jennifer Vyvyan, Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian Bream, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record.

5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often only going to bed at 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} year of his life, George was the only heir to the German territories of his father and three childless uncles. George's brother, Frederick Augustus, was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as Görgen and Gustchen by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent for almost a year (1664–65) during a long convalescent holiday in Italy, but corresponded {{regularly}} with her sons' governess and took <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> their upbringing, even more so upon her return. Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{evidence}} of industrial unrest targeted at Churchill's activities until the 1970s, there was concern about the possibility during the inter-war years, and the probability of none occurring at all is unlikely. The Economic League was established as a right-wing organisation, consisting mainly of employers, to counteract the rise in communist and socialist propaganda and its associated activities during the Great War. Support for the League was particularly strong among the engineering companies in the Manchester area. While workers in the cotton industries, for example, seemed not generally to take <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the Communist Party, left-wing educational groups and shop-floor agitators, those in the engineering industry—perhaps mostly more intelligent—did do so, and the apparent threat to capitalism and private wealth was more evident to the employers of such people. Among the League's less publicised, more nefarious activities was that of intelligence gathering and the promotion of systematic blacklisting methods. It co-operated with the police and government, infiltrated left-wing groups and used information from disaffected ex-supporters of such groups in order to obtain information about what it considered to be dangerous elements and tendencies, and disseminated the knowledge obtained, usually in a confidential manner. The Churchill Machine Tool Co was one of several companies which during 1936–37 was a recipient of information concerning reports of meetings held by anti-capitalist groups, the past and current activities of particular workers and even the names of those specifically blacklisted. Others who received the information at this time included A V Roe, Ferranti, Metropolitan-Vickers and Fairey Aviation.|$|E

50|$|Men {{have been}} found to have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{uncommitted}} sex compared to women. Some research shows this interest to be more sociological than biological. Men have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> visual sexual stimuli than women. However, additional trends {{have been found}} with <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> sensitivity to partner status in women choosing a sexual partner and men placing <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> emphasis on physical attractiveness in a potential mate, as well as <b>a</b> significantly <b>greater</b> tendency toward sexual jealousy in men and emotional jealousy in women.|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, after a {{brief period}} in which the media {{coverage}} generated <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the Beta Israel community, the interest among the Jewish communities world wide declined. This happened mainly because serious doubts still remained about the Jewishness of the Beta Israel community and because the Alliance Israélite Universelle organization did not comply with Halévy's recommendations.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of his studies in Munich, Liège and Paris, Gianni Caproni {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the fine arts. For some time before 1910, although his interest in painting and sculpture was intense, he decided that aviation would become the focus of his professional activity. Caproni, however, didn't lose the artistic sensibility he had acquired thanks to the influences of mitteleuropean secessions and avant-garde movements.|$|E
25|$|Soon after World War II, {{problems}} with his eyes which had begun in 1941-2 led to Mead becoming totally blind, but he never complained about this.

25|$|The {{study of}} the Hakka people first drew {{attention}} to Chinese and foreign scholars, missionaries, travellers and writers during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era {{in the middle of}} the nineteen century. Many wanted to know more about the Hakka people who had started the Taiping Rebellion which almost overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Ernest John Eitel, a prominent German missionary, was one of those who took <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> this area.|$|E
