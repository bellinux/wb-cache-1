5|$|There {{had been}} limited affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> before. However, these mostly {{focused on the}} civil service, as Article 153 of the Constitution did. Admission to higher {{education}} was largely merit-based. The Tunku government preferred laissez-faire policies, minimising economic intervention. Although some agencies, such as the Rural Industrial Development Agency (RIDA), which attempted to aid Malay entrepreneurs, existed, their programs were criticised as being based on handouts and favouring the politically connected. RIDA was renamed as the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (The Indigenous People's Trust Council) or MARA in 1965, and came to symbolise the development of Malay entrepreneurship.|$|E

In addition, both groups opposed affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> that might give preference to non-Coloured Black people, and some Coloured people feared giving up older privileges, such as access to municipal jobs, if African National Congress gained leadership in the government.|$|E

[...] The speech itself was framed in terms of equality and pragmatism, arguing for dispensing with affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> and poorly understood references in legislation to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, and ending the alleged [...] "Treaty of Waitangi Grievance Industry". [...] His speech was criticised by lecturer and political writer Jon Johansson: [...] "Whether intended or not, the Orewa speech reinforced the ignorant and racist stereotype that Māori were 'savages' before the 'gift' of European civilisation was visited upon them." ...|$|E
