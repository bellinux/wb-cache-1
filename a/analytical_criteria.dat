50|$|Choon-Soo Ryu {{is known}} as world class {{architect}} with oriental sensitivity and western rationality. His working style is somewhat unusual. Young architects concentrate in <b>analytical</b> <b>criteria,</b> whereas he approaches in intuitive and integrated way of design. His design approach of integrating rational thinking and formative solution is often referred as oriental approach. He does every work from initial sketch to final design. As a result, his architectural insights and scopes are very wide, that his projects include small residential buildings, subway station, major sports facilities, and skyscrapers. In his works, both orientalism and modernism coexists. The only reason, that both tradition and high-tech exist in his works, is mutual function of two factors through integration. His balance of oriental sensitivity and western rationality is well shown in 868 Towers in China and Seoul World Cup Stadium.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is presented for combining analytical and similarity-based CBR. Analytical CBR permits transfer {{from a source}} problem to a target only if the "analytical criterion" is satisfied, namely, that the justification for the source solution also hold in the target. This strategy has the merit of preventing "unsound" analogies, but is infeasible when no complete, correct domain theory is known. When a partial theory {{is all that is}} available, the <b>analytical</b> <b>criterion</b> becomes merely a heuristic. Similaritybased CBR can be called upon to supplement the heuristic; a similarity metric chooses which source is best among those that pass the <b>analytical</b> <b>criterion.</b> The <b>analytical</b> <b>criterion</b> helps guide the metric toward relevant features to match on. Aside from improved analogical judgements, the combination of analytical and similarity-based CBR supports efficient case retrieval.

40|$|Abstract While {{earlier studies}} {{examined}} reader comprehension, this {{paper in the}} field of written healthcare communication focuses on potential reader response for original English and translated German patient information leaflets (PILs) and hence patient behaviour. For that purpose the cultural dimension of Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) as a measure of controlling future events following Hofstede (2001) was examined. Hofstede‚Äôs study reveals a markedly higher UA index for Germany than for the UK. For this paper UA was defined in terms of <b>analytical</b> <b>criteria</b> which include aspects of epistemic and deontic modality, writer-reader relation and external role relation (ERRO), (causal) explicitation, as well as degrees of explicitness and subjectivity, and explicit uncertainty markers (EUMs). The translation corpus consists of two sections (one informative and one instructive) from 10 PILs (9, 659 words) for medicines treating hypertension and insomnia, taken from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The findings show matching values for the <b>analytical</b> <b>criteria</b> in the English source text PILs and the German translated PILs to a considerable extent, albeit a higher frequency of explicit uncertainty markers and causal explicitation, and a somewhat higher degree of objectivity in the German PILs. These results, and the paucity of translation shifts for the <b>analytical</b> <b>criteria,</b> may, however, partly be attributed to close translation practice which otherwise transpires in literally translated, unidiomatic phrases in the German PILs. This may raise questions of suitability of translation practice for reader response and patient behaviour with written healthcare communication, notably also for texts in more culturally diverse language communities. status: publishe...|$|E

Our approach is demonstrated upon a population comparison, taken on various measurement dates, that focuses on a wild population and a laboratory population of Golden Hamsters. The selected example is particularly suited {{due to the fact}} that ‚Äì aside from the actual growth function of interest ‚Äì additional fixed (e. g. effect of different mating periods, litter size) and random factors (e. g. maternal environment, repeated performances per animal) must be considered.
