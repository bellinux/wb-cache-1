PageRank is Google’s indication of its assessment of the reputation of a webpage: It is non-keyword specific.

25|$|The {{search engine}} results page (SERP) {{is the actual}} result {{returned}} by a search engine in response to <b>a</b> <b>keyword</b> query. The SERP consists of a list of links to web pages with associated text snippets. The SERP rank of a web page refers to {{the placement of the}} corresponding link on the SERP, where higher placement means higher SERP rank. The SERP rank of a web page is a function not only of its PageRank, but of a relatively large and continuously adjusted set of factors (over 200). Search engine optimization (SEO) is aimed at influencing the SERP rank for a website or a set of web pages.|$|E

25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using <b>a</b> <b>keyword</b> or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.|$|E

Ranking it as the 77th top SNES game in 2011, IGN commented that while Shadowrun [...] "didn't quite get away from all the common RPG stereotypes" [...] it was still [...] "a milestone for the introduction of film noir style into the gaming industry, though, so we can forgive the game for only being 90% groundbreaking." [...] The game was also cited as an important milestone in the use of film noir style in video games by Game Informer, according to which [...] "Shadowruns moody music and dark streets set the somber tone for this RPG's prying conversations and self-reflective narrative." [...] Game Informer also ranked Shadowrun as 125th place on their list of best video games of all time in 2009. IGN Australia listed Shadowrun among their favourite Australian video games in 2010, writing it was [...] "without question, one of the best underexposed classics of the SNES era" [...] because it presented players with [...] "a mature narrative, strong characters and a dystopian backdrop" [...] blended with traditional RPG elements in an [...] "irresistible" [...] way. That same year, 1UP.com included Shadowrun on their list of 15 games [...] "ahead of their time" [...] for its use of <b>a</b> <b>keyword</b> dialogue system, common to PC games but foreign to console games of the time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum {{created a}} program which {{appeared}} to pass the Turing test. The program, known as ELIZA, worked by examining a user's typed comments for keywords. If <b>a</b> <b>keyword</b> is found, a rule that transforms the user's comments is applied, and the resulting sentence is returned. If <b>a</b> <b>keyword</b> is not found, ELIZA responds either with a generic riposte or by repeating one of the earlier comments. In addition, Weizenbaum developed ELIZA to replicate the behaviour of a Rogerian psychotherapist, allowing ELIZA to be [...] "free to assume the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world." [...] With these techniques, Weizenbaum's program was able to fool some people into believing that they were talking to a real person, with some subjects being [...] "very hard to convince that ELIZA [...] is not human." [...] Thus, ELIZA is claimed {{by some to be}} one of the programs (perhaps the first) able to pass the Turing Test, even though this view is highly contentious (see below).|$|E

Credit for the result was instead given to Friedrich Kasiski, a Prussian infantry officer, who made the same discovery some years later. However, in 1854, Babbage published the solution of a Vigenère cipher, which had been published previously in the Journal of the Society of Arts.
