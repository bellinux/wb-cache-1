During this phase of training, the horse’s speed and duration of exercise allows for steady state heart rates below 150 to 170 beats per minute, which is the anaerobic threshold. The horse’s speed increases at these heart rates as the horse becomes more fit. Also, recovery heart rates will occur faster as the horse becomes more fit. A horse in good <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition</b> will have recovery heart rate around 100 beats per minute at two minutes post exercise when exercising at rates to induce heart rates near the anaerobic threshold. Recovery heart rates at 10 minutes post exercise should be less than 60 beats per minute.|$|E
5000|$|Strip till warms the soil, {{it allows}} an <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition,</b> {{and it allows}} for a better seedbed than no-till. Strip-till allows the soil’s {{nutrients}} to be better adapted to the plant’s needs, while still giving residue cover to the soil between the rows. The system will still allow for some soil water contact that could cause erosion, however, the amount of erosion on a strip-tilled field would be light compared {{to the amount of}} erosion on an intensively tilled field. Furthermore, when liquid fertilizer is being applied, it can be directly applied in these rows where the seed is being planted, reducing the amount of fertilizer needed while improving proximity of the fertilizer to the roots. Compared to intensive tillage, strip tillage saves considerable time and money. Strip tillage can reduce the amount of trips through a field down to two or possibly one trip when using a strip till implement combined with other machinery such as a planter, fertilizer spreader, and chemical sprayer. This can save the farmer a considerable amount of time and fuel, while reducing soil compaction due to few passes in a field. With the use of GPS-guided tractors, this precision farming can increase overall yields. [...] Strip-till conserves more soil moisture compared to intensive tillage systems. However, compared to no-till, strip-till may in some cases reduce soil moisture.|$|E

Improper discharge of effluents containing azo dyes and their metabolites into the water bodies are detrimental as it generates highly coloured wastewater, and releases compounds that can be toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic to living organisms. The acclimatised BAC-ZS mixed culture was able to decolourise azo dye, Acid Orange 7 (AO 7) in a sequential facultative anaerobic-aerobic condition. The whole genome sequencing showed two possible enzymes are associated with decolourisation and degradation of AO 7 which are azoreductase and NADH peroxidase. Both azoreductase and NADH peroxidase were produced intracellularly during treatment of AO 7 using the sequential facultative anaerobicaerobic condition. The maximum activity of azoreductase was obtained during the facultative anaerobic condition while the maximum activity of NADH peroxidase was obtained during the <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition.</b> During the facultative anaerobic condition (2 hours of static condition), azoreductase activity was about 2 fold (0. 013 U/mg) higher than aerobic conditions which only produced specific activity of 0. 006 U/mg.

Includes bibliographical references (page 25 - 27). Textile industry is one amongst the most chemically intensive industries {{on the face of}} the earth and the major contaminator of potable water. It produces huge amounts of different complex chemical substances as a part of unused materials that includes dye in the form of wastewater throughout various stages of textile processing. The direct discharge of this wastewater into surroundings affects its ecological status by inflicting various undesirable changes. Bacteria isolated from the textile sludge (soil) sample and inoculated into screening media containing different types of textile dye in <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition</b> to attain the biodegradability of the dye. Within 24 hours of incubation, this strain proved to be a good decolorizer of the dye. Most preferable pH and temperature for dye degradation were pH 7 - 7. 8 and 29 - 32 °c under <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition.</b> Various nutrient sources such as sodium chloride, beef extract, yeast extract, or peptone strongly boost the decolorization / degradation process and the bacterial efficiency. All the samples showed positive results for the decolorization of the dyes. Under <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition,</b> color of all the dyes reduced by the bacterial biomass that leads to biodegradation.

Thus, {{the ability of}} C. jejuni to survive under oxygen-rich conditions may significantly impact C. jejuni viability in food and food safety as well. In this study, we investigated the impact of oxidative stress resistance on the survival of C. jejuni under <b>aerobic</b> <b>conditions</b> by examining three mutants defective in key antioxidant genes, including ahpC, katA, and sodB. All the three mutants exhibited growth reduction under <b>aerobic</b> <b>conditions</b> compared to the wild type (WT), and the ahpC mutant showed the most significant growth defect. The CFU reduction in the mutants was recovered to the WT level by complementation. Higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were accumulated in C. jejuni under <b>aerobic</b> <b>conditions</b> than microaerobic conditions, and supplementation of culture media with an antioxidant recovered the growth of C. jejuni. The levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were significantly increased in the mutants compared to WT.

The stoichiometry of nitrate consumption was 0. 75 (± 0. 10) electron equivalents (eeq) of NO 3 − per eeq of CM, {{which is consistent with}} the yield when it is expressed on an eeq basis. Nitrate was stoichiometrically converted to dinitrogen (0. 51 ± 0. 05 mol of N 2 per mol of NO 3 −). The stoichiometry of oxygen use with CM (0. 85 ± 0. 21 eeq of O 2 per eeq of CM) was also consistent with the aerobic yield. Stoichiometric release of chloride and minimal accumulation of soluble metabolic products (measured as chemical oxygen demand) following CM consumption, under anoxic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>conditions,</b> indicated complete biodegradation of CM. Acetylene did not inhibit CM use under <b>aerobic</b> <b>conditions,</b> implying that a monooxygenase was not involved in initiating aerobic CM metabolism. Under anoxic conditions, the maximum specific CM utilization rate (k) for NB 1 was 5. 01 (± 0. 06) μmol of CM mg of TSS− 1 day− 1, the maximum specific growth rate (μmax) was 0. 0506 day− 1, and the Monod half-saturation coefficient (Ks) was 0. 067 (± 0. 004) μM.

The results obtained can be summarized as follows : In the experiment for about two weeks, the degree of the development of the toxicity symptoms resulting a from salinization was significantly greater in the plants under the anaerobic condition than under the <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition</b> at the critical level of concentration for growth but at higher concentration than above, the difference was not significant. This relationship was equally shown in the reduction of top and root growth, hydration ratio and number of leaves. It was shown strikingly that sodium accumulation in leaf blades was lower under the <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition</b> than under the anaerobic condition. The accumulation of the other elements decreased in the plants treated by saline solution under the <b>aerobic</b> <b>condition,</b> but under anaerobic condition this relationship was not clear. In regard to the growth and maturity on the polder fields, {{it was found that the}} yield of wheat as backcrops on the paddy field was extremely poor than that of either upland wheat or of wheat at the field cultivated for the first time in spite of the lapse of the same time after reclamation from sea. It was also found that leaf length, leaf width and size of stoma on top leaves were significantly reduced and found at the same time that the number of stomata increased on wheat as backcrops on the paddy fields. The percentage of air space and porosity in the soils of upper layer on the fields after harvesting rice were distinctly smaller than that on the other fields.
