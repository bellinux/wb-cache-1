5|$|<b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found {{a special}} surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers {{in the colony}} with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E

In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct <b>a</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E

5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E

Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E

5|$|The {{number and}} value of {{contracts}} coming to the station significantly increased during World War II; the 1943–1944 budget {{was the first in}} which industry and government contracts exceeded the station's other income, most notably, its state appropriation. Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station's appropriation by 40%, but increased support from industry and government eventually compensated for lower state funding. World War II is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially telecommunications and electronic warfare; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research.

5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored research, with the 1943–1944 budget being the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state appropriation).

5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. <b>A</b> <b>study</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E

Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also conducted a study concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements {{are associated with the}} Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative {{that came out of the}} study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.|$|E
