25|$|Ibn Taymiyyah {{continued}} to face troubles for his views which {{were found to}} be at odds with those of his contemporaries. His strong opposition to what he believed to be un-Islamic innovation (bid‘ah), caused upset among the prominent Sufis of Egypt including Ibn `Ata'Allah and Karim al-Din al-Amuli, and the locals who started to protest against Ibn Taymiyyah. The nature of the point under contention was Ibn Taymiyyah's stance on tawassul (intercession). In his view a person could not <b>ask</b> <b>anyone</b> other than God for help except on the day of judgement when intercession in his view would be possible. At the time, the people did not restrict intercession to just the day of judgement but rather they said it was allowed in other cases. Due to this Ibn Taymiyyah, now 45, was ordered to appear before the Shafii judge Badr al-Din in March 1308 and was questioned on his stance regarding intercession. Thereafter, he was incarcerated in the prison of the judges in Cairo for some months. After his release, he was allowed to return to Syria, should he so wish. Ibn Taymiyyah however stayed in Egypt for a further 5 years.|$|E
500|$|Carey co-wrote and co-produced {{the song}} [...] "Whenever You Call" [...] with {{longtime}} collaborator Walter Afanasieff for her album, Butterfly. However, {{in order to}} change the song's tempo and format, Carey decided to re-do the song as a duet with Brian McKnight, because she felt {{it was one of}} the best songs on Butterfly. Carey had also expressed how McKnight's vocals added a great deal to the song, describing the project as [...] "perfecting the song". McKnight shared similar sentiments, saying, [...] "It was amazing to go into the studio with someone who's so successful, and has that kind of track record. Mariah is someone who could <b>ask</b> <b>anyone</b> in the world to sing with her, and they called me. The album contains a duet with Whitney Houston ... it's just been great company to be in." ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{historians have}} given Adams {{recognition}} {{as an important}} figure from {{the early years of}} baseball. Thorn has written that he [...] "may be counted as first among the Fathers of Baseball." [...] O'Maxfield said of Adams: [...] "Without , we wouldn't have the game we know and love as baseball today." [...] The [...] "father" [...] label was rejected by Ryczek; he wrote that Adams did not conceive the sport, but called him a [...] "collaborator" [...] in its development. On July 31, 2014, the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 [...] "Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend". Eric Miklich has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer. He says of Adams, [...] "Should he be in the Hall of Fame? Absolutely. You <b>ask</b> <b>anyone</b> who knows about 19th century baseball. They'll laugh at Cartwright; Abner Doubleday, they won't even talk about; but they all know Doc Adams. He was the glue that held things together {{in the early part of}} baseball." [...] Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016, when he was up for consideration on the Hall's Pre-Integration Era Committee ballot. Ten of the 16 committee members supported him, two fewer than the number needed for induction.|$|E

500|$|Oldfield, an Australian national, said he {{was making}} [...] "a protest against inequalities in British society, {{government}} cuts, reductions in civil liberties and a culture of elitism". Oxford number two, William Zeng, denounced Oldfield and described him as [...] "a mockery of a man", while Oxford boat club president Karl Hudspith tweeted [...] "my team went through seven months of hell, this {{was the culmination of}} our careers and [...] took it from us". [...] Educated at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School, the University of Sydney and the London School of Economics, and Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Oldfield tweeted the day after the race, [...] "Having been deep within elite institutions I have a very good understanding of them. I protest their injustices – <b>ask</b> <b>anyone</b> that knows me". On his blog, Oldfield compared his actions to those of Emily Davison, the suffragette killed after stepping in front of the King's horse at The Derby in 1913. [...] Despite later stating he had some sympathy for both the rowers and spectators, he said he had no regrets and that he [...] "would have felt less of a man" [...] had he not made the protest. [...] In October 2012, Oldfield was jailed for six months for causing a public nuisance and ordered to pay £750 costs. In June 2013, he was refused leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the Home Office claiming his presence there was not [...] "conducive to the public good". Oldfield, whose wife is from India, appealed on the grounds that she would be threatened in Australia, and in December 2013, the deportation order was overturned. [...] Security for the 2013 race was increased as a result of Oldfield's actions, with Royal Marines, additional stewards and the Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit in attendance.|$|E

2500|$|Later that year, Consort Wu {{falsely accused}} Empress Wang {{and her mother}} Lady Liu of using {{witchcraft}} to try to regain Emperor Gaozong's favor. [...] Emperor Gaozong began discussions with the chancellors on deposing Empress Wang and replacing her with Consort Wu. [...] The chancellors, other than the senior general Li Ji, who refused to render an opinion (but later also stated to Emperor Gaozong {{that it was his}} own business and that he needed not <b>ask</b> <b>anyone</b> else) and Emperor Gaozong's powerful uncle Zhangsun Wuji, who showed disapproval by silence, were largely vocal in their opposition, with the strongest opposition from Chu Suiliang. [...] Meanwhile, Han also opposed the move, weeping bitterly during one meeting with Emperor Gaozong, causing Emperor Gaozong to remove him from the palace. [...] He later further submitted a petition, pointing out that Empress Wang was the wife Emperor Taizong selected for Emperor Gaozong and was not known for faults. [...] Emperor Gaozong did not listen and, after demoting Chu to be the commandant at Tan Prefecture (roughly modern Changsha, Hunan), in order to show the other chancellors what he was willing to do, deposed Empress Wang and replaced her with Consort Wu late in 655. [...] (The former Empress Wang and her ally Consort Xiao were later executed cruelly at the instigation of the new Empress Wu.) [...] One of the first things that the new empress did as empress was to submit a petition praising Han and Lai for their faithfulness and requesting that they be rewarded—a petition that, however, made Han and Lai apprehensive that she was aware of their opposition of her, and Han offered to resign thereafter, an offer that Emperor Gaozong did not accept.|$|E
