5|$|Stanton {{also wanted}} the {{lighting}} to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured {{the physics of}} being underwater with Finding Nemo and so for WALL-E, he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, lens flare, and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70mm camera, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.|$|E
25|$|Simmel {{believed}} people created {{value by}} making objects, then separating themselves from that object <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> overcome that distance. He found that things which were too close {{were not considered}} valuable and things which were too far {{for people to get}} were also not considered valuable. Considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting the object.|$|E
25|$|In June 1986 Mehmet and Ali start a cab {{firm called}} 'OzCabs' from a corner table in Ali's Café. Mehmet is married with three children, but monogamy is one {{sanctity}} of marriage {{that he is}} {{more than willing to}} overlook. Later that month punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) catches his eye, and so he bets his sceptical brother £10 that he can get Mary to have sex with him. Mary is well aware that Mehmet's intentions are dishonourable and initially refuses to have sex with him, but Mehmet persists and she finally relents and spends the night with him. A triumphant Mehmet then collects his winnings and gloats to his brother in the café. However, Mary overhears their entire conversation and she then sets about trying to get revenge on him by hoax calling his cab-firm and vandalising his car. Later in the year Mehmet acts as Pat Wicks's (Pam St. Clement) pimp, setting her up with clients on a regular basis and he even persuades Pat to convince Mary to go prostitute herself too. He also gets involved in Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) Knitting business, later conning her and disappearing with all her profits. After he gets into more trouble with his customers for overcharging on fares <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> seduce Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) — the wife of his employee — the residents of Albert Square decide to confront him. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) find him and give him a severe beating which involves having his arms pinned behind his back whilst taking a number of blows to the stomach.|$|E

In this episode, the omnipotent entity known as [...] "Q" [...] (John de Lancie) arrives on the Enterprise and decides that Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is ignorant and overconfident. Q then sends the ship across the galaxy where the crew make first contact with the cybernetically enhanced assimilating race known as the Borg. After first trying to make peace <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> destroy the ship, and failing both, Picard is forced to beg for Q's help.|$|E
500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not as good as we thought we were and things got in the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Dave McKean drew {{most of the}} {{principal}} art, {{as well as the}} cover art of the graphic novel. In illustrating the story, McKean blends paintings, drawings, photography, and mixed-media collage to come up with striking page designs, and dense symbols. He has said that he was [...] "trying to make the book despite the subject, rather than because of it. At the end of the day, if you really love to do Batman comics, then that's probably the best thing to do. Not liking them, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make something out of them is just a waste of time." [...] He also came to think that [...] "overpainted, lavish illustrations in every panel just didn't work. It hampers the storytelling." [...] McKean liberally uses symbolism, imagery, and surrealism, and many scenes involve the use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device. For example, a Greek inscription can be seen scratched on the doorway of Maxie Zeus's electroshock chamber, which translates into [...] "Discover thyself." [...] Much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by the release of the 15th Anniversary Edition containing Morrison's annotated script.|$|E

500|$|When Madonna {{embarked}} on her Drowned World Tour in 2001, [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] was added {{as the second}} song in the setlist. The costumes were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, and had varied accessories like spiked dog collars, Swarovski crystal-encrusted bracelets and tattered tops. Michael Schimdt {{was responsible for the}} accessroies; he was sought out by Madonna and her stylist Arianne Phillips, to help with finishing touches for many of the outfits. Madonna opened the show with the punk section, wearing tattered black garments and a tartan kilt and belting out the first song, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love". As the song ended, Madonna started with [...] "Impressive Instant", accompanied by her dancers wearing gas masks and encased in rolls of black mesh, chasing the singer around the stage. In the middle of the song, she was carried around by her dancers. According to Stuart Lenig, author of the book The Twisted Tale of Glam Rock, Madonna merged choreography with narrative in the performance, as she and her dancers crossed the stage. The 1984-style robotic movements denoted fascism with the dancers stalking <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> grope Madonna; in the end one dancer dressed as a robot grabbed a big hosepipe and thrust it between Madonna's legs, as it emitted fog towards the audience. Lenig deduced that this could denote both an act of achieving orgasm or urination towards the crowd. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, {{one of the authors of}} the book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, found similarities with Madonna's exploration of lesbian cultural references from her earlier works, with the performance of [...] "Impressive Instant". The placement of the fogging machine between Madonna's legs were seen as symbols for the phallus and ejaculation, and was deduced as an example of the singer's insistence on masculinity as [...] "performance". The dancers ultimately get subdued by Madonna, who finish off singing the song and takes up a Gibson Les Paul electric guitar to perform the next track, [...] "Candy Perfume Girl".|$|E

[...] He had hoped that other sides to the character could have been explored, such as Carl winning Kirsty back <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> stay out of trouble but failing, or turning them into a criminal couple while showing Carl's [...] "more human side".|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Zubov of Kot-in-Action Creative Artel who {{developed}} the Steel Storm games complained in an interview about the trouble he had getting his games accepted into the Bundles, originally trying to push their game's first episode as a free bonus for the second Bundle, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get their full game into the third. Zubov recalls {{that he had heard}} [...] "nothing back" [...] until they made a [...] "last minute decision" [...] to include Steel Storm: Burning Retribution in the Humble Indie Bundle 3. Even then, Zubov further described his dissatisfaction with how payment was handled, saying that they were [...] "offered a tiny-tiny fraction of what HIB3 made, a very small (compared to the profits of HIB3) fixed amount of money" [...] even though, according to Zubov, [...] "when Steel Storm was released as a bonus, their sales jumped up significantly." [...] He also mentioned that despite claims by the organizers that their sales would [...] "sky rocket just because [...] were in the HIB3", their actual amount of sales remained relatively constant. Zubov noted that their inclusion in the third bundle [...] "did get a lot of users who redeemed their copy of Steel Storm on Steam and Desura" [...] and that they hoped this would help keep their [...] "current user base, which we gained with HIB3, interested in our upcoming games". He concluded his comments about his experiences by saying that [...] "only time will tell if HIB3 was [...] awesome deal or not. Maybe, maybe not. If it works out as a long term investment, it will be awesome indeed. If not, I will never ever participate in such capacity (as a bonus item for a small fixed payout) in the future HIB bundles. We all do have bills to pay and families to feed, don't we?" ...|$|E
