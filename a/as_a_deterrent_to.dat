5|$|Aside from a {{comprehensive}} modernization in 1929–31, Arizona was regularly used for training exercises between the wars, including the annual Fleet Problems (training exercises). When an earthquake struck Long Beach, California, on March 10, 1933, the Arizonas crew provided {{aid to the}} survivors. In July 1934, the ship was featured in a Jimmy Cagney film, Here Comes the Navy, about the romantic troubles of a sailor. In April 1940, she {{and the rest of}} the Pacific Fleet were transferred from California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> Japanese imperialism.|$|E
5|$|In July 1950, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> a Chinese attack on Taiwan, and possible future use in Korea. They were loaded with Mark 4 nuclear bombs, but without the fissile cores. Travis was one of twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 Superfortress 44-87651 when it commenced take off from Fairfield-Suisun at 2200 on 5 August 1950. The plane was piloted by Captain Eugene Q. Steffes, with First Lieutenant Carter W. Johnson as his co-pilot and Technical Sergeant Donald W. Moore as his flight engineer.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E

5|$|Manning's offenses {{carried a}} maximum {{sentence}} of 90 years. The government asked for 60 years <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> others, while Manning's lawyer asked {{for no more}} than 25 years. She was sentenced on August 21 to 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private (private E-1 or PVT), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. She was given credit for 1,293 days of pretrial confinement, including 112 days for her treatment at Quantico, and would have been eligible for parole after serving one-third of the sentence. She was confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.|$|E
5|$|News of the French {{declaration}} of war arrived by ship in Calcutta, having traveled from George Baldwin, British ambassador in Alexandria, on 1 June 1793. Cornwallis immediately sailed to Pondicherry, instituting a blockade and seizing an ammunition supply ship entering the port. Plans to eliminate the French presence in India had already been drawn up. The British and EIC forces, commanded on land by Colonel John Braithwaite, moved rapidly, seizing Chandernagore, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahé without resistance. Pondicherry proved stronger, and Braithwaite was forced to besiege the city for 22 days until the French commander, Colonel Prosper de Clermont, agreed to surrender. Cornwallis's blockade was augmented by several large East Indiamen, proving sufficient <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> drive off the French frigate Cybèle and accompanying storeships which sought to resupply the garrison on 14 August.|$|E
5|$|Shoup later {{warned against}} an armed {{response}} during the Cuban Missile Crisis, noting {{how difficult it}} would be to invade the country. Still, he prepared a team of Marines to invade Cuba should it be necessary. He and the other Joint Chiefs unanimously recommended a quick airstrike to knock out the missiles once they were discovered there. Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating the implications of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> nuclear war.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, Arnold Shapiro's {{documentary}} Scared Straight {{was broadcast}} {{on the station}} without edits for the film's profanity, narrated by Peter Falk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> controversial <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> juvenile delinquency.|$|R
50|$|Macedonian was {{assigned}} to the West Indies Squadron to cruise in the West Indies and along the west coast of Africa from 1839 <b>to</b> 1847 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> continuing <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> Caribbean pirates.|$|R
50|$|Jay {{argues that}} a {{singular}} government speaking for all states would serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> greater <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> military interference by foreign nations than a system of government where each state is given complete control over its affairs.|$|R
5|$|The walls never proved very {{successful}} as defensive structures, and were easily breached {{on more than}} one occasion. They served more as a means of controlling trade and taxing goods, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> smugglers. Throughout their history, the town walls of Edinburgh have served better in their role as a trade barrier than as a defensive one. By the mid 18th century, the walls had outlived both their defensive and trade purposes, and demolition of sections of the wall began. The Netherbow Port was pulled down in 1764, and demolition continued into the 19th century. Today, a number of sections of the three successive walls survive, although none of the ports remain.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{it was not}} an easy {{introduction}} to the front for the New Zealanders. On arriving in their sector, they found the defensive arrangements to be poor and immediately set about improving the trenches and wire emplacements. Although the bulk of the division's personnel manned secondary defences rearward of the front line to avoid the German artillery, the forward areas had to be constantly patrolled <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> an attack and to give the impression they were fully manned. The static nature of the war meant that the Divisional Mounted Troops, intended to be used as scouts, were redundant and, along with two Light Horse squadrons from the Australian infantry divisions, were soon transferred to a new formation designated 1st ANZAC Light Horse Regiment. In July, the New Zealand Division was transferred to the newly arrived II ANZAC Corps while I ANZAC moved south to the Somme.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
50|$|Fear of retribution, {{threatening}} behaviour and intimidation from those {{higher in the}} contractual chain act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> using the legislation.

50|$|According to the SNIE, Pakistan sees missile-delivered {{nuclear weapons}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vital <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> India's much larger {{conventional}} forces, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessary counter to India's nuclear program. Pakistan pursued a nuclear capability more for strategic reasons than for international prestige.|$|R
50|$|Proponents of punishment- and exclusion-based {{philosophy}} of school discipline policies claim that such policies {{are required to}} create an appropriate environment for learning.

50|$|A {{research}} {{report by the}} National Bureau of Economic Research found the law has had no impact on drug usage among young people, and that it acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> college attendance, severely limiting the ability of people to better their lives through education.|$|R
50|$|Hordenine {{has been}} found <b>to</b> act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> feeding <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> {{grasshoppers}} (Melanoplus bivittatus), and to caterpillars of Heliothis virescens and Heliothis subflexa; the estimated concentration of hordenine that reduced feeding duration to 50% of control was 0.4M for H. virescens and 0.08M for H. subflexa.|$|R
50|$|There is {{moderate}} quality {{evidence that}} suggests {{the combination of}} education and exercise may reduce an individual's risk of developing an episode of low back pain.

25|$|Camp Drum {{also served}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> Confederate sympathizers in the Los Angeles area, helped keep the {{territory}} {{loyal to the}} Union, and prevented Confederate use of the Los Angeles harbor.|$|E
25|$|The local German command {{seems to}} have {{tried to keep the}} {{civilian}} population as happy as possible, letting them govern themselves, paying them for work done and not enacting too many draconian orders sent over from France. Resistance activity by islanders would not be tolerated, however. Punishment of the guilty served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> others.|$|E
25|$|After commissioning, though without torpedoes, {{because those}} {{had yet to}} arrive from the east coast, CC-2 was {{deployed}} on 13 August 1914 to the Strait of Juan de Fuca <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> the German raider threat. Later CC-1 joined her as the threat, given form by Admiral Von Spee's Pacific Fleet, increased. However, problems plagued the two boats and they were withdrawn from active service in September 1914 for refit.|$|E
40|$|Sclerotinia {{stem rot}} of {{soybeans}} (also known as white mold) {{is caused by}} a soil-borne fungus and has become a serious problem in northern Iowa.

50|$|The {{government}} of Somaliland, a self-declared republic that is internationally recognized <b>as</b> <b>an</b> autonomous region of Somalia, has adopted stringent anti-piracy measures, arresting and imprisoning pirates {{forced to make}} port in Berbera.

50|$|These {{detention}} {{facilities were}} constructed to provide detention, operations, and related services {{necessary for the}} protection of society. They provide incarceration <b>as</b> <b>an</b> appropriate <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> the commission of crime, are a method of guidance and treatment for incarcerated offenders, and assist the judicial system with evaluation tools and information for use when sentencing offenders.|$|R
25|$|Though GM cited cost <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> {{continuing}} with the EV1, the film interviewed critics contending {{that the cost}} of batteries and electric vehicles would have been reduced significantly if mass production began, due to economies of scale. There is also discussion about electric cars threatening dealer profits since they have so few service requirements—no tuneups, no oil changes, and less brake jobs because of regenerative braking.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{buildings}} have carved ball finials on the gable ends as per the architectural fashion of the time. The finial can also function as a lightning rod, and was once believed to act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> witches on broomsticks attempting to land on one's roof. On making her final landing approach to a roof, the witch, spotting the obstructing finial, was forced to sheer off and land elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|During this time, the USS Constellation was {{flagship}} of the US Africa Squadron from 1859 to 1861. In this period, she {{disrupted the}} African slave trade by interdicting three slave ships and releasing the imprisoned slaves. The {{last of the}} ships was captured at {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War: Constellation overpowered the slaver brig Triton in African coastal waters. Constellation spent much of the war <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> Confederate cruisers and commerce raiders in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{function}} of the patrol division personnel {{is to provide a}} uniformed response to calls for service, enforce traffic laws, investigate criminal activity, provide safety presentations to the campus community, assist other divisions as needed, and <b>to</b> act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> visible <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> crime. Officers patrol the campus using marked patrol cars, bicycles and on foot.|$|R
5000|$|Washing out {{mouth with}} soap {{is most often}} used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{response}} to profanity, lying, biting, tobacco use, or verbal disrespect. It functions both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbolic [...] "cleansing" [...] following the infraction, as well <b>as</b> acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>deterrent</b> due <b>to</b> the foul aftertaste. It is commonly used as child discipline or school discipline, and is more frequently employed by mothers than fathers.|$|R
50|$|At {{the close}} of King Philip's War the Massachusetts provincial {{government}} sought to defend its borders by settling groups of veterans on Indian lands. This was seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inexpensive <b>deterrent</b> <b>to</b> French aggression, <b>a</b> way to shore up English claims to contested ground, a good defensive strategy {{in the face of}} ongoing Indian resistance to British expansion, and a reward to the veterans of the war.|$|R
