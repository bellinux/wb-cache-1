The present Dukes of Buccleuch, Richmond, Grafton and St Albans descend from Charles in unbroken male line. Diana, Princess of Wales, was descended from two of Charles's illegitimate sons: the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond.

They discuss how they do not feel grown up and how being an adult is not necessarily a good thing.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember the exact location of his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E

5|$|The Midwest {{remained}} {{the heartland of}} the Swedish-American community, but its position weakened in the 20th century: in 1910, 54% of the Swedish immigrants <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> lived in the Midwest, 15% in industrial areas in the East, and 10% on the West Coast. Chicago was effectively the Swedish-American capital, accommodating about 10% of all Swedish Americans—more than 100,000 people—making it the second-largest Swedish {{city in the world}} (only Stockholm had more Swedish inhabitants).|$|E
5|$|The {{church does}} not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{maternal}} health contributes to future economic disparities for mothers <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> Poor maternal health often affects a child’s health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman’s ability {{to participate in}} economic activities. Therefore, national health programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Family Welfare Programme have been created to address the maternal health care needs of women across India.|$|E

5|$|As {{newspapers}} were banned and letters infrequent, the Romanovs {{under house arrest}} knew little of the fate of Tsar Nicholas and his family. Nicholas, his wife, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> were originally held at their official residence, the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, but the provisional government under Alexander Kerensky relocated them to Tobolsk, Siberia. Eventually, in July 1918, after being transferred to Yekaterinburg, Nicholas {{and his family were}} killed by their Bolshevik guards. In the Crimea, the Grand Duchess's family were condemned to death by the Yalta revolutionary council but the executions were stayed by the Sevastopol council, who refused to act without orders from Moscow. In March 1918, German forces advanced on the Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} sources for {{children}} to gain knowledge of skin-protective measures is from their parents. Therefore, an imperative exists for parents to model and reinforce the sun-safety practices they want <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to adopt. Although Australian mothers have been the recipients of two extensive sun-safety public health campaigns, {{little is known about}} <b>their</b> attitudes, behaviors, <b>and</b> application of health promotion knowledge toward <b>their</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> ultraviolet (UV) sun exposure. Ten mothers with children aged 4 to 12 years were asked a series of questions about their sun-safety practices, both pre- and post-viewing an UV photoaged photograph of <b>their</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> face. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis identified four themes and 12 subthemes. The findings reveal that mothers expressed divergent views on skin protection pre- <b>and</b> post-inspecting <b>their</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> photoaged photographs. At one end of the viewing spectrum, mothers expressed an opinion that some degree of skin damage was an inevitable reality in Australia’s sunny climate, and {{on the other end of}} the viewing spectrum mothers expressed their desire to keep themselves <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> out of the sun. Mothers in the mid-range of the spectrum stated that their parenting task was one of transferring the responsibility for adopting skin-protective measures from themselves to <b>their</b> preteen <b>children.</b> The combination of mothers viewing their own photos as well as <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> photograph serves to enhance the difference seen in photoaging damage, which in turn provides greater impetus for mothers to be concerned about photoaging in general...|$|R
