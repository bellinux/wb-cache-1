25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted to write {{something}} which did speed up, and took the emotion and the adrenaline with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that was the idea of it. That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E
25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E

Unfortunately he didn't listen but maybe next time..." ...|$|E

Brown and Damiani formed the [...] "new-wave influenced" [...] Deathray; their places within Cake were taken by Xan McCurdy and Gabe Nelson, whom McCrea persuaded to rejoin the band.|$|E
500|$|She {{said she}} wasn't {{interested}} in doing any kind of biography or anything ever, which {{is a bit of}} a stern statement from someone who has been so out there. It doesn't matter whether it's me, Norman Mailer, whoever.

I think for her it is an opportunity missed." ...|$|E
