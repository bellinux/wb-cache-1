5|$|After the US127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, {{and passes}} {{to the east}} of Grayling. There are a pair of {{interchanges}} on either end of town for BL I-75, and the southern one is a partial interchange; only northbound I-75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access southbound I-75. There is no interchange further north for M-72; <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of Grayling, there is a full interchange for BL I-75/M-93 that provides the southbound I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to the Hartwick Pines State Park.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, YouTube is {{completely}} blocked, either {{through a long}} term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> video in order to restore service. Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to bandwidth limitations and the site's potential for distraction.|$|E

DE 9 continues into residential areas and crosses under I-95/US 202, with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> road provided by northbound North Adams Street and southbound North Jackson Street.

5|$|Route 21 crosses into Clifton, Passaic County. It passes under Route 3 {{and comes}} to an {{interchange}} that provides <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> route. Past Route 3, the freeway comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance for southbound County Route 624 (River Road), passing through residential neighborhoods, and enters Passaic. In Passaic, Route 21 interchanges with County Route 608 (Brook Avenue), County Route 614 (Van Houten Avenue), and County Route 624.

It provide access to the Union Avenue Bridge over the Passaic. Route 21 briefly enters Wallington, Bergen County before crossing back into Passaic, where it heads farther {{to the west of}} the Passaic River, passing through industrial and residential areas of Passaic. The freeway comes to an interchange that provides access to County Route 619 (Market Street), Dayton Avenue, and Monroe Street. Route 21 continues to the north and resumes along the west bank of the Passaic River, narrowing to four lanes and crossing back into Clifton. Upon entering Clifton, the route comes to an interchange with Ackerman Avenue. The freeway heads to the northwest, passing by a park and featuring a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Lexington Avenue before ending at an interchange with U.S. Route 46.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{crossing}} the Pocomoke River, US 13 heads into Somerset County and intersects the northern terminus of US 13 Bus. {{and the southern}} terminus of MD 364 (Dividing Creek Road). From here, the route comes to a bridge over the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision and curves to the northwest, running through rural countryside. It features an intersection with the eastern terminus of MD 667 (Rehobeth Road), and the route continues from farmland into heavy woodland. US 13 heads back into agricultural areas where it intersects many unsigned suffixed segments of MD 920 which are mostly short, dead-end roads. The route continues west and northwest before it intersects the eastern terminus of MD 673 (Sam Barnes Road), which provides a connection to southbound MD 413 and Crisfield. A park and ride lot is located north of this intersection. Past MD 673, US 13 turns north and meets the northern terminus of MD 413 (Crisfield Highway), with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> route only in the southbound direction.|$|E

In these cases, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> data is provided by copying a 32- or 64-bit value, versus copying an entire data structure. However, smaller values like integers are the same size as pointers (typically both are one word), so there is no advantage to passing a pointer, versus passing the value. Also, pass-by-reference inherently requires a dereferencing operation, which can produce noticeable overhead in some operations, typically those used with these basic value types, like mathematics.|$|E

25|$|Granada {{was in a}} poor {{financial}} {{state and}} closed the Granada Studios Tour in 2001, citing decreasing visitor figures. The real reason was the decision to increase production of episodes for Coronation Street to five per week. Without <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> set, {{the highlight of the}} tour, the Granada Studios Tour venture was no longer viable. The company also closed Granada Film. The emergence of digital television cut ITV's viewing share, decreasing advertising revenue, which was already suffering from competition with the internet. The failure of ITV Digital cost Granada and Carlton losses estimated at over £1 billion reducing the company's value from 2001 to 2003.|$|E

Jefferson also arranged for Lewis to be further educated by Andrew Ellicott, an astronomer who instructed him {{in the use of}} the sextant and other navigational instruments. Lewis, however, was not ignorant of science and had demonstrated to Jefferson a marked capacity to learn, especially with Jefferson as his teacher. At Monticello, Jefferson possessed the largest library in the world on the subject of the geography of the North American continent, and Lewis had full <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> library.

25|$|Privatization {{works when}} the person who owns the {{property}} (or rights of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving {{the tragedy of the}} commons. Internalizing the externalities, in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.|$|E
25|$|Horve {{decided to}} take the enemy ship as a prize and bring it to a British port. Since Draug had almost no {{anti-aircraft}} weapons to speak of, and the skies were full of enemy aircraft, the destroyer could do little good by remaining where she was. He ignored an order from Naval Command to go to the Hardangerfjord and block German naval forces from gaining <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> fjord. As Horve knew that the Naval Command headquarters in Bergen had been captured by the German invaders, he assumed that the order was false, although it later turned out it was not. When ordered to steer his ship towards Britain, the captain of Main refused, only yielding after the Norwegian warship fired several warning shots and threatened to torpedo him.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Super Mario Bros. 3 was {{developed}} by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development; the game took {{more than two years}} to complete. The game offers numerous modifications on the original Super Mario Bros., ranging from costumes with different abilities to new enemies. Bowser's children were designed to be unique in appearance and personality; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work on the game. The Koopalings' names were later altered to mimic names of well-known, Western musicians in the English localization. In a first for the Mario series, the player navigates via two game screens: an overworld map and a level playfield. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Moving the on-screen character to a certain tile will allow <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> level's playfield, a linear stage populated with obstacles and enemies. The majority of the game takes place in these levels.|$|E
