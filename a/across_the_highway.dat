5|$|The tornado {{intensified}} to EF4 {{strength as}} it entered Van Buren County and tore {{through the south}} edge of Clinton, killing three people in the vicinity. One of these deaths occurred at a boat manufacturing plant in town which was destroyed. The plant was completely leveled to the ground, with its metal beam frame severely mangled. Homes in this area were leveled and swept from their foundations, vehicles were wrapped around trees and rendered nearly unrecognizable, a dentists office was obliterated, and trees were debarked. A church and several businesses were damaged as well. 62 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 30 were severely damaged, and 31 sustained minor damage. The tornado maintained EF4 intensity as it continued into Stone County, slamming into the town of Mountain View. The local hospital sustained heavy roof and wall damage, and several doctors offices were destroyed, along with a paint shop, a body shop, and a car parts store. A car dealership was completely flattened, with vehicles being tossed from the sales lot and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> One vehicle was lofted a considerable distance {{through the air and}} over a building before being dropped into a ravine. Surveyors observed a utility pole in this area that was pulled up and jammed back into the ground with wires still attached. The town's fire station was heavily damaged, and one fatality occurred when a house was swept from its foundation. 38 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 15 sustained major damage, and 15 sustained minor damage in the Mountain View area. The tornado weakened slightly to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed into Izard County and impacted the rural community of Zion, killing two people, destroying 43 homes and mobile homes, severely damaging 14, and lightly damaging 36 more. Hundreds of cattle were killed in this area, and a Jeep was stripped down to its frame and tires and found wrapped around the stump of a large tree that was snapped. An unanchored home in the area was swept clean from its foundation as well, leaving only the slab behind. Maintaining EF3 intensity, the tornado then struck the town of Highland in Sharp County, resulting in severe damage. At least 40 businesses along U.S. Route 412 in Highland were damaged or destroyed, including a strip mall, a restaurant, a church, and a car dealership. The local fire station was destroyed along with much of the equipment inside, and multiple vehicles were overturned along the highway. 40 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 8 sustained major damage, and 19 sustained minor damage in the Highland area. Highland High School and two apartment buildings sustained minor damage as well. To the northeast of Highland, the tornado rapidly weakened and dissipated.|$|E

40|$|Wanderers often walk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> without destiny, like nomadic that renounce geographical, {{psychological}} and social establishments. It is not rare to find wanderers with manifestation of visions and delirious thoughts.

We collected and analyzed the wanderers' talks, specifically exploring the allusive contents to the representation of themselves, of their world and of their walk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways.</b> Persecution, megalomania and depression ideas, super invested of affect, often appeared in their thoughts about present, past and in their reflections about the origins of constant moving. The results suggest that there is a strong relation between constant and without destiny moving and the delirious ideas and visions that emerge inside them...|$|R

MD 396 was extended west to Goldsboro Road, then west along Goldsboro Road to what is now MacArthur Boulevard, in 1934 and 1935. The Goldsboro Road segment of MD 396 became a western extension of MD 614 in 1978. The MD 396MD 614 intersection was originally a wye; the junction was changed to its current T intersection by 1999.|$|E

25|$|MD 191 was {{expanded}} to a divided highway from U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355) {{west to the}} Baltimore & Ohio Railroad railroad crossing (now the Capital Crescent Trail) by 1945. The railroad's bridge <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> was in place by 1951. The divided highway was extended west to near Goldsboro Road by 1962. MD 191's bridges across I-495 were constructed in 1962 when the Beltway was under construction. The Bradley Boulevard bridge and its approaches were built as a divided highway. MD 191 and Eggert Drive were relocated {{at the site of}} the Persimmon Tree Road bridge and a cut-off county road was built to form a four-way intersection just north of the Beltway bridge. The state highway continued to follow the old alignment of Persimmon Tree Road (now Persimmon Tree Lane) instead of the cut-off until 1999. That year, MD 191 was truncated at MD 190 and the highway along Persimmon Tree Road and the portion of Bradley Boulevard west of MD 190 were transferred to Montgomery County maintenance in a highway swap.|$|E

25|$|On June 13, {{less than}} twelve {{hours after the}} Israeli-PLO ceasefire had gone into effect, it fell apart, and heavy {{fighting}} erupted around Khalde. As the fighting raged, an IDF armored unit struck northeast, attempting to bypass Khalde and advance on Baabda, which overlooked the airport and {{could be used as}} another staging point to cut the Beirut-Damascus highway. By June 14, Syrian forces were being deployed to Khalde. Syrian units in Beirut and three commando battalions armed with anti-tank weaponry took up defensive positions southwest of the airport to block any Israeli attempt to capture it. The Israelis attempted to flank these defenses by moving off the road past Shuweifat, up a narrow, steep, and winding road towards Baabda, but were ambushed by a Syrian commando battalion. The Syrians attacked Israeli armor with rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles at close range. Israeli infantry dismounted and engaged the Syrians. Fierce fighting took place, with the Israelis calling in artillery at very close range to themselves. The Israelis advanced relentlessly, and after fourteen hours of fierce combat that raged up through Ain Aanoub and Souq el-Gharb, they broke through the Syrian positions and entered Baabda. The IDF then immediately sent reinforcements to the column in Baabda to enable it to carry out further operations. From Baabda, the Israeli force split into three columns, one of which struck <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> and entered the mountainous area to the northeast, one swung west and took up positions in the steep hills west of Beirut, and one turned toward Kahale, which was further down the highway. To the south, the IDF drove PLO forces out of Shuweifat, but no major battles occurred. The Israelis had now cut the Beirut-Damascus highway, cutting off all PLO and Syrian forces in the city.|$|E
500|$|The San Diego Chamber of Commerce and the San Diego Highway Development Association urged for the {{conversion}} of SR78 west of Vista, a length of , from an expressway to a freeway in April 1967. The College Boulevard diamond interchange on this western segment was scheduled to open to traffic on October 24, 1967, and connected the recently relocated MiraCosta College to the freeway. The interchange, previously an at-grade intersection, improved traffic flow to the college by removing the left turn <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> needed to access it. The construction of the interchange cost $800,941 (about $ in [...] dollars). May 1968 saw the state designating the Jefferson Street and Emerald Drive interchanges as a priority. In August 1968, the state allocated $750,000 (about $ in [...] dollars) for building the Jefferson Street interchange. Further funding difficulties were encountered due to US395 being given priority, but both interchanges had funding by August 1970.|$|E
500|$|Damage {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was widespread. Fort Walton Beach, {{where hundreds of}} structures were damaged or destroyed, was hit particularly hard. In some areas, the storm surge washed away buildings demolished by the strong winds. The winds cleared certain locations of trees and buried properties and roads under sand. Throughout northwest Florida, an estimated 8,000 people suffered storm-related losses, and 500 businesses were completely destroyed. An article in the Tallahassee Democrat reported that [...] "Cottages, motels, restaurants, convenience stores and other beach businesses were strewn <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> in a tangle of down power poles, lines and busted mains." [...] A [...] shrimp farm at Panama City, {{the first of its}} kind, was effectively lost. The storm destroyed the farm's prospective initial harvest, [...] of shrimp enclosed in a system of nets and enclosures. The president of the company described the subsequent events as six months of extreme turmoil in an effort to recover, followed by a quick and steady rebound. By the spring of 1976, the company became confident in financial success and full recovery.|$|E
