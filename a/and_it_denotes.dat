60|$|There is no English {{word for}} vetturino, because where the English {{language}} is spoken, {{there is no}} such thing. The word comes from the Italian word vettura, which means a travelling carriage, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>denotes</b> the man that owns the carriage, and drives it wherever the party that employs him wishes to go. Thus there is somewhat the same relation between the Italian words vettura and vetturino that there is between the English words chariot and charioteer.|$|E

The crest was designed by Diego de Romay in 1673. The iconography supposes the exaltation of the Virgin Mary as a destroyer of the sin {{of the world and}} in relation to the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, of which the Benedictine order was a great defender.|$|E

The term sui iuris is an innovation of the CCEO, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>denotes</b> the relative autonomy of the oriental Catholic Churches. This canonical term, pregnant with many juridical nuances, indicates the God-given mission of the Oriental Catholic Churches to keep up their patrimonial autonomous nature.

50|$|The term Shiva Sharanas/Sarana can {{be roughly}} {{explained}} as devotees of Lord Shiva. The 12th century Vachanakaras are also known by this name. Sharana {{is somebody who}} has surrendered oneself {{to the will of}} the Lord. Sharanu is derived from this term <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>denotes</b> the action of surrendering to or an act of respecting others. This term is seen in many Vachanas composed by the Vachanakaras namely Basavanna, Allama Prabhu, Akka Mahadevi and Madivala Machideva. The Vachanakaras, surrendering themselves to the will of Lord Shiva, have glorified and praised the forms of Lord Shiva. Not only this, the term signifies profound philosophical meanings. A sharana is given a prime place in the schematic world of Vachanas. An example for elevated position of a sharana is the following vachana of Basavanna.|$|E
5000|$|In Finnish, the optative is archaic, mainly {{appearing}} in poetry. It {{is used as}} an [...] "archaic" [...] or [...] "formal imperative", <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>denotes</b> a more subtle and polite request. It is formed using the suffixes -os and -ös, depending on vowel harmony; for instance, kävellös is the active voice second person singular in present optative of the verb kävellä (to walk). Altogether there are 28 verb inflections in the optative mood, complete with active and passive voice, present and perfect, three person forms both in singular and plural and a formal plural form. Most, if not all, of these forms are, however, utterly rare and are not familiar to non-professionals. Only some expressions have remained in day-to-day speech; for instance, one can be heard to say ollos hyvä instead of ole hyvä ("you're welcome" [...] or [...] "here you go"). This form carries an exaggerated, jocular connotation.|$|E

So far as the term Pattern and Balanos' copyrighted translation into Greek (i.e., [...] "Morphodiataxis") are concerned, {{this has nothing to}} do with whatever science fiction writer R. Zelazny means by it. Morphodiataxis is a core term in Balanos' Cosmic Biodynamics system, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>denotes</b> the real whole of any given situation or phenomenon, taking into consideration all those data that elude our common, untrained senses.|$|E

50|$|Tariqa in Arabic means path <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>denotes</b> a Sufi brotherhood or chain or order. The {{orders are}} governed by shaykhs, spiritual leaders that mentor Sufis. Shaykhs are {{identified}} by the signs of God's grace that are evident, {{such as the ability}} to perform miracles. They take on people, usually male, that are committed to the Sufi lifestyle and want to progress further in their spiritual education. It is common for the shaykh to test a new disciple by ignoring them, assigning humiliating tasks or being rude to them. When the disciple has passed these tests, he is introduced to the awrad, a series of prayers particular to that order. These prayers must be studied before they are recited, because mistakes made in the prayer are sins. When the disciple has studied and recited the awrad for an indeterminate amount of time, he is expected to experience visions and revelation from God. Sufis believe that at this point the disciple is able to see spiritual things that are veiled from most people.|$|E
5000|$|The noeme {{is a term}} coined in 2011 by biogerontologist Marios Kyriazis, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>denotes</b> a [...] "combination of a {{distinct}} physical brain function and that of an outsourced virtual one". A noeme is the intellectual [...] "networked presence" [...] of an individual within the global brain, a meaningful synergy between each individual human, their social interactions and artificial agents, globally connected to other noemes through digital communications technology. Kyriazis further clarifies that: [...] "...The noeme is structurally coupled with its medium, i.e. the computer/internet. It continuously generates its own organisation and specifies its operation and content. As a self-organising system it adjusts to external influences and reinvents itself in order to adapt to its environment i.e. it reproduces (self-replicates) horizontally {{in a process that}} can be termed 'noemic reproduction'. This digital intellectual manifestation of a person, if successful, will lead to others copying it, thus noemes are replicating... A noeme is not just a collection of single ideas or solitary intellectual achievements. It is the total sum of all individual cognitive efforts and active information-sharing accomplishments of a person, the intellectual standing of a person within the Global brain.|$|E

We show that like Mandarin bare nouns, N-leikind compounds also denote kinds, {{but they can}} only be instantiated by sets of (sub) kind entities at type, and not sets of individuals at type. Specifically, those kind entities belong to basic-level categories in some folk taxonomy. We claim that N-lei is the nominalization counterpart of the classifier phrase lei-N, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>denotes</b> superkinds, which are instantiated by sets of subkind entities. Accordingly, Mandarin bare nouns are comparable to bare plurals in English, whereas N-lei is comparable to definite singulars in English...|$|E

Following ISGI (2016), a day is considered quiet if mean(aa)< 13 nT and ∑p < 6 were fulfilled over a 48 -h interval (CC 48 day). In this manner, we can ensure that the chosen day has no significant disturbances 12 h {{before and after the}} day of interest.

The models that are now being used in Chinese speech synthesis are described qualitatively and with low precision. We try to find the pitch model from actual speech samples by data mining.

This paper first gives the architecture of SpeechDM, then the learning modules are introduced in detail, and the results are also given at last. 1 Introduction In the field of speech signal process, pitch {{is one of the most}} important parameters.
