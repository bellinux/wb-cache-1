40|$|This work {{describes}} a computational study on hypersonic flow past power law shaped leading edges at zero incidence. Effects of incomplete surface <b>accomodation</b> in rarefied flow on the aerothermodynamic surface quantities {{have been investigated}} by employing the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method {{in combination with the}} Cercignani-Lampis-Lord gas surface interaction model, which incorporates separate <b>accomodation</b> coefficients for the normal and tangential velocity components. The work is motivated by interest in assessing the overall performance of power-law shaped leading edges in order to consider them as possible candidates for blunting geometries of hypersonic leading edges. The results presented highlight the sensitivity of the heat transfer and drag coefficients to changes on the gas-surface <b>accomodation</b> coefficients. It was found that the heat transfer coefficient diminishes with decreasing the normal <b>accomodation</b> coefficient, and increases slightly by a reduction in the tangential <b>accomodation</b> coefficient {{in the vicinity of the}} stagnation region...|$|E
40|$|Steady-state {{accommodation}} {{response was}} measured for seven different {{visual display terminal}} (VDT) screen conditions and a hard-copy control condition. The screen conditions included variations in screen polarity, contrast and chromatic characteristics {{of the text and}} background. <b>Accomodation</b> response was measured for seven young subjects using a free-space infrared optometer, the Canon Autoref R- 1. The <b>accomodation</b> response was measured every 1. 3 s over a period of 60 s for each test condition, and both the mean and standard deviation of the responses were derived. A small but significantly higher <b>accomodation</b> response was found for hard copy, blue-on-red and red-on-blue screen conditions compared with white-on-black, green-on-black and black-on-white screen conditions. Screen polarity and contrast had little effect on <b>accomodation</b> response for the black-and-white screen conditions. The variability of accommodation response showed little difference between test conitions. For short-term VDT screen viewing, the <b>accomodation</b> response appears to be relatively accurate and stable across a wide range of screen conditions...|$|E
