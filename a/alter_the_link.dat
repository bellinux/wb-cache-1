40|$|Most {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} {{studies have shown}} that sex increases the rate of evolution, although evidence of sex constraining genomic and epigenetic variation and slowing down evolution also exists. Faster rates with sex have been attributed to new gene combinations, removal of deleterious mutations, and adaptation to heterogeneous environments. Slower rates with sex have been attributed to removal of major genetic rearrangements, the cost of finding a mate, vulnerability to predation, and exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. Whether sex speeds or slows evolution, the connection between reproductive mode, the evolutionary rate, and species diversity remains largely unexplored. Here we present a spatially explicit model of ecological and evolutionary dynamics based on DNA sequence change to study the connection between mutation, speciation, and the resulting biodiversity in sexual and asexual populations. We show that faster speciation can decrease the abundance of newly formed species and thus decrease long-term biodiversity. In this way, sex can reduce diversity relative to asexual populations, because it leads to a higher rate of production of new species, but with lower abundances. Our results show that reproductive mode and the mechanisms underlying it can <b>alter</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> between mutation, evolutionary rate, speciation and biodiversity and we suggest that a high rate of evolution may not b...|$|E

This may affect both populations’ total reproductive output and {{the link between}} population demography and recruitment, yet detailed information on fecundity regulation is generally lacking for marine fishes. We therefore examined associations between liver energy, oocyte stage, leading cohort oocyte size (LC 20), atresia and fecundity for the Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) Gadus morhua L. from 2006 to 2008 in a comprehensive field and laboratory study. The relationship between the relative liver size (hepatosomatic index, HSI) and specific liver energy content was best described by an asymptotic curve, increasing rapidly at first, then levelling of at HSI > 6 %. LC 20 increased towards the spawning season, but was also positively associated with total length. At present there is thus a tendency towards larger NEAC females spawning earlier. The incidence of atresia was highest during the advanced yolk granule stage. Only 1 % of females that reached an LC 20 > 300 µm absorbed all oocytes and thereby aborted spawning. Potential fecundity showed a parabolic relationship with LC 20, peaking around 614 µm, i. e. approximately on February 1 st, and was positively associated with weight, liver energy and, presently, age. In summary, NEAC females that start vitellogenesis will likely spawn. Atresia and fecundity down-regulation appears only to become pronounced close to spawning. Finally, the size-dependent spawning time, which appears to have emerged in the stock recently, may <b>alter</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> between population demography and recruitment. 2015 - 04 - 0...|$|E

My dissertation explores the connections between health and residential segregation for Hispanics and key Hispanic subgroups in metropolitan America. I conduct a multivariate analysis combining individual-level health survey data on Hispanics from the 1997 - 2002 Urban Institute National Survey of America's Families with metropolitan area-level residential segregation scores from Census 2000. My primary research question is: What {{is the role of}} residential segregation in shaping the health disparities of U. S. Hispanics? I compare the link between segregation and health for U. S. Hispanics with African Americans, and evaluate differences among Hispanics by nativity and country of origin. My outcome measures are self-rated health, insurance status, and having a usual source of health care. I find a significant negative effect on health status of residential segregation from whites for U. S. Hispanics even after accounting for compositional factors such as poverty status and education. Consistent with spatial assimilation theory, however, much of the observed negative effects of segregation on health are overshadowed by individual-level socioeconomic characteristics. In support of place stratification theory which emphasizes the relative disadvantage of African Americans as racial minorities in the U. S., I find that African Americans experience modestly greater health disparities associated with segregation than Hispanics. Despite my prediction that health outcomes for foreign-born Hispanics may actually improve with higher segregation, nativity does not significantly <b>alter</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> between health and segregation among U. S. Hispanics. I do find a significant interaction between nativity and segregation for Mexicans in the prediction of being uninsured and for Cubans in the prediction of self-rated health. For foreign-born Mexicans, segregation is more of a disadvantage in the prediction of being uninsured. The only evidence I find of any positive or protective link between segregation and health is for Cuban-origin Hispanics whose odds of reporting good self-rated health increase with higher levels of segregation. While segregation has a positive association with health status for both U. S. -born and foreign-born Cubans, the effect is substantially stronger for the foreign born. This research highlights the importance of examining residential segregation as a social determinant of health, and reveals important nuances in the link between health and segregation for nativity and country-of-origin subgroups of U.

For polyacene systems with different terminal connections, the conductivity is dependent on the substitution position of anchoring groups even with similar electron transport distance. The conductance of trans-substitution can be ten times or more as large as that of the cis-substitution. However, for the biphenyl system with different intramolecular connections, adding more connections between two benzene rings does not change the junction conductance.

Our laboratory have been involved, for over a decade, in synthesizing Bombesin analogues that target the BB 2 receptor for the purpose of developing radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic and/or therapeutic treatment of cancer. Radiopharmaceuticals based on Bombesin are typically composed of a chelator, isotope, linking group and targeting vector [See Bifunctional Conjugate Design [figure below]. Previous studies by our group and others have shown that variations in <b>linking</b> groups affect <b>the</b> retention time of the bifunctional conjugate in prostate cancer (PC- 3) cells.

Experimental and numerical data showed that afixing a torque link on to a half cylinder strut resulted in the suppression of vortex shedding in between the torque arms. This resulted in a narrower wake with reduced drag. PIV wake profiles showed the suppression of shedding to result in reduced velocity fluctuations, as shown by reductions in shear and normal Reynolds stresses. Simulation showed attaching <b>the</b> torque <b>link</b> to <b>the</b> strut {{to result in a}} reduction of farfield noise levels by up to 7. 5 dB. <b>Altering</b> <b>the</b> torque <b>link</b> angle ttheta was shown to affect the aerodynamic field, with a decrease in drag and wake strength, as shown by a reduction in mean and fluctuating velocities. However, <b>altering</b> <b>the</b> torque <b>link</b> angle was shown to have little affect on near field acoustics. <b>Altering</b> <b>the</b> yaw angle φ from φ = 0 º to 180 º was shown to affect periodic vortex shedding from the strut, with shedding occurring at lower frequencies for φ = 90 º and 135 º.

First, digital distribution increases the quantity of consumer participation within <b>the</b> market by <b>altering</b> <b>the</b> risks <b>linked</b> to acquiring/accessing music and by improving the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to help market music. Second, it improves independent artists 2 ̆ 7 ability to involve consumers in the complex process of producing and marketing their music in essence allowing consumers to become co-producers and co-marketers of an artists and his or her music. The study presents a multiplicity of contributions to economic sociology, the sociology of markets, the sociology of consumers and consumption, hip-hop music studies, and begins what I call the sociology of marketing and distribution...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a new agent-based simulation system {{for studying the}} impact of network topology on military combat performance. Since the timescales of message transfer and agent movement can differ significantly, the simulation is event-based rather than time-step. Figure (i) shows {{a snapshot of the}} simulation in operation. Figure (i). Snapshot of Combat Simulation The networks we explore in this paper are generated using the process introduced by Kawachi et al (2004), which <b>alters</b> <b>the</b> topology of a network without <b>altering</b> <b>the</b> number of <b>links.</b> By varying <b>the</b> parameter p, the Kawachi process can generate regular (p = 0), “Small-World” (0. 02 ≤ p ≤ 0. 1), random (0. 5 ≤ p ≤ 1), and “Scale-Free ” (p ≥ 2) networks. Figure (ii) shows the values of four network metrics as p is varied: the average distance D between nodes, the clustering coefficient C, the node connectivity K (a measure of robustness), and the symmetry ratio r. The “Small-World ” and random networks correspond to phase transitions where network metrics change slowly with respect to p. In particular, random networks are characterised by the clustering coefficient C reaching a minimum and the symmetry ratio r reaching a maximum, with the average distance D between nodes low, and the node connectivity K close to the minimum value of one...|$|R
2500|$|In 1801, David Hartley first {{postulated}} that dreaming <b>altered</b> <b>the</b> associative planetary <b>links</b> within <b>the</b> brain during dreaming periods of dreams. The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable {{by the end}} of the 19th century. In ‘Peter and Wendy’, J.M. Barrie wrote [...] ‘It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. …When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.’ The stories of Peter Pan take place in a mental world and contain many allusions to aspects of cognitive psychology, some of which predate their formal scientific investigation.|$|R

The primary links: Wd, EI, SIp and Api connect together the suffixes, as, in principle, other stems could appear here, without <b>altering</b> <b>the</b> structure of the sentence. <b>The</b> Api <b>link</b> indicates <b>the</b> adjective; SIp denotes subject-verb inversion; EI is a modifier. <b>The</b> Wd <b>link</b> is used to indicate the head noun; the head verb is not indicated in this sentence. <b>The</b> LLXXX <b>links</b> serve only to attach stems to suffixes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Although {{the sharing}} of Web {{navigation}} experiences can be useful, it is not supported by contemporary browsers. The Web has been constructed {{along the lines of}} a spatial metaphor, but with a flaw {{of not being able to}} share navigation experiences, that is, group traces, as is possible in a physical space. This paper shows that from the viewpoint of Information Foraging Theory, sharing Web navigation experiences among group members can increase their information foraging performance. To verify this, a simple prototype, the Group Crumb Prototype (GCP), has been designed. The GCP visualizes group Web traces by <b>altering</b> <b>the</b> appearance of <b>links</b> on a Web page according to their Group Crumb Scents, which are calculated from the recentness and times of group navigations to corresponding links. A longitudinal user study has been conducted to compare user performance and experience when surfing the Web with and without the aid of the GCP. Results show that making group navigation traces available on Web pages to group members increases their Web information foraging performance, promotes group collaboration, and enhances their Web browsing user experience as well...|$|R
