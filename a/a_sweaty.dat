5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins <b>a</b> <b>sweaty</b> character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The video capture footage was then processed into a computer, and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them <b>a</b> <b>sweaty,</b> glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E
500|$|Hogarth {{took his}} {{inspiration}} for the series from the classical satires of Horace and Juvenal, via their Augustan counterparts, particularly John Gay's [...] "Trivia" [...] and Jonathan Swift's [...] "A Description of a City Shower" [...] and [...] "A Description of the Morning". He took his artistic models from other series of the [...] "Times of Day", [...] "The Seasons" [...] and [...] "Ages of Man", such as those by Nicolas Poussin and Nicholas Lancret, and from pastoral scenes, but executed them with a twist by transferring them to the city. He also drew on the Flemish [...] "Times of Day" [...] style known as points du jour, in which the gods floated above pastoral scenes of idealised shepherds and shepherdesses, but in Hogarth's works the gods were recast as his central characters: the churchgoing lady, a frosty Aurora in Morning; the pie-girl, a pretty London Venus in Noon; the pregnant woman, <b>a</b> <b>sweaty</b> Diana in Evening; and the freemason, a drunken Pluto in Night.|$|E

500|$|According to Anthony, in {{the late}} 1980s, the group {{averaged}} over 300 gigs a year throughout Australia. They performed at town halls, concert halls, Bachelor and Spinster (B) balls, parties, and pubs; and were [...] "one of the biggest crowd-drawing groups in Australia". [...] They toured with Mental As Anything, the Hoodoo Gurus, and INXS. In 1988, The Daily Telegraph surveyed booking agencies and determined that The Cockroaches were the [...] "Hardest Working Rock'n'Roll Band in the Country". Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described The Cockroaches as [...] "an in-demand pub band [...] <b>a</b> <b>sweaty,</b> frenzied atmosphere with good old-fashioned showmanship and unpretentious, energetic rock'n'pop". Paul said that the group [...] "rode the last wave of the pub rock era". Anthony claimed they were [...] "shunned" [...] by the major record companies in Australia. Even after their debut album was certified gold, they remained independent: they organised their own shows and paid expenses from their own accounts.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Matt Roush from USA Today said Steve Railsback's performance as Duane Barry rivaled {{that of his}} portrayal of Charles Manson in the 1976 television miniseries Helter Skelter. An unnamed reviewer from the Contra Costa Times called the episode [...] "seminal". San Jose Mercury News said Railsback gave {{what was to be}} the [...] "ultimate X-Files performance" [...] in 2002 after the show had been cancelled. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two called it [...] "a career best for Chris Carter" [...] and praised his writing and directing, noting that both were [...] "powerfully" [...] and [...] "passionately" [...] done. Shearman and Pearson also applauded the episode's simplicity, citing it as the factor that made the entry stand out from others. [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club named it an [...] "essential" [...] episode of The X-Files. Furthermore, he praised Railsback's performance, writing that [...] "there's <b>a</b> <b>sweaty</b> intensity to his best performances that makes him impossible to look away from; but you still can't accept anything he says at face value." ...|$|E

2500|$|Psychobilly is a {{rock music}} fusion genre that mixes {{elements}} of rockabilly and punk rock.

2500|$|Certain {{songs of}} this boxset were later hailed by other acts. Tricky covered [...] "Tattoo" [...] as the opening {{number of his}} second solo album Nearly God.

Massive Attack sampled in 1997 [...] "Mittageisen" [...] (the [...] "Metal Postcard" [...] version sung in German) on [...] "Superpredators" [...] for the movie soundtrack The Jackal. Acts from other genres also selected some of these B-sides. Morrissey played [...] "Eve White/Eve Black" [...] during intermission on his 1997's Maladjusted tour.

He tells her of spending his childhood as an orphan and never being shown affection. She sympathizes with his abandonment issues and he calls her [...] "the one." [...] He relates his psychiatric-student days and the first time he skinned a corpse that resembled his birth mother. Repulsed by the odor of formaldehyde, he decided to only practice on living victims. Kit (Evan Peters) phones him to say Grace (Lizzie Brocheré) had seen Alma and then calls him a liar when the doctor denies future help. Thredson finds <b>a</b> <b>sweaty</b> Lana and discovers she has tried to cut through her chain. He dons the Bloody Face mask and prepares to punish her betrayal. He admits to Lana that he was present when Kit was originally brought to the police station. At the time, he overheard reporter Lana state that her goal was to learn if the killer's possible maternal neglect caused the murders – his moment of clarity. In captivity, she grudgingly plays the motherly role to calm him.|$|E

60|$|Binu Charley led the way, by proxy, however, for, {{by means}} of the {{poisoned}} spear, he drove the captive bushman ahead. The run-way still ran through the dank and rotten jungle, and they knew no villages would be encountered till rising ground was gained. They plodded on, panting and sweating in the humid, stagnant air. They were immersed in a sea of wanton, prodigal vegetation. All about them the huge-rooted trees blocked their footing, while coiled and knotted climbers, of the girth of a man's arm, were thrown from lofty branch to lofty branch, or hung in tangled masses like so many monstrous snakes. Lush-stalked plants, larger-leaved than the body of a man, exuded <b>a</b> <b>sweaty</b> moisture from all their surfaces. Here and there, banyan trees, like rocky islands, shouldered aside the streaming riot of vegetation between their crowded columns, showing portals and passages wherein all daylight was lost and only midnight gloom remained. Tree-ferns and mosses and a myriad other parasitic forms jostled with gay-coloured fungoid growths for room to live, and the very atmosphere itself seemed to afford clinging space to airy fairy creepers, light and delicate as gem-dust, tremulous with microscopic blooms. Pale-golden and vermilion orchids flaunted their unhealthy blossoms in the golden, dripping sunshine that filtered through the matted roof. It was the mysterious, evil forest, a charnel house of silence, wherein naught moved save strange tiny birds--the strangeness of them making the mystery more profound, for they flitted on noiseless wings, emitting neither song nor chirp, and they were mottled with morbid colours, having all the seeming of orchids, flying blossoms of sickness and decay.|$|E

The audience seems unaware of the snapping, snarling dogs - and the dogs slowly give in to a loving temperament, licking those that pay attention to them. This seems to suggest that the club is full of love and affects all who enter.|$|R

60|$|Abundance {{of strange}} notions possessed me, when I {{was in the}} desolate island; {{especially}} on a moonshine night, when every bush seemed a man, and every tree a man on horseback.
