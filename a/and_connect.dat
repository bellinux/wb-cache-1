5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory <b>and</b> <b>connect</b> via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe give a {{constructive}} {{proof of the}} equality between treewidth <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> treewidth. More precisely, we describe an O(nk^ 3) -time algorithm that, given any n-node width-k tree-decomposition of a connected graph G, returns a connected tree-decomposition of G of width ≤ k. The equality between treewidth <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> treewidth finds applications in graph searching problems. First, using equality between treewidth <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> treewidth, we prove that the connected search number (G) of a connected graph G is at most n+ 1 times larger than its search number.

5|$|Although Brunner died on February 14, 1925, {{elements}} of his plans were still completed, {{except for his}} People's Court, which became a parking lot. Brunner planned a bridge to cross the railroad tracks <b>and</b> <b>connect</b> the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13thStreet. Brunner had also originally planned to have another bridge span the Susquehanna River, {{on the west side}} of the capitol. After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise <b>and</b> <b>connect</b> to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E

The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 <b>and</b> <b>connect</b> the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E

5|$|The major {{economic}} centres are Moscow, Minsk and Astana. The distance between Moscow and Minsk is 717 kilometers, {{and the distance}} between Moscow and Astana is 2700 kilometers, making infrastructure a key challenge for the integration of member states. Major infrastructure projects began during the 2000s in order to modernise <b>and</b> <b>connect</b> the regional bloc to other markets, facilitating both integration and trade in the region. In 2007 Moscow announced it will invest 1 trillion USD by 2020 to modernise the country's infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|A four-lane {{bridge is}} {{estimated}} to cost NOK2 billion. It could either be located immediately north of the current bridge, or south of Norwegian Talc. The traffic from Askøy, along County Road 562, connects with National Road 555 at Storavatnet. Without a bypass, the increased capacity from Sotra would not be achieved without expanding the motorway from Storavatnet to the city center. In 2010, an alternative was launched whereby a four-lane bridge would be built south of Norwegian Talc, and would immediately run into a tunnel <b>and</b> <b>connect</b> to the current motorway at Liavatnet. This is the planned intersection between National Road 555 and County Road 557 (Ring Road West), which would result in traffic from Sotra towards southern Bergen would not take up capacity on the current 555 motorway until after traffic from both Sotra and Askøy heading towards southern Bergen have had a possibility to head onto County Road 557.|$|E
5|$|A highway roughly {{parallel}} to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway was to run from I-75 near Newport north to Novi <b>and</b> <b>connect</b> back to I-75 near Davisburg. Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000.|$|E
