His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.

25|$|UCSD <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{planning}} {{to replace the}} dated facility since 2005, as by 2030 it will be inoperable due to increased seismic regulations in California. Planners believe {{that it would be}} more cost-efficient to replace the facility than perform the necessary upgrades. The ten-story Jacobs Medical Center was originally proposed as a controversial replacement for the Hillcrest facility. San Diego residents and nearby hospitals such as Scripps Health argued that the move would leave South County patients underserved, and UCSD decided to build the Jacobs Medical Center as a supplement to, not a replacement for, the Hillcrest campus. A long-range development plan is expected by 2018, and the replacement hospital on the current site will likely be completed by 2030.|$|E

25|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multi-faceted, age-dependent, {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder, {{and is a}} {{major cause}} of dementia. According to the Amyloid hypothesis, the accumulation of extracellular amyloid betapeptides (Aβ) into plaques via oligomerization leads to hallmark symptomatic conditions of AD through synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Immunotherapy via exogenous monoclonal antibody (MAB) <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> known to treat various central nervous disorders, such as AD, by inhibiting Aβ-oligomerization thereby preventing neurotoxicity. However, MABs are large for passive protein channels and are therefore inefficient due to the blood-brain barrier preventing MAB passage into the brain. However, the Peripheral Sink hypothesis proposes a mechanism where MABs may not need to cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, many research studies are being conducted from failed attempts to treat AD in the past.|$|E
25|$|Leung Chun-ying <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{unable to}} unite the {{conservative}} bloc.

Economic Synergy, the breakaway group from the Liberals, formed the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) with the Professional Forum legislators in 2012, while Regina Ip, former Secretary for Security {{who was in charge}} of the Article 23 legislation in 2003 formed in the New People's Party (NPP) in 2011. Together with DAB and FTU, the BPA and NPP formed a loose pro-government coalition.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the city}} <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely criticized for heavy {{destruction}} that has affected many historical buildings. As {{much as a}} third of historic Moscow has been destroyed {{in the past few}} years to make space for luxury apartments and hotels. Other historical buildings, including such landmarks as the 1930 Moskva hotel and the 1913 department store Voyentorg, have been razed and reconstructed anew, with the inevitable loss of historical value. Critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws: in the last 12 years more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down, several of those dating back to the 17th century. Some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures, which include many works by architect Konstantin Melnikov and Mayakovskaya metro station.|$|E

25|$|The Qin {{sought to}} create a state unified by {{structured}} political power and a large military supported by a stable economy. The central government moved to undercut aristocrats and landowners to gain direct administrative control over the peasantry, who comprised {{the overwhelming majority of}} the population and labor force. This allowed ambitious projects, such as connecting walls along the northern border eventually developed into the Great Wall of China. These projects involved three hundred thousand peasants and convicts. The Qin introduced a range of reforms such as standardized currency, weights, measures, and a uniform system of writing, which aimed to unify the state and promote commerce. Additionally, its military used the most recent weaponry, transportation, and tactics, though the government was heavy-handedly bureaucratic. Han dynasty Confucians portrayed the dynasty as a monolithic tyranny, but this view has been rejected by modern scholars. There was indeed an attempt to restrict criticism and purge traces of old dynasties, but not the alleged burning of books and burying of scholars. Recently excavated Qin texts show a more pragmatic and eclectic approach in contrast with descriptions in traditional texts. Qin <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> judged to be no harsher than was prevalent at the time. The Qin were not doctrinaire: Confucian and Legalist philosophies coexisted during the reign of the First Emperor.|$|E

500|$|Tyler's {{presidency}} {{has provoked}} highly divided responses among political commentators. It is generally held in low esteem by historians; Edward P. Crapol began his biography John Tyler, the Accidental President (2006) by noting: [...] "Other biographers and historians {{have argued that}} John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed." [...] In The Republican Vision of John Tyler (2003), Dan Monroe observed that the Tyler presidency [...] "is generally ranked {{as one of the}} least successful". Seager wrote that Tyler [...] "was neither a great president nor a great intellectual," [...] adding that despite a few achievements, [...] "his <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> and must be counted an unsuccessful one by any modern measure of accomplishment". A survey of historians conducted by C-SPAN in 2017 ranked Tyler as 39th of 43 men to hold the office.|$|E
