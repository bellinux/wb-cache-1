5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the {{prevailing}} {{view was that}} the genes in a chromosome <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the rII region of bacteriophage T4 (1955-1959) showed that individual genes have a simple linear structure {{and are likely to}} be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.|$|E

Not long into their apprenticeships, Hawkpaw and Mothpaw see other kits from the nursery pretending to be Tigerstar and kill everybody.

5|$|When Néstor Kirchner {{refused to}} run for {{re-election}} in 2007 and proposed Cristina Kirchner instead, it was rumored that the couple might attempt {{to run for}} the presidency in alternate elections, to circumvent the constitutional limit of a single re-election. The death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010 derailed such a plan. She had a low positive image, below 30%. On 21 June 2011, Cristina Kirchner announced she would run for a second term as president. A few days later, she announced that her economic minister Amado Boudou would run for vice-president on her ticket. This selection was an unexpected one, as Boudou usually <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> a rock star instead of a politician. She personally chose most of the candidates for deputy in the Congress, favoring members of the Cámpora.|$|E

25|$|A {{precursor}} {{of the concept}} is found in entomologist William Morton Wheeler's observation that seemingly independent individuals can cooperate so closely as to become indistinguishable from a single organism (1911). Wheeler saw this collaborative process at work in ants that <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> the cells of a single beast he called a superorganism.|$|E
25|$|The Legionnaires, however, {{had no more}} {{experience}} in the principles of republics than other Paraguayans. The 1870 constitution quickly became irrelevant.

25|$|After the 2007 election, the Independent Group, led by Nairn ward {{councillor}} Sandy Park, effectively <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> a party, {{complete with}} a party whip. Immediately after the 2007 council election, an administration had then been formed by the Independent Group and the SNP, but collapsed when the SNP withdrew from the coalition.

25|$|Upon her rescue Sano {{was found}} to be healthy, {{although}} extremely thin and weak due to lack of exercise: she could barely walk. She was also dehydrated.

25|$|During {{the ensuing}} ice ages a lobe of glacial ice, the Superior lobe, moved into Minnesota through the agate-filled Superior trough.

The advancing glacier <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> an enormous rock tumbler, abrading, fracturing, and rough-polishing the agates.|$|E

25|$|All {{of these}} points may be partly correct in themselves, but they leave {{unanswered}} {{the question of}} why Beck <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> he did. A possible explanation is that he needed to repair his reputation: He was a politician and had during the First War of Schleswig 15 years earlier been passed over for promotion for criticism by Colonel Læssøe, and would probably suffer the same again, for in February during the battle of Sankelmark he left his unit while it was in battle.|$|E
