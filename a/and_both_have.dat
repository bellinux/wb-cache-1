5|$|Eyre {{is thought}} to have been passing through the Toolinna Cove sand patch at the time of writing. B.epica and B.media are the only Banksia species that occur at that location, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> a form and habit that accords with Eyre's description. As he did not collect specimens, it is {{impossible}} to determine what species he saw.|$|E
5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E

5|$|The second {{hypothesis}} holds that Userkaf chose {{to return to}} 3rd dynasty (c. 2670–2610 BC) traditions: {{not only did he}} choose to construct his mortuary complex on the north-east corner of Djoser's complex but its layout {{is similar to that of}} Djoser. Indeed, both are organized on a north–south axis <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> their entrances located at the south-end of the eastern side.|$|E
5|$|The two lions have a male mane, {{patterned}} with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body. Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears {{and on their}} shoulders, emanating from a central disk-shaped whorl. They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but {{with a degree of}} artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> their mouths closed.|$|E
5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E

5|$|Croatian and Hungarian {{high-ranking}} officials usually meet {{several times}} a year. Trade between Croatia and Hungary amounted $1.020 bln in 2012, largely consisting of Hungarian exports to Croatia. Hungarian tourists contribute significantly to Croatian tourism; in 2009, a total of 323,000 visited Croatia, including the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán who spends his summer holidays in Dalmatia for last few decades. Both countries coordinate the development of cross-border infrastructure. Pan-European corridors Vb and Vc connect Budapest to the Adriatic Sea via Zagreb and Osijek. Both countries have sizable minorities living across their common border, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> passed laws to protect their minority rights.|$|E
5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E
5|$|The Schiavo case {{involved}} 14 appeals and numerous motions, petitions, and hearings in the Florida courts; five suits in federal district court; extensive political intervention at {{the levels of}} the Florida state legislature, Governor Jeb Bush, the U.S. Congress, and President George W. Bush; and four denials of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States. The case also spurred highly visible activism from the pro-life movement, the right-to-die movement, and disability rights groups. Since Schiavo's death, both {{her husband and her}} family have written books on their sides of the case, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> also been involved in activism over its larger issues.|$|E

5|$|In The Tempest, Shakespeare {{presents}} {{two powerful}} sorcerers, Prospero and Sycorax, who have both controlled the island. Initially {{it appears that}} the two characters are a contrasting pair: the benevolent Prospero and the rapacious Sycorax. However, upon closer analysis, {{the differences between the two}} characters disappear and the similarities grow. For example, Prospero, like Sycorax, coerces Ariel into doing his bidding, using the sprite to regain his inheritance as a Duke, and tortures Caliban with magic the way Sycorax tortured Ariel. Also, both Prospero and Sycorax were exiled from their respective homelands <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> children, which was possibly the reason why they were both spared being executed. The fine line between Sycorax's black magic and Prospero's white blurs even further during his renunciation of magic in Act V, a speech which has strong parallels to one given by the dark witch Medea in the Metamorphoses. In comparing himself to Medea, Prospero is implicitly comparing himself to Sycorax. Emphasizing the relationship between Prospero and Sycorax demonstrates the ambiguity of Prospero's supposedly benevolent character.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head, while water parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E
5|$|The {{county has}} a long history of human {{settlement}} stretching back to the Neolithic era. The Romans conquered Dorset's indigenous Celtic tribe, and during the early Middle Ages, the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century. The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century, and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348. Dorset has seen much civil unrest: in the English Civil War, an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement. During the Second World War, Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy, and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points. The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> clubs or hire venues for sailing, Cornish pilot gig rowing, sea kayaking and powerboating.|$|E

5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> the skills required to play in either role. This made it very hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E
