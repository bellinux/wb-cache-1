25|$|The Constitution's Ineligibility Clause {{prevents}} the President (and all other executive officers) from simultaneously {{being a member}} of Congress. Therefore, the president cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in Congress. However, the president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation, especially if the president's political party has a majority in one or both houses of Congress. For example, the president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ask</b> senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated, periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today are given as the State of the Union address, which often outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.|$|E
25|$|Customs for {{reciting the}} Mourner's Kaddish vary {{markedly}} among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom {{is that all}} the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the earlier custom was that one mourner be chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest, though most congregations have now adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner's Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have no one left to recite the Mourner's Kaddish on their behalf. In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi will read a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ask</b> the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues try to multiply the number of times that the Mourner's Kaddish is recited, for example, reciting a separate Mourner's Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner's Kaddish {{at the end of the}} service.|$|E
25|$|He {{was hired}} by NBC News' Washington bureau the {{following}} year and became bureau chief by 1989. Russert assumed the job of host of the Sunday morning program Meet the Press in 1991, and would become the longest-serving host of the program. Its name was changed to Meet the Press with Tim Russert, and, at his suggestion, went to an hour-long format in 1992. The show also shifted to a greater focus on in-depth interviews with high-profile guests, where Russert was known especially for his extensive preparatory research and cross-examining style. One approach he developed was to find old quotes or video clips that were inconsistent with guests' more recent statements, present them on-air to his guests <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ask</b> them to clarify their positions. With Russert as host the show became increasingly popular, receiving more than four million viewers per week, and it was {{recognized as one of}} the most important sources of political news. Time magazine named Russert one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008, and Russert often moderated political campaign debates.|$|E

500|$|As {{the film}} crew {{continues}} to document Kenny, House becomes increasingly annoyed {{and tries to}} avoid them by briefing his team by the MRI machine and in surgery. However, ultimately he cannot escape the cameras and the candidates find themselves acting self-consciously {{in front of the}} lens. Meanwhile, House begins to regret recruiting former CIA doctor Samira Terzi (Michael Michele) when she fails to demonstrate the intelligence he witnessed at Langley. Wilson, who believes that House is being distracted by Terzi's looks, offers up the solution to quickly fire her <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ask</b> her out on a date. He also notes House's propensity to hire attractive women, which led him to this situation. House argues that he's [...] "not that guy"; Wilson retorts [...] "every guy is that guy". During the episode the film crew also interviews Cameron, asking why she resigned and making it look like she was romantically attracted to House.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time about}} 1825, [...] came to England {{for two or}} three years, and made a fast and lifelong {{friendship}} with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young. I would ask any fair-minded mathematician to read Babbage's Ninth Bridgewater Treatise and compare it with the works of his contemporaries in England; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ask</b> himself whence came the peculiar conception of the nature of miracle which underlies Babbage's ideas of Singular Points on Curves (Chap, viii) – from European Theology or Hindu Metaphysic? Oh! how the English clergy of that day hated Babbage's book! ...|$|E
2500|$|Howard {{began to}} develop an {{interest}} in acting {{to the point where}} his grades worsened and began to play hookey from school. He said, [...] "I used to stand outside the theater knowing the truant officer was looking for me. I would stand there 'til someone came along, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ask</b> them to buy my ticket. It was necessary for an adult to accompany a juvenile into the theater. When I succeeded I'd give him my ten cents—that's all it cost—and I'd go {{up to the top of}} the balcony where I'd put my chin on the rail and watch, spellbound, from the first act to the last. I would usually select the actor I liked the most and follow his performance throughout the play." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Cake and Sodomy" [...] is {{the second}} track on the album. In 1990, Manson met a woman at a McDonald's {{restaurant}} in Fort Lauderdale who invited him to spend a weekend with her in New York City. Upon discovering that the girl was using her sister's ID because she {{was too young to}} work, Manson abandoned her, shortly after which he ran into two clubbers from South Florida. Manson spent the remainder of his stay in New York at the clubbers' hotel room, where he stumbled on public-access television cable television channels, which were [...] "a completely new phenomenon" [...] to him. Manson [...] "spent hours flipping through the station, watching Pat Robertson preach about society's evils <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ask</b> people to call him with their credit card number," [...] while [...] "on the other channel, a guy was greasing up his cock with Vaseline and asking people to call and give him their credit card number." [...] This inspired Manson to grab the hotel notepad and begin penning the song's lyrics. Manson explains in his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell that [...] "I had written other songs I thought were good, but [...] "Cake and Sodomy" [...] {{was more than just a}} good song. As an anthem for the hypocritical America slobbering on the tit of Christianity, it was a blueprint for our future message." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the introduction, {{the poet}} {{establishes}} the setting using conventional astrological and geographical references which place the poem within the traditional {{framework of a}} dream poem and introduces the dreamer who sits “all solytary alone besyde a lake,/ Musyng on a maner how that I myght make/ Reason & Sensualyte in oon to acorde” (1). [...] But, before he can think through his puzzle he is overcome by sleep. [...] Morpheus comes and escorts him {{to the court of}} Minos which is being held at the estate of Pluto. [...] There the dreamer watches as Diana and Neptune accuse Aeolus of flouting their authority and discrediting them in the eyes of their worshippers. [...] Before the trial can be concluded a messenger comes from Apollo, asking Minos to hold off on the judgement and inviting all the gods to his palace for a banquet. [...] In Apollo’s palace, Diana’s complaint is resolved and the dreamer describes each of the gods and goddesses as they sit down to eat. [...] The gods won’t allow Discord into their feast, but as she is leaving she meets with Atropos and sends him to stir things up. [...] Atropos goes to the gods and complains that while the gods claim to have given him power to bring death to any who disobeyed or despised them, there is one person who has escaped his power. [...] He threatens to leave their employ if they don’t make good on their promise to him and give him power over this person. [...] All the gods agree that they will bring down this one who defies Atropos. [...] They quickly resolve the dispute between Neptune and Aeolus to ensure that the offender {{will not be able to}} escape in the sea or air <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>ask</b> who it is that has defied them. [...] When Atropos tells them that it is Virtue, Pluto says he knows him well and the only thing that can harm Virtue is Vice, Pluto’s bastard son. [...] Vice is called for, and he assembles his host for battle. [...] Morpheus warns Virtue of the impending battle and Virtue prepares his host and heads to the field of Microcosm, hoping to arrive before Vice and thus have the advantage. [...] The descriptions of the assembly of these armies are made up long lists of characters representing various vices and virtues and types of people under the influence of Vice and Virtue.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{very seldom}} {{that a man}} finds himself in such a {{position}} as that," [...] said Sowerby, {{walking up and down}} his sister's room; [...] "and, upon my word, I don't think I am up to the task.

6000|$|... "It {{was worth}} running the risk, anyhow; for if {{only half of}} them are real they are a big fortune. Anyhow, Dick, let's hold our tongues about it.

60|$|That was all; {{not another}} word could I extract from him. I don't pretend to have {{discovered}} {{what he really}} has in his mind. I only venture on a suggestion.
