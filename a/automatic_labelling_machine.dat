40|$|International audienceSpeech-text {{alignment}} {{tools are}} frequently used in speech technology and research. In this paper, we propose a GPL software CoALT (Comparing <b>Automatic</b> <b>Labelling</b> Tools) for comparing two automatic labellers or two speech-text alignment tools, ranking them and displaying statistics about their differences. The main feature of CoALT {{is that a}} user can define its own criteria for evaluating and comparing the speech-text alignment tools since the required quality for labelling depends on the targeted application. Beyond ranking, our tool provides useful statistics for each labeller and above all about their differences and can emphasize the drawbacks and advantages of each labeller.

40|$|To support program comprehension, {{software}} artifacts can be labeled—for example within software visualization tools—with a set {{of representative}} words, hereby referred to as labels. Such labels can be obtained using various approaches, including Information Retrieval (IR) methods or other simple heuristics. They provide a bird-eye’s view of the source code, allowing developers to look over software components fast and make more informed decisions on which parts of the source code they need to analyze in detail. However, few empirical {{studies have been conducted}} to verify whether the extracted labels make sense to software developers. This paper investigates (i) to what extent various IR techniques and other simple heuristics overlap with (and differ from) labeling performed by humans; (ii) what kinds of source code terms do humans use when labeling software artifacts; and (iii) what factors—in particular what characteristics of the artifacts to be labeled—influence the performance of <b>automatic</b> <b>labeling</b> techniques. We conducted two experiments in which we asked a group of students (38 in total) to label 20 classes from two Java software systems, JHotDraw and eXVantage. Then, we analyzed to what extent the words identified with an automated technique—including Vector Space Models, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), as well as customized heuristics extracting words from specific source code elements—overlap with those identified by humans. Results indicate that, in most cases, simpler <b>automatic</b> <b>labeling</b> techniques—based on the use of words extracted from class and method names as well as from class comments—better reflect human-based labeling. Indeed, clustering-based approaches (LSI and LDA) are more worthwhile to be used for source code artifacts having a high verbosity, as well as for artifacts requiring more effort to be manually labeled. The obtained results help to define guidelines on how to build effective <b>automatic</b> <b>labeling</b> techniques, and provide some insights on the actual usefulness of <b>automatic</b> <b>labeling</b> techniques during program comprehension tasks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} a constructive algorithm {{in which a}} hierarchi-cal tree of hidden Markov models may be obtained directly from data using an unsupervised learning regime. The method is applied to health insurance trans-action data such that profiles with similar local temporal behaviours are grouped together. By judicious incorporation of limited additional prior information, {{it is found that}} profiles can be separated into various sub-behavioural groups thus pro-viding a technique for large-scale <b>automatic</b> <b>labelling</b> of data. In the application to the health insurance transaction data set, by incorporating limited information concerning the medical functions used in a medical procedure, it is possible to label some individual medical transactions as to whether they are related to a par-ticular medical condition or not. This <b>automatic</b> <b>labelling</b> process adds values to the collected transactional database for possible further applications, e. g. public health studies. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the classification of}} German news stories as either focusing on future-directed beliefs and intentions or lacking these. The method proposed in this article requires only a small set of labeled training data. Rather, we introduce German clues for the automatic identification of future-orientation which are used for <b>automatic</b> <b>labeling</b> of Reuters news stories. We describe {{the development of a}} high-precision procedure for <b>automatic</b> <b>labeling</b> in a boot-strapping fashion: A first version of the labeling procedure uses the absence of clues for future-directedness as indicator for non-future-directedness and is able to automatically label about one third of the Reuters news stories with high precision. Then a perceptron is applied to the automatically labeled news stories in order to semi-automatically acquire an additional set of clues for non-future-directedness. The second version of the labeling procedure additionally uses these clues and achieves remarkably improved results in terms of recall; it can even be extended by a guessing step to perform classification with an error of 22. 5 %. We also investigate another way to increase the recall by using the au-tomatically labeled news stories as training data for statistical classifiers. Three different types of statistical classifiers are applied in order to address the ques-tion, which classifier is most suited for the text classification task considered. The best statistical classifier combined with the results of improved <b>automatic</b> <b>labeling</b> is able to recognize the two classes of news stories with an error of 19 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to implement a system for semi-automatic counting of polyps on the photographs of sea-bed. Numerous photographs have been obtained, wherein the manually labelled sample of those {{was used for the}} train set, and on basis of this the machine learning was implemented. Photographs had to be re-processed with appropriate methods in order to correct the bad lighting and furthermore even out the differences. First a model was used, which removes the background in the image while leaving everything {{that is part of the}} polyp. Image with the removed background is re-processed again for the model for <b>automatic</b> <b>labelling</b> of polyps. The user can then decide whether automatically labelled polyps will be repaired and thereby the exact number of polyps is obtained, or leave it to the model for predicting the number of polyps. This model is taught to foresee the error of previous models and to predict the number of polyps more accurately. The entire system was tested by test images and it was established that some images are not suitable for the entire system, and, therefore cannot be used in this system. While manually correcting <b>automatic</b> <b>labels</b> of polyps it was established that it is significantly faster than the manual labelling of polyps in the overall photographs. The model for predicting polyps was also positively assessed, as it reduces the error of the model for <b>automatic</b> <b>labelling</b> of polyps on average...|$|R

In the registration process, the curves are encouraged to follow the fine details of the sulcal geometry and to observe the shape statistics learned from training data. Using the framework of probabilistic point set registration methods, the proposed algorithm finds the sulcal curve network that maximizes the posterior probability by Expectation-Maximization (EM).
