After serving as the Chairman of the Task Force on Ethics Enforcement, in 2008 Capuano introduced [...] which established the Office of Congressional Ethics. Capuano has had a long-running relationship with former Congressman Anthony Weiner, whom he shared a Washington, D.C. apartment with for 12 years. Following Weiner's sexting scandal Capuano did not call on him to resign, saying: [...] "I am not the guy who likes to judge other people. I figure that is between them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> appropriately named to do that– and that is the Ethics Committee." ...|$|E

Factors like capitalism, exploration of Indigenous lands all contribute to food insecurity for minorities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> the most oppressed in various countries (women being one of these oppressed groups). To emphasis, [...] "food {{and nutrition}} insecurity is a gender justice issue". The facts that women and girls are the most oppressed by [...] "the inequitable global economic processes that govern food systems and by global trends such as climate change", shows how institutions continue to place women in positions of disadvantage and impoverishment to make money and thrive on capitalizing the food system. When the government withholds food by raising its prices to amounts only privileged people can afford, they both benefit {{and are able to}} control the [...] "lower-class"/ marginalized people via the food market.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond the {{requirement}} for a settlor to have truly intended to create a trust, {{it has been said}} since at least 1832 that {{the subject matter of the}} property, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> to benefit must also be certain. Together, certainty of intention, the certainty of subject matter and beneficiaries have been called the [...] "three certainties" [...] required to form a trust, although the purposes of each [...] "certainty" [...] are different in kind. While certainty of intention (and the formality rules) seek to ensure that the settlor truly intended to benefit another person with his or her property, {{the requirement}}s of certain subject matter and beneficiaries focus on whether a court will have a reasonable ability to know on what terms the trust should be enforced. As a point of general principle, most courts do not strive to defeat trusts on the basis of uncertainty. In the case of In re Roberts a lady named Miss Roberts wrote in her will that she wanted to leave £8753 and 5 shillings worth of bank annuities to her brother and his children who had the surname of [...] "Roberts-Gawen". Miss Roberts' brother had a daughter who changed her name on marriage, but her son later changed his name back to Roberts-Gawen. At first instance, Hall VC held that, because the grand-nephew's mother had changed the name it was too uncertain that Miss Roberts had wished him to benefit. But on appeal, Lord Jessel MR held that ...|$|E

60|$|I might dwell {{upon this}} article, {{and extend the}} {{observation}} to the East Indies, where a remarkable difference is evident between {{the present and the}} past times; for whereas a few years past the quantity of European goods, whether of English or other manufactures, was very small, and indeed not worth naming; on the contrary, now the number of European inhabitants in the several factories of the English, Dutch, and Portuguese, is so much increased, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> subject to them also, and who they bring in daily to clothe after the European fashion, especially at Batavia, at Fort St. George, at Surat, Goa, and other principal factories, that the demand for our manufactures is grown very considerable, and daily increasing.
