5|$|All three {{channels}} televise {{events such}} as congressional hearings, White House press briefings and presidential speeches, {{as well as other}} government meetings including Federal Communications Commission hearings <b>and</b> <b>Pentagon</b> press conferences. Other U.S. political coverage includes State of the Union speeches, and presidential press conferences. According to the results of a survey after the 1992 presidential election, 85% of C-SPAN viewers voted in that election. The results of a similar survey in 2013 found that 89% of C-SPAN viewers voted in the 2012 presidential election. In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations, including those at the National Press Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents' Dinner. While C-SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court, the network has used the Court's audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and lawyers to cover the Court in session on significant cases, and has covered individual Supreme Court justices' speaking engagements.|$|E

5|$|On the February 3, 2016 {{episode of}} Lucha Underground, Mundo faced Killshot in a winning effort. After the match, Mundo taunted Lucha Underground Champion Mil Muertes, {{only to be}} confronted by Cage. Mundo {{defeated}} Cage on February 24, after interference from the debuting Taya, subsequently becoming Mundo's valet. On the May 25 episode of Lucha Underground, Taya revealed to PJ Black and Jack Evans that their partner Fénix was injured by Mundo. As Mundo revealed himself as Fénix's replacement for their match, Black and Evans allied with the two. Later {{that night in the}} main event, Mundo, Black and Evans defeated Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma and Dragon Azteca Jr. to win the Lucha Underground Trios Championship, the first championship for each in Lucha Underground. The week after, Mundo, Black and Evans, now collectively billed as Worldwide Underground, retained their championships in a rematch via disqualification. During the match, Mundo delivered a low blow to Azteca Jr. while Taya distracted the referee. After seeing Mundo's actions, Puma hit a low blow to Mundo, causing a disqualification towards Puma's team. On the June 8 episode of Lucha Underground, Mundo teamed up with Taya, Ivelisse, Fénix, King Cuerno <b>and</b> <b>Pentagón</b> Jr. in a 12-man tag team match where the winning team would go on to face each other in a six-man elimination match to determine the No. 1 contender for the Lucha Underground Championship. Mundo's team won defeating Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma, Sexy Star, The Mack, Son of Havoc and El Texano Jr. The week after, Mundo lost the six-man elimination match which was won by Pentagón Jr. Worldwide Underground lost their titles to Aero Star, Drago and Fénix at the third and final part Ultima Lucha Dos, which aired on July 20.|$|E

It was in 1972 when three hijackers took control of a domestic passenger flight along the east coast of the U.S. and threatened to crash the plane into a U.S. nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plane got as close as 8,000 feet above the site before the hijackers' demands were met.|$|E
25|$|Arlington {{during the}} 1960s was {{undergoing}} tremendous change after the huge {{influx of newcomers}} in the 1950s. The old commercial districts did not have ample off-street parking and many shoppers were taking their business to new commercial centers, such as Parkington and Seven Corners. Suburbs further out in Virginia and Maryland were expanding, and Arlington's main commercial center in Clarendon was declining, similar {{to what happened in}} other downtown centers. With the growth of these other suburbs, some planners and politicians pushed for highway expansion. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would have enabled that expansion in Arlington. However, the administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency, economist C. Darwin Stolzenbach, saw the benefits of rapid transit for the region and oversaw plans for a below ground rapid transit system, now the Washington Metro, which included two lines in Arlington. Initial plans called for what became the Orange Line to parallel I-66, which would have mainly benefited Fairfax County. Arlington County officials called for the stations in Arlington to be placed along the decaying commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston that included Clarendon. A new regional transportation planning entity was formed, the Washington, Metropolitan Transit Authority. Arlington officials renewed their push for a route that benefited the commercial corridor along Wilson Boulevard, which prevailed. There were neighborhood concerns that there would be high density development along the corridor that would disrupt the character of old neighborhoods. With population in the county declining, political leaders saw economic development as a long range benefit. Citizen input and county planners came up with a workable compromise, with some limits on development. The two lines in Arlington were inaugurated in 1977. The Orange Line's creation was more problematic than the Blue Line's. The Blue Line served the Pentagon and National Airport, and boosted the commercial development of Crystal City <b>and</b> <b>Pentagon</b> City. Property values along the Metro lines increased significantly for both residential and commercial property. The transformation of Clarendon is particularly striking, with its transformation from a downtown shopping area, ensuing decay, home to a vibrant Vietnamese business community in the 1970s and 1980s known as Little Saigon, and now is a vibrant urban village. Arlington's careful planning for the Metro has transformed the county and has become a model revitalization for older suburbs.|$|E

500|$|After {{adopting}} an [...] "anti-Mexico" [...] {{attitude and}} teaming with El Mesías and Hernandez to defeat El Texano Jr., El Hijo del Fantasma <b>and</b> <b>Pentagón</b> Jr., Mundo challenged {{the latter to}} a match at Triplemanía XXIV for the AAA Latin American Championship, to which Pentagón accepted. At the event, on August 28, Mundo defeated Pentagón to win the Latin American Championship, marking his first championship in AAA and becoming the first non-Mexican to hold the title. On October 2 in the main event of Héroes Inmortales X, Mundo successfully defended his title against Garza Jr. On March 19, 2017, at Rey de Reyes, Mundo defeated El Texano Jr. and El Hijo del Fantasma in a three-way match to not only retain the Latin American Championship, but to also win Texano's AAA Mega Championship and Fantasma's AAA World Cruiserweight Championship. In his first AAA Mega Championship defense, on June 30, Mundo successfully retained his title against Texano.|$|E
500|$|In AAA, Cibernético formed Los Vipers with Negro {{along with}} Psicosis (II), Mosco De La Merced, Maniaco and Histeria. Histeria was {{replaced}} {{a few weeks}} later by Histeria II. In 1998, Negro acquired a [...] "mascot": a midget wrestler called Mini Abismo Negro. Abismo, Mini Abismo, and new Vipers member Electroshock were defeated by Octagón, his mascot Octagóncito, <b>and</b> <b>Pentagón</b> in a six-man tag team match at Triplemanía. Los Vipers engaged in several scripted rivalries with other AAA groups, such as the group of masked wrestlers dressed as clowns known as Los Payasos. They also had a long-running rivalry with Los Vatos Locos—consisting of Espiritu, Picudo, Nygma, May Flowers, and Silver Cat during the rivalry—over the Mexican National Atómicos Championship. Los Vipers won the Atómicos titles from Los Vatos on several occasions, but Negro {{was not part of the}} teams that won. Palomeque wrestling as Abismo Negro did capture a title of his own when he defeated Pentagón on May 19, 1998, to win the Mexican National Middleweight Championship, a title he held until January 1999.|$|E
500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to apply the}} Near <b>and</b> <b>Pentagon</b> Papers standards, the court {{was concerned about the}} prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not {{go so far as to}} claim that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it [...] "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date to those who do not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the national security of the United States, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." [...] However, the court still found that [...] "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for us all. In that event, our right to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause [...] "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the Pentagon Papers case. The preliminary injunction was therefore granted.|$|E

500|$|On June 4, 2015 in {{the main}} event of Verano de Escándalo, Mundo {{established}} himself as a rudo and teamed with El Mesias <b>and</b> <b>Pentagón</b> Jr. losing to Myzteziz, La Parka and Rey Mysterio Jr. On September 27, Konnan announced Mundo as an official member of the rudo stable, La Sociedad, while he subsequently stepped down {{as the leader of the}} group. On October 4, at Héroes Inmortales IX, Mundo unsuccessfully challenged El Patrón Alberto for the AAA Mega Championship, when he was defeated by disqualification. After Alberto left AAA, Mundo was scheduled to face Rey Mysterio Jr. for the vacant AAA Mega Championship at Guerra de Titanes, but after the matches of the event were officially announced, neither Mundo nor Mysterio were featured for the event. Mundo participated in the 2016 Lucha Libre World Cup as a member of [...] "Team Lucha Underground" [...] alongside Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Brian Cage, defeating [...] "Team Mexico Leyendas" [...] (Blue Demon Jr., Canek and La Parka) in the quarter-finals, and [...] "Team Mexico International" [...] (Rey Mysterio Jr., Dr. Wagner Jr. and Dragon Azteca Jr.) in the semi-finals.

500|$|Trying {{to build}} on the {{popularity}} of AAA wrestler Octagón Antonio Peña decided to use the [...] "evil counterpart" [...] concept here instead, turning Andrade into Pentagón, the mirror opposite of Octagón. Initially the two faced off in six-man or eight-man tag team matches as a way to build tension for singles matches further along the storyline. Their first encounter came at Triplemania III-A the first of AAA's major shows of 1995 when Octagón teamed with Konnan, Perro Aguayo and La Parka to defeat the team of Pentagón, Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000 and Jerry Estrada although without Pentagón and Octagón being involved in the finish of the match. One week late at Triplemania III-A Octagón teamed up with El Hijo del Santo, Rey Misterio Jr. and La Parka to defeat Pentagón, Blue Panther, Psicosis and Fuerza Guerrera. Again Octagón <b>and</b> <b>Pentagón</b> were not involved in the finish of the match but faced off several times in the ring to further the storyline. In early 1996, Andrade suffered an injury during a match with La Parka when a move caused him to land wrong. The impact left him momentarily clinically dead {{in the middle of the}} ring before being brought back to life. The injury, coupled with his age, forced Andrade to retire from wrestling. Since the Pentagón character wore a mask to cover his entire face it was decided to give the character to another wrestler who then became Pentagón without officially stating that it was a different wrestler under the mask now.|$|E
500|$|The 1980s saw {{the last}} of Koubek's major projects. [...] In August 1980, ground was broken on the 18-story Hyatt Regency Crystal City hotel (2799 Jefferson Davis Highway) and {{adjacent}} 12-story office building (2687 Clark Street) in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia. The same year, construction began on Pentagon City I <b>and</b> <b>Pentagon</b> City II—12-story twin office towers built by Rose Associates prior {{to the construction of}} the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, Pentagon Centre mall, Southampton Condominiums, and Claridge House condominiums. Koubek was also the lead architect for Capitol Place, a , $125 million project at the southeast corner of F Street NW and New Jersey Avenue NW. The project involved construction of a 13-story office building (now the headquarters of the American Federation of Teachers) and a hotel with a glass atrium (now the Washington Court Hotel). Groundbreaking began in December 1982, by which time another two office buildings (integrated with the first) had been added. In 1983, construction was completed on Koubek's black-glass curtain-walled Union Labor Life Insurance Company headquarters at 111 Massachusetts Avenue NW. (Commonly called the [...] "Darth Vader Building" [...] for its imposing black surface, the company sold the building to developer Douglas Jemal in 2003.) In 1984, Koubek partnered with architect Robert Brannen of Brannen/Jung Associates to design 1615 L Street NW, a 12-story office building with a two-story red brick facade on the ground surmounted by light-green glass and dark-green spandrels on the upper floors. The building was highly praised by The Washington Post for its deeply recessed and double-wide entrance and its spectacular, two-story lobby with seven different kinds of polished marble. In 1988, 1615 L Street NW won the Tucker Award of Excellence, [...] "the stone industry's most prestigious award," [...] for its use of stone in the building's lobby and other interiors. In March 1986, Koubek was commissioned to design One Judiciary Square, an 11-story office building on top of the Judiciary Square Metro station. He designed the Westin Georgetown hotel (2350 M Street NW) in 1988, a structure which successfully used large glass walls to [...] "mingle outside with inside". He also designed Shockoe Slip (formerly Shockoe Plaza), a seven-building complex at E. Cary and Governor Streets in Richmond, Virginia.|$|E
