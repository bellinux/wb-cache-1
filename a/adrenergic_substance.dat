40|$|THE {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the re-sults of an {{investigation}} of the therapeutic use of a sympatholytic drug, Dibenamine (N, N dibenzyl-beta-chloro-ethylamine), in certain psy-chopathologic syndromes in which an elevated blood level of adrenergic substances appears to play an important role in the production of symptoms. We know from the studies of Diethelm and others (i), that the emotions of anxiety, fear, panic, re-sentment, and anger are accompanied by the pres-ence in the blood of demonstrable adrenergic sub-stances, and that this is so regardless of the diag-nostic entity in which these psychopathologic emo-tions may appear. If we may assume that at least some of the distress of the patient is due to the ac-tion of the circulating <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substance,</b> it seems reasonable to believe that the administration of a sympatholytic drug would offer a certain amount of symptomatic relief. The pharmacologic properties of Dibenamine have been studied fairly extensively by Nickerson and Goodman (2, 3). These authors have shown that in mice, rats, rabbits, cats, dogs, and humans, Dibenamine blocks and reverses excitatory adrener-gic responses, but does not prevent the inhibitory effects of adrenalin. The drug is stable in acid alco-hol solution, but rapidly loses its activity at the ^H of the body. Nevertheless, the blocking effects of a single dose may last three to four days. Dibena-mine does not promote the in vitro or in vivo de-struction of adrenalin. These facts suggest that this amine acts directly upon effector cells in prevent-ing the excitatory response to adrenalin, and the prolonged inhibitory effect suggests inactivation or actual destruction of some structure or substance within these cells, with slow reactivation, repair, or replacement. Recovery is without residua. Dibenamine is moderately toxic, but if properly used can be safely administered over prolonge...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{selective}} non-covalent clenbuterol (CL) imprinted polymers {{were prepared}} using methacrylic acid as monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylale as cross-linking agent. HPLC experiments with columns packed with this material showed that CL are selectively recognised {{with respect to}} all other <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substances</b> studied using a phosphate buffer/acetonitrile eluent. The separation was strongly dependent on pH and the organic/aqueous phase ratio. An important contribution to the recognition mechanism from hydrophobic interactions was found at higher water content. These results demonstrate that a novel family of absorbents with high selectivity for CL was obtained which can be exploited in solid phase extractions or as recognition elements for selective sensors.

40|$|The {{progress}} of 58 patients with first attacks of genital herpes was monitored {{for up to}} 30 weeks. The effects of sex (gender), age, social class, and non-psychotic psychiatric illness (as measured by the "general health questionnaire," GHQ) on the recurrence rate of herpes was studied. The recurrence rates, measured by the actuarial percentage recurrence-free curves, showed that the 29 patients with GHQ scores above 11 had a significantly higher recurrence rate than those who scored less than 11 (P = 0. 002). There were no important differences between recurrence rates according according to sex, age, or social class. These findings suggest that non-psychotic states, such as anxiety or obsessionality resulting in GHQ scores above 12, may possibly cause an excess production of <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substances</b> which encourages reactivation of latent genital herpes. Thus, to lessen the recurrence rate in such patients, a psychological or chemical approach to treatment {{could be used to}} modify the autonomic sympathetic response...|$|R
5000|$|The {{immune system}} may be heavily {{influenced}} by stress. The sympathetic nervous system innervates various immunological structures, such as bone marrow and the spleen, allowing for it to regulate immune function. The <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substances</b> released by the sympathetic nervous system can also bind to and influence various immunological cells, further providing {{a connection between the}} systems. The HPA axis ultimately results in the release of cortisol, which generally has immunosuppressive effects. However, the effect of stress on the immune system is disputed, and various models have been proposed in an attempt to account for both the supposedly [...] "immunodeficiency" [...] linked diseases and diseases involving hyper activation of the immune system. The most recent model proposed to account for this suggests an push towards an imbalance of cellular immunity(Th1) and humoral immunity(Th2). The proposed imbalance involved hyperactivity of the Th2 system leading to some forms of immune hypersensitivity, while also increasing risk of some illnesses associated with decreased immune system function, such as infection and cancer.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} pharmacological and biochemical evidence for the involvement of <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substances</b> in the regulation of neuroeffector activities in the bioluminescent cnidarian Re illa koellikeri(Cnidaria, Anthozoa). Therefore, direct radiobinding assays were developed to identify and characterize b-ad energic binding in membrane preparations from this species, using the two b-antagonists [3 H]dihydroalprenolol and [3 H]CGP 12177 as tracers. In addition, the effect of various b-adrenergic agents on luminescence was examined. Binding of the radioligands at 25 ˚C was rapid, reversible, saturable and specific. Saturation studies revealed the presence of two different and independent classes of binding site, site 1 and site 2, n {{the body of the}} colony (rachis). In contrast, homogeneous populations of binding sites corresponding to site 1 were detected in autozooid polyps and to site 2 in he p duncle. The pharmacological profile of b-adrenergic binding in R. koellikerimembrane preparations displayed properties consistent with the presence of two sites and followed a pattern similar to b 2 -and b 1 -adrenergic receptor subtypes for site 1 and site 2, respectively. Bioluminescence in polyps was induced by b-agonists as well as by one b 1 -s lective antagonist, atenolol, an...|$|R
40|$|Sixty beef bulls with a {{body weight}} (BW) of 314. 79 16. 2 kg were used to {{evaluate}} the effects of zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) and zinc methionine (ZM) on growth performance and carcass characteristics. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, with a factorial 22 arrangement of treatments (ZH: 0 and 0. 15 mg kg 1 BW; ZM: 0 and 80 mg kg 1 dry matter). The ZH increased (PB 0. 05) the final BW, average daily gain, feed conversion, carcass yield and longissimus dorsi area. Bulls fed ZH plus ZM had less (PB 0. 01) backfat thickness and intramuscular fat (IMF) compared with those fed ZH or ZM alone. The ZH increased (PB 0. 02) the meat crude protein content and cooking loss. It is therefore concluded that ZH increases growth performance, carcass yield, longissimus dorsi area, and meat crude protein. The interaction of ZM and ZH did not present additional advantages. The reason for the reduction in backfat thickness and IMF by ZH plus ZM is unclear, and implies that our knowledge of b-agonistic <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substances</b> and their interactions with minerals is incomplete...|$|R
40|$|Mescaline, (3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyphenylethylamine), {{is one of}} {{the nine}} {{alkaloids}} found in the peyote cactus (Henry, 1949). Administered to man either orally or intravenously, it produces colored visions, synesthesias, and functional altera-tions of the autonomic nervous system (Hoch, 1951). Psychiatrists have used mescaline experimentally to induce a temporary psychosis with the hope of gain-ing insight into the nature of certain mental disorders. The effect on the auto-nomic nervous system and the chemical similarity to epinephrine and norepineph-rine suggested that the mode of action of mescaline may involve a disturbance in the activity of the <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substances.</b> The present work was undertaken to investigate the physiological effects of increasing doses of mescaline, of chronic administration, and of the influence of certain drugs on the action of mescaline. The possibility that mescaline competes for certain epinephrine receptors was considered and this phase of the investiga-tion was emphasized. METHODS. An inbred, local strain of Sprague-Dawley rats was used. Male animals 160 to 230 grams in weight were used in the experiments. No animal was used more than once in the acute experiments. Unless otherwise stated, the rats were permitted to feed ad lib. until the time of the experiment. The intraperitoneal LD 60 of mescaline was determined by a method using probit analysis and groups of ten animals per dose (Litchfield and Wilcoxon, 1949).

40|$|Control of {{expression}} of molecular receptors for chemical messengers and modulation of these receptors’ activity are now established as ways to alter cellular reaction. This paper extends these mechanisms to {{the arena of}} pathological pain by presenting the hypothesis that increased expression of α-adrenergic receptors in primary afferent neurons {{is part of the}} etiology of pain in classical causalgia. It is argued that partial denervation by lesion of peripheral nerve or by tissue destruction induces a change in peripheral nociceptors, making them excitable by sympathetic activity and <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substances.</b> This excitation is mediated by α-adrenergic receptors and has a time course reminiscent of experimental denervation supersensitivity. The change in neuronal phenotype is demonstrable after lesions of mixed nerves or of the sympathetic postganglionic supply. Similar partial denervations also produce a substantial {{increase in the number of}} dorsal root ganglion neurons evidencing the presence of α-adrenergic receptors. The hypothesis proposes the increased presence of α-adrenergic receptors in primary afferent neurons to result from an altered gene expression triggered by cytokines/growth factors produced by disconnection of peripheral nerve fibers from their cell bodies. These additional adrenergic receptors are suggested to make nociceptors and other primary afferent neurons excitable by local or circulating norepinephrine and epinephrine. For central pathways, the adrenergic excitation would be equivalent to that produced by noxious events and would consequently evoke pain. In support, evidence is cited for a form of denervation supersensitivity in causalgia and for increased expression of human α-adrenergic receptors after loss of sympathetic activity...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: IFNA 1 (interferon alpha) {{is a key}} {{cytokine}} {{regulating the}} activity of numerous immune cells. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) as natural interferon-producing cells play critical roles as sensors of pathogens and link innate to adaptive immunity. CpG motifs within DNA sequences activating toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9) are the main stimuli eliciting IFNA 1 secretion from pDCs. <b>Adrenergic</b> <b>substances</b> are capable of differentially modulating the response from various immune cells. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine how adrenoceptor stimulation influences TLR 9 -induced IFNA 1 secretion from human pDCs. METHODS: PBMCs generated from human whole blood and pDCs enriched from buffy coats were stimulated with LPS and CpG-ODN 2336 in the presence or absence of epinephrine and different adrenoceptor antagonists. Secretion of TNF and IFNA 1 was measured by ELISA. Flow cytometry was used to determine efficacy of pDC enrichment and adrenoceptor expression of PBMC subsets. The influence of modified IFNA 1 secretion on NK cell activity was evaluated using a colorimetric tumor cell lysis assay. RESULTS: TLR 9 -induced IFNA 1 secretion as well as TLR 4 -induced TNF secretion from PBMCs was dose-dependently attenuated by coincubation with epinephrine. Combination with different specific adrenoceptor antagonists revealed that this effect was mediated by the adrenoceptor β 2 (ADRB 2). Since flow cytometric analysis could exclude the presence of ADRB 2 on pDCs, highly enriched pDCs lacked any visible impact of adrenoceptor stimulation on TLR 9 -induced IFNA 1 release. Combination of pDCs with PBMCs restored the effect, even when they were separated by a permeable membrane. Suppression of TLR 9 -mediated IFNA 1 secretion from PBMCs by adrenoceptor stimulation reduced the lytic activity of NK cells on K 562 tumor cells. CONCLUSION: We provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the interrelation between immune responses and pharmacological agents widely used in clinical practice. Our results have implications for the future treatment of human patients, in which the endogenous immune response plays a pivotal role, such as during viral infections, inflammatory diseases and cancers...|$|R
40|$|Donor {{catecholamine}} use reduces acute allograft {{rejection and}} improves graft survival after cadaveric renal transplantation. BackgroundEpidemiological data implicate that renal transplants from living unrelated donors result in superior survival rates {{as compared with}} cadaveric grafts, despite {{a higher degree of}} human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) mismatching. We undertook a center-based case control study to identify donor-specific determinants affecting early outcome in cadaveric transplantation. MethodsThe study database consisted of 152 consecutive cadaveric renal transplants performed at our center between June 1989 and September 1998. Of these, 24 patients received a retransplant. Donor kidneys were allocated on the basis of prospective HLA matching according to the Eurotransplant rules of organ sharing. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of a cyclosporine-based triple-drug regimen. In 67 recipients, at least one acute rejection episode occurred during the first month after transplantation. They were taken as cases, and the remaining 85 patients were the controls. Stepwise logistic regression was done on donor-specific explanatory variables obtained from standardized Eurotransplant Necrokidney reports. In a secondary evaluation, the impact on graft survival in long-term follow-up was further measured by applying a Cox regression model. The mean follow-up of all transplant recipients was 3. 8 years (sd 2. 7 years). ResultsDonor age [odds ratio (OR) 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 02 to 1. 08], traumatic brain injury as cause of death (OR 2. 75; 95 % CI, 1. 16 to 6. 52), and mismatch on HLA-DR (OR 3. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 47 to 6. 12) were associated with an increased risk of acute rejection, whereas donor use of dopamine (OR 0. 22; 95 % CI, 0. 09 to 0. 51) and/or noradrenaline (OR 0. 24; 95 % CI, 0. 10 to 0. 60) independently resulted in a significant beneficial effect. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, both donor treatment with dopamine (HR 0. 44; 95 % CI, 0. 22 to 0. 84) and noradrenaline (HR 0. 30; 95 % CI, 0. 10 to 0. 87) remained a significant predictor of superior graft survival in long-term follow-up. ConclusionsOur data strongly suggest that the use of catecholamines in postmortal organ donors during intensive care results in immunomodulating effects and improves graft survival in long-term follow-up. These findings may at least partially be explained by down-regulating effects of <b>adrenergic</b> <b>substances</b> on the expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM, E-selectin) in the vessel walls of the graft...|$|R
40|$|In most blood vessels, the {{endothelium}} generates both vasodilator and growth-stabilizing mediators {{under normal}} physiological circumstances. The vasodilator {{influence of the}} endothelium modulates the vasoconstriction induced by <b>adrenergic</b> nerves, blood-borne <b>substances,</b> and local autacoids. Nitric oxide (NO) is a major endothelium-derived vasodilator, along with protacyclin. A third substance called endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF) mediates vasodilatation in certain conduit arteries and in most resistance vessels. EDHF may be a cytochrome P- 450 metabolite of arachidonic acid. NO acts mostly through an elevation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in vascular smooth muscle, whereas prostacyclin stimulates adenylate cyclase. The mode of action of EDHF involves the activation of K+ channels. The multiplicity of the factors released by the endothelium, {{as well as the}} complexity of the interactions among these factors and those with other nonendothelial mediators, determine the extent of vasomotor control exerted locally by the endothelium. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
