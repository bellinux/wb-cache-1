All participants completed the resiliency, identity styles, spirituality, and perceived social support questionnaires. Results: The results of comparing of identity styles indicated that on informational and normative styles, non-addicts had significantly higher scores than <b>addicts</b> and recovered <b>addicts.</b> On avoidant/disoriented style, non <b>addicts</b> had significantly lower levels than two other <b>addict</b> groups. The results of comparing of resiliency showed that non-addicts had significantly higher scores than two other groups. Also recovered <b>addicts</b> were significantly more resilient than <b>addicts.</b> In comparing of spirituality component, non <b>addicts</b> and recovered <b>addicts</b> had significantly higher scores than <b>addicts.</b> By Comparing of perceived social support, non-addicts and recovered <b>addicts</b> had significantly higher levels than <b>addicts.</b> Conclusion: According to the results of this study, participating in NA groups and perception of social support increased the resiliency of recovered <b>addicts.</b> Also, identity is relatively consistent component that by participating in treatment process, does not change significantly...|$|R
40|$|Neil Levy {{argues that}} while <b>addicts</b> {{who believe they}} are not <b>addicts</b> are self-deceived, <b>addicts</b> who believe they are <b>addicts</b> are just as self-deceived. Such persons accept a false belief that their {{addictive}} behaviour involves a loss of control. This paper examines two implications of Levy's discussion: that accurate self-knowledge may be particularly difficult for addicts; and that an <b>addict's</b> self-deceived belief that they cannot control themselves may aid their attempts at self-control. I argue that the self-deceived beliefs of <b>addicts</b> in denial and of self-described <b>addicts</b> differ in kind. Unlike the self-deception of an <b>addict</b> in denial, that of the self-described <b>addict</b> allows them to acknowledge their behaviour. As such, it may aid an <b>addict</b> to develop more self-control. A paradoxical implication is that this self-deception may allow an <b>addict</b> more self-knowledge. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to determine the role of family functioning and psychological problems of drug <b>addicts</b> and non <b>addicts</b> by assessing {{the difference between the two}} groups. After detailed literature review it was hypothesized that scores on the variable of communication, affective expression and control among family members of <b>addicts</b> will be higher than non <b>addicts.</b> Furthermore scores on the variables of anger control problems, emotional distress and positive self will also be higher of <b>addicts.</b> Methods: This was a cohort study.

Sample of present research consisted of 240 adolescents divided into two groups of 120 <b>addicts</b> and 120 non-addicts each from different socio-economic status. General scale of Family Assessment Measure-Version III (FAM-III) was administered in order to measure the level of communication, value and norms whereas dyadic Relationship Scale was used to measure affective expression and control among the family members of <b>addicts</b> and non <b>addicts.</b> Renold Adolescent Adjustment Screening Inventory was administered in order to assess anger control problems, emotional distress and positive self in <b>addicts</b> and non <b>addicts.</b> t-test was calculated in order to determine the difference in the level of communication, value and norms, affective expression and control among families of <b>addicts</b> and non <b>addicts.</b> Furthermore difference in anger control problems, emotional distress and positive self between the <b>addicts</b> and non <b>addicts</b> was also determined by calculating t-test.

40|$|Pituitary-thyroid {{function}} in male heroin <b>addicts</b> and <b>addicts</b> after abstinence (ex-addicts) was studied and {{compared with that}} of healthy euthyroid men. In heroin <b>addicts</b> the increases in circulating total thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were accompanied by an increase in the thyroid hormone uptake test. These changes may reflect a quantitative increase in thyroxine binding globulin. Reverse triidothyronine concentrations in heroin <b>addicts</b> were normal. The thyrotrophin-releasing hormone elicited a diminished thyrotrophin response in heroin <b>addicts</b> which was significantly different from that in control subjects and ex-addicts. An elevation of serum prolactin was noted in heroin <b>addicts,</b> while ex-addicts had normal levels.

The cross-sectional study was conducted among detoxified drug <b>addicts</b> from Mandatory Detoxification Center (MDC) in five Chinese cities. Orexin levels were assayed with radioimmunoassay (RIA). Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to detect differences across groups, and logistic regression was used to explore the association between orexin levels and characteristics of demographic and drug abuse. Between November 2009 and January 2011, 285 opiates <b>addicts,</b> 112 methamphetamine <b>addicts,</b> and 79 healthy controls were enrolled. At drug withdrawal period, both opiate and methamphetamine <b>addicts</b> had lower median orexin levels than controls, and median orexin levels in opiate <b>addicts</b> were higher than those in methamphetamine <b>addicts</b> (all above P< 0. 05). Adjusted odds of the above median concentration of orexin were higher for injection than “chasing the dragon” (AOR = 3. 1, 95 % CI = 1. 2 – 7. 9). No significant factors associated with orexin levels of methamphetamine <b>addicts</b> were found.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare HCV and HIV {{infection}} among heroin <b>addicts</b> in MMT {{and not in}} MMT in {{two large}} cities in central China. METHODS: A total of 541 heroin <b>addicts</b> were recruited from MMT clinics and voluntary detoxification centers in Changsha and Wuhan, China. Structured questionnaires collected data on their socio-demographics, clinical status, risk behaviors, and their knowledge of HIV. Their HIV serostatus and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) serostatus were determined by testing antibodies in blood serum. RESULTS: We observed a higher prevalence of HCV infection among MMT heroin <b>addicts</b> (82. 3 %) than that in the non-MMT group (50. 6 %). However, our findings indicated that the heroin <b>addicts</b> in MMT had less drug or sexual HIV/HCV risk behaviors and more knowledge about HIV than non-MMT <b>addicts.</b> The heroin <b>addicts</b> in MMT had a significantly higher percentage of individuals who always used condoms (44. 9 %) compared with patients in the non-MMT group (14. 6 %, p = 0. 039), and they had more knowledge about HIV than non-MMT individuals (p<. 001). The percentage of HIV-positive <b>addicts</b> in the MMT group (0. 7 %) and non-MMT group (0. 8 %) were almost same. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated {{that the rate of}} HCV infection among heroin <b>addicts</b> among MMT or non-MMT settings in central China is very high. The non-MMT heroin <b>addicts</b> have higher risk of becoming infected with HCV in the future, while at present they have lower rates of HCV infection than MMT heroin <b>addicts.</b> Although rates of HIV infection among MMT and non-MMT heroin <b>addicts</b> are low now, they are all at great risk of becoming infected with HIV in the future, especially for non-MMT heroin <b>addicts.</b> We should use the MMT sites as a platform to improve the control of HCV and HIV infection in heroin <b>addicts...</b>|$|R

The participants were sorted according to their age and education.     Results: There was a significant difference between the two groups with regard to harm avoidance, reward dependence, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence traits. Thus, opiate <b>addicts</b> had higher levels of harm avoidance, reward dependence, and cooperativeness, and stimulant <b>addicts</b> had higher levels of self-transcendence. The significance level was set at P < 0. 01.   Conclusion: The obtained results showed that there was a significant difference between opiate and stimulant <b>addicts.</b> Opiate <b>addicts</b> gained higher scores, compared with stimulant <b>addicts,</b> in Temperament and Character Inventory variables. The obtained results also showed that stimulant <b>addicts</b> were suffering from more severe disorders than opiate <b>addicts.</b> Based on the means of the values of the TCI, personality traits reﬂecting personality disorders are detectable and predictable in substance abusers.
