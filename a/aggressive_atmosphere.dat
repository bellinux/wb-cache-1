Crack houses were defined as the homes of crack users where crack is being sold and smoked together with other users. All crack houses were located in disadvantaged, multi-ethnic neighbourhoods.

In addition to economic benefits for residents (crack sales, getting crack for free from visitors) and sometimes also for visitors, crack houses predominantly serve as a safe haven for drug use and as a social meeting place. Two types of crack houses were found: dealing houses (with ‘home sellers’) and home circuits (divided into ‘fixers’ who arrange or facilitate that crack is available, and ‘users-for-free’, who allow that crack is sold or delivered and used in their apartment, in exchange for a bit of crack).

The films structure before and after heat treatment at 700 °C was characterised by XRD. In addition, two types of quantitative experiments were performed in thermobalance: oxidation rate was deduced from isothermal thermogravimetric analyses at 800 °C, while the temperature of oxidation beginning (Tc) was measured in dynamic mode. Tc was then calculated by a mathematical approximation based on the non-linear least square. The results were compared to those obtained using TiN and SiNx standards. Depending on the deposition conditions, ternary films have been deposited with an atomic ratio Si/Ti of 0. 10 and 0. 15. The hardness of the films was close to 40 GPa. Only the TiN phase was detected by XRD. The mean crystal size {{was estimated to be}} in the 6 - 8 nm range, which suggested the nanocomposite nature of the coatings. After air oxidation at 700 °C, it was found that this crystal size was not affected by the thermal treatment, indicating a good thermal stability of the structure. Moreover, incorporation of silicon into TiN-based coatings led to a drastic decrease of their oxidation rate, together with a shift of 200 °C of Tc. The high resistance of oxidation of Ti-Si-N films at elevated temperature is attributable to the network of refractory SiNx, which acted as a diffusion barrier for oxygen and insulated TiN nanograins from the <b>aggressive</b> <b>atmosphere...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the analysis of}} probabilistic corrosion time initiation in reinforced concrete structures exposed to ions chloride penetration. Structural durability is an important criterion which must be evaluated in every type of structure, especially when these structures are constructed in <b>aggressive</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Considering reinforced concrete members, chloride diffusion process is widely {{used to evaluate the}} durability. There-fore, at modelling this phenomenon, corrosion of reinforcements can be better estimated and prevented. These processes begin when a threshold level of chlorides concentration is reached at the steel bars of reinforcements. Despite the robustness of several models proposed in the literature, deterministic approaches fail to predict accurately the corrosion time initiation due to the inherently randomness observed in this process. In this regard, the durability can be more realistically represented using probabilistic approaches. A probabilistic analysis of ions chloride penetration is presented in this paper. The ions chloride penetration is simulated using the Fick’s second law of diffusion. This law represents the chloride diffusion process, considering time dependent effects. The probability of failure is calculated using Monte Carlo simulation and the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) with a direct coupling approach. Some examples are considered in order to study these phenomena and a simplified method is proposed to determine optimal values for concrete cover...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} thin hard {{coatings}} at a nanometric scale is very promising {{to improve the}} surface characteristics of coated parts. Unfortunately, most often only one specific property is really enhanced. Besides, the origin of such a "nanostructure effect" remains still not clearly elucidated, and a wider industrial development requires {{a better understanding of}} the relations linking structure and functionality. This paper results from an invited review presented within the framework of the EMRS 2007 spring meeting. Its objective is to present how it is possible to control the films structure to achieve optimized performance in terms of tribological, mechanical, and physico-chemical behaviours. Two types of films architecture are studied, resulting either from a stratification of nanolayers, or from a nanodistribution of a crystallised phase into an amorphous matrix. To illustrate both structures, arc-evaporated nanomultilayered TiN/CrN and TiSiN nanocomposite coatings are more particularly developed, and compared to TiN, CrN and SiNx references. High wear resistance of TiN/CrN is explained by an original propagation mode of the cracks due to a fluctuating residual stress field, evidenced by TEM and synchrotron measurements. Corrosion behaviour depends mainly on the nature of the outer layer. An external CrN layer, presenting a p-type semiconductive character, affords an enhanced protection. A beneficial role of the nanostratification, susceptible to strongly improve the density of films, was also evidenced. The high oxidation resistance of TiSiN is attributable to the network of refractory SiNx, which acts as a diffusion barrier for oxygen and insulates the highly reactive TiN nanograins from the <b>aggressive</b> <b>atmosphere...</b>|$|E

The tempered martensitic steel P 92 is a creep resistant material used for the production of components for live steam with operating temperature 550 - 630 °C. For the application of these steels is essentially necessary to know the impact of different test atmospheres and temperatures on the crack growth rate. In the present work, the influence of atmosphere (air, vacuum, simulated live steam), proof-temperature, hold time, thermal exposure on the crack growth has been studied at temperatures between 500 and 600 °C. The influence of proof-temperature and atmosphere has been reflected on micrographs of fracture surface. SEM-micrographs of the principal crack and also optical micrographs coming from the cross sections perpendicular to the plane of a crack propagation (secondary cracks) show changes in the character of a crack propagation dependent of the loading cycle and temperature. By fatigue crack growth tests has been enhancement of crack growth due to the <b>aggressive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> (air) noted. The fatigue crack growth rates in air are at least one order of magnitude faster than those in vacuum (inert atmosphere).

The results from crack growth tests demonstrated, that steam oxidation plays a important role among the three factor, creep crack growth, fatigue crack growth and oxidation, in crack growth of these steel in superheated steam.

They have evident limitations in accomplishing interplanetary transfers by their own, but they add flexibility to the operational mission if they are thought to be the opportunity to distribute sensors in different locations as soon as the main platform arrives at the target planet. A fleet of nanosatellites, equipped either with identical or different scientific payloads can be released at the end of the interplanetary transfer to support the main probe science data collection or to add more environmental data retrieval, making the mission enhanced. Moreover, they can be released to get through harsh and dangerous environments-such as planetary ejecta and <b>aggressive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> - as scouts, preserving the safety of the main vehicle while acquiring scientifically interesting data the collection of which with a single classic size probe, would have required a largely expensive design, testing and qualification to ensure any catastrophic risk mitigation. Nano satellite delivery mitigates the risk with numerosity and flexibility. In this perspective the paper presents the study run on a nanosatellite fleet delivery around the Dydimos binary asteroid. The fleet scientific objectives are the binary gravity field reconstruction, any binary natural emission detection, 3 D thermogravimetry and imaging. Therefore, a camera, a microbalance and corner cube retroreflectors is the set of selected payloads. Three combinations of 6 1 U cubesat have been traded off to get the best science return according to the tight constraints imposed by the nanosatellites available technology, the harsh environment they would operate in and the science requirements. Moreover, the peculiar dynamics the gravitational binary asteroid environment provokes on vehicles flying in its proximity has been analyzed to exploit at the best its properties to minimize the nanosatellite fleet control while maximizing the desired trajectory evolution in time.
