5|$|In the station, {{the trains}} are {{oriented}} in a vertical position {{in order to}} allow riders to board. Once the restraints are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sections}} of the Beijing-Guangzhou railway, a main rail route in China, were blocked by flooding and landslides, causing many delays and diversions. One train was surrounded by floodwaters in Lechang, and passengers had to be evacuated to a nearby school. At least 274 trains were affected <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> company refunded nearly 2million tickets. After three days of repair work, the rail service resumed normal operations on July 18.|$|E
5|$|After {{the police}} leave, Cheenu comes running after {{the car in}} which Viji is travelling. He follows them to the railway station and tries to gain the {{attention}} of Viji, but she is unable to recognise him. Cheenu acts like a dancing monkey that Viji developed a liking for, but Viji, unable to comprehend, thinks that he is insane and begging for food. Cheenu continues his futile attempts to gain her attention, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> eventually leaves with Viji not recognising him. Cheenu, who was injured while chasing her car {{and trying to get}} her attention, is left alone, heartbroken.|$|E

5|$|In Boston, an {{undercover}} cop {{waits for the}} subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
5|$|In Series 1, Episode 6, Rachel reveals to Karen {{that she}} is pregnant, but is unsure whether the father is Adam or Kris, whom she had sex with {{while he was in}} Manchester. She devastates Adam by first turning down his {{proposal}} of marriage, after he believes he is the father of the child, and then by leaving Manchester on a train. Adam arrives at the station shortly before her train leaves and pledges to love the child regardless of who its father is. Rachel demonstrates that he does not mean it, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> departs for London.|$|E
5|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} from Stephenson's, {{but the first}} was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth being told to convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828 two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing the driver and both due to the safety valves being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used on the line, and they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy cart was introduced in mid-1828: a small cart {{at the end of}} the train, this carried the horse downhill, allowing it to rest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> to run at higher speed. The S made their use compulsory from November 1828.|$|E

5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. The battalion {{was the lead}} unit {{of one of the}} columns, numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E
5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which are attached to the restraints.|$|E
5|$|Stunt co-ordinator Martin Grace {{suffered}} an injury while shooting {{the scene where}} Bond climbs down the train to catch Octopussy's attention. During {{the second day of}} filming, Grace – who was Roger Moore's stunt double for the scene – carried on doing the scene longer than he should have, due to a miscommunication with the second unit director, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> entered a section of the track which the team had not properly surveyed. Shortly afterwards, a concrete pole fractured Grace's left leg.|$|E

5|$|As {{the train}} departs King's Cross, Hedwig the owl flies {{alongside}} while {{passing through the}} outskirts of London. Hedwig flies away and Dementors arrive from over the nearby buildings. At the same time Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass along the corridor side of the carriage looking for food. The journey enters a tunnel; upon its exit, it passes by Malfoy Manor during a stormy night. Next, the train passes through a second tunnel and {{the lights in the}} compartments go out as a Dementor enters the train and passes along the corridor; Harry Potter uses his magic to defeat the Dementor. After exiting the tunnel, riders are greeted by Hagrid flying on a motorbike with Hogwarts in the background. As the train enters a forest, the flying Ford Anglia appears and starts driving through the terrain. The car crashes soon after <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> leaves the forest, passing by Hogwarts once again before arriving at Hogsmeade Station with Hagrid greeting passengers.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{additional}} Pendolinos {{were ordered}} {{at the end}} 1997 {{at the price of}} FIM 77 million per train (€13 million). They were delivered between 2000 and 2002. The main series trains differed in various ways from the prototypes. The new trains allowed Pendolino traffic to extend: they started running between Helsinki and Jyväskylä on 22 October 2001. In June 2002, the network was expanded further, and routes were continued from Tampere onwards to Oulu and from Jyväskylä to Kuopio. One of the main series trains (number 7x08) was damaged during maritime transport in October 2001. The badly secured train had come loose during a storm on the Atlantic, almost causing the loss of M/S Traden, the ship carrying it. Thanks to good actions of the ship's crew, it was able to reach Le Havre <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> was sent back to Italy to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|On 27 February 2002, the Godhra train burning {{incident}} {{initiated a}} series of riots in Gujarat. Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya on the Sabarmati Express train were attacked <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> which had stopped at Godhra station, was set on fire causing the death of 58 Hindus including 25 women and 15 childrenactivists of Vishva Hindu Parishad and Kar Sevaks. Following the attack, false rumours were spread by a senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader that Muslims had kidnapped three Hindu girls during the incident. Retaliatory attacks on Muslims began the same evening; a number of incidents in which Muslims were attacked and killed were reported in various cities in Gujarat before the Naroda incident. The first attacks on the Muslim community occurred at Ahmedabad, where Hindu mobs began throwing stones and later burnt Gulbarg Society, a Muslim housing complex. The initial violence {{was believed to be}} instigated by the unsubstantiated rumours about Muslims kidnapping three Hindu girls. Violence spread to the largely rural districts of Panchmahal, Mehsana, Kheda, Junagadh, Banaskantha, Patan, Anand and Narmada the next day.|$|E

5|$|Security on the Delhi Metro {{is handled}} by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who have been {{guarding}} the system ever since they took over from the Delhi Police in 2007. Closed-circuit cameras are used to monitor trains and stations, and feed from these is monitored by both the CISF and Delhi Metro authorities at their respective control rooms. Over 3500 CISF personnel have been deployed to deal with law and order issues in the system, in addition to metal detectors, X-ray baggage inspection systems, and dog squads which are used to secure the system. About 5,200 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cover every nook and corner of each Metro station. Each of the underground stations has about 45 to 50 cameras installed while the elevated stations have about 16 to 20 cameras each. The monitoring of these cameras {{is done by the}} CISF, which is in charge of security of the Metro, as well as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Intercoms are provided in each train car for emergency communication between the passengers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> operator. Periodic security drills are carried out at stations and on trains to ensure preparedness of security agencies in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|The conference {{began in}} the evening of September 29, 1920. The Polish {{delegation}} was led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz (who originated from Lithuania), and the Lithuanian delegation by general Maksimas Katche. Lithuania proposed an immediate armistice, but the Polish delegation refused. Only after the Lithuanian delegation threatened to leave the negotiation table did Poland agree to stop fighting, but only {{to the east of}} the Neman River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting {{to the west of the}} river continued. The Polish delegates demanded that the Lithuanians allow the Polish forces to use a portion of the Warsaw– Saint Petersburg Railway <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> station in Varėna (Orany). The Lithuanians refused: their major forces were concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. The Lithuanian side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{express services}} were often given nicknames by railwaymen but these names later appeared officially in timetables, on headboards {{carried on the}} locomotive, and on roofboards above {{the windows of the}} carriages. For instance, the late-morning Flying Dutchman express between London and Exeter was named after the winning horse of the Derby and St Ledger races in 1849. Although withdrawn at the end of 1867, the name was revived in 1869– following a request from the Bristol and Exeter Railway– <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> ran through to Plymouth. An afternoon express was instigated on the same route in June 1879 and became known as The Zulu. A third West Country express was introduced in 1890, running to and from Penzance as The Cornishman. A new service, the Cornish Riviera Express ran between London and Penzance– non-stop to Plymouth– from 1 July 1904, although it ran only in the summer during 1904 and 1905 before becoming a permanent feature of the timetable in 1906.|$|E
