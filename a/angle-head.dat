50|$|A {{headlamp}} {{is designed}} to be worn on the head, often having separate lamp and battery components. The battery pack may be attached {{at the back of the}} head or in a pocket to improve balance. Headlamps leave the user's hands free. A headlamp can be clipped to the brim of a hat, or built to mount on a hard hat, instead of using straps; other types resemble eyeglass frames. Similar to the headlamp, an <b>angle-head</b> flashlight emits light perpendicular to the length of the battery tube; it can be clipped to a headband, belt, or webbing or set on a flat surface. Some types allow the user to adjust the angle of the head. The Fulton MX991/U Flashlight was an <b>angle-head</b> flashlight issued to US military personnel; similar style lights remain popular.|$|E
50|$|The Fulton MX991/U Flashlight (or {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a GI Flashlight, Army flashlight, moonbeam (Marine Corps) or simply MX991/U) {{is a model of}} <b>angle-head</b> flashlight currently manufactured by Fulton Industries which was issued to soldiers during the Vietnam War, and has since remained in service with the United States Army.|$|E
50|$|Gonocephalus abbotti’s {{experience}} {{interacting with}} humans {{has been both}} positive and negative. The location of the dragon plays a part on the influence. The Thailand and Malaysia regions are subject to farming and the clearing of rainforest timber to acquire more farm land. The end product can result {{in the destruction of}} habitats of reptiles and lizards, including the <b>angle-head.</b> Many exotic lizards and reptiles are also hunted and sold as pets affecting the general diversity of rainforest organisms. Environmental degradation is an issue for the <b>angle-head</b> along with many other rainforest species (Bain, & Hurley, 2011). The Gonocephalus abbotti currently does not appear on the red list but it does appear in the catalog of life (“Catalogue of life: Indexing the worlds known species,”2012). The angle head does not appear on the red list {{due to the lack of}} data.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, {{a request}} {{was made for}} a type of {{flashlight}} to be developed and used by soldiers being deployed by the US military. The TL-122 series of <b>angle-head</b> flashlights was developed by multiple manufacturers, most notably Bright Star, and issued to soldiers. It was used widely throughout the war, and the design remained fairly consistent throughout the following years.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flashlight}} {{is often}} sold at military disposal stores, and is popularly {{considered by many}} to be an ideal flashlight for camping or power outages, due to its low price, utility and durable body. The flashlight can also accept custom bulbs such as modern LED lamp, which greatly extend the battery life and provide brighter light than the standard incandescent bulbs. It is still widely recognized or known as a [...] "GI Flashlight" [...] or [...] "Boy Scout Flashlight" [...] in referral to its resemblance to the brass stamped <b>angle-head</b> flashlights issued to Boy Scouts in the mid-century.|$|E
50|$|The <b>angle-head</b> is a shy and an excitable dragon; therefore, {{a spacious}} pen is {{recommended}} to reduce stress {{and make them}} feel more at home (Langerwerf, 2006, p. 107). In fact, the environmental {{set up for the}} dragon is imperative to maintain a healthy dragon such as G. abbotti. The dragon should have an environment that provides a place to obtain warmth and bask. An environment that lacks this feature may accumulate an overabundance of moisture. This can result in blisters. On the other hand, if the environment is too dry the dragon may acquire a shedding problem called dysecdysis. The problem consists of incomplete shedding in areas such as the toes and the tip of the tail. An ideal temperature for a dragon enclosure ranges from 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit with a place to bask and stay moist. A temperature that is too high can cause heat stroke and or death.

5000|$|Realizing {{he was the}} {{intended}} sacrifice, Alex experiences a flashback showing Josh's true fate. When Alex was younger, he had taken Josh rowing out on the lake, where Josh showed Alex a ring, which his father had chosen to give to him instead of Alex. Out of jealousy, Alex struggled with Josh {{to try to take}} the ring, and as they fought Josh accidentally fell into the lake and drowned. His father retrieved the body and explained that Alex had [...] "ruined it for all of us", since he had chosen Alex, and not Josh; unable to accept Josh's death, Alex was then sent to the mental hospital, and with Josh instead of Alex sacrificed, the Order's pact was broken. After fighting the final boss, the manifestation of Josh's spirit, Alex finally has the chance to apologize and states that he never wanted Josh's death. Alex leaves the family ring and their father's <b>angle-head</b> army flashlight on Josh's body and exits the chamber.|$|E

40|$|Red {{blood cell}} (RBC) {{fractions}} were studied after separation of whole blood {{by means of}} counterflow centrifugation, Percoll column [Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and a combi-nation of both separation techniques. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and hemoglo-bin Alc (HbAlc) were measured in each fraction. From the results {{it was obvious that}} the combination of both tech-niques was the best separation technique of these three. N ORDER TO study characteristics of red blood cell 1 (RBC) senescence, it is necessary to isolate RBC populations of different mean cell age. Most of the investi-gations have been performed with erythrocytes separated on the basis of differences in cell density. Plain centrifuga-tion, ' <b>angle-head</b> centrifugation: and the use of several discontinuous gradients, for instance albumin 3 and Strac...|$|E
40|$|Carp {{erythrocytes}} were fractionated by <b>angle-head</b> centrifugation which yielded fractions with {{a linear}} increase in density. Haematological examinations {{revealed that the}} heavier red blood cells of carp had greater volumes (MCV), more haemoglobin (MCH) and higher haemoglobin concentrations (MCHC) than light ones. The same experiments with human red cell fractions yielded a decrease in MCV, constant MCH {{and an increase in}} MCHC. Haemoglobin content in individual erythrocytes was also determined by scanning stage absorbance cytophotometry to establish the frequency distribution of the cellular haemoglobin contents. In carp, the distribution was symmetrical with the means increasing with density. No such change with cell density was found in human erythrocytes. Both carp and human erythrocytes incorporated [2 - 14 C]glycine in vitro. After gel filtration, radioactivity was detected in carp, but not in human, haemoglobin fractions. 14 C was found in all three haemoglobin fractions, obtained by isoelectric focusing, and was present in the haem and in the globin. [2 - 14 C]glycine-labelled erythrocytes were reinjected into chronically cannulated carp and followed in vivo for several months. With time, the main peak of scintillation counts shifted from red cell fractions of low to high density. This is considered as evidence that density and age of red cells in carp are positively correlated and that erythrocytes can synthesize haemoglobin while circulating in the peripheral blood...|$|E
