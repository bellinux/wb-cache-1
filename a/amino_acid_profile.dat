The main free <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> present in samples from Annurca apples were asparagine (> 70 mg/ 100 g), aspartic acid, glutamic acid and ophosphoserine (about 1 - 5 mg/ 100 g each).

40|$|This study {{characterizes the}} {{developmental}} patterns of seven key amino acids: glutamate, γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA), glycine, glutamine, aspartate, alanine and taurine in the mouse retina. We analyze <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in specific bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cell sub-populations (i. e. GABAergic vs. glycinergic amacrine cells) and anatomically distinct regions of photoreceptors and Müller cells (i. e. cell bodies vs. endfeet) by extracting data from previously described pattern recognition analysis. Pattern recognition statistically classifies all {{cells in the}} retina based on their neurochemical profile and surpasses the previous limitations of anatomical and morphological identification of cells in the immature retina. We found that the GABA and glycine cellular content reached adult-like levels in most neurons before glutamate. The metabolic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> glutamine, aspartate and alanine also reached maturity in most retinal cells before eye opening. When the overall <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>profiles</b> were considered for each cell group, ganglion cells and GABAergic amacrine cells matured first, followed by glycinergic amacrine cells and finally bipolar cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{measured}} the plasma levels of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> at various reproductive stages in female rats, including the estrous cycle, preg-nancy and lactation, and compared the resulting <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>profiles</b> using two- or three-dimensional figures. These figures {{revealed that the}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>profiles</b> of pregnant and lactating dams differed considerably from those during the estrous cycle or in male rats. The plasma levels of individual <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> were almost the same between proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus, and their profiles did not differ significantly. However, the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>profiles</b> changed during pregnancy and lactation in dams. The plasma Ser level decreased signifi-cantly in mid and late pregnancy, whereas Tyr, Gly and His decreased significantly in the late and end stages of pregnancy, and Trp and Lys significantly decreased and increased {{at the end of}} pregnancy, respectively. Much larger changes in <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>profiles</b> were observed during lactation, when the levels of many <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> increased significantly, and none showed a significant decrease. Plasma Pro, Ser and Gly levels increased continuously from day 1 until day 15 of lactation, whereas Asn and Met increased significantly from days 1 and 5 respectively until the end of lactation.

Following insemination, zygotes were immobilized in groups of 16 on the base of a Petri dish using Cell-Tak tissue adhesive to enable the developmental progress of each to be tracked to the blastocyst stage. Spent droplets of in vitro maturation medium were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, which revealed glutamine, arginine, and asparagine were depleted in the greatest quantities. Incompetent MII oocytes that failed to cleave by 72 h postfertilization depleted significantly more glutamine from (P 0. 0006) and released more alanine (P 0. 0001) into the medium than oocytes that cleaved. When cutoff values were selected for the turnover of alanine, arginine, glutamine, leucine, and tryptophan and modeled to predict fertilization and cleavage potential, oocytes that did not exceed the cutoff values for 2 of these key <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> were more likely to cleave.

30|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} the influence of BCAAs on plasma <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>profiles</b> and protein metabolism in humans (Matthews 2005). Plasma amino-acid profiles have received considerable clinical focus because multivariate indexes consisting of plasma <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>profiles</b> have potential for diagnostic applications, disease activity monitoring and the assessment of pathophysiological conditions (Noguchi et al. 2006; Hisamatsu et al. 2012). The initial rationale for the clinical application of plasma <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>profiles</b> was Fischer’s ratio, which indicates the balance between BCAAs and aromatic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (AAAs) and serves as a diagnostic marker and indicator of the progression of liver fibrosis and of the effects of drugs (Fischer et al. 1976; Soeters and Fischer 1976). These reports generated interest in BCAAs and many studies in humans have investigated the effects of varying amounts and durations of infused <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (Matthews 2005). Leucine infusion elevates blood leucine concentrations ~ 6 -fold from the basal level and obviously decreases the concentrations of isoleucine (55 %), valine (40 %), methionine (50 %), phenylalanine (35 %) and tyrosine (35 %) (Hagenfeldt et al. 1980). In contrast, isoleucine or valine infusion elevates corresponding <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations to ~ 6.5 - and ~ 11 -fold, respectively, but do not significantly affect the concentrations of other <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (Eriksson et al. 1981). These findings indicated that leucine lowers AAA and methionine concentrations more effectively than other BCAAs.|$|R

The <b>profiles</b> of plasma <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> after ingesting <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> supplements should be clarified because the availability of circulating <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> regulates muscle protein turnover (Wolfe 2002; Bohé et al. 2003; Drummond et al. 2010). Exercise and essential <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> supplements, especially those providing added leucine, stimulate muscle protein synthesis (Pasiakos and McClung 2011) and the plasma <b>profiles</b> of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations after <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> ingestion are affected during strength training (Mero et al. 2008; 2009).
