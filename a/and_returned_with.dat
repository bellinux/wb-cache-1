He sought the assistance of Duke Boleslaus the Bold of Poland <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> Polish reinforcements. Béla emerged the victor in the ensuing civil war, during which Solomon's father was mortally injured in a battle. Solomon and his mother fled to the Holy Roman Empire and settled in Melk in Austria.|$|E
5|$|Gambira started {{attending}} school at age five, but the 1988 pro-democracy protests caused school closings that interrupted Gambira's schooling. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), {{he ran away}} from home at age 12 and was recruited as a child soldier by a military unit in Yangon. Once his parents located him, they removed him from the unit <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> him to their home in Pauk Township. When the authorities came to investigate, Gambira's parents enrolled him in a local monastery to protect him from arrest or conscription into further military service.|$|E

5|$|Linzee was {{advanced}} to rear-admiral on 11 April 1794 and shifted his flag to the 98-gun , bringing Downman {{with him as}} his second lieutenant. He was then moved into the 100-gun , the flagship of Admiral Lord Hood, <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> Hood to England. Hood was preparing {{to return to the}} Mediterranean aboard Victory, when on 2 May he was ordered to strike his flag. Victory then went out to the Mediterranean as a private ship, whereupon she became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Robert Mann, and then Sir John Jervis. Under Mann Downman saw action at the Naval Battle of Hyères Islands on 13 July 1795, and under Jervis he was at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{appointment}} of Abu-Ubaidah as commander in chief, he sent a small detachment to the annual fair held at Abu-al-Quds, modern day Abla, near Zahlé 50km east of Beirut. There was a Byzantine and Christian Arab garrison guarding that fair, however {{the size of the}} garrison was miscalculated by the Muslim informants. The garrison quickly encircled the small Muslim force. Before it would have been completely destroyed, Abu Ubaidah, having received new intelligence, sent Khalid to rescue the Muslim army. Khalid engaged and defeated them in the Battle of Abu-al-Quds on 15 October 634 <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> tons of looted booty from the fair and hundreds of Roman prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{historian}} Diodorus Siculus {{provided a}} seemingly conflicting account about Illyrian invasions occurring in 393 BC and 383 BC, {{which may have}} been representative of a single invasion led by Bardylis of the Dardani. In this event, Amyntas III is said to have fled his own kingdom <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> the support of Thessalian allies, while a possible pretender to the throne named Argaeus had ruled temporarily in Amyntas III's absence. When the powerful Chalcidian city of Olynthos was allegedly poised to overthrow Amyntas III and conquer the Macedonian kingdom, Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, sailed to Macedonia with a large Spartan force to provide critical aid to Amyntas III. The result of this campaign in 379 BC was the surrender of Olynthos and the abolition of the Chalcidian League.|$|E
5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} a refit {{in the early}} months of the war, Provence conducted anti-raider patrols with Force Y, based in Casablanca. Bretagne was also overhauled early in the war; in March 1940 she escorted a convoy to Halifax <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> another convoy loaded with aircraft for the French Air Force. She was then ordered to join Lorraine in Force X, to be based in Alexandria to operate in concert with the British Mediterranean Fleet. Two weeks later, Bretagne was instead ordered to steam at high speed to Bizerte, to join the Force de Raid with Provence. The ships put in at Mers-el-Kébir and remained there until after the fall of France in June 1940. To prevent the ships of the French Navy from falling {{into the hands of the}} occupying Germans, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the neutralization of all French warships. Force H was to deliver an ultimatum to the ships based at Mers-el-Kébir; on 3 July, the British squadron arrived outside the harbor and demanded that the ships sail with them to Britain or they would be sunk.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{had made}} no {{official}} provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough and had acquired experience in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account in al-Tabari, on his deathbed, al-Ma'mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as Caliph on 9 August, {{with the name of}} al-Mu'tasim. It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother, and al-Abbas's absence elsewhere, to propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, {{but it is clear that}} his position was far from secure: a large part of the army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas himself refused, whether out of weakness or out of a desire to avoid a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce to al-Mu'tasim's succession. The precariousness of his position is further evidenced by the fact that al-Mu'tasim immediately called off the expedition, abandoned the Tyana project <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> his army to Baghdad, which he reached on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 September 5, Lieutenant Colonel Rollins S. Emmerich, {{one of the}} ROK I Corps KMAG advisers, {{hastened to}} Yonil Airfield where he conferred with Lieutenant Colonel D. M. McMains, {{commanding}} the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry, stationed there, and informed him {{of the situation in}} P'ohang-dong. Emmerich obtained a platoon of tanks <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> them to the town. He placed the tanks in position and awaited the expected North Korean armored attack. At 05:30 he received information that elements of the ROK 22nd Regiment had retreated in the face of North Korean attack. North Korean troops entered this gap and just before 11:00 the American tanks in P'ohang-dong were under heavy North Korean machine gun fire. Five NK SU-76 self-propelled guns approached and began firing. At a range of one city block the US tanks knocked out the lead gun, killing its three crew members. In the ensuing exchange of fire the other four withdrew. Emmerich then directed air strikes and artillery fire which destroyed the other four guns. But that afternoon at 14:35 the order came to evacuate all materiel and supplies from the Yonil airstrip.|$|E

5|$|Brescia's {{army was}} easily dispersed, and Constantine quickly {{advanced}} to Verona, where a large Maxentian force was camped. Ruricius Pompeianus, {{general of the}} Veronese forces and Maxentius' praetorian prefect, was in a strong defensive position, since the town was surrounded on three sides by the Adige. Constantine sent a small force north of the town {{in an attempt to}} cross the river unnoticed. Ruricius sent a large detachment to counter Constantine's expeditionary force, but was defeated. Constantine's forces successfully surrounded the town and laid siege. Ruricius gave Constantine the slip <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> a larger force to oppose Constantine. Constantine refused to let up on the siege, and sent only a small force to oppose him. In the desperately fought encounter that followed, Ruricius was killed and his army destroyed. Verona surrendered soon afterwards, followed by Aquileia, Mutina (Modena), and Ravenna. The road to Rome was now wide open to Constantine.|$|E
5|$|Colonel England's 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was {{supported}} by the guns of the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery and a troop of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment. The tanks were late in arriving, and England postponed his attack to 1030. The battalion came under artillery fire, mostly from a battery north of Bardia that was then engaged and silenced by the 104th Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The advance resumed, only to come under machine gun and artillery fire from Wadi el Gerfan. An eight-man section under Lance Corporal F. W. Squires was sent to reconnoitre the wadi but attacked a battery position instead <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> 500 prisoners. The wadi was found to contain large numbers of Italian soldiers from technical units who, untrained for combat, surrendered in large numbers. One company captured over 2,000 prisoners, including 60 officers.|$|E
5|$|In about 880, {{after two}} decades in Córdoba, Onneca {{abandoned}} her Muslim family, <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> her father to Pamplona, to which he would shortly succeed. Shortly after her return, Onneca married her first cousin Aznar Sánchez de Laron. Together they had a son and two daughters, probably born between 880 and 890: Sancho, Toda and Sancha. Their son Sancho Aznar is only known from the Roda Codex genealogies and may have died young. Their daughters Toda and Sancha would both become queens consort of Pamplona by marrying into the Jiménez dynasty, which {{came to power in}} 905 after displacing Onneca's father Fortún Garcés from the throne. Toda married Sancho I Garcés, thus uniting the royal houses of Íñiguez and Jiménez. Toda's sister Sancha was wedded to Sancho I Garcés' brother and successor Jimeno Garcés, and was later killed in France by her son García Jiménez.|$|E

5|$|In the 850s, {{the most}} {{persistent}} {{threats to the}} Empire were the emirate of Melitene (Malatya) under Umar al-Aqta, the emirate of Tarsus under Ali ibn Yahya ("Ali the Armenian"), the emirate of Qaliqala (Theodosiopolis, modern Erzurum) and the Paulicians of Tephrike under their leader Karbeas. Melitene, in particular, was {{a major threat to}} Byzantium as its location on the western side of the Anti-Taurus range allowed direct access to the Anatolian plateau. An indication of the threat posed by these states came in 860, when their combined actions turned the year into a veritable annus horribilis for the Byzantines: Umar and Karbeas raided deep into Asia Minor <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> much plunder; they were followed shortly after by another raid by the forces of Tarsus under Ali, while a naval attack from Syria sacked the major Byzantine naval base at Attaleia.|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed back out <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> 13 {{steerage}} passengers. On board Volturno, {{the crew and}} some of the male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E
5|$|Some time in {{the early}} 12th century, a castle was built within the town. Originally a wooden fort built by Richard de Redvers, first cousin to King Henry I, it was rebuilt in stone by Baldwin de Redvers to resist King Stephen {{during the civil war}} with the Empress Matilda. The castle again saw action during the Civil War of 1642–1651 when {{occupied}} by the Parliamentarians. Christchurch changed hands a number of times: originally under Royalist control, it was captured by Sir William Waller's Parliamentary army in 1644. Lord Goring briefly retook the town in 1645 but was obliged to withdraw <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>with</b> a larger force days later and laid siege to the castle. However, the Parliamentarians withstood the siege and maintained their hold on the town. Fearing such a powerful stronghold might once again fall into Royalist hands, Cromwell ordered the castle to be destroyed in 1652.|$|E
