5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in {{a process known as}} photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> light.|$|E

40|$|The {{strains of}} Vibrio parahaemolyticus {{isolated}} from water, sediment, plankton, fish and prawn of Cochin backwater were tested for sensitivity to ten antibiotics namely, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, kanamycin, neomycin, oxytetracycline, penicillin, polymyxin-B, streptomycin and sulphadiazine. Of the 120 isolates tested, 96. 7 and 93. 3 % <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> gentamycin and chloramphenicol respectively. No strain <b>was</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> penicillin and only 5 % <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> kanamycin. Isolates from fish and prawn showed higher resistance to ampicillin {{and none of}} them <b>was</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> kanamycin.

30|$|It {{can also}} be added that when α has larger {{positive}} value, it <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> events that occur often and when α has larger negative value, and it <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> events that occur seldom.|$|R
5|$|Phellodon species, {{like other}} members of the family Bankeraceae, <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> air {{pollution}} and soil pollution, and are in general decline in western Europe. In a preliminary assessment for a red list of threatened British Fungi, P.confluens, P.tomentosus, and P.melaleucus are considered vulnerable, and P.niger is rare.|$|E
5|$|Stylidium habitat {{includes}} grassy plains, open heaths, rocky slopes, sandplains, forests, and {{the margins}} of creeks and water holes. Somes species, such as S. eglandulosum, can even be found in disturbed areas like near roads and under powerlines. Others (i.e. S. coroniforme) <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> disturbance and are considered rare because of their extremely specific habitat.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, {{in those who}} <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in {{those who do not}} respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E
30|$|The recall <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> false negatives, and on {{the other}} hand, {{precision}} <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> false positives. If the levenshtein values are higher, then false positives increase, and if the levenshtein values are lower, then false negatives increase.|$|R
50|$|As a photodiode, an LED <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> {{wavelengths}} {{equal to}} or shorter than the predominant wavelength it emits. For example, a green LED <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> blue light and to some green light, but not to yellow or red light.|$|R
40|$|In the pithed rat, {{following}} beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the pressor {{effect of}} adrenaline can be blocked by phentolamine or by prazosin plus yohimbine {{but not by}} prazosin or yohimbine given alone. It is concluded that adrenaline produces its pressor effect by acting on two sets of post-junctional alpha-adrenoceptors, each of which <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> phentolamine, one of which <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> prazosin but resistant to yohimbine and the other of which <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> yohimbine but resistant to prazosin...|$|R
5|$|C.maxima {{originated}} in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> frost, and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. C.maxima {{did not start}} to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of C.maxima include triloba, zapallito, zipinka, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (C.maxima Marrow), Show, and Turban.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are useful}} as bioindicators (of good water quality), since they <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> water pollution, and are {{large enough to}} be {{assessed}} conveniently in the field. Some species indicate undisturbed habitat, and some indicate degraded habitat. Although caddisflies may be found in waterbodies of varying qualities, species-rich caddisfly assemblages are generally thought to indicate clean water bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and marshes. Together with stoneflies and mayflies, caddisflies feature importantly in bioassessment surveys of streams and other water bodies.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups {{are in favor of}} DST.|$|E
50|$|To {{measure the}} index, one observes the {{magnitude}} of an object successively through two different filters, such as U and B, or B and V, where U <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> ultraviolet rays, B <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> blue light, and V <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> visible (green-yellow) light (see also: UBV system). The set of passbands or filters is called a photometric system. The difference in magnitudes found with these filters is called the U−B or B−V color index respectively.|$|R
30|$|DEA <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> outliners. Since DEA {{relies on}} {{identifying}} best practice reference units, it can <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> extreme points, known as outliners, especially data contaminated by measurement error {{as described by}} Kuosmanen and Post (1999) and Nam et al.

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling {{numerous}} times and answering their neighbors' calls before {{going off to}} forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both shallow and deep marine waters {{where they can be}} benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E

50|$|A glass {{electrode}} {{is a type}} of ion-selective electrode made of a doped glass membrane that <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> a specific ion. The most common application of ion-selective {{glass electrode}}s is for the measurement of pH. The pH electrode {{is an example of a}} glass electrode that <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> hydrogen ions. Glass electrodes play an important part in the instrumentation for chemical analysis and physico-chemical studies. The voltage of the glass electrode, relative to some reference value, <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> changes in the activity of certain type of ions.|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{sensitivity}} of 16 Australian isolates of Bordetella avium and 15 isolates of B. avium -like organisms to 11 antimicrobial agents or combinations of agents was determined using a microtitre plate system to establish minimal inhibitory concentrations. All the B. avium isolates <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> ampicillin but resistant to erythromycin, lincomycin, spectinomycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and lincomycin with spectinomycin. Most of the B. avium isolates <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> tetracycline and resistant to streptomycin and sulfadiazine.

5|$|Neptunocene, Np(C8H8)2, was {{synthesized}} in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K2(C8H8). It is isomorphous to uranocene and plutonocene, {{and they}} behave chemically identically: all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only slightly soluble in benzene and toluene. Other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC8H7)2 (R = ethanol, butanol) and KNp(C8H8)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound. In addition, neptunium hydrocarbyls have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are {{a precursor to}} many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Solid ionic {{compounds}} {{have long}} been used as paint pigments, and are resistant to organic solvents, but <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> acidity or basicity. Since 1801 pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks. Under intense heat, the electrons in the metal ions or small molecules can be excited. These electrons later return to lower energy states, and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present.|$|E
5|$|Some Hydnellum {{species have}} been shown to be in decline in Europe, {{including}} the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland. In the United Kingdom, several are listed in the biodiversity action plan for stiped hydnoid fungi: H. aurantiacum is classified as critically endangered; H. caeruleum, H. ferrugineum are listed as endangered, while H. concrescens, H. spongiosipes, H. peckii, and H. scrobiculatum are considered vulnerable. H. ferrugineum and H. peckii <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{dromedary}} has {{not occurred}} in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. Wild dromedaries inhabited arid regions, particularly the Sahara Desert. The original range of the camel’s wild ancestors was probably southern Asia and the Arabian peninsula. Its range included hot, arid regions of northern Africa, Ethiopia, the Near East and western and central Asia. The dromedary typically thrives in areas with a long dry season and a short wet season. They <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> cold and humidity, though some breeds can thrive in humid conditions.|$|E
5|$|The genome of the {{nematode}} worm C. elegans contains 9 serpins, all {{of which}} lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular. However, only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors. One, SRP-6, performs a protective function and guards against stress-induced calpain-associated lysosomal disruption. Further, SRP-6 inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases released after lysosomal rupture. Accordingly, worms lacking SRP-6 <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> stress. Most notably, SRP-6 knockout worms die when placed in water (the hypo-osmotic stress lethal phenotype or Osl). It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and controllable role in determining cell fate.|$|E
