40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oscillations</b> with periods of about 300 s which were observed for the 1991 Pinatubo and the 1982 El Chichón eruptions. Two distinct spectral peaks, at T = 270 and 230 s for the Pinatubo eruption and at T = 195 and 266 s for the El Chichón eruptions, have been reported. We found similar oscillations for the 1980 Mount St. Helens and the 1883 Krakatoa eruptions. To explain these observations, we investigated excitation problems for two types of idealized sources, “mass injection” and “energy injection” sources, placed in an isothermal atmosphere. In general, two modes of oscillations, “acoustic” and “gravity” modes, can be excited. For realistic atmospheric parameters, the acoustic and gravity modes have a period of 275 and 304 s, respectively. For a realistic time history of eruption, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oscillations</b> with an amplitude of 50 to 100 Pa (0. 5 to 1 mbar) can be excited by an energy injection source with a total energy of 10 ^ 17 J.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{model for the}} origin of the tropospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is presented. It is argued that the tropospheric QBO may not be a fundamental mode of oscillation of the tropical coupled system. It is proposed that it may arise due to multiscale interactions between high-frequency synoptic and intraseasonal oscillations of the atmosphere and a low-frequency oscillation of the coupled system {{in the presence of the}} annual cycle. This is demonstrated using a conceptual low-order system consisting of three variables representing the nonlinear <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oscillations</b> and a linear oscillator representing the low-frequency coupled mode. The annual cycle and coupling to the low-frequency linear oscillator provide slowly varying forcings for the <b>atmospheric</b> high-frequency <b>oscillations.</b> The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oscillations</b> go through a chaotic regime during a certain part of the slowly varying forcing. Such variable forcing introduces a low-frequency tail in the spectrum of the <b>atmospheric</b> high-frequency <b>oscillations.</b> This low-frequency tail resonantly interacts with the low-frequency oscillation and produces the QBO in addition to broadening the spectrum of the low-frequency oscillator. The {{conceptual model}} simulates features similar to many observed features of the tropospheric QBO but depends on the assumption that there is an inherent low-frequency El Nino-Southern Oscillation oscillation with a four-year period that occurs independently of the high-frequency forcing or the QBO...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of {{the effect}} of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oscillations</b> on {{physical}} condition of pre–reproductive bluefin tuna from the Strait of Gibraltar. — The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the possible effects of atmospheric oscillations: North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO), on the physical condition of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus). We estimated a fitness ratio from 3, 501 pairs of length–weight data based on bluefin tuna caught in bait–boat fisheries before the spawning season (January, February and March), for each length class and year. In order to obtain a single fitness ratio (K–mean) per year we determined the average for all length classes. We also evaluated Le Cren’s condition index (K LC). We observed significant positive correlations between the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oscillations</b> and both physical condition indexes. In the case of K–mean, the AO explained 75 % of the observed variability. Regarding K LC, the NAO explained approximately 73 % of the observed variability, while the AO explained 70 % of the observed variability. The increase in physical conditions of bluefin tuna in association with positive <b>atmospheric</b> <b>oscillations</b> could be mediated by the increase in the prevalence of strong trade winds. We concluded that the increase in the prevalence of strong westerly winds, mediated by a positive AO or NAO, favours the trip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean by reducing energy costs due to migration and by increasing the supply of nutrients at the surface by the mixing of deep water and surface water in local areas such as the Strait of Gibraltar.

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea is {{considered}} by several authors as a hot-spot of Climate Oscillation, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO). However, information {{about the effect of}} the climate oscillations on the fitness of the species is still scarce.
