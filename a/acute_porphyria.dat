25|$|Porphyria is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} in which substances called porphyrins build up, negatively affecting the skin or nervous system.

Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Acute</b> {{intermittent}} <b>porphyria</b> {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} metabolic disease. It {{is caused by a}} genetic mutation that results in deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme, the third enzyme in heme biosynthesis. <b>Acute</b> intermittent <b>porphyria</b> precipitated by surgery is very rare. Case presentation: We present a 24 year-old woman who developed <b>acute</b> intermittent <b>porphyria</b> five days after right hemi-colectomy. Her presentation included neuro-visceral and psychiatric manifestations, and severe hyponatremia. She received critical care symptomatic management including mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis was based on a positive urine test for porphobilinogen and confirmed by the presence of a heterozygous mutation in the hydroxyrmethylbilane synthase (HMBS) gene (c. 760 delC p Leu 254). Discussion: <b>Acute</b> intermittent <b>porphyria</b> is the most common and life threatining type of <b>acute</b> <b>porphyrias.</b> It is more common in women and usually presents after puberty with acute abdominal pain and diverse neuro-psychiatric manifestations that can be confused with several surgical and medical diseases. <b>Acute</b> intermittent <b>porphyria</b> after surgery is most likely due to postoperative pain and low-calorie intake. Once suspected, prompt ICU management including high calorie intake are necessary to avoid serious complications and mortality before starting definitive treatment with hematin. Conclusion: <b>Acute</b> intermittent <b>porphyria</b> should be suspected in any patient, particularly young women, who develop diverse neuro-visceral and psychiatric manifestations and hyponatremia after surgery...|$|R
