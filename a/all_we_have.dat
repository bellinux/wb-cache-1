5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
25|$|Dawkins {{finishes}} {{by arguing}} that atheism is not a recipe for despair but just the opposite; rather than viewing life as a trial that must be endured before reaching a mythical hereafter, an atheist sees this life as <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> and by disclaiming a next life can take more excitement in this one. Atheism, Dawkins concludes, is life-affirming {{in a way that}} religion can never be.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to do is wait six months and Saddam is going to collapse on his own volition. That vehicle is sanctions. They needed a justification; the justification was disarmament. They drafted a Chapter 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for the disarmament of Iraq and saying in Paragraph 14 that if Iraq complies, sanctions will be lifted. Within months of this resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and {{voted in favor of}} this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even if Iraq complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time Saddam Hussein is removed from power.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1943, [...] "out of {{frustration}} over American policy, and outrage at Hollywood's fear of offending its European markets", he organized {{and wrote a}} pageant, We Will Never Die, which was produced by Billy Rose and Ernst Lubitsch, {{and with the help}} of composer Kurt Weill and staging by Moss Hart. The pageant was performed at Madison Square Garden for two shows in front of 40,000 people in March 1943. It then traveled nationwide, including a performance at the Hollywood Bowl. Hecht was disappointed nonetheless. As Weill noted afterward, [...] "The pageant has accomplished nothing. Actually, <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done is make a lot of Jews cry, which is not a unique accomplishment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The current {{notion of}} Chinese {{philosophy}} {{as an academic}} field of study first appeared during the 20th century. In 1918, Hu Shih published [...] "An Outline of the History of Chinese philosophy". In the preface of this book, Chinese educator Cai Yuanpei wrote: There has been no systematic recording of classical Chinese learning. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> are very pedestrian accounts. If we wish to compose a systemic account of classical learning, the studies :of Antiquity are of no help, {{and we have no}} other way but follow the criteria of histories of philosophy in the West. In other words, only those who have studied the history of western :philosophy can determine the appropriate form of exposition.|$|E
2500|$|... "Friendship with Jesus Christ" [...] is a {{frequent}} theme of his preaching. He stressed that on this intimate friendship, [...] "everything depends." [...] He also said: [...] "We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God... speaking to him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy... That is <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to do is put}} ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history." [...] Thus, in his book Jesus of Nazareth, his main purpose was [...] "to help foster [...] the growth of a living relationship" [...] with Jesus Christ.|$|E

2500|$|After partial {{elections}} for Vaslui's 2nd College (April 1877), Carp took a Senate seat. He watched with concern as the PNL drew Romania closer to Russia, and as Russia prepared {{to confront the}} Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans refused to guarantee Romanian neutrality {{in the case of}} war, and Foreign Minister Mihail Kogălniceanu began meeting with the Russian envoys; Carp regretted Ottoman indifference, stating: [...] "abandoned by <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been pushed into the arms of Russia". He also asked, rhetorically, [...] "what is our guarantee against Russia?" [...] Just before the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, he criticized Premier Ion Brătianu for allowing safe passage to Russian troops. His argument was that the intrusion of [...] "30,000 foreign bayonets" [...] posed a great threat for Romania's future. Still a skeptic, Carp welcomed the his country's independence war on the Ottomans, but continued to warn his peers about any unwanted effects of the Russian alliance.|$|E
2500|$|On December 15, 2005, a {{week after}} Smith's ruling, [...] the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU {{announced}} they would appeal the decision. Their lawyer Seth Cohen told reporters [...] "that the organization disagrees with the judge's finding" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "confident they will win in the N.C. Court of Appeals". Cohen went on to say: [...] "It's a shame that this matter cannot be resolved sooner. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ever asked is that people of all faiths be able to put their hands on the holy text of their choice. It's that simple. We don't understand why this is such a big deal." [...] Cohen also said that members of Judaism have thrown their support behind the case as they {{would like to be able}} to swear on the Tanakh, and that this joining over the issue was one of the things [...] "that's gotten lost in this case".|$|E
2500|$|From {{an early}} age, Alice was {{interested}} in politics. When advancing age and illness incapacitated her Aunt Bamie, Alice stepped into her place as an unofficial political adviser to her father. She warned her father against challenging the renomination of William Howard Taft in 1912. Alice took a hard-line view of the Democrats and in her youth sympathized with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. She supported her half-brother Ted {{when he ran for}} governor of New York in 1924. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for president in [...] 1932, Alice publicly opposed his candidacy. Writing in the Ladies' Home Journal in October 1932, she said of FDR, [...] "Politically, his branch of the family and ours have always been in different camps, and the same surname is about <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> in common..... I am a Republican..... I am going to vote for Hoover..... If I were not a Republican, I would still vote for Mr. Hoover this time." ...|$|E
