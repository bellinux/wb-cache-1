He was charged with marijuana possession and intent to distribute.

25|$|By 1999, the 75-year-old stadium {{was showing}} its age. Except for the turf and {{lighting}} enhancements, no substantial upgrade {{of the stadium}} had occurred since the press box was built 25 years earlier, in 1975. The OU College of Architecture was housed under the west stands and in the north end zone, until other facilities became available in 1990. The artificial turf on Owen Field had literally become threadbare before its replacement in 1981; {{it is possible that}} the poor condition of the Superturf, prior to its 1994 replacement, contributed to a crash of the Sooner Schooner during a 1993 game against Colorado. The east side of the stadium still had the original dirt flooring underneath the stands, making for a cloudy, dusty walk into the student and visitor seating sections. Restrooms were old and inadequate; paint was peeling off external walls and the areas under the stands (the east side in particular) were dark <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> like dust.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E

500|$|In studies {{carried out}} prior to 1991–92 on {{physical}} and chemical parameters of the lake water, Lake Untersee was stated to be well-mixed and unstratified. However, studies performed {{in the summer of}} 1991–92 found significant stratification in a [...] wide trough in the southeastern part of the lake, where it is up to [...] deep. There were sharp vertical gradients of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity. While a thermocline was recorded at a depth between [...] and , an oxycline followed at , with a chemocline extending from [...] to bottom of the lake. Below , the water column was anoxic <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> of hydrogen sulfide. The presence of hydrogen sulfide was associated with decreased sulfate concentrations, indicating that it probably arose from bacterial reduction of sulfate.|$|E
500|$|In September 1930 Heseltine {{moved with}} Barbara Peache into a {{basement}} flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, {{he worked in}} the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of [...] "Bethlehem Down" [...] with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Knorr was physically, verbally, {{and psychologically}} abusive towards her children. After her fourth divorce, her {{alcoholism}} and abusive behavior escalated, {{and she also}} gained {{a tremendous amount of}} weight and became quick-tempered and reclusive. She disconnected the home phone and would not allow the children to have visitors. [...] Knorr and her children lived in Orangevale, California for many years before moving into a two-bedroom apartment in Sacramento; Knorr's eldest son Howard reportedly left home before the move to Sacramento. According to neighbors, the apartment was filthy <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> of urine. Neighbors also noticed that the children, whom Knorr never let go outside, seemed fearful, nervous and high-strung.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 July 2013, {{children}} aged between four and twelve {{years at the}} Dharmashati Gandaman primary school complained that their lunch, served {{as a part of}} the Midday Meal Scheme, tasted odd. Children who questioned the food were rebuked by the headmistress. Earlier, headmistress Meena Kumari had been informed by the school's cook that the new cooking oil was discoloured <b>and</b> <b>smelled</b> odd. Kumari replied that the oil was purchased at a local grocery store and safe to use. The cook, who was also hospitalized by the poisoning, later told reporters that it looked like there was [...] "an accumulation of residual waste at the bottom [...] ". The meal cooked at the school that day consisted of soya beans, rice and potato curry.|$|E

40|$|Malnutrition {{is common}} in both adult and {{pediatric}} patients undergoing treatment for cancer. Patients commonly attribute difficulties maintaining food intake to an altered taste developed during treatment. This review summarizes {{what is known about}} taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> dysfunction in patients with undergoing chemotherapy as their main treatment modality. Self-reported taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> alterations are prevalent in upwards of 86 % of cancer patients. There is some evidence for decreased taste sensitivity in cancer patients when assessed using common gustatory tests. In some patients, taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> alterations may continue well after their cancer treatment has been completed. Such disorders can increase distress, reduce appetite and contribute towards poor nutritional status in cancer patients. There remain no effective interventions for improving the appetite or nutritional intake of patients with cancer experiencing taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> changes. There is a lack of consistency in assessment methodologies for measuring taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> changes in cancer patients and we therefore recommend that future work use well-established methods. Research should also take into account the role of food hedonics, food flavor and texture in assessing the association between taste dysfunction, poor oral intake and malnutrition in cancer patients. Both adult and child cancer patients should be counselled on the potential impact taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> dysfunction can have on their appetite and oral intake...|$|R

The Prophet began to say, ‘O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!’” Her son Abdullah remembered: “He said, ‘O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja’far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!’” Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatima, “Prepare food for the family of Ja’far, for they are preoccupied today.” ...|$|E
