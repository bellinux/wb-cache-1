25|$|Much of {{the debate}} over {{contemporary}} Canadian identity is argued in political terms, and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values. To the political philosopher Charles Blattberg, Canada should be conceived as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, one that contains many other kinds of communities within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, civic (the provincial and municipal governments) and civil associational sorts, but also national communities. Blattberg thus sees Canada as a multinational country and so asserts that it contains a number of nations within it. Aside from the various aboriginal First Nations, there is also the nation of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> of the Acadians.|$|E

2500|$|Shepilov was {{the only}} Central Committee Secretary to oppose Khrushchev in June 1957 when a {{majority}} of the Presidium members tried to oust Khrushchev during the so-called Anti-Party Group affair. He reportedly joined the plot at the last moment when Lazar Kaganovich assured him that the plotters had a majority in the Presidium When Khrushchev prevailed at the Central Committee meeting, he was furious over what he saw as Shepilov's betrayal. Shepilov was ousted from the Central Committee on 29 June 1957 and [...] vilified in the press along with Molotov, Malenkov and Kaganovich, the only 3 other Soviet leaders whose participation in the coup attempt was made public at the time. Shepilov was friend of Marshal Georgy Zhukov <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> {{was one of the reasons}} why a few months later Zhukov himself was removed from the office.|$|E

2500|$|The Coregency Stela (UC 410) {{mentioned}} earlier might resolve the question {{if it were}} not so badly damaged. [...] The name Neferneferuaten replaced Nefertiti's name on it. How the image of Nefertiti was changed to match the new inscription could settle matters if her image was not missing. If her entire image was replaced it would mean Nefertiti was replaced by someone else called King Neferneferuaten <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> she died. If just a new crown was added to her image, it would argue quite strongly that Nefertiti adopted a new name and title. As it is, the scene seems to be another of the royal family including at least Meritaten. Replacing the name Nefertiti with the name King Neferneferuaten in a depiction of the royal family, still seems to favor Nefertiti as the new king.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{documentation}} shipped {{with the original}} Lisa only ever {{referred to it as}} The Lisa, officially, Apple stated the name was an acronym for Local Integrated System Architecture or [...] "LISA". Since Steve Jobs's first daughter (born in 1978) was named Lisa Nicole Brennan, it was normally inferred that the name also had a personal association, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> the acronym was a backronym invented later to fit the name. Andy Hertzfeld states the acronym was reverse engineered from the name [...] "Lisa" [...] in late 1982 by the Apple marketing team, after they had hired a marketing consultancy firm to come up with names to replace [...] "Lisa" [...] and [...] "Macintosh" [...] (at the time considered by Jef Raskin to be merely internal project codenames) and then rejected all of the suggestions. Privately, Hertzfeld and the other software developers used [...] "Lisa: Invented Stupid Acronym", a recursive backronym, while computer industry pundits coined the term [...] "Let's Invent Some Acronym" [...] to fit the Lisa's name. Decades later, Jobs would tell his biographer Walter Isaacson: [...] "Obviously it was named for my daughter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vices & Virtues has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album {{has received}} an average score of 62 out of 100, which indicates [...] "generally favourable reviews" [...] based on 15 reviews. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called the record [...] "one of 2011's {{best and most}} captivating albums," [...] calling [...] "Sarah Smiles" [...] the [...] "stand-out" [...] and noting the wise change in tone to high-energy with the second track, [...] "Let's Kill Tonight". Alternative Press also welcomed the new version of Panic! at the Disco. [...] "Perhaps Smith and Urie's biggest success on Vices is their disinterest in simply recreating either of their previous albums, instead choosing to meld the youthful exuberance of their debut with the restraint and maturity of 2008's Pretty. Odd.," [...] wrote critic Evan Lucy. [...] "The duo sound absolutely recharged, likely {{a result of the}} lineup shuffling, but also perhaps a realization that the '70s were a nice place to visit for a couple years, but life in the 21st century is much more fun." [...] He went on to praise the [...] "Elfman-esque string arrangements, creepy undertones and twinkling pianos" [...] on several tracks and enjoy the [...] "scaled-back," [...] more personal tracks, such as [...] "The Calendar" [...] and [...] "Memories". James Montgomery of MTV News said of the album, [...] "Vices is at its very core a studio album, one stuffed with ideas and instrumentation, which not only positions Panic! as perhaps this generation's Brian-Wilsons-on-a-budget, but serves as a solid starting point for wherever Urie and Smith choose to go from here." [...] He complimented the new sound of the band: [...] "It's not exactly new, not exactly old, but it's definitely something. Call it a fresh start, a return to form, a re-imaging of the past, just don't call it Pretty. Odd. because that ship has sailed. Panic! are back to their old tricks, exclamation point and all ... <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> was the secret ingredient all along." ...|$|E
