She spent her childhood in Saint Petersburg, Poland and the Crimea, and married King George I of Greece in 1867 at the age of sixteen. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> felt ill at ease in the Kingdom of Greece, but she quickly became involved in social and charitable work.

He learned that Cooke had become a recluse nearby at her mother's plantation after her public disgrace. Having heard from a mutual friend about her beauty and accomplishments, he decided to meet Cooke. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> rejected all attention, but gradually received Beauchamp under his guise of borrowing books from her library. The two eventually became friends, and, in 1821, began courting. Beauchamp was eighteen years old; Cooke was at least thirty-four.|$|E
5|$|Growing up, Takako Matsu practiced {{piano and}} took vocal {{training}} as a child. Prior to releasing music, she acted in various television drama and plays. In 1996, she acted in the drama Long Vacation, which became very popular in Japan. At the wrap up party of the drama, {{the director of the}} series at that time heard her perform karaoke and suggested that she try singing. Although taken aback and hesitant <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> later agreed, as she felt it was not a chance that everyone received and because she liked singing; she felt it might work out somehow.|$|E
5|$|In terukkuttu performances, at {{the time}} of Aravan's sacrifice, he is often {{compared}} to Puru and Bhishma, characters in the Mahabharata who gave up their youth and sexual fulfilment for the sake of their respective fathers, Yayati and Santanu. In the drama, after acquiring Aravan's approval, Krishna approaches Aravan's mother, Ulupi—Nagakanni or Nakakanni ("Serpent maiden") in Tamil, for her consent. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>she</b> strongly opposes her son's proposed sacrifice but finally relents when Aravan appeals to her, explaining that he belongs to Kali alone.|$|E

50|$|A drunk Neil has an {{accidental}} meeting with Dodie and invites {{her onto the}} yacht. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>she's</b> annoyed by his advances, but in Tijuana she gets tipsy and has a great time.

5|$|Tubman {{served as}} a nurse in Port Royal, {{preparing}} remedies from local plants and aiding soldiers suffering from dysentery. She rendered assistance to men with smallpox; {{that she did not}} contract the disease herself started more rumors that she was blessed by God. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> received government rations for her work, but newly freed blacks thought she was getting special treatment. To ease the tension, she gave up her right to these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.|$|E
5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Anderson was {{institutionalized}} in {{a mental}} hospital after a suicide attempt in Berlin. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> went by the name Fräulein Unbekannt (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity. Later she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a Russian grand duchess first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family {{and those who had}} known her, including court tutor Pierre Gilliard, said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, identified Anderson as Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.|$|E

5000|$|A German girl, nicknamed Lotte, {{introduced}} in volume three. She's short {{and she has}} a very childish appearance; her silky blonde hair and blue eyes make her seem like a doll. Ushio falls for her <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sight and <b>she</b> calls her an 'angel'. Despite her appearance, Lotte's personality isn't feminine at all: she has a harsh way of speaking, she practices karate and wants to become cool and strong like Sumika. She also acts innocently and naively, and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>she's</b> easily tricked by Ushio into wearing cute dresses. When at school she wears a gakuran, a schoolboy's uniform, in order to preserve the [...] "Japanese spirit".|$|R
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>she</b> struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kim Deal {{was eager}} to {{continue}} recording and performing. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> envisioned her next album as a solo record, on which she would play all of the instrument parts. When she was recording initial demos for the project, she asked Kelley to play on some of them, to distract her from her drug difficulties. Since Kelley was now also involved, Deal {{decided not to go}} solo, but formed a new group. She recruited Macpherson to play drums, musician Luis Lerma, bass, and Nate Farley, guitar. Later, Kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota. For fun, Deal began calling herself Tammy Ampersand, and the group, Tammy and the Amps. This later became simply the Amps.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>she</b> hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but they were afraid that if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people who worked in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E

Alone in the billiard room, Sumner tells Diane that, against her will, he submitted one of her unfinished manuscripts {{to one of his}} colleagues, who praised it, and was sent to publishers. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> becomes excited. However, Sumner persuades her to leave everyone and everything behind, including Sam, in order to hone her talents. He warns her that finishing the novel is impossible and that her potentials will be wasted if she marries Sam. Diane tells Sumner to leave the bar and never return again. Unbeknownst to them, Sam overhears this conversation under the pool table whose underneath is covered by drapes.|$|E
5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>she</b> responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E

5|$|Bonstelle {{sold her}} {{stake in the}} Garrick Theater in 1924. She and her company founded the Bonstelle Playhouse in Detroit, which opened on January 1, 1925. Backed by a {{syndicate}} led by a patron of hers, she bought a former synagogue on Woodward Avenue, Temple Beth El, for $500,000 and commissioned C. Howard Crane to renovate it. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>she</b> carried on producing mostly Broadway-style plays. However, the company did perform classics, including modern-dress productions of Romeo and Juliet in 1926 and Hamlet in 1927, {{among the first to}} put on such performances. In February 1928 Bonstelle began a campaign to gain community support for the theater. A fund of over $200,000 was raised by donations from the public and Bonstelle made an agreement with local authorities to make the playhouse the city's unofficial premier theater. Later that year the group became known as the Detroit Civic Theater. In her plan for the theater she emphasized the importance of providing the public with the best drama, including both classics and modern works, and improving young people's knowledge of dramatic literature. Funded by public subscription, it had ticket prices as low as $1.50. Performances included works by Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The theater also played a religious role. Bonstelle used it in an effort to improve understanding and co-operation between the church and the theater, holding multi-denominational religious services there during Lent, and she stated that her plays, while avoiding being preachy, were intended to have a positive moral influence on the audience. Local clergy publicly praised her work with the theater.|$|E
5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>she</b> hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{economic}} success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch {{had decided to}} leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there, and the artists' association was temporarily disbanded. In June 1867 Busch met his brother Otto for the first time, in Frankfurt. Otto {{was working as a}} tutor to the family of a wealthy banker and industrialist, Kessler. Busch became friends with Kessler's wife, Johanna, a mother of seven and an influential art and music patron of Frankfurt. She regularly opened salons at her villa, frequented by artists, musicians and philosophers. She believed Busch to be a great painter, a view supported by Anton Burger, a leading painter of the Kronberger Malerkolonie, the Kronberg-based group of painters. While his humorous drawings did not appeal to her, she supported his painting career. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>she</b> established an apartment and studio for Busch in her villa, later providing him with an apartment nearby. Motivated by Kessler's support and admiration, and introduction to the cultural life of Frankfurt, the 'Frankfurter Years' were the most artistically productive for Busch. At this time he and Otto discovered the philosophical works of Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
