5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research {{found them to be}} particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} envisaged that a {{war with}} Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware {{of the impact of}} a blockade on an island nation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{was born}} in Prague in 1619, {{at the start of}} the Thirty Years' War, to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, and was {{declared}} a prince by the principality of Lusatia. He was given his name in honour of King Rupert of Germany, a famous Wittelsbach ancestor. Rupert's father was a leading member of the Holy Roman Empire and the head of the Protestant Union, with a martial family tradition stretching back several centuries. Rupert's family was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> network of Protestant rulers across the north of Europe, as Frederick had close ties through his mother to the ruling House of Orange-Nassau in the United Provinces, and Elizabeth was the daughter of James I of England and Anne of Denmark. The family lived an extremely wealthy lifestyle in Heidelberg, enjoying the palace gardens—the Hortus Palatinus, designed by Inigo Jones and Salomon de Caus—and a lavish castle with one of the best libraries in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} {{received}} the least consideration, but naval planners {{were aware that}} Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of Manila {{being used as a}} forward base. The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E

25|$|The {{process is}} {{identical}} in form to atomic absorption {{in which the}} energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. In normal media at thermal equilibrium, absorption exceeds stimulated emission because there are more electrons in the lower energy states than in the higher energy states. However, when a population inversion is present, the rate of stimulated emission exceeds that of absorption, and a net optical amplification can be achieved. Such a gain medium, along with an optical resonator, is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> laser or maser.|$|E

25|$|Net Zero Energy Building Certification {{launched}} in 2011, {{with an international}} following. The first project, Painters Hall, is Pringle Creek’s Community Center, café, office, art gallery, and event venue. Originally built in the 1930s, Painters Hall was renovated to LEED Platinum Net Zero energy building standards in 2010, demonstrating the potential of converting existing building stock into high‐performance, sustainable building sites. Painters Hall features simple low-‐cost solutions for energy reduction, such as natural daylighting and passive cooling lighting, that save money and increase comfort. A district ground-source geothermal loop serves the building’s GSHP for highly efficient heating and air conditioning. Excess generation from the 20.2kW rooftop solar array offsets pumping for the neighborhoods geo loop system. Open to the public, Painters Hall is a hub for gatherings of friends, neighbors, and visitors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neighborhood designed around nature and community.|$|E
