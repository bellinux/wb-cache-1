5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E
5|$|The album embraces {{a form of}} {{symbolism}} {{that would}} eventually become a staple of Morrison's songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or as close <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> being can approach it.

5|$|Lundomys molitor {{has been}} found <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> animal only in Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul; records of live {{specimens}} from eastern Argentina and Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, have not been confirmed. It is rarely encountered, and has been collected in only one location in Rio Grande do Sul, but {{this may be due}} to insufficient efforts to locate it, rather than genuine rarity. Its distribution is generally limited to areas with mean winter temperatures over , mean annual temperatures over , annual rainfall over , and a long rainy season averaging over 200 days. It is usually found in swamps or near streams.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi, {{also known}} as Gorgas's oryzomys or Gorgas's rice rat, is a rodent in the genus Oryzomys of family Cricetidae. First {{collected}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> animal in 1967, it is known from only a few localities, including a freshwater swamp in the lowlands of northwestern Colombia and a mangrove islet in northwestern Venezuela. It formerly occurred {{on the island of}} Curaçao off northwestern Venezuela; this extinct population {{has been described as a}} separate species, Oryzomys curasoae, but does not differ morphologically from mainland populations.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Báthory sent Andrew to Rome {{to start}} {{negotiations}} about an alliance against the Ottoman Empire, and to secure Andrew's creation as cardinal. Andrew and his retinue left Kraków for Italy on 10 September 1583. He visited Charles Borromeo, archbishop of Milan, {{who was a}} highly respected prelate and regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> saint for his piety in his diocese. After their meeting, Borromeo wrote a spiritual instruction to him. In Milan, Andrew also met Giovanni Botero who described him as an actual representative of anti-Machiavellianism. A Protestant retainer of Andrew, Ferenc Forgách, converted to Catholicism in the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto on 21 November.|$|E

5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> being, as {{it is able to}} sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E
5|$|The Avery Coonley School (ACS), {{commonly}} called Avery Coonley, is an independent, coeducational day school serving academically gifted students in preschool through eighth grade (approximately ages 3 to 14), and {{is located in}} Downers Grove, Illinois. The school was founded in 1906 to promote the progressive educational theories developed by John Dewey and other turn-of-the-20th-century philosophers, and was a nationally recognized model for progressive education well into the 1940s. From 1943 to 1965, Avery Coonley {{was part of the}} National College of Education (now National-Louis University), serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> laboratory for teacher training and educational research. In the 1960s, ACS became a regional research center and a leadership hub for independent schools, and began to focus on the education of the gifted.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} senate {{that he planned to}} leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E

5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E
