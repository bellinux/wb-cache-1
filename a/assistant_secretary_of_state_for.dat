During the Korean War (which began when North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950), when rumors started circulating in the State Department that plans were being made to advance beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea, an act that Kennan considered dangerous, he engaged in intense arguments with <b>Assistant</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>for</b> the Far East Dean Rusk, who apparently endorsed Acheson's goal to forcibly unite the Koreas.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{returned}} to the United States in March 1949.

The problem became severe in 1949. He was no longer able eat a normal diet, and he was suffering from malnutrition.

5|$|In 1990, {{seasoned}} diplomat James K. Bishop {{was appointed}} US Ambassador to Somalia.

5|$|On 31 January, US {{ambassador}} Peter Galbraith unsuccessfully {{tried to}} persuade Tuđman's aide Hrvoje Šarinić to accept another extension of the UNPROFOR mandate, explaining that the conflict would inevitably escalate once the UN force withdrew. This rebuff was followed by harsh French and UK diplomatic responses calling on the UN to ignore the Croatian decision, which resulted in Tuđman dismissing any extension of the mandate. The US <b>Assistant</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>for</b> European and Eurasian Affairs, Richard Holbrooke, met Tuđman and suggested to him that if UNPROFOR was permitted to stay, Croatia could count on integration into the European Union and NATO. As {{a way out of}} the diplomatic row, Holbrooke proposed that UNPROFOR be replaced by a new mission using the same personnel and organisational structure. Following Croatian agreement, the UNSC adopted Resolution 981 establishing the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO), replacing UNPROFOR in the country. The new mission's name was devised by Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Shashi Tharoor.|$|E
5|$|Under dos Santos's leadership, Angolan troops {{crossed the}} border into Namibia {{for the first time}} on 31 October, going into Kavango. The next day, dos Santos signed a non-aggression pact with Zambia and Zaire. In the 1980s, {{fighting}} spread outward from southeastern Angola, where most of the fighting had taken place in the 1970s, as the National Congolese Army (ANC) and SWAPO increased their activity. The South African government responded by sending troops back into Angola, intervening in the war from 1981 to 1987, prompting the Soviet Union to deliver massive amounts of military aid from 1981 to 1986. The USSR gave the MPLA more than US$2billion in aid in 1984. In 1981, newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan's U.S. <b>assistant</b> <b>secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>for</b> African affairs, Chester Crocker, developed a linkage policy, tying Namibian independence to Cuban withdrawal and peace in Angola.|$|E
