25|$|There are {{two types}} of TNF receptors: those found {{embedded}} in white blood cells that respond to TNF by releasing other cytokines, and soluble TNF receptors which are used to deactivate TNF and blunt the immune response. In addition, TNF receptors are found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells (red blood cells, which are not nucleated, do not contain TNF receptors on their surface). Etanercept mimics the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors, the difference being that etanercept, because it is a fusion protein rather than a simple TNF receptor, has a greatly extended half-life in the bloodstream, and therefore <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>profound</b> and long-lasting biologic effect than a naturally occurring soluble TNF receptor.|$|E

25|$|Dirac's {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had reached. Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the Poisson brackets {{that occur in the}} classical dynamics of particle motion. From this thought he quickly developed a quantum theory that was based on non-commuting dynamical variables. This led him to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>profound</b> and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics than was achieved by any other worker in this field. Dirac's formulation allowed him to obtain the quantisation rules in a novel and more illuminating manner. For this work, published in 1926, Dirac received a PhD from Cambridge. This formed the basis for Fermi-Dirac statistics that applies to systems consisting of many identical spin 1/2 particles (i.e. that obey the Pauli exclusion principle), e.g. electrons in solids and liquids, and importantly to the field of conduction in semi-conductors.|$|E

As a result, paint masked some of Crisp's inscriptions inside the house, but outside, signs reading [...] "Don't keep off the grass", [...] "Herons will be prosecuted" [...] and [...] "Eton boys are a Harrowing sight" [...] remained intact.

500|$|Building on {{the latter}} of these two assessments, British historians of the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries, such as Trevelyan and Erskine May, {{promoted}} hostile interpretations of George III's life. However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of Lewis Namier, who thought George was [...] "much maligned", started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign. Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as Butterfield and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: [...] "Erskine May must be {{a good example of the}} way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance. His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence... carried him into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>profound</b> and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors... he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth." [...] In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives. In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality.|$|E
