5|$|A life of <b>Augustine</b> {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays <b>Augustine</b> in a {{different}} light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that <b>Augustine</b> founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from <b>Augustine,</b> and a number of medieval writers who included <b>Augustine</b> in their romances. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning <b>Augustine</b> do not distinguish between <b>Augustine</b> of Canterbury and <b>Augustine</b> of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature <b>Augustine</b> of Canterbury quite often, however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E
5|$|<b>Augustine</b> {{established}} his episcopal see at Canterbury. It {{is not clear}} when and where <b>Augustine</b> was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that <b>Augustine</b> was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop Ætherius of Arles, Gaul (France) after the conversion of Æthelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to <b>Augustine</b> as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls <b>Augustine</b> a bishop, and one dated ten months later says <b>Augustine</b> had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands. The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where <b>Augustine</b> was consecrated, and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.|$|E
5|$|<b>Augustine</b> {{failed to}} extend his {{authority}} to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to <b>Augustine</b> and that their bishops should obey him, apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case. According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed <b>Augustine</b> with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part. In 603, <b>Augustine</b> and Æthelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn. These guests retired early to confer with their people, who, according to Bede, advised them to judge <b>Augustine</b> based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When <b>Augustine</b> failed to rise from his seat on {{the entrance of the}} British bishops, they refused to recognise him as their archbishop. There were, however, deep differences between <b>Augustine</b> and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the tonsure, the observance of Easter, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised. Some historians believe that <b>Augustine</b> had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops. Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.|$|E

Delsin can choose to either kill Hank, or let him escape Seattle with his daughter. Aided by Fetch and Eugene, Delsin rallies {{an assault on the}} D.U.P. headquarters. After breaking through the building's defenses, Delsin confronts <b>Augustine</b> and reveals to her that he has figured out she staged the Conduit escape at Akomish to instill fear in the population and give the D.U.P. a reason to continue their regime. <b>Augustine</b> lets Delsin absorb her powers, and tells him that she wants to save the Conduits by imprisoning and protecting them from the population.

5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between <b>Augustine</b> and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that <b>Augustine</b> had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. <b>Augustine</b> replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that <b>Augustine</b> was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that <b>Augustine</b> was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though <b>Augustine</b> writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} what <b>Augustine’s</b> ecclesiology was between 354 - 387 AD {{and how his}} ecclesial thoughts developed during that period. Scholarship has tended to neglect {{the importance of this}} period in understanding <b>Augustine’s</b> ecclesiology as a coherent whole (Alexander 2008 : 21). Like Harrison (2007 : 165 - 179) and Alexander (2008 : 18 - 21), this study establishes that <b>Augustine’s</b> early ecclesiology and its development is an essential lens to understanding <b>Augustine’s</b> later ecclesiology. The thesis statement, which yielded a positive result, is the defining features of <b>Augustine’s</b> ecclesiology were in place by 387 AD. A chronological textual approach was used {{to establish}} whether the thesis was positive or negative. Primary and secondary sources were used where appropriate to determine <b>Augustine’s</b> ecclesiology. This study established the different phases of <b>Augustine’s</b> ecclesial growth, what the contents of his ecclesiology most likely was during these different phases, how his early ecclesial thoughts influenced his future ecclesial thoughts and what lessons can be learnt for the South African church context.

5|$|<b>Augustine</b> was {{accompanied}} by Laurence of Canterbury, his eventual successor to the archbishopric, {{and a group of}} about 40 companions, some of whom were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted {{by the nature of the}} task before them. They sent <b>Augustine</b> back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent <b>Augustine</b> back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere. In 597, <b>Augustine</b> and his companions landed in Kent. They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin's for services. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597. In the early medieval period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and <b>Augustine</b> is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent. Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it. Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by <b>Augustine,</b> but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted. His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|In 595, Gregory chose <b>Augustine,</b> prior of Gregory's own monastery of St Andrew in Rome, to {{head the}} mission to Kent.

Gregory thanked King Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding <b>Augustine.</b> Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and were asked to allow some Frankish priests to accompany the mission.
