5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E

500|$|Marks {{was obliged}} to spend much time and effort in {{securing}} the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At {{the same time the}} Arts Council was contemplating <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By increasing ticket sales in successive years, Marks demonstrated that the Arts Council's proposition was unrealistic. After what The Independent described as [...] "a sustained period of criticism and sniping at the ENO by music critics", Edwards resigned as music director at the end of 1995. Paul Daniel became ENO's next music director. In 1997, Marks resigned. No official reason was announced, but one report stated that he and the ENO board had disagreed about his plans to move the company from the Coliseum to a purpose-built new home. Daniel took over the management of the company until a new general director was appointed.|$|E
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years.

500|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is {{the most}} common approach in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. This technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside the body to break down the stones. [...] An alternative technique to remove very large obstructing stones is electrohydraulic lithotripsy, where a small endoscope known as a cholangioscope is inserted by ERCP to directly visualize the stone. A probe uses electricity to generate shock waves that break down the obstructing stone. [...] Rarely, surgical exploration of the common bile duct (termed choledochotomy), which can be performed with laparoscopy, is required to remove the stone.|$|E
500|$|Barry was {{distinguished}} in {{the subsequent}} case R. v. East Sussex County Council, ex parte Tandy (1998), in which the reduction of home tuition services provided by East Sussex County Council to a young myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) sufferer was challenged. The services were reduced due to <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> authority's home tuition budget. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, speaking for the House of Lords, noted that the statute in question in Barry had required the decision-maker to assess the [...] "needs" [...] of disabled people and whether arranging for home care services to be provided was [...] "necessary in order to meet" [...] those needs. The statute only listed the services that could be provided, and did not define what [...] "needs" [...] meant. Thus, it was [...] "perhaps not surprising" [...] that the court had laid down the availability of resources as a criterion for determining what should be considered [...] "needs". On the other hand, in Tandy the statute involved imposed on the authority a duty to arrange to provide [...] "suitable education" [...] to the applicant, which was defined according to [...] "wholly objective educational criteria". Financial resources were not mentioned at all. In the circumstances, the judge held that {{the extent of the}} latter was not a consideration relevant to the authority's decision. He also commented that since it had not been submitted that the authority lacked resources to perform its duty, this was a situation of the authority preferring to spend money on other matters. Thus, the authority could divert funds from discretionary matters and apply them to fulfil its statutory duty.|$|E
