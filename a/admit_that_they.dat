5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|From April, Marquis began {{collecting}} artifacts of the Custer battle. He visited Cheyennes to buy objects {{that had been}} taken from the dead soldiers, particularly weapons. According to Weist, the fact that the Cheyennes would even <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had these objects was a measure of the trust Marquis had earned. Marquis also collected Cheyenne objects, including scalping knives. After attending the annual Sun Dance in Lame Deer, Marquis moved to Hardin, somewhat closer to the Custer battlefield. Marquis' presence at that Sun Dance, and at others held in subsequent years until 1931, was another measure of the Cheyennes' trust. The Sun Dance (called by the Cheyenne the Great Medicine dance) had earlier been made illegal by the Federal Government; 1927 was the first year they had been allowed to hold it openly. It was still disapproved of, and practicing Indian medicine was a jailable offense.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of Avatar, {{taking place in the}} future, Krusty the Clown sends the {{military}} force to the planet Rigel 7 to find the a sacred extract Hilarrium, so he can easily entertain his Nazi audience. The military recruits Bart and Milhouse to befriend the alien race in avatar bodies. They succeed in this and Bart ends up getting Kang's daughter pregnant after falling in love with her. They learn that the extract Hilarrium, which is excreted by their queen, is primarily used by the natives to reduce the mood swings of pregnant women. Milhouse then contacts the military of their location, which then attacks the natives. In the battle, the natives are helped by all the animals of the planet, which eventually defeats the military. Kang and Kodos then <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would have just given the Hilarrium to the humans.|$|E

5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the player}} visits the Moogle's shop and discovers {{it has been}} {{attacked}} by a giant Heartless. The player helps four Keyblade wielders chase down the Heartless in the sewers but it proves to be very powerful while in water. While the four Keyblade wielders hold it off, the player drains out the water and defeats the giant Heartless. Afterwards, they return to the Moogle's shop just as the Moogle has repaired the damage and returns to chat with the four Keyblade Wielders, who now <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are friends and continues {{to assist them in}} various missions (either together, separately, or alone). Throughout this point, significant scenes are shown as the player progresses (which actually take place in the real world either before or after the Keyblade War): the first scene takes place {{after the end of the}} Keyblade War, where Ephemer meets up with Skuld, revealing that they are two of the five people selected to become new Foretellers. Two others selected Keyblade Wielders, Ventus and Brain, appear to greet them followed by the fifth selected person, Lauriam (who is the original form of Marluxia). Later, they come to the Foreteller's room where they learn that they must start their own unions and to avoid the terrible incidents that happened in the past, they decide to create Spirit Dream Eaters to help the other Keyblade Wielders. The second shows a flashback of the Master of Masters instructing Ava to form the Dandelions and select five of them to be the new Foretellers, who also plans to give the Book of Prophecies to one of them. Ava later informs this to Ephemer and plans to have him and four others become the new Foretellers. The third shows Chrithy informing Ephemer and Skuld that the player's character is dreaming and Ephemer warns them that a stronger source of darkness is coming and plans to form the Union Cross to stop it while encouraging Chrithy to protect the player. The fourth introduces Strelitzia, a Dandelion Keyblade Wielder who has secretly been following the player on their quest until being recruited by Ava, revealing that she is the true fifth selected Keyblade Wielder. She is skeptical of this but is encouraged by her Chrithy to do so, despite also having doubts. After realizing that the player is not a Dandelion, she decides to find and convince them to join the Dandelions. While searching a dark building, she and her Chrithy are ambushed by an unseen person, who steals the book that Ava gave her. The dying Strelitzia carries her Chrithy towards the door before they fade from existence. Later (taking place after the player fights Master Aced), the story itself goes through an entirely different plot after that. The player and Chrithy later meet another Chrithy, who entrusts them a gift from the Foretellers, a Spirit Dream Eater.|$|E

25|$|Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, with {{going too}} much into details in efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are metaphysically distinct: {{to be a human}} is to be a {{composite}} of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.|$|E

On Italian TV some tried to explain this discrepancy claiming that some House of Freedoms voters were ashamed to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> planned to vote for them. Others claimed that {{the last week of}} electoral campaign, dominated by Berlusconi's proposal of cutting ICI and by the media's insistence on the alleged new taxes advocated by The Union, persuaded a large number of Italians, usually uninterested to politics, to cast a vote for the House of Freedoms.|$|E

25|$|As {{this is all}} happening, Greenlee and Leo's {{feelings}} for each other continue to deepen and they finally <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have {{fallen in love with}} each other. The road to romance starts out rocky, with the two of them ending up in many misunderstandings. During one of Greenlee's attempts to win him back after a fight, Greenlee and Leo inadvertently learn that Leo's friend, Bianca Montgomery is a lesbian. Greenlee promptly nicknames the young woman LesBianca. Jealous of his friendships with Bianca and Laura English, a drugged Greenlee pushes Laura off a yacht, while a horrified Bianca looks on. In order to silence her, Greenlee threatens to tell Bianca's mother, Erica Kane, that Bianca is gay. Greenlee later makes good on her threat and publicly outs Bianca. Leo finds out and ends his relationship with Greenlee, although the two eventually reconcile. When Greenlee proposes to Leo, he accepts, though he is worried that she will find out that his original interest in her was to steal her trust fund. Although he no longer cares about the money and is truly in love with her, Greenlee feels too betrayed to believe Leo when she learns the truth and breaks up with him.|$|E

Investigators speculated that Kinne had already crossed the border from Mexico into Guatemala, mooting the purpose of a Mexican manhunt, but noted that Kinne was fluent in Spanish after her years in Mexican prison, and she could therefore be [...] "get along rather well" [...] in nearly any Spanish-speaking area of the world.
