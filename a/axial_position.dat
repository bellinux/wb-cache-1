25|$|The optical {{rotation}} {{of a given}} enantiomer of ketamine can vary between its salts and free base form. The free base form of (S)‑ketamine exhibits dextrorotation and is therefore labelled (S)‑(+)‑ketamine. However, its hydrochloride salt shows levorotation and is thus labelled (S)‑(−)‑ketamine hydrochloride. The difference originates from the conformation of the cyclohexanone ring. In both the free base and the hydrochloride, the cyclohexanone ring adopts a chair conformation, but {{the orientation of the}} substituents varies. In the free base, the o-chlorophenyl group adopts an equatorial position and the methylamino group adopts an <b>axial</b> <b>position.</b> In the hydrochloride salt, the positions are reversed, with the o-chlorophenyl group axial and the methylamino group equatorial. Not all salts of ketamine show different {{optical rotation}} to the free base: (S)-ketamine (R,R)-tartrate is levorotatory, like (S)‑ketamine.|$|E
2500|$|Steric effects play a {{major role}} in the {{assignment}} of configurations in cyclohexanes. [...] One can use steric hindrances to determine the propensity of a substituent to reside in the axial or equatorial plane. [...] It is known that axial bonds are more hindered than the corresponding equatorial bonds. [...] This is because substituents in the <b>axial</b> <b>position</b> are relatively close to two other axial substituents. [...] This makes it very crowded when bulky substituents are oriented in the <b>axial</b> <b>position.</b> These types of steric interactions are commonly known as 1,3 diaxial interactions. [...] These types of interactions are not present with substituents at the equatorial position.|$|E

50|$|In {{the mixed}} halide PF3Cl2 the chlorines occupy {{two of the}} {{equatorial}} positions, indicating that fluorine has a greater apicophilicity or tendency to occupy an <b>axial</b> <b>position.</b> In general ligand apicophilicity increases with electronegativity and also with pi-electron withdrawing ability, as in the sequence Cl < F < CN.

50|$|Although {{originally}} developed as 2D (x, y) imaging methods, PALM and STORM have quickly developed into 3D (x,y, z) capable techniques. To determine the <b>axial</b> <b>position</b> {{of a single}} fluorophore in the sample the following approaches are currently being used: modification of the point spread function to introduce z-dependent features in the 2D (x,y) image (the most common approach is to introduce astigmatism in the PSF); multiplane detection, where the <b>axial</b> <b>position</b> is determined by comparing two images of the same PSF defocused one {{with respect to the}} other; interferometric determination of the <b>axial</b> <b>position</b> of the emitter using two opposed objectives and multiple detectors; use of temporal focusing to confine the excitation/activation; use of light sheet excitation/activation to confine to a few hundred nanometers thick layer arbitrarily positioned along the z-plane within the sample.|$|E

Aromatization of ring C leads to loss of activity, possibly from ring E no longer being placed on the <b>axial</b> <b>position.</b> In addition, the stereochemistry at C-2 and C-3 configures a trans-lactone, which has more activity than the cis counterpart.

40|$|A {{scenario}} is {{proposed for the}} simultaneous breakup process of an arrangement of parallel viscous threads. At very close distances, threads will break up via an in-phase mode, that is, droplets will be formed at the same <b>axial</b> <b>positions</b> along the threads. In the case of threads that are further apart, breakup will occur via an out-of-phase mode, that is, on neighboring threads droplets will be formed at <b>axial</b> <b>positions</b> that are shifted by one-half of a wavelength. The smaller the viscosity ratio between the thread phase and the continuous phase, the closer the threads must be to break up via this in-phase mode. This scenario agrees with recent experimental results...|$|R

Measurements of CO 2 absorption in methyldiethanolamine solutions were carried out in a prismatic column 0. 06 m side and 1. 03 m height. Five electrode pairs were placed at various <b>axial</b> <b>positions</b> in the column. Measurements were conducted at different gas flow rates and amine concentration. It {{was found that the}} local {{mass transfer}} varied in the axial direction. An experimental model was developed to obtain the absorption rate values using the electrochemical method data.

50|$|As {{can be seen}} on {{the model}} of cyclohexane, the trans {{configuration}} comes with a price: the only possible way to join the two six-membered rings in the trans position means the second ring needs to start from the two equatorial bonds of the first ring. A six-membered ring does not offer sufficient space to start out on an <b>axial</b> <b>position</b> (upwards), and reach the <b>axial</b> <b>position</b> of the neighboring carbon atom, which then will be on the downwards side of the molecule.|$|E

50|$|For cyclic allylic alcohols, greater {{selectivity}} is {{seen when}} the alcohol {{was locked in}} the pseudo equatorial position rather than the pseudo <b>axial</b> <b>position.</b> However, {{it was found that}} for metal catalyzed systems such as those based on vanadium, reaction rates were accelerated when the hydroxyl group was in the <b>axial</b> <b>position</b> by a factor of 34. Substrates which were locked in the pseudo equatorial position were shown to undergo oxidation to form the ene-one. In both cases of vanadium catalyzed epoxidations, the epoxidzed product showed excellent selectivity for the syn diastereomer.|$|E

IR, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. In the crystal, L(1) utilizes all four pyridyl N atoms to coordinate at the <b>axial</b> <b>positions</b> {{of two different}} ZnTPP units. The first utilizes two <b>axial</b> <b>positions</b> for coordination, and the second coordinates at {{only one of the}} <b>axial</b> <b>positions.</b> Thus, the former ZnTPP units and two pyridyl nitrogens of L(1) ligands are linked alternately to afford a zigzag chain, and two of the latter porphyrin units are appended to both sides of each repeating unit of the zigzag chain by coordination to the remaining two nitrogens of each L(1) ligand. Interestingly, the appended porphyrins form two straight lines at both sides of the zigzag chain by the linkage of pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions between the phenyl rings. Finally, a triple chain is formed. The solid state emission of 1 is also studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
