5|$|Some time in July, {{probably}} just before Climbié {{was admitted to}} the Central Middlesex Hospital, Kouao befriended a couple, Julien and Chantal Kimbidima. Climbié and Kouao visited their home several times over the following months. According to Chantal, Kouao would shout at Climbié <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> never showed her affection.|$|E
5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> I believe that this year I am going to do some serious things.|$|E
5|$|Mark's ex-girlfriend, Lana Turnboldt, has {{a picnic}} with her fiancé at the secluded {{place in the}} mountains, where they {{discover}} Mr. Griffin's medicine bottle. The police investigate, and find Mr. Griffin's body buried nearby. However, police do not find the ring Mr. Griffin was wearing when he died as David had taken it. Irma Ruggles, David's paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses {{to give it back}} to him, believing the ring to be that of David's father who had left him. David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown sweater. Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed – in this case, the ring.|$|E
25|$|In <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>all</b> places mankind always showed great {{ingenuity}} making {{sound and}} music from existing materials {{in its natural}} environment.

40|$|Justice is a {{very complex}} conception, {{expressed}} as one of the more appraised human feelings in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> cultures. This work implies an approach to so much significant concept from an iconographyca point of view, attending to the origin, metamorphosis and analysis of iconographical attributes used by Modern Age artists as incarnation and expression of Justice´s idea. From this iconic perspective as departure, it is possible to understand the course of thoughts, ethic values and ways of life in the Renaissance and Baroque european society and the iconographical influence come from Antiquity and Middle Ages...|$|R
30|$|If a dose {{adjustment}} is required, {{it should be}} done in such a way to avoid potential problems as a consequence of too low (therapy failure) or too high (adverse effects emergence) drug exposure. Preferably, the serum drug levels should be monitored {{both before and after the}} generic substitution of AEDs. However, practically it is not possible <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> may have cost implications. Furthermore, the serum drug levels of some newer AEDs are inadequately described. Nevertheless, systematically collected data of serum drug concentrations during generic substitution of AEDs offer opportunities to evaluate bioequivalence (BE) in routine care settings, and to identify the generics with potential risks to the patients.|$|R
5|$|While Evolve carried some game {{mechanics}} from Left 4 Dead, {{others were}} discarded. The team originally {{thought that it}} could be added to the artificial intelligence system of Evolves wildlife, but was later scrapped. They thought that the core experience offered by Evolve should be tracking and hunting the monster, instead of getting attacked by wildlife constantly. The team also thought that it would become an irritation if they added too many complex mechanics for the wildlife. The developer also intentionally chose not to make Evolve action-packed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> introduced segments that would require players to slow down and track the Monster. Robb explained that the design team wanted to create a contrast, so that players could appreciate the action and chaotic moments after experiencing the less exciting segments.|$|E

50|$|Francsi claimed another IL-4 in {{an unknown}} {{location}} <b>and</b> an unknown <b>time</b> on <b>the</b> {{night of the}} 14/15 December 1944. I./NJG 100 were also flying missions on 20/21 December. Fellow night fighter pilot Günther Bertram accounted for three IL-4s to reach his 29th {{of a total of}} 35 night victories. Helmut Dahms also claimed his 15th and 16th victories. Leutnant Francsi achieved his 42nd this night over an IL-4, but <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> locations for <b>the</b> unit are not recorded. On 14/15 January 1945 Francsi claimed his 43rd victory at an unrecorded <b>time</b> <b>and</b> location.

50|$|Also in 2001, at the World Championships in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Boldon {{finished}} fourth {{and out of}} the medals in the 100 m with 9.98 s, and then ran the second leg of his country's 4 x 100 metre relay, finishing third in the finals. This was Trinidad and Tobago's first 4 x 100 m relay medal in either World or Olympic competition and Boldon states that making national history with this team of young men (the average age of his teammates was 19) was his greatest accomplishment in his career. The colours of his 2001 World Championship medals would change in 2005 as both his placings were improved - he received bronze in the 100 m and the bronze relay medals were upgraded to silver after <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> performances of <b>the</b> American sprinter Tim Montgomery (who was second in the 100 m and won the 4 x 100 m with the US team) were nullified due to serious doping violations. That brought Boldon's career total to four World Championship medals, to match his four Olympic medals.|$|R
25|$|Immersion {{survival}} suits are dry suits carried {{for use by}} ship and aircraft crew who will be immersed in cold water if the craft must be abandoned. Unlike immersion survival work suits, these are {{not intended to be}} worn <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> are only to be used in an emergency. Survival suits will typically be a one-piece design made of fire-retardant neoprene, optimized with quick donning features, and produced in high visibility colours with reflective tape patches.|$|E
25|$|My {{point with}} these seven {{thousand}} trees was that each {{would be a}} monument, consisting of a living part, the live tree, changing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> a crystalline mass, maintaining its shape, size, and weight. This stone can be transformed only by taking from it, when a piece splinters off, say, never by growing. By placing these two objects side by side, the proportionality of the monument's two parts {{will never be the}} same.|$|E
25|$|On {{the back}} of Pollard's {{domestic}} performance he was offered a central contract which he turned down because that would force him to be available for West Indies selection <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> Pollard wanted to play Twenty20 cricket as well. Despite this his good performances meant that he was selected for the West Indies in the ODI and Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka as several high-profile names such as Denesh Ramdin and Ramnaresh Sarwan had been dropped.|$|E
40|$|Providing mobile {{users with}} {{communication}} services at <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> places is <b>the</b> principal {{incentive for the}} development of SatCom On-The-Move (SOTM) applications. Fading due to objects surrounding the earth terminal and antenna de-pointing due to the vehicle motion represent the main challenges {{for the development of}} SOTM systems. In fact, both lead to degradation in the overall Quality of Service (QoS). Moreover, antenna de-pointing may lead to harmful interference to adjacent satellites. Regulatory authorities define limits for antenna de-pointing and for the Power Spectral Density (PSD) transmitted from the antenna. An integral part of the development of SOTM systems is to demonstrate their overall performance as well as to test the performance of the tracking unit. Such tests and demonstrations are usually performed in a field test where two or more operational satellites are involved. This contribution proposes a test methodology which avoids the employment of operational satellites and offers a reliable and repeatable environment for measuring the overall SOTM system performance. In particular, antenna pointing errors can be estimated {{with a high degree of}} precision...|$|R
40|$|With today's {{demands for}} {{continuous}} availability of mission-critical databases, on-line reorganization is a necessity.

In addition to the significant reduction of the total I/O cost, the algorithm also assures that almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> database is available <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> reorganization is interruptible and restartable. We believe that the technique {{presented in this paper}} could be used for improving normal database update performance as well...|$|R
30|$|The {{satellite}} took around 11  days {{to cover}} 1  h of local <b>time</b> (LT) <b>and</b> around 131  days to cover <b>all</b> <b>the</b> LT sectors. To cover both <b>all</b> <b>the</b> local <b>times</b> <b>and</b> seasons, it took around 5  years.

25|$|Lack of {{lubrication}} is {{a common}} problem during and after perimenopause. Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and lubricants can help with lubrication difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women complain that their genitalia are uncomfortably dry <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> they may do better with moisturizers. Those who need only lubricants do well using them only during intercourse.|$|E

25|$|Physicist John Taylor, who has {{investigated}} parapsychological claims, {{has written that}} an unknown fifth force causing psychokinesis would have to transmit {{a great deal of}} energy. The energy would have to overcome the electromagnetic forces binding the atoms together, because the atoms would need to respond more strongly to the fifth force than to electric forces. Such an additional force between atoms should therefore exist <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> not during only alleged paranormal occurrences. Taylor wrote there is no scientific trace of such a force in physics, down to many orders of magnitude; thus, if a scientific viewpoint is to be preserved, the idea of any fifth force must be discarded. Taylor concluded that there is no possible physical mechanism for psychokinesis, and it is in complete contradiction to established science.|$|E
