Ammonia and hydrogen enter the inner compartment of the refrigerator. An increase in volume causes {{a decrease in the}} partial pressure of the liquid ammonia. The ammonia evaporates, taking heat from the liquid ammonia (ΔHVap) and thus lowering its temperature. Heat flows from the hotter interior of the refrigerator to the colder liquid, promoting further evaporation.3. Ammonia and hydrogen return from the inner compartment, ammonia returns to absorber and dissolves in water. Hydrogen is free to rise upwards.4. Ammonia gas condensation (passive cooling).5.

40|$|The {{application}} of emerging fitness-for-service standards {{in conjunction with}} advanced modeling and ultrasonic thickness (UT) inspection is demonstrated with the recent assessment and repair of a CO 2 <b>absorber</b> <b>vessel.</b> UT inspection discovered four regions of localized metal loss on the internal surface of a CO 2 <b>absorber</b> <b>vessel</b> shell. Of the four regions, two were directly adjacent to major structural discontinuities, including two nozzles, one of which contained a reinforcing plate or repad. In order to define the critical locations of metal loss and estimate a corrosion rate, thickness data for the regions of metal loss was provided {{in the form of}} 1 inch by 1 inch equally-spaced, rectangular thickness grid from two separate inspection dates. Based on the estimated corrosion rate, and the specified operation interval, the rate of metal loss was determined to be significant enough to require repair. This conclusion was {{based on the fact that}} in certain locations, the metal loss was estimated to grow through-wall before the end of the specified operation interval. Computational analysis using guidelines per API 579 - 1 /ASME FFS- 1 [1] was used to evaluate an appropriate repair procedure. This included evaluation of repair plate placement and sizing using advanced modeling techniques including elastic-plastic material behavior and contact interaction. The effect of future metal loss was included based the estimated corrosion rate. The result of this assessment was a repair design that provided sufficient protection against excessive plastic deformation and allowed for continued operation through the specified operating interval. Thus, repairing the vessel based on fitness-for-service (FFS) criteria allowed for continued use of the vessel and avoided costly replacement. The lessons learned provide insight into the improved design of vessel repairs...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Healy Clean Coal Project (HCCP) is to conduct a cost-sharing project that will demonstrate a new power plant design which features innovative integration of an advanced combustor and heat recovery system coupled with both high- and low- temperature emission control processes. The primary equipment elements comprising this new power plant design includes entrained combustion systems coupled with a boiler which will produce low- NO{sub x} levels, and function as a limestone calciner and first-stage SO{sub 2 } remover {{in addition to its}} heat recovery function; a single spray dryer <b>absorber</b> <b>vessel</b> for second-stage sulfur removal; a baghouse for third-stage sulfur and particulate removal; and a lime activation system which recovers unused reagent from particulate collected in the baghouse. The emission levels of SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and particulate to be demonstrated are expected to be less than the Federal New source Performance Standards. The plant design is finalized and all Federal and State permits have been obtained for construction of the project.

The scrubbers consist of two countercurrent-flow <b>absorber</b> <b>vessels</b> on each unit, using limestone slurry sprays to remove more than 92% of SO2 from the flue gas. [...] The three scrubbers in total consume about 24 MW of power, and use 130,000 tons of limestone and 3,000 acre•ft (3,700,000 m3) of water per year, producing 200,000 tons of gypsum per year.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an illustrated {{description of a}} proposed LiBr-H 2 O vapour absorption refrigerator which uses a thermally activated solution pumping mechanism that combines controlled variations in generator vapour pressure with changes it produces in static-head pressure difference to circulate the absorbent solution between the generator and <b>absorber</b> <b>vessels.</b> The proposed system is different and potentially more efficient than a bubble pump system previously proposed and avoids {{the need for an}} electrically powered circulation pump found in most conventional LiBr absorption refrigerators. The paper goes on to provide a sample set of calculations that show that the coefficient of performance values of the proposed cycle are similar to those found for conventional cycles. The theoretical results compare favourably with some preliminary experimental results, which are also presented {{for the first time in}} this paper. The paper ends by proposing an outline design for an innovative steam valve, which is a key component needed to control the solution pumping mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the progress {{made on the}} design of the cryogenic cooling system for the liquid absorber for the international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). The absorber consists of a 20. 7 -liter vessel that contains liquid hydrogen (1. 48 kg at 20. 3 K) or liquid helium (2. 59 kg at 4. 2 K). The liquid cryogen vessel is located within the warm bore of the focusing magnet for the MICE. The purpose of the magnet is to provide a low beam beta region within the absorber. For safety reasons, the vacuum vessel for the hydrogen absorber is separated from the vacuum vessel for the superconducting magnet and the vacuum that surrounds the RF cavities or the detector. The absorber thin windows separate the liquid in the absorber from the absorber vacuum. The <b>absorber</b> vacuum <b>vessel</b> also has thin windows that separate the absorber vacuum space from adjacent vacuum spaces. Because the muon beam in MICE is of low intensity, there is no beam heating in the absorber. The absorber can use a single 4 K cooler to cool either liquid helium or liquid hydrogen within the absorber...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMuon {{beams of}} low {{emittance}} {{provide the basis}} for the intense, well-characterised neutrino beams necessary to elucidate the physics of flavour at the Neutrino Factory and to provide lepton-anti-lepton collisions at energies of up to several TeV at the Muon Collider. The International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will demonstrate ionization cooling; the technique by which it is proposed to reduce the phase-space volume occupied by the muon beam at such facilities. In an ionization-cooling channel, the muon beam is caused to pass through a material (the absorber) in which it looses energy, the energy lost is then replaced using RF cavities. The combined effect of energy loss and re-acceleration is to reduce the transverse emittance of the beam (transverse cooling). MICE is being constructed in a series of Steps. At Step IV, MICE will be able to study the properties of liquid hydrogen and lithium hydride that affect cooling. A solenoidal spectrometer will measure emittance upstream and downstream of the <b>absorber</b> <b>vessel.</b> The muon beam will be focused at the absorber by a focusing coil. The construction of Step IV at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is well advanced and is scheduled to be complete early in 2015. The status of the construction project will be described together with the performance of the principal components. Once the Step IV programme has been completed, the apparatus will be reconfigured to allow the MICE collaboration to demonstrate ionization cooling. This will require two single-cavity modules to be inserted one upstream and one downstream of a central absorber. The status of the preparations for the MICE demonstration of ionization cooling will also be described briefly...|$|E

Welded windows offer some potential advantages over bolted windows when {{they are on the}} absorber itself. This report describes the bolted window and its seal. This report also describes an alternate window that is welded directly to the absorber body. The welded window design presented permits the weld to be ground off and re-welded.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} novel system for regenerable SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} scrubbing of flue gas that focuses on (1) a novel method for regenerating spent SO{sub 2 } scrubbing liquor and (2) novel chemistry for reversible absorption of NO{sub x}. In addition, high efficiency hollow fiber contactors (HFC) are proposed as the devices for scrubbing the SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} from the flue gas. The system will be designed to remove more than 95 % of the SO{sub 2 } and more than 75 % of the NO{sub x} from flue gases typical of pulverized coal-fired power plants at a cost that is at least 20 % less than combined wet limestone scrubbing of SO{sub x} and selective catalytic reduction of NO{sub x}. The process will generate only marketable by-products. Our approach is to reduce the capital cost by using high-efficiency hollow fiber devices for absorbing and desorbing the SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x}. We will also introduce new process chemistry to minimize traditionally well-known problems with SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} absorption and desorption. Our novel chemistry for scrubbing NO{sub x} will consist of water-soluble phthalocyanine compounds invented by SRI as well as polymeric forms of Fe{sup ++} complexes similar to traditional NO{sub x} scrubbing media. The final novelty of our approach is the arrangement of the absorbers in cassette (stackable) form so that the NO{sub x} absorber can be on top of the SO{sub x} absorber. This arrangement is possible only because of the high efficiency of the hollow fiber scrubbing devices, as indicated by our preliminary laboratory data. This arrangement makes it possible for the SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} scrubbing chambers to be separate without incurring the large ducting and gas pressure drop costs necessary if a second conventional <b>absorber</b> <b>vessel</b> were used. Because we have separate scrubbers, we will have separate liquor loops and simplify the chemical complexity of simultaneous SO{sub 2 }/NO{sub x} scrubbing...|$|E
