The Brothers Grimm decide to pursue a new profession, presumably {{recording}} fairy tales, although they are now wanted criminals of the state. One of the Queen's crows is seen flying off with the last shard of her mirror, still holding the Queen's watchful eye and presumably, her living soul.|$|E
5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was <b>always</b> <b>welcome,</b> as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E

25|$|Hebard's {{indoctrination}} of new Americans came on {{the heels}} of the greatest wave of migrants to every enter the country. Millions of new immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe entered the United States, mostly through Ellis Island, from 1880 to 1915. New Americans, with their new languages, foods, and customs were not <b>always</b> <b>welcome.</b> One of the early targets where the Chinese who were locked out from immigrating to the U.

They {{remained in the}} same house throughout their lives, where the children were <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> to return. Keynes would receive considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of Great Depression in 1929. Keynes's mother made her children's interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, [...] "because she could grow up with her children, they never outgrew home".|$|E

Likewise, Dave Kim of WGRD-FM listed [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] as the sixth best Rise Against song, saying that although it is {{a significant departure from}} their normal sound, [...] "we'll <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> the softer side of Rise Against". The song has also been credited with helping Rise Against achieve mainstream appeal. In 2011, Alternative Addiction wrote [...] "'Swing Life Away' catapulted Rise Against past Anti-Flag to the point where they've been with the past three albums as one of most established bands going in rock." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1861, a major {{reorganization}} of the College transferred control from the Board of Education to the newly formed Board of Agriculture. Holmes was [...] "not retained despite the urging of his colleagues and the unquestioned spiritual debt which the College owed him." [...] Holmes returned to the Detroit area, lived another twenty-six years, and remained active in his community. [...] Although he continued to be, as President T. C. Abbot wrote circa 1883, [...] "a not infrequent and <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> visitor at the college, {{and one of its}} warmest friends," [...] Holmes never again held any official position at the College. There is no known explanation for this change of fortune, but as Lautner wrote, [...] "clearly there were troubles here other than financial ones that are not suggested in the minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|At a {{time when}} the Yorkshire team was {{successful}} but exhibited a grim and determined attitude, Kilner was very popular with spectators. They liked him for his cheerfulness and desire to entertain, an attitude not shared by all of his team-mates. He had many friends in the game at {{a time when}} Yorkshire were not <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> in other counties due to their on-field attitude. When he was chosen as a Bowler of the Year in 1924, Wisden remarked that he was devoted to the game, possessed a cheery temperament and stood out among players for his personality, while his obituary described him as modest and generous. His Times obituary described him as [...] "not only a notable exponent of the game, but a man of rare charm. Few modern professionals commanded such a measure of esteem and kindly regard from his own immediate colleagues and his opponents in the cricket field as did Roy Kilner".|$|E
500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{wrote that}} [...] "it's {{hard to make}} a 'true meaning of Christmas' story seem fresh. That's why this week's Kenneth/No LudaChristmas bit was a bit lame, in my opinion", {{although}} he did say [...] "the A story [...] fared a bit better". Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that this episode was [...] "a modern, irreverent look at [...] ". Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that Buck Henry and Andy Richter were both [...] "destined to play" [...] their roles. He also wrote that [...] " [...] Stritch wasn't as brilliant as she's been in previous appearances, but she's <b>always</b> <b>welcome,</b> simply because her character riles Jack." [...] Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode [...] "had all the trimmings for a holiday classic, though it fell just shy of that pantheon." [...] He added that [...] "this {{may not have been the}} 30 Rock holiday classic people were hoping for, but it was a solid, funny episode nonetheless." [...] Canning rated this episode 8 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|The final {{took place}} on August 16, at 10:10 CST. Before the race, Milorad Čavić made {{headlines}} by saying {{in an interview that}} it would be better for swimming if he beat Phelps. Phelps' coach Bob Bowman used the quote to provide motivation to his protégé. In an interview, Phelps said that doubters like Čavić [...] "fires me up more than anything, I <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> comments. It definitely motivates me even more." [...] Almost immediately after the race started, Čavić took the lead with Phelps getting off to a slow start. At the turn, Čavić was first, followed by Ian Crocker, while Phelps made the split in seventh place, just 0.62 seconds behind Čavić. As the two approached the finish, Čavić tried to coast to the wall on one last stroke, while Phelps, who had misjudged the end, took an extra half-stroke, causing both competitors to touch the wall at almost exactly the same time. It turned out that Phelps had actually finished one one-hundredth of a second ahead of Čavić, with a time of 50.58 seconds. Phelps even admitted that, at first, he thought the extra stroke he took had cost him the gold medal, until he looked at the scoreboard displaying the results. Andrew Lauterstein won the bronze medal, also beating Crocker by one one-hundredth of a second.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall at HitFix {{called the}} episode a {{promising}} {{start to the}} season, [...] "a fairly lively hour in spite of , helped by some good casting and smart creative choices". He was positive about both the changes to the existing characters {{and the introduction of}} the new ones, and though he noted that the opening sequence was [...] "itself a piece of brand extension — early promotion for Agent Carter," [...] he felt that [...] "Links {{to the rest of the}} Marvel niverse are <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> when they're in service to the story the show is telling". Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the visual style, which he called [...] "less glossy" [...] than previous episodes, as well as the introduction of new characters and development of old ones, especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the [...] "nicely done FX showing off his power". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B-', feeling that [...] "With a clearly defined villain and mission statement, this show's second season is already off to a better start than its first year, but there's still plenty of room for the series to grow. The scripts could use more energy, the action could be better choreographed, and it could use a huge injection of style for both the visual and audio elements. There's so much potential in Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... but the show's creators aren't fully exploring it yet." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{number of}} the {{black-and-white}} [...] "special", [...] "Let It Snow" [...] featuring Blaine and Kurt, garnered the most praise. Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] and {{described it as a}} [...] "jazzy, uptempo take on the seasonal classic with gorgeous harmonies and retro dancing", and said it rivaled their Christmas duet from 2010, [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside". While Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the number, she preferred the previous year's offering; Flandez called [...] "Let It Snow" [...] an [...] "admirable job". Futterman characterized it as [...] "both effortless and full of seasonal spirit", and Votta said it was [...] "a spot-on tribute to male duets of yesteryear with that knowing undercurrent of romance even when it's not explicit". Chaney gave it an [...] "A", but she wondered at the inclusion of the next song, [...] "My Favorite Things", since it [...] "technically isn't a holiday song". The number was also not as well received as many of the others: Bell described it as taking [...] "a turn for the worse", Hyman noted that it [...] "didn't do too much for me", and Kubicek said it [...] "seemed to drag {{on and on and on}} with no real purpose". However, West called it a [...] "wonderful effort" [...] and Slezak wrote that [...] "a little Rodgers and Hammerstein is <b>always</b> <b>welcome</b> at any party"; both reviewers gave the performance a [...] "B+".|$|E
