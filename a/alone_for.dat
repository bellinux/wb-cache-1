5|$|I Not Stupid Too was {{released}} in cinemas on 26 January 2006, and earned over S$4 million in total. The film became the second-highest grossing Singaporean film in history, with only Money No Enough grossing more.

5|$|Another {{factor in}} the revolt of 1381 was {{the conduct of the}} war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his claims to the French throne, {{beginning}} a long-running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years' War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England. By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest <b>alone,</b> <b>for</b> example, were costing £36,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months. Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, Richard II, then only ten years old.|$|E
5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential for state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be <b>alone</b> <b>for</b> long.|$|E

5|$|Based on its {{fundraising}} {{efforts and}} crowd {{estimates for the}} Obama inauguration, the presidential committee set its budget at $160–$170million for the inauguration, including about $45million for the gala events.

The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75million <b>alone</b> <b>for</b> police, fire and medical services.

Subsequently, none of the unsold tickets were granted for Chelsea and its followers; the consequences proved worse, when the side announced that they had issued tickets <b>alone</b> <b>for</b> those, who had ordered the more higher-priced package.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt.
