5|$|By mid-December the ship's {{supply of}} flour and butter for the voyage had been {{exhausted}} and Philip authorised Mason to broach the stores {{set aside for}} the future colony in order to continue to feed the convicts. A month later, on 20 January 1788, Prince of Wales reached Australia's Botany Bay. Six days later she sailed for Sydney Cove as part of the relocation of the convict settlement to Port Jackson. Leaving Botany Bay she collided with Friendship, losing her mainmast staysail and topsail, but the damage was swiftly repaired <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to enter Port Jackson in line with her fellow transports. There she landed 49 convicts, 31 marines and 23 civilians.|$|E
5|$|Caroline and {{her second}} husband {{divorced}} soon after, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to keep the bulk of her wealth intact (though she settled on Durrieux a sum of one million dollars in order to retain custody of her two sons). Various suitors often in her entourage, such as Count Boni de Castellane and Gaston Bonnefoy, were reported to be engaged or interested in her, particularly after her divorce. She never remarried. Caroline's younger son died in 1914, but the elder lived a long, quiet life on his inherited wealth, dying in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Wu's {{older brother}} died in 1958, {{her father in}} 1959 and her mother in 1962. At that time the United States {{government}} had severe restrictions on its citizens' ability to travel abroad, so she was not permitted to visit China to attend their funerals. She saw her uncle Wu Zhou-Zhi and younger brother Wu Chien-Hao again {{on a trip to}} Hong Kong in 1965. After the 1972 Nixon visit to China, {{relations between the two countries}} improved, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to visit China again in 1973. By this time her uncle and brother had perished in the Cultural Revolution, and the tombs of her parents had been destroyed. She was greeted by Chou En-Lai, who personally apologized for the destruction of the tombs. After this, she returned to China a number of times.|$|E

25|$|In 1974 the East German {{authorities}} {{announced that}} they wanted to bring the museum and its exhibits under state control. In protest von Mahlsdorf began giving away the exhibits to visitors. Thanks to the committed involvement of the actress Annekathrin Bürger and the attorney Friedrich Karl Kaul (and possibly also thanks to her enlistment as an inoffizieller Mitarbeiter or Stasi collaborator) the authorities' attempt was stopped in 1976 <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to keep the museum.|$|E
25|$|Once she had {{completed}} her training, {{she was able}} to set off to join her father in Moscow, where he was then British Ambassador <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to be useful as a secretary in the embassy. Because the direct route to Moscow would have required travelling through German-occupied Europe, she and her mother and her sister Theresa, travelled to Russia by way of Canada, crossing the continent on the Canadian Pacific Railway and then passing through Japan and China and crossing the Soviet Union by rail.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 2007, the Ålandsfärjan {{touched the}} bottom near Mariehamn. Passengers were readied for evacuation, but an {{inspection}} of the ship revealed no major damage <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to continue to Mariehamn under her own power, arriving some 30 minutes behind schedule. As {{a result of the}} accident, all departures until 22 November were cancelled. Investigations revealed that the cause for the accident was the new duty rosters: the officer on duty was inspecting the new roster and because of that failed to notice that the ship should have made a course change whilst approaching Mariehamn.|$|E

25|$|Dougherty {{returned}} to Leadville {{at least once}} a year to visit his mother. On a visit in 1935, he met Phyllis Lofts, a fellow school teacher who taught at Coonamble High School. They were married at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church in Sydney. This cut short Phyllis's teaching career for the time being, as married women were not permitted to work as teachers at that time. During the Second World War this regulation would be relaxed <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to take a position at Goulburn High School. They would eventually have five children: Margaret and Graeme, born before the war, and, later, Maureen, David and Noela.|$|E
25|$|Hyrax Hill {{is located}} near Lake Nakuru. 5000 to 6000 years ago, during the {{occupation}} of Site I, a wetter climate meant that lake levels were as much as 100 meters higher than their present levels. Hyrax Hill was a peninsula at this time, which jutted out into {{the north side of}} the lake. The occupants would have had access to a steady supply of fresh water, as well as fish. Mary Leakey identified the ancient rocky beach of the lake in her 1938 excavations. The early occupation of Site I lies directly on the ancient beach, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to use this and relative dating to date this portion of the site.|$|E
25|$|Cooke {{was born}} in Hulme in Lancashire in 1867 to John and Eliza Anderson (born Jackson) Cooke. Following private {{education}} she went to Manchester High School for Girls where she was identified as academic. She was able to attend Owens College, Manchester (part of the Victoria University) as the college had allowed women to attend {{a few years before}} <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to live with her parents. The university had limited provisions for co-educational education. She liked history and she won the Bradford history scholarship in 1888 which assisted her in gaining not only a first class degree in history in 1890, but also the Jones fellowship. The fellowship funded post-graduate research which resulted in a publication in 1893 of what became the standard account of early Cistercian monasteries.|$|E

25|$|In Anna's own memoirs, she {{describes}} her perils {{in prison and}} her narrow escape from execution when, miraculously, she met several old friends of her father on a St. Petersburg street who helped her escape. She endured much hardship avoiding the Bolsheviks, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to escape to Finland only in December 1920. Before leaving the Soviet Union, she became friends with the revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky, who urged her to write her memoirs; she followed his advice. She met with Zinaida Gippius, Alexander Blok and Valery Bryusov. Her memories of life at court provided rare descriptions of the home life of the Tsar and his family. No one understood Rasputin and Alexandra better than Anna did. She tells a good story but {{does not seem to}} tell the truth.|$|E
25|$|An {{independent}} {{investigation of}} the event was undertaken by Russian politicians Sergei Yushenkov, Sergei Kovalev, journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Hoover Institute scholar John B. Dunlop, and former FSB officers Aleksander Litvinenko and Mikhail Trepashkin. According to their version, FSB knew about the terrorist group's arrival in Moscow and directed them to the theater through their agent provocateur Khanpasha Terkibayev ("Abu Bakar"), whose name was {{in the list of}} hostage takers and who left the theater alive. In April 2003 Litvinenko gave information about Terkibayev ("the Terkibayev file") to Sergei Yushenkov when he visited London. Yushenkov passed this file to Politkovskaya <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to interview Terkibayev in person. A few days later, Yushenkov was assassinated by gunfire in Moscow. Terkibayev was later killed in an apparent car crash in Chechnya.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April 1943, U-607 {{departed}} St Nazaire {{on active}} patrol {{under the command}} of Oberleutnant zur See Wolf Jeschonnek. Jeschonnek had served on U-607 since her commissioning. During the patrol she was attacked on a number of occasions. On 28 April she was attacked by a Vickers Wellington aircraft of 172 Squadron, Royal Air Force. On 12 May she was attacked by a Fairey Swordfish of 811 Squadron, Fleet Air Arm. After this, she was hunted by a Royal Navy corvette which opened fire at extreme range without effect. She was forced to submerge when one of her diesel engines broke down. Over a seven-hour period a number of depth charges were dropped without effect. U-607 managed to surface {{a couple of times and}} was forced to dive again. The third time she surfaced there was an area of mist <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to make her escape.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 Winter Olympics at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, athletes Catriona Le May Doan, Steve Nash, Nancy Greene and Wayne Gretzky were to {{simultaneously}} light {{the base of}} poles, which would then carry the flames upwards to the cauldron. However, only {{three out of four}} poles came out of the ground due to mechanical problems, resulting in inadvertently excluding Le May Doan from lighting it with the other three athletes. Because the site of the ceremonies - BC Place - was a domed stadium, Gretzky was sent via the back of a pick-up truck to a secondary site— the Vancouver Convention Centre which served at the International Broadcast Centre for these Olympics— to light a larger cauldron of a similar design located outdoors, as Olympic rules state that the flame must be in public view for the entirety of the Olympics. In the closing ceremonies, Le May Doan took part in a joke about the mechanical glitch, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to light the fully raised fourth pole and have the indoor cauldron relit.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{location}} of the body, the murder investigation was allocated to the RUC B Division (West Belfast), based at the Springfield Road station where CID Detective Alan Simpson served. He formed part of the CID team set up to investigate the Ogilby killing. After Sharlene was located in a children's home, she was interviewed by a female detective; she clearly remembered the events of 24 July. It was arranged for Sharlene to accompany three CID detectives in a car to Sandy Row <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to direct them to the disused bakery in Hunter Street. A Scenes of Crime Officer was sent to the scene to examine the building's interior and collect the evidence. Forensics later showed that the bloodstains police detectives found on the floor and on the items retrieved from inside the UDA club matched Ogilby's blood group. Documents were also found on the premises bearing William Young's name. By that time the suspects had already been rounded up and taken in for interrogation. These were the eight women who had been inside the car with Ogilby on the evening of 23 July following the fracas outside the Glengall Street bus station.|$|E
25|$|In March 1551, her {{condition}} improved somewhat <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> {{to receive a}} messenger from Bona Sforza who informed her that Bona recognized her marriage to Sigismund Augustus.

Sigismund Augustus personally tended to his sick wife even though reportedly she stank of pus. He wanted {{to take her to}} Niepołomice where he hoped that spring weather would lessen her suffering. When there was a doubt whether a special wagon to transport Barbara could fit through the city gates, Sigismund Augustus ordered the gate demolished. Barbara died on 8 May 1551 in Kraków. She asked to be buried in Vilnius and her body was transported to Vilnius Cathedral, where she was buried on 23 June next to Sigismund Augustus' first wife Elizabeth of Austria. Her death was a severe loss to the King; it is said that for {{a good portion of the}} journey he followed her coffin on foot. It was said that Sigismund Augustus became more serious, avoided parties, and liked to dress black for the rest of his life.|$|E

25|$|This {{shipyard}} overhaul prepared Carina {{for service}} with distant voyages {{in support of}} the Liberation of the Philippines. Among other tasks, she carried pontoons from Pearl Harbor to Ulithi Atoll between 2 October 1944 and 31 December 1944. Returning to San Francisco for further repairs and upgrades, she went asea towards the combat areas again on 9 March 1945. She arrived in the dangerous combat waters off Okinawa on 26 April, and on 4 May, she became the target of a determined Japanese suicide boat, which successfully rammed Carina. This ramming produced a violent explosion on her port side, knocked out one of her boilers, and flooded one of her holds. Six crewmen of Carinas were injured by the explosion. Skillful damage control saved both Carina and her cargo, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to complete unloading her cargo at Okinawa before departing for temporary repairs at the Navy base at Ulithi Atoll. Carina returned to the West Coast of the United States for an overhaul in July, and the war ended in August before her services were needed again. On 17 October 1945, she was decommissioned at Suisun Bay, California, and she was delivered to the War Shipping Administration for long-term storage.|$|E
25|$|Li Mi {{was pleased}} with Li Yuan's response, believing that Li Yuan was willing to support him, and from that point on, Li Mi and Li Yuan often {{exchanged}} messengers. Li Yuan's campaign against Chang'an thus went without opposition from Li Mi. Meanwhile, however, when Li Yuan arrived near Hedong, his army was bogged down by the weather, and with food running out, there were rumors that Eastern Tujue and Liu Wuzhou would attack Taiyuan. Li Yuan initially ordered retreat, but at the earnest opposition by Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, continued to advance. After defeating Sui forces at Huoyi (霍邑, also in modern Yuncheng), he decided to leave a small contingent to watch over Hedong while advancing across the Yellow River into Guanzhong (i.e., the Chang'an region). Once he did, he headed for Chang'an himself, while sending Li Jiancheng to capture the territory around the Tong Pass region to prevent Sui forces at Luoyang from reinforcing Chang'an and Li Shimin north of the Wei River to capture territory there. Meanwhile, his daughter had also risen in rebellion in support of him, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to gather a sizable army and capture some cities. She joined forces with Li Shimin and her husband Chai Shao. Soon, Li Yuan reconsolidated his forces and put Chang'an under siege. In winter 617, he captured Chang'an and declared Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong). He had himself made regent (with the title of grand chancellor) and created the Prince of Tang. (Meanwhile, most of Sui territory did not recognize Emperor Gong as emperor and continued to recognize Emperor Yang as emperor and not as retired emperor.) He sent his nephew Li Xiaogong south, and Li Xiaogong was able to persuade the Sui cities in modern southern Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Chongqing to submit.|$|E
25|$|Setting out towards Imbros, Yavûz Sultân Selîm {{struck a}} mine on transit to the island, {{but the damage}} was {{insignificant}} and the two Ottoman vessels were able to continue their mission. Yavûz Sultân Selîm then proceeded to bombard the British signal station at Kephalo Point while Midilli was sent ahead to guard the entrance of Kusu Bay. As Yavûz Sultân Selîm and Midilli approached Kusu Bay, they were sighted by the destroyer HMS Lizard at 5:30am. Lizard attempted to engage the Ottoman ships, but could not close to torpedo range due to heavy fire from her opponents. Yavûz Sultân Selîm soon sighted the two British monitors taking refuge in the bay, and broke off from Lizard to engage them. As Yavûz Sultân Selîm attacked the monitors, Midilli continued to duel with Lizard who was then joined by the destroyer HMS Tigress. Lizard and Tigress attempted to shield the monitors from Yavûz Sultân Selîm by laying a smoke screen, but this was ineffective. The monitors were both much too slow to evade Yavûz Sultân Selîm <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to score numerous hits on Raglan, hitting her foretop and killing her gunnery and direction officers. Raglan attempted to return fire with its 6 and 14-inch guns, but scored no hits on the German vessels before her main armament was knocked out when a shell pierced its casemate and ignited the ammunition within it. Shortly after she was disarmed, Raglan was hit in her magazine by one of Yavûz Sultân Selîms 11-inch shells causing the monitor to sink. After Raglan was sunk, the Ottoman battlecruiser began {{turned her attention to}} HMS M28, striking her amidships and setting her alight before she was sunk when her magazine exploded at 6:00a.m. With the two monitors sunk, the Ottomans decided to break off the engagement and head south in an attempt to raid the allied naval base at Mudros.|$|E
