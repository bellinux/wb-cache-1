5000|$|A {{factor that}} limits {{locomotive}} performance is {{the rate at}} which fuel is fed into the fire. Much of the fireman's time is spent throwing wood or shoveling coal into the firebox of the locomotive to maintain constant steam pressure. In the early 20th century some locomotives became so large that the fireman could not shovel coal fast enough. [...] Consequently, in the United States, various steam-powered mechanical stokers (typically using an <b>auger</b> <b>feed</b> between the fuel bunker and the firebox) became standard equipment and were adopted elsewhere, including Australia and South Africa.|$|E

The auger means has {{first and second}} helical fighting sections extending inwardly from its ends which are adapted to convey the cut crop {{to the center of}} the platform. A first endless chain is operatively positioned forwardly of the first flighting section and has a plurality of first cutting elements mounted thereon. A second endless chain is operatively positioned forwardly of the second flighting section and has a plurality of second cutting elements mounted thereon. The first and second chains are operated in opposing directions so that the first and second cutting elements move away from the center of the platform as the cutting elements cut the standing crop. The opposing action of the cutting elements causes the crop stems to be properly oriented with respect to the flighting sections so that the stems will be inclined towards the center of the platform in the same direction as the <b>auger</b> <b>feed...</b>|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of StatisticsLeigh MurrayThis {{case study}} was {{motivated}} by the need for effective statistical analysis {{for a series of}} poultry feeding experiments conducted in 2006 by Kansas State University researchers in the department of Animal Science. Some of these experiments involved an automated <b>auger</b> <b>feed</b> line system commonly used in commercial broiler houses and continuous, proportion response data. Two of the feed line experiments are considered in this case study to determine if a statistical model using a non-normal response offers a better fit for this data than a model utilizing a normal approximation. The two experiments involve fixed as well as multiple random effects. In this case study, the data from these experiments is analyzed using a linear mixed model and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM’s) with the SAS Glimmix procedure. Comparisons are made between a linear mixed model and GLMM’s using the beta and binomial responses. Since the response data is not count data a quasi-binomial approximation to the binomial is used to convert continuous proportions to the ratio of successes over total number of trials, N, for a variety of possible N values. Results from these analyses are compared on the basis of point estimates, confidence intervals and confidence interval widths, as well as p-values for tests of fixed effects. The investigation concludes that a GLMM may offer a better fit than models using a normal approximation for this data when sample sizes are small or response values are close to zero. This investigation discovers that these same instances can cause GLMM’s utilizing the beta response to behave poorly in the Glimmix procedure because lack of convergence issues prevent the obtainment of valid results. In such a case, a GLMM using a quasi-binomial response distribution with a high value of N can offer a reasonable and well behaved alternative to the beta distribution...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryR. Scott BeyerThe modern poultry {{industry}} uses <b>auger</b> <b>feed</b> lines to transport feed for broilers to pans to make feed available for them while greatly reducing labor costs. The feed given to broilers is manufactured at significant cost into a pelleted form. Pellets reduce broiler production costs by increasing feed intake and growth rate while reducing feed. Pellet quality is expressed using a method called the Pellet Durability Index (PDI). A {{series of studies}} was conducted {{to determine the effects}} of these destructive forces on both pellet quality and nutritive value. In Experiment 1, it was found that pellets of 78 and 86 PDI had 30 % more fines in the final pan compared to the initial pan, but there was no significant difference between the two diets. In Experiment 2, a significant difference existed between a 23 PDI diet and an 82 PDI diet in the percentage of fines found at 12 selected pans. This indicates destruction occurring along the length of the feed line. In Experiment 3, soybean oil was applied to the exterior of the pellets and they were transported through the feed line. A significant difference in the amount of fat at each collection site was found, as the fat was removed from the exterior of the pellets in earlier pans, indicating destructive forces having an effect on the pellets. In Experiment 4, whole sorghum was used to create four diets with similar PDI. The feed was then placed in the feed line, collected at twelve locations, and analyzed for crude fat, CP, DM, ash and Ca. The results indicated the presence of whole sorghum in the pellets had no effect on percent fines or nutrient values. In Experiment 5, three diets with different PDI were transported through the feed line. Five collection sites were selected. Results indicate that high quality pellets withstand handling while pellets below 68 PDI show increased fine percentage. These experiments indicate pellets are damaged during transport in the feed line, but nutrients remain the same unless they are on the exterior of the pellet...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{fertilizers}} and solid amendments in agriculture generates special interest for {{their effect on}} crop productivity, {{as well as for}} their environmental impact. The efficient use of these products demands knowing their physical and mechanical properties, the storing conditions effect and the operational characteristics of the metering systems used in the fertilizing equipment. In this context, the present study was developed with the purpose of evaluating the operational characteristics of different fertilizing metering systems and to determine the adequate metering system-product operational parameters, using powder lime, powder gypsum, granular 10 - 30 - 10 (N-P-K), and granular urea. Operational differences were established among four types of commercial fertilizer metering systems, including wire <b>auger,</b> star-shaped <b>feed</b> wheel, feed screw and ridged traction wheel. The study found that the unloading rate depends directly on the fertilizer metering system’s rotating speed and is affected by particle size, repose angle, bulk density and moisture content of the applied product. The wire <b>auger</b> and star-shaped <b>feed</b> wheel metering systems were adequate for the distribution of powder products and the feed screw for granulated fertilizers...|$|R

50|$|Early Traeger Grills, {{as well as}} many of the pellet grills first {{introduced}} after the expiration of the Traeger patent, used a simple three-position controller, sometimes called a LMH controller. As the name suggests, the control panel utilizes a knob with three settings, Low (or Smoke), Medium, and High, intended for smoking, baking, and grilling, respectively. Each setting approximates a temperature range, and those temperatures were achieved by means of a fixed, predetermined duty cycle*. For instance, on Medium the pellet grill reaches 300-325 °F by repeating a duty cycle in which the <b>auger</b> <b>feeds</b> pellets for two minutes then goes idle for two minutes. So long as the controller remains on that setting, the pellet grill continuously performs the same duty cycle. Although this type of controller can automatically reach and maintain a predetermined cooking range—give or take 25-50 °F—it has obvious shortcomings. Offering only three temperature settings, with large jumps in temperature between each, limits cooking options and prevents the user from cooking with precision. Furthermore, because the duty cycles are fixed, they don't account for weather conditions or the amount of food being cooked, both of which affect temperature. Thus, on a cold, windy day, a pellet grill with a three-position controller that is filled with meat will struggle to reach its set temperature. The duty cycles themselves are also problematic. The auger-on portion of the cycle is too long, allowing large amounts of pellets to pile up in the fire pot and ignite at once, causing sudden, sharp temperature swings.|$|R
50|$|The term feeding in {{the context}} of vacuum fillers refers to {{actively}} moving the filling media {{in the direction of the}} lower part of the hopper to support the vacuum approach within the hopper. Feeding is achieved by using moveable feeding augers with scrapers/rigid counter arms. The <b>feeding</b> <b>auger</b> is driven in synchronisation with the rotation of the rotors. Due to the special geometry of both augers and the parallel rotation movement, the filling product is moved vertically in the direction of the vane cell feed system. The required feed intensity depends on the viscosity of the media to be filled. Less active feed is needed with low-viscosity media than with high-viscosity product. There are therefore a variety of combinations or versions of the parts involved in the feeding process.|$|R
50|$|First, {{the desired}} {{temperature}} is programmed into the electronic control panel. A motor-driven <b>auger</b> then <b>feeds</b> {{a small amount}} of pellets from the hopper to the fire pot. Igniter rods light the pellets and prime the fire, raising the grill to an initial starting temperature (140 °F to 180 °F, depending on manufacturer). Once the fire is ready, the desired temperature is achieved via a repeated duty cycle, which represents a segment of time when the auger is active and idle. A single duty cycle starts when the auger turns on and begins feeding pellets then continues through the period when it shuts off and remains idle. The duty cycle ends when the auger turns on again. For example, a pellet grill set to 250 °F might have an auger-on period of 10 seconds followed by an auger-off period of 50 seconds. Duty cycles are typically stated as a percentage that represents the amount of time the auger is running—an auger that's always on has a 100% duty cycle, while one that is on half the time has a 50% duty cycle. Each temperature setting has a different duty cycle. However, regardless of that temperature setting, the auger-on portion of the duty cycle remains constant. The auger-off period is the variable. Lower temperatures have longer auger-off periods, while high temperatures have shorter.|$|R
50|$|The {{key element}} of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the feed system {{mechanically}} via a hopper with actively driven <b>feeding</b> <b>auger,</b> as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell feed system move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The feed system moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the feed system. Each cell of the feed system has a particular volume. The portion {{is defined by the}} rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor’s rotation distance by the number of the feed system cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.|$|R
