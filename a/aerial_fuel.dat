Black Horse was deliberately designed to use existing tanker aircraft, specifically the KC-135Q and T models, which had fuel tanks completely separate from the aircraft's own fuel system (most models allowed the 135's engines to draw from the tanks). However, performance was slightly increased if the transfer took place in the supersonic regime at Mach 3.0, and dramatically increased, almost doubled, if it was hypersonic at Mach 5.5.|$|E
40|$|Commercial timber {{harvesting}} typically reduces <b>aerial</b> <b>fuel</b> loading and continuity, but can actually heighten fire activity through increased surface fuel loading (Agee 1997). Fuel depth and loading, which typically increase after harvest, {{play a significant}} role in fire intensity and rate of spread in redwood forests (Sequoia sempervirens) (D. Don.) Endl.) (Nives 1989), which are significant predictors of redwood mortality (Finney and Martin 1993). However, residual slash fuels may simultaneously reduce erosion, which may be of greater importance in some areas because they intercept rainfall and soil particles dispersed by overland flow (Fernandez et al. 2004). The relationship of surface fuel loading on potential fire behavior and soil erosion was explored in coast redwood stands that were selectively harvested 11 years prior to this study by either cable- or tractor-skidding methods (Piirto et al. 1997). The objectives of this study were to (1) assess fuel loading and potential fire behavior in harvested stands and (2) determine if surface soil erosion was influenced by surface fuels...|$|E
30|$|Among {{the most}} {{immediate}} threats to the WNRA’s relict forests {{appears to be a}} high susceptibility to stand-replacing wildland fire that the presence of the encroachment cohort has introduced in the form of ladder fuel continuity. Crown fires were historically rare in ponderosa pine dominated forests, primarily due to the scarcity of ladder fuels (Skinner and Chang 1996). As is common for ponderosa pine forests, the forests of the WNRA are believed to have evolved under a regime of frequent fire occurrence that kept those ladder fuels at bay (USDI 2003). The incidence of fires that would have kept those ladder fuels at bay diminished substantially around 1925 (Fry and Stephens 2006). The current arrangement of understory and mid-story strata has resulted in greater vertical connectivity of fuel complexes in WNRA relict forests; in many cases, there is no spatial segregation of surface and <b>aerial</b> <b>fuel</b> complexes. Given the park’s inherently high risk of fire occurrence (presence of a major highway through the park; close proximity to the city of Redding), this hazard presents an acute condition that chronically threatens the WRNA’s relict forests.|$|E
40|$|Tree {{mortality}} caused during extensive {{outbreaks of}} spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby [Coleoptera: Curculionidae]), has been assumed to increase hazardous fuel loads and consequently influence fire behavior, occurrence, and effects. However, {{little research has}} been done to quantify or qualify how spruce beetle-induced tree mortality may alter fuel complexes during the course of an outbreak. The objective of our research was to determine how fuel complexes differ between stands with 1) endemic populations of spruce beetle, 2) stands experiencing current outbreaks and 3) stands with post-outbreak spruce beetle-induced tree mortality. We measured ground, surface and <b>aerial</b> <b>fuels</b> in spruce-fir stands assigned into one of three spruce beetle condition classes; endemic, epidemic, or post-epidemic. These stands were located on the Manti-LaSal and Fishlake National Forests in south central and southern Utah. We used analysis of variance to compare mean differences in stand attributes and fuel variables between the three spruce beetle condition classes. Mean amount of down, woody, surface fuel (tonnes/ha) in the 100 hr size class in epidemic stands was significantly greater than endemic stands. Mean litter depth and amount was significantly greater in epidemicstands than endemic and post-epidemic stands. A significant increase for most estimates of live and dead herbaceous material was detected in epidemic stands and post-epidemic stands when compared with stands not impacted by spruce beetle. Similarly, significant increases in live shrub material were detected in post-epidemic stands. Spruce-fir stands also had significantly less live <b>aerial</b> <b>fuels</b> following outbreaks compared with endemic stands...|$|R

The model {{is based upon}} data {{from a series of}} experimental crown fires in immature jack pine. Its intended use is to permit calculation of fuel consumption per unit area (kg/m 2) needed to estimate edge intensity (kW/m) from the spread rate of a crown fire. Model predictions of small fuel component fractional loading reduction had a root-mean-square error of almost 0. 2 for our calibration data set. Most of the error arises from the model prediction of complete consumption of crown foliage, some of which was not exposed to flame in the fires of our data set.

40|$|Stand-replacement fires, {{particularly}} in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests, have replaced high-frequency, low-intensity historical fire regimes. We examined whether forest stands treated recently using silvicultural practices would be (1) {{less susceptible to}} stand-replacing crownfires, and (2) more ecologically and functionally resilient compared to untreated stands following extreme wildland fire. Reports detailing wildland fire behavior in treated stands remain largely anecdotal. We compared fire severity indices, fireline intensity (btu/ft/s), stand characteristics including canopy bulk density (kg/m 3), and post-fire recovery indices in silviculturally treated vs. untreated forest stands in New Mexico and Arizona. Results indicated fire severity in pine-grassland forests was lowered when surface and <b>aerial</b> <b>fuel</b> loads were reduced. Specifically, as density (stems/ac) and basal area (ft 2 /ac) decreased and mean tree diameter (in) increased, fire severity and fireline intensity decreased. The more aggressive the treatment (i. e., where the canopy bulk density was reduced), the less susceptible forest stands were to crownfire. However, mechanical treatments where slash was scattered rendered stands susceptible to near stand-replacement type damage when wildfire occurred within 4 years of treatment. On our study sites, mechanical treatment followed by prescribed fire had the greatest impact toward mitigating fir...|$|E

Three sites were chosen: two sites, Sawtooth NRA (Idaho) and Wasatch-cache NF (Utah), had current epidemics; and one site, Ashley NF (Utah), had previous epidemics. We also compared our fire behaviour results with those from standard fuel models. Results indicated that for surface fires both rates of fire spread and fireline intensities {{were higher in the}} current epidemic stands than in the endemic stands owing to increases in the amounts of fine surface fuels. In the post-epidemic stands, rates of surface fire spread and fireline intensities were higher than in the endemic stands owing to decreased vegetative sheltering and its effect on mid-flame wind speed. Total heat release of surface fires, including postfrontal combustion, was also higher in the post-epidemic stands owing to heavy accumulations of large diameter fuels. Crown fires were more likely to initiate in the post-epidemic stands owing to greater fireline intensities and lower crown base heights. However, the critical rate of spread needed to sustain an active crown fire was higher in the post-epidemic stands owing to decreased <b>aerial</b> <b>fuel</b> continuity. We suggest here that crown fire initiation in the current epidemic stands was also greater because of an abundance of dead aerial fuels; although this relationship is unclear...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Bark beetle-caused tree {{mortality}} in conifer forests affects {{the quantity and}} quality of forestfuelsandhaslongbeenassumedtoincreasefirehazardandpotential firebehavior. In reality, bark beetles and their effects on fuel accumulation, and subsequent fire hazard have only recently been described. We have extensively sampled fuels in three conifer forest types (lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce and Douglas-fir) and described bark beetle/fuels/fire interactions within the context of intermountain disturbance regimes. Our data sets were developed by measuring the forest biomass in stands with endemic, epidemic and post-epidemic bark beetle populations and comparing {{the quantity and quality}} of fuels present within each beetle population phase. Surface and canopy fuels data were used to create fuel models that are customized to represent the actual fuel conditions created by the bark beetles. Fire behavior predictions based on these custom fuel models showed that surface fire rate of spread and fireline intensities were higher in the current epidemic stands than in the endemic stands due to increased litter and fine fuel in all three forest types. Bark beetles selectively remove large diameter trees altering stand level canopy fuels and promoting release of herbaceous and shrub species which further affects fire potential. Bark beetle-caused tree mortality decreases vegetative sheltering which affects mid-flame wind speed and increases rate of fire spread. Passive crown fires are more likely in post-epidemic stands, but active crown fires are less likely due to decreased <b>aerial</b> <b>fuel</b> continuity. Intense surface fires are possible in post epidemic stands, but it is very much dependent on the rate at which dead trees fall. Our present research will utilize this information in addition to spatial data to describe the influence of mountain pine beetle (MPB) on fuels and fire behavior in stands of high- elevation five-needle pines, including whitebark, limber, foxtail, Rocky Mountain bristlecone, and Great Basin bristlecone pine...|$|E

30|$|There was {{temporal}} and spatial variation in fuel deposition, suggesting that winter storm activity {{during the course of}} the study may have been an important source of localized surface fuel loads (Keane 2013, Stalling et al. 2017). Deposition of 100 -hour fuels at one litter basket resulted in a 10 -fold higher total fuel load in 2010. The total precipitation from 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011 was approximately 36 to 67 % higher than the several years prior, and this may have contributed to high deposition rates of litter in 2011, which was the main contributor to total fuel loading (Table  3). High winds and rainfall and snowfall amounts may cause tree mortality and damage to canopies of trees, transferring <b>aerial</b> <b>fuels</b> to surface fuels (Brown and See 1981, Grier 1988) in relatively shorts periods, contributing to the spatially clumped distribution of coarse fuel loads (Lundquist 2007, Fry and Stephens 2010, Lydersen et al. 2015). A limited sample size and low snag densities (Stephens and Gill 2005) in this study area prohibited an examination of relationships with coarse fuels (1000 -hour).|$|R
30|$|Suppression of {{wildfire}} in the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB), USA, {{has resulted}} in an accumulation of surface and <b>aerial</b> <b>fuels</b> and increased forest density, increasing the risk of high-severity fire (Weatherspoon et al. 1992). To help remove accumulated fuels, pile burning of slash and forest residues from thinned conifers and shrubs has been adopted by most agencies and land owners. However, concern has been voiced about pile burning within or near stream environment zones (SEZs). Elevated soil temperatures during burning contribute {{to the destruction of}} soil organic matter, degradation of soil structure and porosity, alteration of hydraulic properties, and changes in nutrient cycling and microbial processes (Frandsen and Ryan 1986, Campbell et al. 1995, Certini 2005). Additionally, post-fire soil water repellency can limit infiltration and promote surface erosion (Shakesby et al. 2000). Heat-induced changes also affect soil nitrate (NO 3), ortho-phosphate (PO 4), and sulfate (SO 4) status and facilitate their movement in surface overland flow, with potential implications for lake functions and processes (Stephens et al. 2004, Miller et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Bark beetle-caused tree {{mortality}} in conifer forests affects {{the quantity and}} quality of forest fuels and has long been assumed to increase fire hazard and potential fire behavior. In reality, bark beetles, and their effects on fuel accumulation, and subsequent fire hazard, are poorly understood. We extensively sampled fuels in three bark beetle-affected Intermountain conifer forests and compared these data to existing research on bark beetle/fuels/fire interactions within the context of the disturbance regime. Data were collected in endemic, epidemic and post-epidemic stands of Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce. From these data, we evaluated the influence of bark beetle-caused tree mortality on various fuels characteristics over the course of a bark beetle rotation. The data showed that changes in fuels over time create periods where the potential for high intensity and/or severe fires increases or decreases. The net result of bark beetle epidemics was a substantial change in species composition and a highly altered fuels complex. Early in epidemics there is a net increase in the amount of fine surface fuels when compared to endemic stands. In post-epidemic stands large, dead, woody fuels, and live surface fuels dominate. We then discuss potential fire behavior in bark beetle-affected conifer fuels based on actual and simulated fuels data. Results indicated that for surface fires both rates of fire spread and fireline intensities were higher in the current epidemic stands than in the endemic stands. Rates of spread and fireline intensities were higher in epidemic stands due, however, to decreased vegetative sheltering and its effect on mid-flame wind speed, rather than changes in fuels. Passive crown fires were more likely in post-epidemic stands, but active crown fires were less likely due to decreased <b>aerial</b> <b>fuel</b> continuity. We also discuss the ecological effects of extreme fire behavior.

40|$|Recent {{bark beetle}} {{outbreaks}} have caused extensive tree mortality in conifer forests across western Northern America, which has altered forest fuels. These changes have {{raised concerns about}} forest health and wildfire risk. Studies focused on interactions between bark beetles, forests fuels, and changes in fire behavior have been primarily led in upper elevation forests characterized by high-severity fire regimes, principally in lodgepole pine (pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm) forests. Few studies to date have addressed bark beetle fuel interactions in lower to middle montane forest characterized by a mixed-severity fire regime, with available research focused strictly on assessing fuel load conditions or stand structural changes. The goal {{of this research was}} to quantify and characterize surface and canopy fuel changes in middle montane interior Douglas-Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca (Beissn.)) forest infested by Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins), while also measuring physical and chemical changes to foliage in terms of moisture content and terpenes, which are known to play important roles in foliage flammability. Our results revealed few changes in surface fuels following Douglas-fir beetle infestations aside from a significant increase in litter depth and loading in red stage sample plots. Substantial changes to canopy fuels were detected in the red stage of an outbreak with a significant reduction in foliar moisture content measured as tree crowns faded from a healthy green phase to red. During this period, volatile emissions and within-needle concentrations of terpenes increased, including some terpenes previously associated with increased foliage flammability in other tree species. Furthermore, <b>aerial</b> <b>fuel</b> parameters that estimate the likelihood of crown fire initiation, including canopy bulk density and canopy base height, showed a substantial reduction in gray stage sample plots. Based on our findings we judge the influence of Douglas-fir beetle activity on altering fuels is most pronounced in the aerial fuels complex. Our results suggest bark beetle affected interior Douglas-fir stands with a high percentage of trees in yellow and red crown phases could have an increased threshold for crown fire initiation based on higher levels of flammable monoterpenes and lower foliar moisture content...|$|E
40|$|Ladder fuels carry {{fire from}} the forest floor to the canopy and thereby may turn low-intensity fires into severe canopy fires. Attempts at {{assessing}} ladder fuels have been either expensive and spatially limited quantified approaches or unrepeatable and variable expert opinion strategies. We have developed a mixed semiquantitative, semiqualitative approach using a flow chart that systematizes observations and constrains judgments and decisionmaking. The ladder fuel hazard assessment (LaFHA) approach leads to ladder hazard ratings and some quantified observed data; it can be repeated across a very large area at relatively low cost and, because of the systematic and constrained approach, produces results that are mostly consistent and repeatable. Key attributes assessed are clumping of low <b>aerial</b> <b>fuels,</b> height to live crown base, and maximum gaps in vertical fuel ladders.

The endemic bark beetle condition class had greater amounts of live, available canopy fuel and canopy bulk density {{than either the}} epidemic and post epidemic condition classes. Epidemic bark beetle condition classes had the highest amounts of needle litter and 1 -hr time lag (0 - 0. 64 cm diameter) fuel while the post-epidemic condition class had the highest amount live shrubs and non-woody plants. Fire behavior calculated with BehavePlus from the custom fuel models resulted in substantial differences in fire rates of spread and intensity for each spruce beetle condition class based on identical moisture scenarios and wind speeds. Rates of spread for epidemic and post-epidemic condition classes ranged between 2. 0 – 2. 9 and 3. 0 – 4. 5 {{times faster than the}} endemic condition class. Fireline intensities ranged from 4. 1 – 5. 0 times higher in the epidemic condition class and 6. 6 – 8. 8 times higher in the post-epidemic condition class compared to endemic condition class. An observed lack of overstory sheltering is attributed to increased fire behavior in epidemic and post epidemic condition classes and has a dominating affect on fire behavior. Post-epidemic condition class rates of spread and fireline intensities at identical midflame wind speeds were 1. 7 and 3. 3 times higher, respectively, than endemic parameters. Relatively, higher rates of spread (4. 4 times) and fireline intensities (8. 5 times), were observed between endemic and post-epidemic condition classes when calculated with 6. 1 m wind speed adjusted for canopy sheltering.

40|$|Alaska white, Lutz, and Sitka spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss, P. x lutzii Little, and P. sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) {{forests are}} subject to {{mortality}} {{from a variety of}} causes such as wind, disease, fire, and insect outbreaks. Of all the insects, the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rojipennis Kirby) is the most devastating (Holsten et al. 1991). Ongoing and new infestations currently impact more than 641, 000 acres in Alaska, with 295, 000 acres located on the Kenai Peninsula in south-central Alaska (USDA 1994). A variety of impacts are associated with spruce beetle infestations. These impacts include, but are not limited to, the loss of merchantable value of killed trees, long-term stand conversion, changes in wildlife habitat, and increase in fire hazard due to increased fuel loading (USDA 1993). Site specific factors must be considered when predicting the degree of impact and planning for treatment of impacted areas. Following an outbreak of spruce budworm (Choristoneurajumiferana [Clem. ]) in eastern Canada during the 19602 ̆ 7 s and 19702 ̆ 7 s, several studies were conducted to assess fire potential and fire hazard (Stocks 1985; Pech 1993). The mixed conifer forests of central Ontario experienced an abundance of combustible surface and <b>aerial</b> <b>fuels</b> and high fire weather severity, resulting in many fires that were difficult to control (Stocks 1985). In contrast, the pure and mature stands of balsam fir on the Cape Breton Highlands of Nova Scotia had no accumulation of fuels and low fire weather severity; the cool, moist climate of the Highlands hastened the decomposition of dead woody materials (Pech 1993). As the beetle epidemic continues, land managers must assess impacts and design treatments for areas close to human communities. Their decisions affect those living in the area, and fire hazard is often a central concern to the people who live and/or own property adjacent to beetle-impacted stands. A fire behavior analysis was done for the Cooper Landing area of the Kenai Peninsula in 1990 (See 1990) in direct response to the spruce beetle epidemic. Fire behavior analyses require site specific information on fuels, weather conditions, and topography. A major source of fuel load data had been collected in 1987 by the U. S. Forest Service Forestry Sciences Laboratory (FSL) in Anchorage, Alaska (USDA 1987). While this data set included stands in various stages of beetle outbreak, it did not include stands where trees killed by beetles had begun to break or fall to the ground.

One of the successful change point detection techniques is Bayesian approach because of its strength to cope with uncertainties in the recorded data.
