40|$|Rhodiola imbricata Edgew. (Rose root or <b>Arctic</b> <b>root</b> or Golden root or Shrolo), {{belonging}} to the family Crassulaceae, is an important food crop and medicinal plant in the Indian trans-Himalayan cold desert. Chemometric profile of the n-hexane, chloroform, dichloroethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and 60 % ethanol root extracts of R. imbricata were performed by hyphenated gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique. GC/MS analysis was carried out using Thermo Finnigan PolarisQ Ion Trap GC/MS MS system comprising of an AS 2000 liquid autosampler. Interpretation on mass spectrum of GC/MS was done using the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Database, with NIST MS search program v. 2. 0 g. Chemometric profile of root extracts revealed the presence of 63 phyto-chemotypes, among them, 1 -pentacosanol; stigmast- 5 -en- 3 -ol, (3 β, 24 S); 1 -teracosanol; 1 -henteracontanol; 17 -pentatriacontene; 13 -tetradecen- 1 -ol acetate; methyl tri-butyl ammonium chloride; bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate; 7, 8 -dimethylbenzocyclooctene; ethyl linoleate; 3 -methoxy- 5 -methylphenol; hexadecanoic acid; camphor; 1, 3 -dimethoxybenzene; thujone; 1, 3 -benzenediol, 5 -pentadecyl; benzenemethanol, 3 -hydroxy, 5 -methoxy; cholest- 4 -ene- 3, 6 -dione; dodecanoic acid, 3 -hydroxy; octadecane, 1 -chloro; ethanone, 1 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl); α-tocopherol; ascaridole; campesterol; 1 -dotriacontane; heptadecane, 9 -hexyl {{were found to be}} present in major amount. Eventually, in the present study we have found phytosterols, terpenoids, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, alkyl halides, phenols, alcohols, ethers, alkanes, and alkenes as the major group of phyto-chemotypes in the different root extracts of R. imbricata. All these compounds identified by GC/MS analysis were further investigated for their biological activities and it was found that they possess a diverse range of positive pharmacological actions. In future, isolation of individual phyto-chemotypes and subjecting them to biological activity will definitely prove fruitful results in designing a novel drug...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe current {{understanding}} of <b>Arctic</b> ecosystems is deeply <b>rooted</b> {{in the classical}} view of a bottom-up controlled system with strong physical forcing and seasonality in primary-production regimes. Consequently, the Arctic polar night is commonly disregarded as a {{time of year when}} biological activities are reduced to a minimum due to a reduced food supply. Here, based upon a multidisciplinary ecosystem-scale study from the polar night at 79 °N, we present an entirely different view. Instead of an ecosystem that has entered a resting state, we document a system with high activity levels and biological interactions across most trophic levels. In some habitats, biological diversity and presence of juvenile stages were elevated in winter months compared to the more productive and sunlit periods. Ultimately, our results suggest a different perspective regarding ecosystem function that will be of importance for future environmental management and decision making, especially at a time when Arctic regions are experiencing accelerated environmental change [1]...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Fungi {{are thought}} {{to be one of the}} most diverse groups of organisms in the Arctic. They drive mineral and energy cycles and {{influence}} the occurrence of other organisms as mutualists (mycorrhizae, endophytes, lichens), decomposers and pathogens. Nevertheless, information on fungal biodiversity and distribution patterns in relation to environments across the Arctic is still sparse. Molecular methods were used to examine the diversity and community structures of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) associated with two principal arctic host plants, Salix aretica and Dryas integrifolia, as well as total soil fungal communities of adjacent disturbed and undisturbed areas of patterned-ground features across the five bioclimatic subzones (A-E) of the North American Arctic. Key findings include the following: (1) More diverse fungal communities had been observed than previously known. These communities encompass nearly all fungal phyla and included all fungal guilds. However, a few species-rich fungal families dominated these fungal communities. (2) Surprisingly, species richness did not decline with latitude. (3) The most abundant fungal taxa were widely distributed in and beyond the <b>Arctic.</b> Yet <b>root</b> (EMF) and soil fungal communities showed niche preferences in regard to bioclimatic subzones. Furthermore, disturbed and undisturbed patterned ground features harbored different soil fungal communities with the exception of the coldest subzone A. In contrast, EMF community composition was not affected by host plant identity. (4) Fungal communities in the warmest subzone E were distinct from the other arctic subzones and the majority of taxa matched fungi from the boreal forest. (5) Key drivers of fungal community and guild composition along the bioclimatic gradient included regional climate, p. H as well as vegetation composition and productivity across the subzones. At the local scale of patterned-ground features, fungal communities were correlated with vegetation composition and microclimate. With a warming climate, I would expect an enhanced colonization of patterned-ground features by vascular plants that would then affect fungal community structure not only at the species level, but also at the level of fungal guilds. In particular I would expect increases in fungi that are symbiotic with plants and a northward shift of both plant and fungal taxa...|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} thesis {{project was to}} {{investigate}} Arctic precipitation from three atmospheric reanalyses: Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-Interim (ERA-Interim). The first objective {{of the study was}} to determine if the three atmospheric reanalyses provide an accurate depiction of seasonal precipitation patterns. Spatial variability, recent trends, and anomalies in Arctic precipitation were investigated. The second objective was to conduct a statistical validation of each of the reanalysis products through a comparison with monthly GHCN station observations. Monthly precipitation fields were investigated for the period spanning January 1979 - December 2010. Overall, MERRA, CFSR, and ERA-Interim captured the known average monthly precipitation patterns across the Arctic. One notable discrepancy with ERA-Interim 2 ̆ 7 s precipitation field exists across the northern North Atlantic and is further investigated using nearby coastal station data. Station observations were then used to validate the reanalyses across the entire <b>Arctic.</b> Bias, correlations, <b>root</b> mean-squared error were calculated. The largest inconsistency between the reanalyses and the station observations exists in summer; smaller biases and errors exist in winter. However, associated model errors and biases are found to be related to the number of observations utilized. The ability to pinpoint the best reanalysis for use in Arctic hydrologic studies lies in further investigation of the precipitation assimilation process in each reanalysis as well as an improvement in the accuracy of gauge measurements...|$|R
40|$|The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala {{is one of}} the hardiest {{and most}} {{abundant}} of all woody plant groups in alpine and arctic environments. The main aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the fungal communities associated with D. octopetala roots along a latitudinal gradient from Southern Norway to the high <b>Arctic</b> (Svalbard). Twenty-six <b>root</b> systems were sampled at five main localities (13 sub-localities) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplified from DNA extracts from pooled root samples using fungal specific primers. Twenty-four cloned ITS fragments were obtained from each root system and the taxonomic affinity of the sequences were analyzed by DNA homology searches against UNITE and GenBank, as well as own reference sequences obtained from collected basidiocarps. A total of 138 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were detected, 76 belonging to Basidiomycota, 59 to Ascomycota, two to Zygomycota, and one to Glomeromycota, demonstrating that an ecologically and phylogenetically diverse array of fungi is associated with the roots of D. octopetala. The most frequently detected taxonomic order was Agaricales, followed by Thelephorales, Cantharellales and Helotiales. The majority of the environmental sequences had taxonomic affinity to well-known ECM genera such as Hebeloma, Cortinarius, Tomentella, and Inocybe. Most of the environmental sequences with affinity to ascomycetes represented ECM, such as Cenoccoccum geophilum and Cadophora finladia, or endophytic fungi including dark septate endophyes (DSE) such as Phialocephala fortinii. These taxa were widespread and found in all but the southernmost main locality. Non-asymptotic species accumulation curves and the occurrence of a high number of singletons indicate that only a small fraction of the fungal diversity was detected. The spatial heterogeneity in the fungal communities associated with D. octopetala was high, both within and between sub-localities and between main localities, but a slight geographic structuring of the composition of OTUs in the root systems was observed. There was no decrease in fungal diversity with increasing latitude, which contrasts observations made in a wide spectrum of other organism groups...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEctomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) form symbioses {{with a few}} {{plant species}} that {{comprise}} a large fraction of the arctic vegetation. Despite their importance, the identity, abundance and distribution of EMF in the Arctic, {{as well as the}} key drivers controlling their community composition are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the diversity and structure of EMF communities across a bioclimatic gradient spanning much of the North American <b>Arctic.</b> We collected <b>roots</b> from two principal arctic ectomycorrhizal host plants, Salix arctica and Dryas integrifolia, typically growing intermingled, at 23 locations stratified across the five bioclimatic subzones of the Arctic. DNA was extracted from ectomycorrhizal root tips and the ITS region was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. A total of 242 fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were documented, with 203 OTUs belonging to the Basidiomycota and 39 to the Ascomycota, exceeding the number of previously morphologically described EMF in the Arctic. EMF communities were dominated by a few common and species-rich families such as Thelephoraceae, Inocybaceae, Sebacinaceae, Cortinariaceae, and Pyronemataceae. Both host plants showed similar species richness, with 176 OTUs on Salix arctica and 154 OTUs on Dryas integrifolia. Host plant identity did not affect EMF community composition. The ten most abundant OTUs had a wide geographic distribution throughout the Arctic, and were also found in boreal, temperate and Mediterranean regions, where they were associated with a variety of hosts. Species richness did not decline with increasing latitude. However, EMF community structure changed gradually across the bioclimatic gradient with the greatest similarity between neighboring bioclimatic subzones and locations. EMF community structure was correlated with environmental factors at a regional scale, corresponding to a complex of glaciation history, geology, soil properties, plant productivity and climate. This is the first large-scale study of EMF communities across all five bioclimatic subzones of the North American Arctic, accompanied by an extensive set of environmental factors analyzed to date. While our study provides baseline data to assess shifts of plant and fungi distribution in response to climate change, it also suggests that with ongoing climate warming, EMF community composition may be affected by northward shifts of some taxa...|$|R
