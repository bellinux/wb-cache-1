60|$|Philammon was aroused {{from his}} slumbers at sunrise {{the next morning}} by the attendants who came in to sweep out the lecture-rooms, and wandered, disconsolately enough, {{up and down the}} street; longing for, and yet dreading, the three weary hours to be over which must pass before he would be {{admitted}} to Hypatia. But he had tasted no food since noon the day before: he had but three hours' sleep the previous night, and had been working, running, and fighting for two whole days without a moment's peace of body or mind. Sick with hunger and fatigue, and aching from head to foot with his hard night's rest on the granite-flags, he felt as unable as man could well do to collect his thoughts or brace his nerves for the coming interview. How to get food he could not guess; but having two hands, he might at least earn a coin by carrying a load; so he went down to the Esplanade in search of work. Of that, alas! there was none. So he sat down upon the parapet of the quay, and watched the shoals of sardines which played in and out over the marble steps below, and wondered at the strange crabs and sea-locusts which crawled up and down the face of the masonry, a few feet below the surface, scrambling for bits of offal, and making occasional fruitless dashes at the nimble little silver arrows which played round them. And at last his whole soul, too tired to think of anything else, became absorbed in a mighty struggle between two great crabs, who held on stoutly, each by a claw, to his respective bunch of seaweed, while with the others they tugged, one at the head and the other at the tail of a dead fish. Which would conquer?.... <b>Ay,</b> <b>which?</b> And for five minutes Philammon was alone in the world with the two struggling heroes.... Might not they be emblematic? Might not the upper one typify Cyril?--the lower one Hypatia?--and the dead fish between, himself?.... But at last the deadlock was suddenly ended--the fish parted in the middle; and the typical Hypatia and Cyril, losing hold of their respective seaweeds by the jerk, tumbled down, each with its half-fish, and vanished head over heels into the blue depths in so undignified a manner, that Philammon burst into a shout of laughter.|$|E

40|$|Disposal {{of plant}} biomass removed from heavy metal {{contaminated}} land via gasification achieves significant volume reduction and can recover energy. However, these biomass often contain {{high concentrations of}} heavy metals leading to hot-corrosion of gasification facilities and toxic gaseous emissions. Therefore, it is of significant interest to gain a further understanding of the solid-gas phase transition of metal(loid) s during gasification. Detailed elemental analyses (C, H, O, N and key metal/metalloid elements) were performed on five plant species collected from a contaminated site. Using multi-phase equilibria modelling software (MTDATA), the analytical data allows modelling of the solid/gas transformation of metal(loid) s during gasification. Thermodynamic modelling based on chemical equilibrium calculations {{was carried out in}} this study to pi-edict the fate of metal(loid) elements during typical gasification conditions and to show how these are influenced by metal(loid) composition in the biomass and operational conditions.

DBA/ 2 J mice homozygous for the reverse mutation to wild type at the dilute locus (d+ 2 J) lack ecotropic virus-specific sequences, suggesting that the dilute mutation was caused by virus integration. In the experiments described here, we analyzed the ecotropic MuLV DNA content of mice that collectively carry 10 different alleles at the agouti coat color locus (of chromosome 2) to determine whether any of these alleles also are associated with ecotropic virus sequences.

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the effect of}} measuring randomly varying local hydraulic conductivities K(x) on one's ability to predict deterministically, without upscaling, steady state flow in bounded domains driven by random source and boundary terms. Our aim is to allow optimum unbiased prediction of hydraulic heads h(x) and Darcy fluxes q(x) by means of their ensemble moments,, and c, conditioned on measurements of K(x). It has been shown earlier that these predictors satisfy a deterministic flow equation which contains an integro-differential "residual flux" term. This term renders c nonlocal and non-Darcian so {{that the concept of}} effective hydraulic conductivity looses meaning in all but a few special cases. Instead, the residual flux contains kernels which constitute nonlocal parameters that are conditional on hydraulic conductivity data and therefore nonunique. The kernels include symmetric and nonsymmetric second -rank tensors as well as vectors. We derive exact integro-differential equations for second conditional moments of head and flux which constitute measures of predictive uncertainty. We then develop recursive closure approximations for the moment equations through expansion in powers of a small parameter <b>ay</b> <b>which</b> represents the standard estimation error of In K(x). Finally, we solve these nonlocal equations to first order in a by finite elements on a rectangular grid in two dimensions. We also solve the original stochastic flow equations by conditional Monte Carlo simulation using finite elements on the same grid. Upon comparing our nonlocal finite element and conditional Monte Carlo results we find that the former are highly accurate, under either mean uniform or convergent flows, for both mildly and strongly heterogeneous media with a as large as 4 - 5 and spatial correlation scales as large as the length of the domain. Since conditional mean quantities are smooth relative to their random counterparts our method allows, in principle, resolving them on relatively coarse grids without upscaling. We also examine the quc on under what conditions can the residual flux be localized so as to render it approximately Darcian. One way to achieve such localization is to treat ' "draulic conductivity as if it was locally homogeneous and mean flow as if it was locally uniform. This renders the flux predictor Darcian according to c _ - Kc(x) c where Kc(x) is a conditional hydraulic conductivity tensor which depends on measurements of K(x) and is therefore a nonunique function of space. This function can be estimated by means of either stochastically- derived analytical formulae or standard inverse methods (in which case localization coincides with common groundwater modeling practice). We use the first approach and solve the corresponding localized conditional mean equation by finite elements on the same grid as before. Here the conditional hydraulic conductivity is given by the geometric mean KG(x). Upon comparing our localized finite element solution with a nonlocal finite element solution and conditional Monte Carlo results, we find that the first is generally less accurate than the second. The accuracy of the localized solution deteriorates rel tive to that of the nonlocal solution as one approaches points of conditioning and singularity, or as the variance and correla': ^n scale of the log hydraulic conductivity increase. Contrary to the nonlocal solution, locàlzation does not yield information about predictive uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Methods for {{predicting}} the transverse mixing coefficient, Ez in rivers based solely upon estimates or {{measurements of the}} channel geometry, channel slope and flow parameters are not completely reliable. Therefore, it is generally necessary to perform field tracer tests {{in order to determine}} Ez for a particular river reach at a given stage and flow. Characterizations of the transverse mixing in the Athabasca River downstream of a pulp mill located near Boyle, Alberta are described herein. The characterization of the mixing is based upon analysis of four tracer tests conducted on the river (three continuous input tests and one slug test). The tracer tests were conducted on different dates and cover a range of flow conditions (October 1994, 270 m 3 /s; February 1995, 84 m 3 /s, and August 1997, 960 m 3 /s and 876 m 3 /s). The February test was conducted under ice-covered conditions. Beak Consultants Ltd. conducted the October 1994 and February 1995 tests. The tracer input for each field test consisted of injection of Rhodamine WT fluorescent dye at the mill outfall location. In the continuous input tests, the tracer was injected into the mill effluent stream at a constant rate and entered the river via the effluent diffuser structure. The diffuser is 52 m long, oriented perpendicular to the flow, and located close to the left bank of the river. In the slug input, test a known mass of tracer was instantaneously dumped directly into the river at approximately the mid-point {{along the length of the}} diffuser. For each test the dye plume was sampled across transects oriented perpendicular to the river flow at a number of downstream locations stretching over a 32 -km reach of the river. Hydrographic surveys were conducted at each sampled transect and at several other transects to determine channel geometry and flow parameters. The hydrographic survey information and the tracer input conditions were required for numerical modelling of the mixing in the river reach. The implementation of the two-dimensional river mixing modelling procedure used in the present study was written by Putz (1996), based upon the descriptions given by Beltaos and Arora (1988). The numerical model utilizes a streamtube approach and a numerical procedure employing an advection optimized grid to limit numerical errors. The model is capable of simulating continuous input and unsteady input conditions. The modelling package includes two preprocessing programs for generating the calculation grid based upon channel characteristics, a two-dimensional, transient mass input mixing program, and a post-processing program for output of data at selected locations. The transverse mixing coefficient was determined for each field test using the model fit of predicted tracer concentrations compared to the concentration of the samples collected in the field. The mixing simulations provide a very good representation of the measured concentration distributions. The four field verification studies demonstrate that the Advection Optimized Grid method can be applied to two-dimensional, steady and unsteady source mixing problems in natural streams satisfactorily. Nondimensionalized transverse mixing coefficients determined from the modelling procedure are compared to the range of values reported in other locations. These comparisons show that the values of <b>ÃŸ</b> <b>which</b> characterize the transverse mixing in the reach of the Athabasca River studied fall well within the range of reported ÃŸ values from other studies. Reach-averaged dimensionless mixing coefficient, ÃŸ, is fairly consistent (in the range of 0. 34 to 0. 48) for the range of flow conditions represented by the four tests. The overall weighted average of ÃŸ for the different ranges of flow was found to be 0. 41. The results demonstrate that the dimensionless mixing coefficient measured at one flow condition may be used with the appropriate flow parameters to estimate mixing for other flow conditions for the same reach. The results of the modelling procedure are also used to assess the variation in mixing with discharge and due to the presence of an ice cover...|$|E

Skeletal muscle from mice with muscular dysgenesis lacks both E-C coupling and/ca.,. However, dysgenic skeletal muscle does express a small DHP-sensitive calcium current (termed Ica. <b>ays)</b> <b>which</b> is kinetically and pharmacologically distinct from /Ca-, " We have examined the ability of Ica. a,, or the DHP receptor underlying it, to couple depolarization and contraction. Under most conditions Ica_a, is small (~ 1 pA/pF) and dysgenic myotubes do not contract in response to sarcolemmal depolarization. However, in the combined presence of the DHP agonist Bay K 8644 (1 0. M) and elevated external calcium (10 mM), Ica~y, is strongly potentiated and some dysgenic myotubes contract in response to direct electrical stimulation. These contractions are blocked by removing external calcium, by adding 0. 5 mM cadmium to the bath, or by replacing Bay K 8644 with the DHP antagonist (+) -PN 200 - 110. Only myotubes having a density of Ica-dys greater than ~ 4 pA/pF produce detectible contractions, {{and the strength of}} contraction is positively correlated with the density of Ic~-dy~, Thus, unlike the contractions of normal myotubes, the contractions of dysgenic myotubes require calcium entry.
