Here we use ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV-STM) and density functional theory to identify the precise structure of hydrogenated single atomic vacancies in a topmost graphene layer of graphite and establish {{a connection between the}} details of hydrogen passivation and the electronic properties of a single <b>atomic</b> <b>vacancy.</b> Monovacancy-hydrogen complexes are prepared by sputtering of the graphite surface layer with low energy ions and then exposing it briefly to an atomic hydrogen environment. High-resolution experimental UHV-STM imaging allows us to determine unambiguously the positions of single missing atoms in the defective graphene lattice and, in combination with the ab initio calculations, provides detailed information about the distribution of low-energy electronic states {{on the periphery of the}} monovacancy-hydrogen complexes. We found that a single <b>atomic</b> <b>vacancy</b> where each sigma-dangling bond is passivated with one hydrogen atom shows a well-defined signal from the non-bonding pi-state which penetrates into the bulk with a (\sqrt 3 \times \sqrt 3) R 30 ^ \circ periodicity. However, a single <b>atomic</b> <b>vacancy</b> with full hydrogen termination of sigma-dangling bonds and additional hydrogen passivation of the extended pi-state at one of the vacancy's monohydrogenated carbon atoms is characterized by complete quenching of low-energy localized states.

40|$|Lattice {{disorder}} due to <b>atomic</b> <b>vacancies</b> has detrimental {{impact on}} the transport properties of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs; MX 2). We theoretically study the effect of Mo and S vacancies on carrier scattering and transport in p- and n-type monolayer MoS 2 based on an atomistic first-principles description of atomic disorder. Due {{to the presence of}} vacancy midgap states, the vacancies are shown to act as combined short-range and Coulomb disorder scattering centers. For the short-range scattering potential typical for atomic point defects, we surprisingly find that the threefold rotational symmetry of the vacancy sites, in most cases, leads to a strong protection against intervally scattering. In addition, we find that Mo and S vacancies resemble, respectively, strong and weak short-range disorder. The dual character of the vacancies results in a nontrivial interplay between short-range and Coulomb disorder scattering and a pronounced screening-induced temperature and density dependence of the low-temperature carrier mobility. Our work identifies <b>atomic</b> <b>vacancies</b> as the likely source of both short-range and Coulomb disorder in monolayer TMDs, and presents a unified microscopic framework where these scattering mechanisms can be treated consistently.

40|$|Quantum thermal {{transport}} in armchair and zig-zag graphene nanoribbons are {{investigated in}} the presence of single <b>atomic</b> <b>vacancies</b> and subject to different boundary conditions. We start with a full comparison of the phonon polarizations and energy dispersions as given by a fifth-nearest-neighbor force-constant model (5 NNFCM) and by elasticity theory of continuum membranes (ETCM). For free-edges ribbons we discuss the behavior of an additional acoustic edge-localized flexural mode, known as fourth acoustic branch (4 ZA), which has a small gap when it is obtained by the 5 NNFCM. Then, we show that ribbons with supported-edges have a sample-size dependent energy gap in the phonon spectrum which is particularly large for in-plane modes. Irrespective to the calculation method and the boundary condition, the dependence of the energy gap for the low-energy optical phonon modes against the ribbon width W is found to be proportional to 1 /W for in-plane, and 1 /W$^ 2 $ for out-of-plane phonon modes. Using the 5 NNFCM, the ballistic thermal conductance and its contributions from every single phonon mode are then obtained by the non equilibrium Green's function technique. We found that, while edge and central localized single <b>atomic</b> <b>vacancies</b> do not affect the low-energy transmission function of in-plane phonon modes, they reduce considerably the contributions of the flexural modes. On the other hand, in-plane modes contributions are strongly dependent on the boundary conditions and at low temperatures can be highly reduced in supported-edges samples.
