METHODS: The study randomly selected 460 insured patients with hypertension and investigated their cost on each case in the out-patient department through 2002, based on the electronic system of medical insurance. RESULTS: As a whole, the distribution of hypertensive outpatient expenditure takes on the positively skewed, with the median of 1 567. 9 Yuan RMB. With the increase of age, the <b>average</b> <b>expenses</b> in each age group increased accordingly. In the study, the average number of outpatient attendances per patient was 19. 5, the <b>average</b> <b>expenses</b> per visit was 115. 4 Yuan RMB. In age groups 40 - 49 and 50 - 59, expenses of outpatient in male and female groups are obviously different in 2002 (Wilcoxon W(40 - 49) = 36, P(40 - 49) = 0. 037; Wilcoxon W(50 - 59) = 374, P(50 - 59) = 0. 023), as well as the number of out-patients (Wilcoxon W(40 - 49) = 52. 5, P(40 - 49) = 0. 007; Wilcoxon W(50 - 59) = 379, P(50 - 59) = 0. 028). When considering the factors of gender and age at one time, the outpatient expenditures in the male group were significantly different between the different age groups (chi(2) = 22. 3, P < 0. 001), as well as the number of outpatients (chi(2) = 25. 4, P < 0. 001). In addition, the expenditure of drugs, which took {{a large proportion of the}} total expenditure of hypertensive outpatients (about 83. 6 percent), was divided into three parts according to the degree of correlation with hypertension: direct expenses related to the with disease, the indirect expenses and the irrespective. The proportions of each part were 19. 9 percent, 32. 3 percent and 47. 8 percent respectively. CONCLUSION: When economic evaluation of community prevention is carried out, the cost and cost-benefit analysis based on the analysis of outpatient expenditure and the proportion of expenses on hypertension should be taken into account.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the frequency of}} catastrophic expenditures for emergency obstetric care, explore its risk factors, and assess {{the effect of these}} expenditures on households in the Kayes region, Mali. Methods Data on 484 obstetric emergencies (242 deaths and 242 near-misses) were collected in 2008 - 2011. Catastrophic expenditure for emergency obstetric care was assessed at different thresholds and its associated factors were explored through logistic regression. A survey was subsequently administered in a nested sample of 56 households to determine how the catastrophic expenditure had affected them. Findings Despite the fee exemption policy for Caesareans and the maternity referral-system, designed to reduce the financial burden of emergency obstetric care, <b>average</b> <b>expenses</b> were 152 United States dollars (equivalent to 71 535 Communaute Financiere Africaine francs) and 20. 7 to 53. 5 % of households incurred catastrophic expenditures. High expenditure for emergency obstetric care forced 44. 6 % of the households to reduce their food consumption and 23. 2 % were still indebted 10 months to {{two and a half years}} later. Living in remote rural areas was associated with the risk of catastrophic spending, which shows the referral system's inability to eliminate financial obstacles for remote households. Women who underwent Caesareans continued to incur catastrophic expenses, especially when prescribed drugs not included in the government-provided Caesarean kits. Conclusion The poor accessibility and affordability of emergency obstetric care has consequences beyond maternal deaths.
