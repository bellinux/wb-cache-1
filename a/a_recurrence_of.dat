5|$|In December 1891, May {{was engaged}} to her second cousin once removed, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The choice of May as bride for the Duke owed much to Queen Victoria's fondness for her, {{as well as to}} her strong {{character}} and sense of duty. However, Albert Victor died six weeks later, in <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> the worldwide 1889–90 influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2013, {{after more}} than a year of {{testimony}} and over 12,000 pages of evidence, the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations, and requested they come back with a verdict in Smith's death and recommendations on means to prevent <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> such an event.|$|E

Flinkkilä reports <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> rate <b>of</b> instability of 19  % (9  % from redislocation and 10  % from subluxation) and a revision surgery rate of 10  % [9], while Voos noted <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> rate <b>of</b> 18  % (10  % from redislocation and 8  % from subluxation) and a revision surgery rate of 6  % [10].|$|R
5|$|Campbell {{made his}} return to {{training}} in March 2011. Despite having seemingly recovered from the injury, Campbell suffered <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> the ligament injury in the same knee {{in preparation for a}} match against Manchester City on 3 April 2011. After undergoing surgery on 20 April 2011, it was learned that Campbell would be out of action for 12 months. This injury ruled Campbell out of action {{for the remainder of the}} 2010–11 season and much of the 2011–12 season. Though he was proposed to return in March 2012, Steve Bruce revealed that Campbell was in the frame to return to action around Christmas time – three months ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer in 1992. After a successful operation to remove a tumor and part of his lung, he began chemotherapy a few months later, when a routine exam revealed <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> the cancer. Despite his health problems, he remained a hard worker until the end, and even went hunting in Tanzania only four days after having part of his lung removed. An experimental procedure failed to stop the cancer, and he died on August 25, 1994, at the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans. He was survived by wife Joy, daughter Gay, and son Hugh, Jr.|$|E

5|$|Fahey {{returned}} to the team in mid-September, and made seven appearances, four of which were starts. In November, he returned home to Ireland on indefinite compassionate leave for personal and family reasons. After two months away, Fahey took part in pre-season training with Shamrock Rovers, ahead of a full fitness assessment which preceded his return to training with Birmingham in mid-February. However, Fahey was ruled out {{for the rest of}} the season in April with <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> a hip problem, having played just twice since his return from compassionate leave. At the end of the season, Fahey announced he was leaving Birmingham as the club had decided not to take up their option to extend his contract.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 the Prison Commissioners {{agreed to}} declare Clifford's Tower a {{national}} monument and to conserve it as a historic location. In 1902 Clifford's Tower {{was given to}} the York Corporation, together with a grant of £3,000 (£242,000 at 2009 prices) arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs. The removal of the talus and the damage to the castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte, causing <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> the 14th century subsidence. Sir Basil Mott, a leading Victorian engineer, installed concrete underpinnings to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse. By the early 20th century, Clifford's Tower was regularly open to visitors, and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, as McClellan planned an assault, {{his army}} was {{surprised}} by a Confederate attack. Johnston saw that the Union army was split in half by the rain-swollen Chickahominy River and hoped to defeat it in detail at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks. McClellan was unable to command the army personally because of <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> malarial fever, but his subordinates were able to repel the attacks. Nevertheless, McClellan received criticism from Washington for not counterattacking, which some believed could have opened the city of Richmond to capture. Johnston {{was wounded in the}} battle, and General Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. McClellan spent the next three weeks repositioning his troops and waiting for promised reinforcements, losing valuable time as Lee continued to strengthen Richmond's defenses.|$|E

5|$|On May19, 2002, Rivera {{recorded}} his 225th career save, surpassing Dave Righetti as the Yankees' franchise leader in saves. Over {{the next few}} months of the season, injuries limited his playing time. He was first placed on the disabled list in June due to a groin strain, though his first-half numbers, which included a 1.47ERA and 21saves, earned him an All-Star selection. In a game on July14, Rivera endured one of his worst outings, allowing six earned runs, including a walk-off grand slam. One week later, he was placed on the disabled list with a shoulder strain. Rivera was activated on August8 after receiving a cortisone shot but returned to the disabled list after <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> shoulder tightness. For the season, Rivera recorded a 2.74ERA and 28saves in 32opportunities in just 46innings pitched.|$|E

She quit the sport after being told that neither insurance nor the Australian Paralympic Committee would cover her against injury during a tour in the United States, as her tendonitis was considered a there, and she would have to pay the costs for injury treatment herself. She quit wheelchair basketball. She had a child, which caused <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> her original illness.|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{progressed to}} {{the second round of}} the {{competition}} after Trinidad and Tobago beat Deccan in the final group match, but lost Trescothick, who flew home after <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> his illness. Wes Durston, who replaced Trescothick in the side, top-scored for Somerset in their next match, making 57. Only two other players reached double-figures for the county, and the Diamond Eagles chased down the total with eight balls to spare. Somerset went into their final match, against the New South Wales Blues with a slim mathematical chance of progressing, but a strong bowling display from Brett Lee and Stuart Clark restricted Somerset to 111, which the Australian side reached with ease.|$|E

5|$|With {{his health}} in serious decline, the British Legion {{arranged}} for O'Leary {{to return to}} Britain and work in their poppy factory. By 1932, O'Leary was living in Southborne Avenue in Colindale, had regained his health and found employment as a commissionaire at The May Fair in London, at which {{he was involved in}} charitable events for wounded servicemen. With the mobilisation of the British Army in 1939, O'Leary returned to military service as a captain in the Middlesex Regiment. O'Leary was sent to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force but had returned to Britain before the Battle of France due to <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> his malaria.|$|E
5|$|A {{product of}} Manchester United's youth academy, Campbell progressed to their first-team in the 2006–07 season. He made four {{appearances}} without scoring in his {{tenure at the}} club. He had a loan spell at Belgian club Royal Antwerp, where he scored 24 goals in 38 appearances. He also had loan periods with Hull City and Tottenham Hotspur, where he scored 15 goals in 37 matches and three goals in 22 appearances respectively. He signed for Sunderland {{at the beginning of}} the 2009–10 season for £3.5million. His involvement at Sunderland was limited due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury he sustained in his second season at the club, as well as <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> the same problem later in the season. He moved to Cardiff in January 2013 on a three-and-a-half-year deal, and then Crystal Palace 18 months later.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> {{the effects}} of his injury in 1924 {{restricted}} Gilligan's cricket in 1925. Appearing in fewer games and bowling far less frequently than in previous seasons, he scored 542 runs at 15.05 and took only eight wickets. He bowled {{in the first four}} games of the season, but in his remaining seventeen appearances played only as a batsman. In 1926, he was more successful and his performances helped Sussex to rise from thirteenth to tenth in the County Championship. Playing more games, he scored 1,037 runs at 30.50, the highest seasonal batting average of his career, and took 75 wickets at 20.74. That season, although no longer considered for a place in the England team himself, Gilligan joined the panel of Test selectors, and as a consequence missed some cricket for Sussex. He published a book on that summer's tour by Australia called Collins's Men.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{made his}} West Ham {{breakthrough}} in the 2000–01 season, playing 41 games in all competitions, which included 33 games in the league. His only goal of the season came in a 1–1 home draw against Aston Villa on 9 December 2000. Carrick was awarded a new, improved contract for his progress that would keep him at Upton Park until 2005. On 20 April 2001, he was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year alongside teammate Joe Cole. The award was eventually won by Liverpool's midfielder Steven Gerrard on 29 April. For the second successive season Carrick was voted as West Ham's Young Player of the Year. The 2001–02 season saw Carrick make 32 appearances for the Hammers. Carrick scored twice during this season, his first was West Ham's only goal in a 7–1 loss at Blackburn Rovers on 14 October. He scored the first goal in a 2–1 victory over rivals Chelsea ten days later. Towards {{the end of the}} season, Carrick suffered <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> a groin injury that ruled him out of the 2002 FIFA World Cup for the England squad.|$|E
5|$|Coulson {{returned}} to training in early November before making {{his return to}} action later that month, scoring in a reserve-team match against Grimsby Town. His first-team return came on 22 November 2008 after entering Barnsley's 2–1 defeat away to Preston North End as an 90th-minute substitute. However, <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> his knee injury in January 2009 ruled him out of action {{for the rest of}} 2008–09, which he finished with three appearances. On 16 October 2009, Coulson signed a one-month loan deal with Conference Premier club Chester City, making his debut on 17 October 2009 against Gateshead in a 1–0 home victory. He scored his first goal for Chester on 7 November 2009 in a 3–1 away win over Grays Athletic. After Chester failed in an attempt to extend his loan he {{returned to}} Barnsley in November 2009, having scored one goal from five appearances. However, these were later removed from the records after Chester were expelled from the Football Conference the following February {{as a result of the}} club breaching five league rules.|$|E

40|$|The UKG of the Netherlands {{uses the}} lateral {{approach}} as intervention for otitis media polypus in cats. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the <b>recurrence</b> rates <b>of</b> this operation technique and compare the results with the traction/video-otoscopic method and the ventral bulla osteotomy. The traction method has <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> rate <b>of</b> 30 - 50 %. The ventral bulla osteotomy has <b>a</b> <b>recurrence</b> rate <b>of</b> 0 - 8 %. In this study patients which were operated with the lateral approach were tracked down and data was collected to calculate the recurrence rate. This was based on the <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> polyp growth after the lateral approach was used. Also the time in which the polyp reoccurred was measured after the first surgery. Definition <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> is regrowth <b>of</b> the polyp in the same ear. In 14 / 62 cats (22. 6 %) <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> polyp growth occurred, with <b>a</b> mean <b>recurrence</b> time <b>of</b> 55 weeks after the first surgery. There were no significant differences between males and females. This is a lesser rate compared with the traction method. Because the ventral bulla osteotomy (VBO) is a more invasive method, the lateral approach is a good alternative intervention and should be considered as first choice treatment...|$|R
