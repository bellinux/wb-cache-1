5|$|Weber also {{proposed}} a socioevolutionary model of religious change, showing that in general, societies {{have moved from}} magic to polytheism, then to pantheism, monotheism and finally, ethical monotheism. According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed professionalisation {{and the evolution of}} ever more sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular <b>and</b> <b>desirable.</b>|$|E

So In this study, perspective of Total Coliforms, fecal coliforms and residual chlorine water quality of 17 indoor pools of Kermanshah city were studied. Methods: This is a descriptive - analytical study. In this study, a total of 12 months a year for three consecutive years, indoor pool, and 17 water qualities in Kermanshah with the sample of 618 Total Coli forms, fecal coliforms, and residual chlorine were studied. All the samples and tests were performed according to standard methods of testing water and wastewater treatment. Results: showed that the most <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> undesirable the water quality perspective of chlorine residual, is depend to (C and L) and (P and I) pools, respectively. Most <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> undesirable the quality perspective of fecal Coli forms, is depend to (C and I) and (G and H) pools. Of residual chlorine, April <b>and</b> May least <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> October and November were most <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> of fecal Coli forms, August <b>and</b> September least <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> December and February were dedicated to the most desirability. Consider the desirability of water quality in pools {{of residual}} chlorine and fecal Coli forms from 2009 to 2011 has been an upward trend & of the seasons, spring and summer were least <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> most <b>desirable</b> to due to the fall and winter. From both the residual chlorine and fecal Coli forms, pools merely masculine more desirable, feminine, {{it just kind of}} the least <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> feminine - masculine, borderline case, had the two types mentioned above. Conclusion: Consider the Environmental health officers inspection & oversight the regulatory and monitoring water quality in pools, shows the positive impact on upgrade the water quality during 2009 to 2010. From the results, although the pools of water quality parameters has been studied in almost ideal But in summer, especially on a female pools and pools with wells water supply source than other pools, to be more oversight...|$|R
