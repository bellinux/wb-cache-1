5|$|The {{first known}} {{population}}, at Wangelling Gully Nature Reserve in Tarwonga. This population <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> decline: in 1988 {{it was estimated}} as containing from 500 to 800 plants, but a 2001 survey found only 198 adults, 1 seedling, and 286 dead plants; and a 2004 survey found 135 adults, no seedlings, and 174 dead plants.|$|E
5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} yellowhammer to be from 54–93million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73–186million birds. Although the population <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge breeding range of about 12.9million km2 (5million sq mi), mean that this bunting is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E

5|$|After the Myst series' success, various {{proposals}} for films and television series {{based on the}} franchise were planned or rumored. The Sci Fi Channel announced in 2002 that a TV miniseries would be produced based on Myst, to be produced by Mandalay Television Pictures in association with Columbia TriStar Domestic Television and Cyan, but never materialized. According to Rand Miller, none of the various proposals met Cyan's approval, or were too formulaic or silly. Independent filmmakers Patrick McIntire and Adrian Vanderbosch, themselves Myst fans, took {{it upon themselves to}} produce a motion picture based on the story revealed in the Myst novels. In 2006, the filmmakers sent a DVD proposal to Cyan. The developers gave the filmmakers permission to begin production. The film was set {{to be based on the}} novel Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, but no longer <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> error for the period from 1979 to 1983, {{but in fact it}} is given correctly in the table. Note also that vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, as it seems to be from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000 BC, the Maya spoke {{a single}} language, dubbed proto-Mayan by linguists. Linguistic {{analysis}} of reconstructed Proto-Mayan vocabulary {{suggests that the}} original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive. Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups {{that make up the}} family, including Huastecan, Greater K'iche'an, Greater Q'anjobalan, Mamean, Tz'eltalan-Ch'olan, and Yucatecan. These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times. The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as Ch'olan; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, also <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in,</b> or related to, Ch'olan. The use of Ch'olan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to Medieval Latin as a ritual or prestige language. Classic Ch'olan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade. By the Postclassic period, Yucatec was also being written in Maya codices alongside Ch'olan.|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, {{the black}} stork has been rated {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range—more than 20,000km2(7,700mi2)—and because its {{population}} is thought not to have declined by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not a rapid enough decline to warrant a vulnerable rating. Even so, the state of the population overall is unclear, and although it is widespread, it is not abundant anywhere. Black stork numbers have declined for many years in western Europe, and the species has already been extirpated from Scandinavia. The population in India—a major wintering ground—is declining. Previously a regular winter visitor to the Mai Po Marshes, it is now seldom seen there, and <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> decline in China overall. Its habitat is changing rapidly in much of eastern Europe and Asia. Various conservation measures have been taken, including Wetlands International's Conservation Action Plan for African black storks, which focuses on improving the wintering conditions of the birds which breed in Europe. It is protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).|$|E

25|$|The {{function}} of miRNAs <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> gene regulation. For that purpose, a miRNA is complementary to {{a part of}} one or more messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Animal miRNAs are usually complementary to a site in the 3' UTR whereas plant miRNAs are usually complementary to coding regions of mRNAs. Perfect or near perfect base pairing with the target RNA promotes cleavage of the RNA. This is the primary mode of plant miRNAs. In animals the match-ups are imperfect.|$|E

25|$|Sulfur and {{chlorine}} may {{be derived}} from the crust, evaporites such as these found at Salar de Atacama, subducted lithosphere or the mantle.

25|$|Also, the time-symmetric {{interpretation}} of the electromagnetic waves <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> contrast with the experimental evidence that time flows in a given direction and, thus, that the T-symmetry is broken in our world. It is commonly believed, however, that this symmetry breaking appears only in the thermodynamical limit (see, for example, the arrow of time). Wheeler himself accepted that {{the expansion of the}} universe is not time-symmetric in the thermodynamic limit. This, however, does not imply that the T-symmetry must be broken also at the microscopic level.|$|E
