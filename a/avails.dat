500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the Imperial Review in November 1805 stated, [...] "something should {{be said of the}} language. This undoubtedly is not its chief excellence. The style, in many places, is trailing, flat, and uninteresting,—deficient both in strength and animation. The author seldoms <b>avails</b> himself of any artificial ornaments [...] Though we feel ourselves compelled to make these observations, it is hardly necessary to add, that upon the whole we think very highly of this performance." [...] The review continues by comparing Madoc to Paradise Lost: [...] "were the style adorned by a little artificial colouring, and enriched with all the allowable decorations of poetry, Madoc would hardly yield to Paradise Lost. As it stands, it is certainly the second heroic production in the English language. Its leading characteristics are not fire and sublimity, but tenderness and humanity. Milton astonishes the head—Southey touches the heart. The first we may admire—the last we can love." ...|$|E

500|$|HBO {{reportedly}} {{invested in}} Carnivàle promotion {{as much as}} for any of its primetime series launches. The series' unconventional and complex narrative made the network deviate from its traditional marketing strategies. Teaser trailers were inserted on CD-ROMs into Entertainment Weekly issues {{to draw attention to}} the show's visual quality. 30-second TV spots were aired in national syndication, cable and local <b>avails</b> for four weeks before the show's premiere instead of the usual seven days. The historical context of Carnivàle was deliberately emphasized in the show's print art, which depicted the 17-member cast surrounding a carnival truck. This image was accompanied by a tagline of the show's good versus evil theme: [...] "Into each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness." [...] These measures were hoped to be backed up by positive critical reviews. To give ratings an initial boost, HBO placed the premiere of Carnivàle directly after the series finale of the successful Sex and the City. The series continued to receive extensive online advertisement for almost its entire run.|$|E

[...] "We see {{the ebb and flow of}} the feeling, its pauses and feverish starts, its impatience of opposition, its accumulating force when it has had time to recollect itself, the manner in which it <b>avails</b> itself of every passing word or gesture, its haste to repel insinuation, the alternate contraction and dilatation of the soul, and all 'the dazzling fence of controversy' in this mortal combat with poisoned weapons, aimed at the heart, where each wound is fatal." [...] He observes, too, in explaining an instance of what later came to be called comic relief, how when the reader's feelings are strained to the utmost, [...] "just as [...] the fibres of the heart [...] are growing rigid from over-strained excitement [...] he imagination is glad to take refuge in the half-comic, half-serious comments of the Fool, just as the mind under the extreme anguish of a surgical operation vents itself in sallies of wit." ...|$|E

After Castro <b>avails</b> himself of {{the services of a}} prostitute, he rampages around the property searching for Picasso. The storm crashes through the inn. A guest is killed by a billiards table that falls on top of him and is dragged off into the sea. Mr. Glowery is also dragged off into the sea by the storm. Castro and his assistant round up the guests and interrogate them about the location of the $1.5 million Picasso stole. In another part of the inn a fire starts. Finally, Mr. Briscoe shows up and kills Castro's assistant before knocking Castro unconscious. While Hawthorne learns his wife is leaving him for the prostitute, the inn becomes completely engulfed in flames. Picasso, Hawthorne, and Briscoe motor a lobster boat over to the lighthouse, and dump Castro's dead assistant into the sea along with Castro himself, weighed down with two cinder blocks chained to his ankles. When they land on the island, Briscoe runs into the lighthouse and blows himself up. Amongst the rubble of the lighthouse, Picasso notices the inscription [...] "MORTE D'AUTHOR" [...] painted on one of the surrounding rocks and says to the innkeeper [...] "He's been thinking about this for some time, George." ...|$|E

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{application}} with <b>Avail</b> {{may affect}} plant growth and grain yields of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under dryland conditions. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the effects of two P application rates (45 and 90 kg ha - 1) with and without <b>Avail</b> polymer on growth and yields of dryland winter wheat near Blackville, SC from 2010 to 2012. Plant growth measurements included plant biomass, P uptake, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), plant height and grain weight, yield and nutrient uptake. Application of P significantly improved wheat biomass production, plant Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at 8, 10 and 12 weeks after planting and grain yields of winter wheat. Plant biomass production improved with addition of <b>Avail</b> polymer by 6. 3 % at P rate of 45 kg ha - 1 and by 4. 3 % at P rate of 90 kg ha - 1. Additionally, <b>Avail</b> application increased P uptake by 8 % in biomass and improved plant NDVI at high P rates. Compared to untreated control, higher grain yields were obtained from treatments with P application at 90 kg ha - 1 with and without <b>Avail</b> and P rate at 45 kg ha - 1 with <b>Avail</b> application. <b>Avail</b> improved wheat grain yields by 5. 1 % at 45 kg P ha - 1 and 2. 0 % at 90 kg P ha - 1 and increased grain P uptake by 2. 6 % at P rate of 45 kg ha - 1. Based on significant linear regression at 20 weeks after planting, increasing plant NDVI by 0. 1 increased grain yield by 0. 88 Mg ha - 1. Phosphorus and <b>Avail</b> polymer applications did not affect plant height, grain mass and grain nitrogen uptake compared to the untreated control. Results from this study indicate that growth and yields of winter wheat grown may increase with P application and <b>Avail</b> polymer under dryland conditions with insufficient rainfall in Southeastern Coastal Plains...|$|R
500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v. Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the <b>avails</b> of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first heard about this decision, she cried, and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of women who {{want to get out of}} prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially sent to New York State Prison, he {{was sent}} to The Tombs eight months later. Heinrichs soon began exhibiting signs of extreme {{violence}} and paranoia while in prison. On September 24, 1872, he attacked his cellmate Jacob Rosenzweig believing he was spying on him. He reportedly did not recognize his lawyers when they came to visit him. His council successfully appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. As a result of the court's review of his case, a precedent was set in state criminal law that [...] "when a party on trial <b>avails</b> himself of the recent statute allowing an accused to be a witness on his own behalf, he is not disqualified to testify by reason of a former conviction or felony". 19 Nov 1872 On May 7, 1873, officials announced that Heinrichs would be committed to the insane asylum at Wards Island.|$|E
2500|$|When the ovarian follicles {{have reached}} {{a certain degree of}} development, {{induction}} of final oocyte maturation is performed, generally by an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Commonly, this is known as the [...] "trigger shot." [...] hCG acts as an analogue of luteinising hormone, and ovulation would occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection, but the egg retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This <b>avails</b> for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully mature. HCG injection confers a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Using a GnRH agonist instead of hCG eliminates most of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but with a reduced delivery rate if the embryos are transferred fresh. [...] For this reason, many centers will freeze all oocytes or embryos following agonist trigger.|$|E

2500|$|Embryos can {{be either}} “fresh” from fertilized egg cells of the same menstrual cycle, or “frozen”, that is they have been {{generated}} in a preceding cycle and undergone embryo cryopreservation, and are thawed {{just prior to the}} transfer, which is then termed [...] "frozen embryo transfer" [...] (FET). The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities, also between fresh versus frozen eggs used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In fact, pregnancy rates are increased following FET, and perinatal outcomes are less affected, compared to embryo transfer in the same cycle as ovarian hyperstimulation was performed. The endometrium is believed to not be optimally prepared for implantation following ovarian hyperstimulation, and therefore frozen embryo transfer <b>avails</b> for a separate cycle to focus on optimizing the chances of successful implantation. Children born from vitrified blastocysts have significantly higher birthweight than those born from non-frozen blastocysts. When transferring a frozen-thawed oocyte, the chance of pregnancy is essentially the same whether it is transferred in a natural cycle or one with ovulation induction.|$|E
2500|$|This {{geographical}} {{transition is}} accompanied by a change in approach to skyscraper design. For much of the twentieth century large buildings took the form of simple geometrical shapes. This reflected the [...] "international style" [...] or modernist philosophy shaped by Bauhaus architects early in the century. The last of these, the Willis Tower and World Trade Center towers in New York, erected in the 1970s, reflect the philosophy. Tastes shifted in the decade which followed, and new skyscrapers began to exhibit postmodernist influences. This approach to design <b>avails</b> itself of historical elements, often adapted and re-interpreted, in creating technologically modern structures. The Petronas Twin Towers recall Asian pagoda architecture and Islamic geometric principles. Taipei 101 likewise reflects the pagoda tradition as it incorporates ancient motifs such as the ruyi symbol. The Burj Khalifa draws inspiration from traditional Islamic art. Architects in recent years have sought to create structures that would not appear equally at home if set in any part of the world, but that reflect the culture thriving in the spot where they stand.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the use of}} {{lots and}} auguries, they are {{addicted}} beyond all other nations. Their method of divining by lots is exceedingly simple. From a tree which bears fruit they cut a twig, and divide it into two small pieces. These they distinguish by so many several marks, and throw them at random and without order upon a white garment. Then the Priest of the community, if for the public the lots are consulted, or {{the father of a}} family about a private concern, after he has solemnly invoked the Gods, with eyes lifted up to heaven, takes up every piece thrice, and having done thus forms a judgment according to the marks before made. If the chances have proved forbidding, they are no more consulted upon the same affair during the same day: even when they are inviting, yet, for confirmation, the faith of auguries too is tried. Yea, here also is the known practice of divining events from the voices and flight of birds. But to this nation it is peculiar, to learn presages and admonitions divine from horses also. These are nourished by the State in the same sacred woods and groves, all milk-white and employed in no earthly labour. These yoked in the holy chariot, are accompanied by the Priest and the King, or the Chief of the Community, who both carefully observed his actions and neighing. Nor in any sort of augury is more faith and assurance reposed, not by the populace only, but even by the nobles, even by the Priests. These account themselves the ministers of the Gods, and the horses privy to his will. They have likewise another method of divination, whence to learn the issue of great and mighty wars. From the nation with whom they are at war they contrive, it <b>avails</b> not how, to gain a captive: him they engage in combat with one selected from among themselves, each armed after the manner of his country, and according as the victory falls to this or to the other, gather a presage of the whole.|$|E
