500|$|After planting, {{sprouting}} requires <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>place</b> (about 20°C). Bulbs need light watering {{until the}} leaves and buds emerge, {{and need to be}} situated in a well-lit, cool place and watered as needed to maintain moderate soil moisture. [...] Overwatering will cause bulb and root rot. Plants may be fed with common fertilizers that contain iron and magnesium. Blooming takes place about two months after planting. The plant's leaves should continue to grow after the flowers have faded. Summering outdoors in four or five hours of direct sunlight, plus fertilizing lightly as the season progresses, will help develop buds for the next year.|$|E
500|$|The Slavs {{collected}} hogweed in May {{and used}} its roots for stewing with meat, while the stems, leaves and umbels were chopped, covered {{with water and}} left in <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>place</b> to ferment. After a few days, lactic and alcoholic fermentation produced a mixture described as [...] "something between beer and sauerkraut". This concoction was then used for cooking a soup characterized by a mouth-puckering sour taste and pungent smell. As the Polish ethnographer [...] wrote in 1830, [...] "Poles have been always partial to tart dishes, which are somewhat peculiar to their homeland and vital to their health." ...|$|E

[...] In response, on February 1, 1939, Călinescu took over most of Cristea's powers, while Cristea remained nominally the Prime Minister at the King's insistence.|$|R
500|$|In 2000, Schmirler {{worked as}} colour {{commentator}} for CBC during Canada's national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>place.</b> And the last one was to actually be here today, and I thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead." ...|$|E
500|$|Ariel has {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the character, writing that [...] "Ariel is a fully realized female character who thinks and acts independently, even rebelliously, instead of hanging around passively while the fates decide her destiny". James Bernardelli of Reelviews wrote that Ariel {{can be viewed as}} a template for future Disney heroes and heroines. He also praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance for the character. In an article for Empire, Levi Buchanan stated that Ariel is [...] "powerful and self-reliant". Janet Maslin of The New York Times complimented Ariel, stating that [...] "teenagers will appreciate the story's rebellious heroine" [...] and went on to praise Ariel's wit. Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend wrote favorably about Ariel although he believed that the character was eroticized, stating, [...] "The scene where Ursula rips out her throat and gives her extremely naked parts below the waist is almost titillating, though I'm sure to little kids it seems entirely innocent". Similarly, reviewer John Puccio said that [...] "Ariel is perhaps the sexiest-looking animated character the Disney artists have ever drawn". In his review of Ariel's Beginning, James Plath of DVD Town wrote, [...] "For little girls, Ariel is one of the most beloved of Disney princesses, and she holds <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> <b>place</b> in the hearts of parents as well". Rory Aronsky of Film Threat praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance in Ariel's Beginning, writing that [...] "Benson adds more to the appeal of Ariel for older fans, and younger girls just learning about her, as well as generations not born yet who will undoubtedly become attached to her, ensuring the continued existence of the franchise".|$|E

30|$|The forced swim test (FST) was {{performed}} {{at the end of}} the study. It was conducted by placing all rats individually in the testing cylinders (45  cm high ×  20  cm in diameter) filled with 30  cm water, maintained at 25  ±  1 °C. The rats were allowed to swim in the cylinder under conditions in which escape is impossible. In the first trial, rats were allowed to swim for 12  min. They were then removed from water, dried and put into <b>a</b> <b>warmed</b> <b>place</b> for approximately 15  min. After 24  h, the second trial {{was performed}}. This trial lasted 5  min and was recorded by a video camera. In this trial, we measured duration of immobility, which is explained as the absence of motion of the body except for small action necessary to keep the rat’s head above the water. After 5  min, rats were taken from the cylinder, dried and <b>placed</b> in <b>a</b> <b>warmed</b> <b>place</b> for approximately 15  min before returning to home cages. After the procedure, the devices were emptied and cleaned following every session [13].|$|R
