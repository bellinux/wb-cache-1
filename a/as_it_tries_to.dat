25|$|The title, without {{needing to}} {{actually}} include Charteris, {{allows for the}} play {{to serve as a}} critique of abuses of power and immorality. Justice Squeezum represents the flaws of society, while Justice Worthy represents England <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> deal with the various problems. The play serves as a way for Fielding to express his own views about society in his comedy. Fielding furthered this end by using Aristophanes as a model, and the theatre became his means to encouraging social change. However, the play is still a comedy, and the social agenda stands besides romantic intrigue and traditional comedic situations. There is an emphasis on legal matters, and the final words deal with crime. As such, the theatre serves as a kind of courtroom, and the characters are judged throughout the play with Fielding serving as a sort of prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|Ileal {{hypertrophy}} {{occurs when}} the circular and longitudinal layers of the ileal intestinal wall hypertrophy, and can also occur with jejunal hypertrophy. The mucosa remains normal, so malabsorption {{is not expected to}} occur in this disease. Ileal hypertrophy may be idiopathic, with current theories for such cases including neural dysfunction within the intestinal wall secondary to parasite migration, and increased tone of the ileocecal valve which leads to hypertrophy of the ileum <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> push contents into the cecum. Hypertrophy may also occur secondary to obstruction, especially those that have had surgery for an obstruction that required an anastomosis. Hypertrophy gradually decreases the size of the lumen, resulting in intermittent colic, and in approximately 45% of cases includes weight loss of 1–6 month duration and anorexia. Although rectal examination may display a thickened ileal wall, usually the diagnosis is made at surgery, and an ileocecal or jejunocecal anastomosis is made to allow intestinal contents to bypass the affected area. If surgery and bypass is not performed, there is a risk of rupture, but prognosis is fair with surgical treatment.|$|E

2500|$|Exchange rates can be {{adjusted}} by government [...] in a rules based or managed currency regime, and when left to float freely in the market {{they also tend to}} change in the direction that will restore balance. When a country is selling more than it imports, the demand for its currency will tend to increase as other countries ultimately need the selling country's currency to make payments for the exports. The extra demand tends to cause a rise of the currency's price relative to others. [...] When a country is importing more than it exports, the supply of its own currency on the international market tends to increase <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> exchange it for foreign currency to pay for its imports, and this extra supply tends to cause the price to fall. [...] BoP effects are not the only market influence on exchange rates however, they are also influenced by differences in national interest rates and by speculation.|$|E
