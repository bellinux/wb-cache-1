5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} are meat <b>and</b> <b>beans</b> or rice simmered overnight on a hotplate or blech, or {{placed in a}} slow oven. Ashkenazi cholent usually contains meat, potatoes, barley <b>and</b> <b>beans,</b> and sometimes kishke, and seasonings such as pepper and paprika. Sephardi hamin contains chicken or meat, rice, beans, garlic, sweet or regular potatoes, seasonings such as turmeric and cinnamon, and whole eggs in the shell known as haminados. Moroccan Jews prepare variations known as dafina or skhina (or s′hina) with meat, onion, marrow bones, potatoes, chickpeas, wheat berries, eggs and spices such as turmeric, cumin, paprika and pepper. Iraqi Jews prepare tebit, using chicken and rice.|$|E
5|$|During {{their earlier}} {{exploration}} of the Cape, the Pilgrims had come upon a Native American burial site which contained corn, and they had taken the corn for future planting.

40|$|Magadi soda <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> debris-ash {{have been}} used as {{condiments}} for a long time by various ethnic groups in East and Central Africa in cooking traditional dishes. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate whether magadi soda <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> debris-ash had similar effects and functional attributes when added to traditional dishes during cooking. Reason for the addition of the two condiments has not been revealed by researchers. Mineral content, in-vitro bioavailability studies and pH of non-ashed and ashed magadi soda <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> debris were evaluated. The results indicated that high concentrations of sodium ions (30. 2 %) and potassium ions (64. 2 %) were observed in magadi soda <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> debris-ash, respectively. In-vitro iron and zinc bioavailability decreased significantly with the addition of magadi soda <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> debris-ash in maize, <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> sorghum. Equally, the cooking time was significantly reduced. The mean pH for both magadi soda (9. 66) <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> debris-ash (9. 75) were not significantly different indicating that both aqueous solutions had alkaline properties. The similarity in properties especially in mineral profile, alkalinity, decreased cooking time and lowered mineral uptake by magadi soda <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> debris-ash explain similar functionality in foods they are added to during cooking. Despite the similarities observed, communities should be informed of the negative nutritional effects of these condiments so as to diversify their meal patterns accordingly. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the intercropping of corn (Zea mays L.) <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars (Phaseolus spp.) an experiment {{was carried out in}} a randomized complete block design with three replicaties at Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University during growing season of 2010. The experimental treatments consisted of sole cropping of corn, white bean, bush bean, red <b>bean,</b> pinto <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> sword <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> 50 : 50 ratio of corn <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> types. In this experiment, the corn-bush <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> corn-pinto <b>bean</b> intercropping had the highest seed yield (5734. 4 and 5674. 3 kg/ha- 1, respectively) and land equivalent ratio (LER= 1. 13 and 1. 21, respectively). Evaluated intercropping indices indicated that red bean (k= 1. 85), pinto bean (k= 2. 41) <b>and</b> sword <b>bean</b> (k= 2. 80) had the highest crowding coefficient whereas the maximum aggressivity value was belonged to pinto bean intercropped with corn (A= - 0. 02). Also, both the red <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> pinto <b>bean</b> (CR= 0. 75 and CR= 0. 98, respectively) had the maximum competitive ratio. Furthermore, the most corn crowding coefficient (K= 1. 15) was belonged to corn <b>and</b> sword <b>bean</b> intercropping <b>and</b> maximum corn aggressivity value was observed in corn intercropped with white bean (A=+ 0. 60) <b>and</b> bush <b>bean</b> (A=+ 0. 69). In conclusion, according to competition indices, intercropping of 50 % corn + 50 % red <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> pinto <b>bean</b> plants were superior as compared to other combinations. Also, both the red <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> pinto <b>bean</b> (CR= 0. 75 and CR= 0. 98, respectively) had the maximum competitive ratio. Furthermore, the most corn crowding coefficient (K= 1. 15) was belonged to corn <b>and</b> sword <b>bean</b> intercropping <b>and</b> maximum corn aggressivity value was observed in corn intercropped with white bean (A=+ 0. 60) <b>and</b> bush <b>bean</b> (A=+ 0. 69).

5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site {{should not be}} used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, <b>and</b> <b>beans,</b> which are also susceptible to the eelworm.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas <b>and</b> <b>beans),</b> and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley <b>and</b> <b>beans,</b> or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1300, the port {{exported}} wheat, peas <b>and</b> <b>beans</b> to Ireland, France and Spain, and by 1400 was also exporting cloth from Somerset and the adjoining counties. By 1500 {{it was the}} largest port in Somerset, later becoming the fifth largest in England, until eclipsed by Bristol in the 18th century. In its heyday, imports included wine, grain, fish, hemp, coal and timber. Exports included wheat, wool, cloth, cement, bricks and tiles. Unlike Bristol, Bridgwater was never involved in the slave trade and, in 1797, was the first town in Britain to petition the government to ban it.|$|E
5|$|In Mesoamerica, wild {{teosinte}} {{was transformed}} through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize, more than 6,000 years ago.

5|$|Native Americans {{occupied}} the river valleys surrounding the Metacomet Ridge {{for at least}} 10,000 years. Major tribal groups active in the area included the Quinnipiac, Niantic, Pequot, Pocomtuc, and Mohegan. Traprock was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as corn, squash, tobacco, <b>and</b> <b>beans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of food for humans, and for their {{domestic}} animals. They have {{played a key role in}} the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas <b>and</b> <b>beans.</b> Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, <b>and</b> <b>beans.</b> Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E

5|$|Their diet {{consisted}} of mainly grains <b>and</b> <b>beans</b> and in fishing communities fish was usually substituted for meat. Bread, wine, and olives were important staples of Byzantine diet with soldiers on campaign eating double-baked and dried bread called paximadion (Greek: παξιμάδιον). As in antiquity and modern times, {{the most common}} cultivations in the choraphia (Greek: χωράφια) were olive groves and vineyards. While Liutprand of Cremona, a visitor from Italy, found Greek wine irritating as it was often flavoured with resin (retsina) most other Westerners admired Greek wines, Cretan in particular being famous.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, <b>and</b> <b>beans,</b> spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture {{formed the}} bulk of the English economy {{at the time of the}} Norman invasion. Twenty years after the invasion, 35% of England was covered in arable land, 25% was put to pasture, 15% was covered by {{woodlands}} and the remaining 25% was predominantly moorland, fens and heaths. Wheat formed the single most important arable crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated extensively. In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes <b>and</b> <b>beans</b> were also cultivated. Sheep, cattle, oxen and pigs were kept on English holdings, although most of these breeds were much smaller than modern equivalents and most would have been slaughtered in winter.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped in the flood waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread <b>and</b> <b>beans.</b> Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E
