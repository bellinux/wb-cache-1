5|$|H. Roy Cullen, H. L. Hunt, Sid W. Richardson, and Clint Murchison {{were the}} four most {{influential}} businessmen during this era. These men became among the wealthiest and most politically {{powerful in the}} state <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{whites and}} some blacks were alarmed by MalcolmX and the {{statements}} he made during this period. He <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> of Islam {{were described as}} hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, and a threat to improved race relations. He was accused of being antisemitic. One {{of the goals of}} the civil rights movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in voting and other aspects of the political process. Civil rights organizations denounced him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> as irresponsible extremists whose views did not represent African Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} toward national unification in Italy was similarly precipitated by Napoleonic rule. These changes {{contributed to the}} development of nationalism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> state.|$|E
40|$|The {{author of}} Psalm 47 {{appears to be}} {{occupied}} with the relationship of three role-players, namely God, Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations.</b> <b>The</b> relationship of the three role-players is investigated by employing a social-scientific and semantic investigation into terminology used in Psalm 47 referring to patronage <b>and</b> clientage as <b>the</b> form {{of the relationship between}} them. A brief overview is also given of how patron-client/vassal relationships functioned in the ancient Near East. The result {{of this study is that}} Psalm 47 clearly contains a universal perspective on the relationship between God, Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>and</b> that God serves as the universal patron over Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> being subject to the patronage of Israel...|$|R

5|$|Beaumont almost {{instantly}} became a boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> participating in land speculation. Investment in Texas speculation in 1901 reached approximately $235 million US (approximately $ in present-day terms). The level of oil speculation in Pennsylvania and {{other areas of the}} United States was quickly surpassed by the speculation in Texas. The Lucas gusher itself was short-lived; production fell to 10,000 barrels per day by 1904. The strike, however, was only the beginning of a much larger trend.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> of Nazi Germany. His relationship with Eva Braun, which lasted nearly 14 years, was hidden from the public and all but his inner circle. Braun biographer Heike Görtemaker notes that the couple enjoyed a normal sex life. Hitler and Braun married in late April 1945, less than 40 hours before committing suicide together.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the Khmer Rouge advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, the Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E

5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. The Giants got off to a quick 3–0 lead; however, the Bills scored the next 12 points. The Giants responded by running a nearly eight-minute drive, which culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker.|$|E
5|$|The Emancipation Proclamation, {{issued on}} September 22, 1862, {{and put into}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.|$|E

5|$|According to the California Secretary of State, the Democratic Party holds a voter {{registration}} advantage in every congressional district, state senate district, state assembly district, State Board of Equalization district, all nine counties, {{and all but}} three of the 101 incorporated municipalities in the Bay Area. On the other hand, the center right Republican Party holds a {{voter registration}} advantage in only one state assembly subdistrict (the portion of California's 4th State Assembly district in Solano county) and three cities, Atherton, Hillsborough, and Danville. According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI), congressional districts the Bay Area tends to favor Democratic candidates by roughly 40 to 50 percentage points, considerably above the mean for California <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> overall.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge and Cox were renominated {{for their}} {{respective}} offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his {{actions in the}} Police Strike around the state <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form. He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier. His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge {{run for president in}} 1920.|$|E
5|$|Even out {{of elected}} office, he was widely {{considered}} the most powerful political figure in the state for many years. His influence extended {{all over the state}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> As a member of the Oregon Health & Science University board, Goldschmidt was an early advocate of the controversial Portland Aerial Tram, which connected the research hospital to real estate projects by his longtime associates Homer Williams and Irving Levin near land whose owners Goldschmidt later represented. He stayed active in Portland as well, advocating an expansion of the Park Blocks (a strip of open park space cutting through downtown Portland.) Goldschmidt assisted in the deal that led to the construction of TriMet's MAX Red Line to Portland International Airport that opened in 2001. He also started the Start Making a Reader Today (SMART) volunteer program in Oregon schools.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929, and married her in April 1945. In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death {{was a source of}} deep, lasting pain. Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in 1960.|$|E
5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live.|$|E

5|$|Lockett {{finished}} his college career with 249 receptions for 3,710 yards and 29 touchdowns as a receiver; 77 kickoff returns for 2196 yards and 4 touchdowns; 32 punt returns for 488 yards and 2 touchdowns; and 22 rushes for 192 yards {{as well as}} 6 career tackles. This totals 6,586 career All-purpose yards. Although the National Collegiate Athletic Association officially recognizes 1.2 punt returns per game as the qualifying minimum threshold, some sources consider 1 punt return per game as the qualifying minimum, and thus Richard Leonard of Florida International is the 2014 punt return average leader by those sources. Lockett's senior season totals led the Big 12 Conference in receiving yards <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> in punt return average.|$|E
5|$|Nauru {{earned a}} {{qualification}} place in weightlifting in the International Weightlifting Federation's continental Olympic qualification event—Oceania and South Pacific Olympic Weightlifting Championships—held in Auckland, New Zealand from March 27 to 30, 2008. At the event only those National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of Oceania {{which had not}} gained berths for 2008 Olympics in the 2006 and 2007 World Weightlifting Championships got chance to win qualification places. Itte Detenamo was selected over Yukio Peter to fill the earned quota.

Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington's, the availability of images and the setting of his death made it a cause célèbre. Leaders of the NAACP hoped to launch a legal battle against those responsible for Washington's death, but abandoned the plan owing to the projected cost.|$|E
