5|$|An acid {{dissociation}} constant, Ka, (also {{known as}} acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant) is a quantitative {{measure of the}} strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid–base reactions. and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as Ka2, etc. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, {{is an example of a}} polyprotic acid <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> lose three protons.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat {{is dark and}} stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy.

5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Sustainment Brigade was {{permanently}} {{attached to}} the 1st Cavalry Division, though it could operate independently when needed.

5|$|The {{white dwarf}} {{companion}} could also accrete matter from {{other types of}} companions, including a subgiant or (if the orbit is sufficiently close) even a main sequence star.

5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E

It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium.

The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using indirect lighting. The station is also compliant with National Fire Protection Association standards, despite its extreme depth, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be evacuated in six minutes in case of fire, and the platform can be cleared within four minutes.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can,</b> and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

5|$|Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are {{the primary}} cause of {{decomposition}} of wood, causing billions of dollars of economic damage each year. Fungal decay, while useful in composting, is destructive of timber exposed to the weather, {{and in the case of}} dry rot caused by Serpula lacrymans, also of timbers in largely dry houses. Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E
5|$|The Cucurbita digitata, C.foetidissima, C.galeotti, and C.pedatifolia species {{groups are}} xerophytes, arid zone {{perennials}} with storage roots; the remainder, including the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life perennials with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated {{from each other}} by sterility barriers and have different physiological characteristics. Some cross pollinations can occur: C.pepo with C.argyrosperma and C.moschata; and C.maxima with C.moschata. Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo gourd (C.foetidissima), which does not taste good, {{has been used as}} an intermediary <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be crossed with all the common Cucurbita.|$|E

It has a main span of three lanes, which use a tidal flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these {{is used as a}} local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> no longer be used for vehicular traffic due to weight restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E
