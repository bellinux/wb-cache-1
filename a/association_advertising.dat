Because nearly all affiliates found production costs for the FCC's intended goal of increased public affairs programming very high and the ratings (and by <b>association,</b> <b>advertising</b> revenues) low, making it mostly unprofitable, the FCC created an exception for network-authored news and public affairs shows. After a six-month hiatus in late 1971, CBS found a prime place for 60 Minutes in a portion of that displaced time, 6:00 to 7:00p.m. (Eastern; 5:00 to 6:00 Central Time) on Sundays, in January 1972.|$|E
