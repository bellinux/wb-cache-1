5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun <b>and</b> <b>laughter,</b> although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} version of the song had stayed largely in the key of G major (except for {{transient}} modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges), the reprise starts in F and features a modulation, to G. The mono and stereo mixes of the song differ slightly: the former has a fractionally different transition from the previous song, and includes crowd noise <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> in the opening bars that are absent from the stereo mix.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} {{years of his}} {{presidency}} at Nintendo, Iwata would often forego media appearances, unless new hardware was being announced, in order {{to spend more time}} programming. However, his attitude towards this changed, and he eventually became a prominent part of Nintendo's public relations. Iwata helped Nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media, and he shared insights on Nintendo's employees, games, and hardware through his interview series Iwata Asks. Inspiration for this series, which began in September2006, stemmed from Iwata's background as a game programmer and his curiosity of the mindset of other developers. These interviews often showcased the friendly camaraderie between Iwata and other members of Nintendo as jokes <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> were commonplace. They also revealed a different side of the normally secretive Nintendo: openness to discuss some of {{the inner workings of the}} company.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} {{laughter}} in conversations {{in order to}} find out what functions laughter can fulfil. The data that are used for the analysis are conversations involving four different families and one or two researchers. Laughter {{plays an important role in}} communication, as it depends on social factors. For example people laugh more when other people are present and how often we laugh also depends on who these other people are and in what situation we find ourselves. Because laughter is a social signal it is interesting to find out which role laughter can play in a conversation. Much has been written about the relationship between <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> humour or jokes but there is not much research on laughter in everyday conversations, that doesn’t only look at laughter as a response to humour. As laughter cannot only be seen as an indicator of humour, this thesis looks at the different functions of <b>laughter</b> in conversations <b>and</b> tries to give answers to questions like: Which participant initiates the <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> how do other participants react to the laughter? What different functions does laughter have in different situations? So for the analysis the context of the laughter is very important. The methodology used for the analysis is primarily conversation analysis but the analysis also contains elements of interactional sociolinguistics. The analysis looks at the functions of laughter in five different contexts: <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> irony, <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> trouble-telling, <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> teasing, <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> disagreement <b>and</b> finally <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> narratives. The analyzed examples show that laughter can fulfil different functions for each context...|$|R

Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E
25|$|Anime: a Japanese {{animation}} TV {{series was}} made in 1978 as Hoshi no Ojisama Petit Prince, containing 39 episodes that do not follow {{the plot of the}} original novella. Each episode contains an adventure on a planet, usually Earth, where the little prince meets different people each time and makes friends. Some key elements of the original story have been kept. Namely, the little prince's golden hair, his scarf <b>and</b> <b>laughter.</b> Also, his planet name (B-612), the rose and the three volcanoes. The anime had been aired and dubbed into several languages including Arabic, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.|$|E

25|$|Several dialogues tackle {{questions}} about art: Socrates says that poetry {{is inspired by}} the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, {{and other forms of}} divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetry, <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literature that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.|$|E
25|$|The {{contents}} of the record were selected for NASA by a committee chaired by Carl Sagan of Cornell University. The selection of content for the record took almost a year. Sagan and his associates assembled 115 images {{and a variety of}} natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind, thunder and animals (including the songs of birds and whales). To this they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, spoken greetings in 55 ancient and modern languages, other human sounds, like footsteps <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> (Sagan's), and printed messages from U.S. president Jimmy Carter and U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. The record also includes the inspirational message Per aspera ad astra in Morse code.|$|E

25|$|The {{series was}} set {{at a time of}} change in the fashion of the {{so-called}} traditional British holiday. During the years after the Second World War, British holiday camps flourished, as people were celebrating with fun <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> again after years of austerity and wartime hardship. The series was set towards the end of this period, when the original format of holiday camps was coming to an end. Despite the feeling amongst many staff that their brand of fun and entertainment for the whole family was a tradition that would endure, the emerging popularity at the time (late 1950s / early 1960s) for self-catering and holidaying abroad meant the camp was unlikely to survive in its original format. The closing storyline of the series was the camp undergoing drastic changes to modernise with the times, meaning that many of the staff would lose their jobs as their particular talents were no longer required.|$|E

40|$|Laughter {{is highly}} {{relevant}} for social interaction {{in human beings}} and non-human primates. In humans {{as well as in}} non-human primates laughter can be induced by tickling. Human laughter, however, has further diversified <b>and</b> encompasses emotional <b>laughter</b> types with various communicative functions, e. g. joyful <b>and</b> taunting <b>laughter.</b> Here, it was evaluated if this evolutionary diversification of ecological functions is associated with distinct cerebral responses underlying laughter perception. Functional MRI revealed a double-dissociation of cerebral responses during perception of tickling <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>laughter</b> (joy <b>and</b> taunt) with higher activations in the anterior rostral medial frontal cortex (arMFC) when emotional <b>laughter</b> was perceived, <b>and</b> stronger responses in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) during appreciation of tickling laughter. Enhanced activation of the arMFC for emotional laughter presumably reflects increasing demands on social cognition processes arising from the greater social salience of these laughter types. Activation increase in the STG for tickling laughter may be linked to the higher acoustic complexity of this laughter type. The observed dissociation of cerebral responses for emotional <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> tickling <b>laughter</b> was independent of task-directed focusing of attention. These findings support the postulated diversification of human laughter in the course of evolution from an unequivocal play signal to laughter with distinct emotional contents subserving complex social function...|$|R
500|$|The novel shows irony with [...] "unmistakable {{strains of}} cynicism,...laughing at human nature without any real hope of {{changing}} it". Laughter in the story, which ranges from irresponsible laughter to laughter at people <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> of amusement and relief, {{can also be}} linked to the sexual tensions among the different characters. Despite their appeal to modern audiences, laughter and wit were seen as vulgar and irreverent in Austen's time. The BBC drama made changes [...] "with a view to exposing a character, or adding humour or irony to a situation". The adaptation comically exaggerates the characters of Mrs. Bennet, Miss Bingley and Mr. Collins, even showing Mrs. Bennet on the verge of hysteria in many of the early scenes.|$|E

With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability {{to perform the duties}} of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer's disease. Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, [...] "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," [...] which generated applause <b>and</b> <b>laughter,</b> even from Mondale himself.|$|E

He fell into a state of depression, but on the scaffold gathered his resolve and, according to the 16th-century historian William Camden, declared that [...] "he loved the Queen as well as he loved Jesus Christ".
