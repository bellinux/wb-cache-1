5|$|Ceremonies, {{masses and}} an {{enormous}} funeral were held; a funeral train toured Poland. A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks was also released. In 1937, after a two-year display at St. Leonard's Crypt in Kraków's Wawel Cathedral, Piłsudski's body was laid {{to rest in the}} Cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells, except for his brain, which he had willed for study to Stefan Batory University, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> which was interred in his mother's grave at Vilnius' Rasos Cemetery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, two {{teenagers}} {{get into a}} fight in the woods. The girl, named Maggie (Jillian Bach), runs into the woods to be alone and Kevin (Angelo Vacco), her boyfriend, gives chase. However, he is attacked <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> is removed. Meanwhile, the writer intensely transcribes the event on his typewriter. The next day, Mulder and Scully discuss this latest incident via phone. An unmarked envelope is discovered by Scully in the office containing a milagro, a type of pendant. While she examines the pendant, a voice-over from the writer describes Scully's most intimate feelings as she examines the unsolicited gift.|$|E
5|$|Many doctors {{considered}} {{the case to}} be unusual and debated the cause of death. Some, including family members, accused them of criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him to choke on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest {{was made by the}} coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> and lungs seemed healthy. A Tribune reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer William T. G. Morton who had first used it in 1846. Morton said it was most improbable Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when properly used, and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.|$|E

25|$|Examinations and X-rays {{showed that}} the man's head was undamaged, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> lungs and liver were well preserved. The Silkeborg Museum {{estimated}} his age as approximately 40 years and height at , a relatively short stature even for the time. It {{is likely that the}} body had shrunk in the bog.|$|E
25|$|MBTA {{police officer}} Richard H. Donohue Jr. (33) was {{critically}} wounded during a firefight with the bombers {{just after midnight}} on April 19. He lost almost all of his blood, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> stopped for 45 minutes, during which time he was kept alive by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The Boston Globe reported that Donohue may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer.|$|E
25|$|Tophet is Moloch, {{which was}} made of brass; and they heated him from his lower parts; and his hands being {{stretched}} out, and made hot, they put the child between his hands, and it was burnt; when it vehemently cried out; but the priests beat a drum, that the father might not {{hear the voice of}} his son, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> might not be moved.|$|E

The poem ends with a long description of the funeral games in honour of the dead youth.|$|E
25|$|In 1826 Maréchal made {{a journey}} to Canada, and on his return fell ill. He died at age 63 on January 29, 1828 in Baltimore. His coadjutor, James Whitfield, who succeeded him as Archbishop of Baltimore, {{had not yet been}} consecrated when Maréchal died. Maréchal's body is interred in the Baltimore Basilica's crypt, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> is in the chapel behind Elizabeth Ann Seton's house in {{downtown}} Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|One {{doctor was}} also {{struck by the}} Karmapa's refusal of pain {{medication}} {{and the absence of}} any signs of feeling the profound pain that most patients in his condition report.

25|$|Bucky, who collapses {{along the}} way, {{is unable to}} take Gerda up to the ice palace, so Gerda goes on alone.

25|$|The {{following}} day, a 13-day {{period of}} mourning started {{in several countries}} formerly part of Austria-Hungary. Otto was entombed in the Imperial Crypt under the Capuchin Church in Vienna on 16 July <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> buried in Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary on 17 July. Multiple requiems were celebrated. Many foreign dignitaries—among them reigning or former monarchs King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, King Michael I of Romania, Tsar Simeon II of Bulgaria, Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, and Fra' Matthew Festing—attended the Requiem Mass in Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral on 16 July, presided over by Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which {{was followed by the}} entombment in the Imperial Crypt. Commemorations were also held in Bavaria.|$|E
50|$|Tangible {{progress}} {{was made in the}} League Championship in 1949-50 when Hearts finished third. McLean's death on 14 February 1951 saw Tommy Walker promoted to the new manager of Conn <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>Hearts</b> team mates. The important foundations Walker inherited from McLean included the Terrible Trio forwards. Walker managed Hearts {{for the rest of the}} time Conn was there.|$|R

25|$|As Penn became homeless, {{he began}} to live with Quaker families. Quakers were {{relatively}} strict Christians in the 17th century. They refused to bow or take off their hats to social superiors, believing all men equal under God, a belief antithetical to an absolute monarchy which believed the monarch divinely appointed by God. Therefore, Quakers were treated as heretics because of their principles and their failure to pay tithes. They also refused to swear oaths of loyalty to the King. Quakers followed the command of Jesus not to swear. The basic ceremony of Quakerism is silent worship in a meeting house, conducted in a group. There was no ritual and no professional clergy, and many Quakers disavowed the concept of original sin. God's communication comes to each individual directly, and if so moved, the individual shares their revelations, thoughts or opinions with the group. Penn found all these tenets to sit well with his conscience <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
25|$|Viki is {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer in 2000, but survives after a mastectomy and chemotherapy. She and Ben marry in November. In 2001, a girl named Natalie Balsom (Melissa Archer) makes the startling claim that she is Viki and Clint's biological daughter, which is confirmed by a DNA test. Mitch Laurence returns from the dead, divulging to Viki he drugged and raped her around the same time she and Clint conceived Jessica and had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint, Natalie, and the other fathered by Mitch, Jessica (Erin Torpey). Unable to reconcile the revelation, Niki Smith emerges during the ordeal and plots to kill Ben in order to have her freedom, but when Ben is accidentally shot by Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes), Viki returns. Ben is left comatose after the shooting. In 2003, Victor (William Stone Mahoney) is ostensibly revealed to be alive, claiming to have faked his death in 1976; however, shortly after he returns, Victor dies — but not before Viki and Todd confront him on ills inflicted to them in his wake. In 2004, Viki {{is diagnosed}} with heart disease and eventually needs a heart transplant. Coincidentally, a comatose Ben dies just as Viki takes a turn for the worse, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> is transplanted into Viki, who recovers but must face widowhood once again.|$|E
25|$|The First Peace of Thorn {{ending the}} Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War {{was signed in}} the city in February 1411 leaving the town {{in the hands of}} the Order. In 1440, the gentry of Thorn formed the Prussian Confederation to further oppose the Knights' policies. The Confederation rose against the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in 1454 and its {{delegation}} submitted a petition to Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon asking him to regain power over Prussia as the rightful ruler. An act of incorporation was signed in Kraków (6 March 1454), recognizing the region, including Toruń, as part of the Polish Kingdom. These events led to the Thirteen Years' War. The New and the Old Towns amalgamated in 1454. The citizens of Thorn enraged by the Order's ruthless exploitation, conquered the Teutonic castle, and dismantled the fortifications brick by brick, except for the Gdanisko tower, which was used until the 18th century for the gunpowder storage. During the war, Toruń financially supported the Polish Army. The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466 with the Second Peace of Thorn, in which the Teutonic Order ceded their control over the city to Poland. The Polish King granted the town great privileges, similar to those of Gdańsk. In 1501, Polish King John I Albert died in Toruń <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> was buried in Toruń's St. John's Church. In 1506 Toruń became a royal city of Poland. In 1528, the royal mint started operating in Toruń. A city of great wealth and influence, it enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period. Sejms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were held in Toruń in 1576 and 1626.|$|E

25|$|After his death, Gustavus's wife {{initially}} kept <b>his</b> body, <b>and</b> later <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> in {{the castle}} of Nyköping for over a year. His remains (including <b>his</b> <b>heart)</b> now rest in Riddarholm Church in Stockholm.|$|R

500|$|John Gill, {{a seven-year-old}} boy, was found murdered in Manningham, Bradford, on [...] 1888. His legs had been severed, his abdomen opened, his {{intestines}} drawn out, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> and one ear removed. The similarities {{with the murder}} of Mary Kelly led to press speculation that the Ripper had killed him. The boy's employer, milkman William Barrett, was twice arrested for the murder but was released due to insufficient evidence. No-one else was ever prosecuted.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{his friends}} {{provided}} music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello. Chopin requested that his body be opened after death (for fear of being buried alive) <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> returned to Warsaw where it rests at the Church of the Holy Cross. He also bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, Projet de méthode, to Alkan for completion. On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. [...] "No longer", he replied. He died {{a few minutes before}} two o'clock in the morning. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand's daughter Solange, and his close friend Thomas Albrecht. Later that morning, Solange's husband Clésinger made Chopin's death mask and a cast of his left hand.|$|E
500|$|When Rhys {{is offered}} {{the chance to}} apply for a three-month work {{placement}} in Japan, he decides to apply and then convince Vanessa to go with him. Barber revealed [...] "He puts himself <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> on the line like he's never done before. At first, Vanessa says no - and he's devastated. He's in a really vulnerable place and he doesn't take her knockback well. Rhys has been a bit of a ladies man all his life and he's never really committed to someone before Vanessa. She's a pretty special girl as far as Rhys is concerned." [...] Rhys becomes determined not to give up and he is [...] "thrilled" [...] when Vanessa changes her mind. Barber teased that it is possible viewers could see the last of Rhys and Vanessa for a while, adding [...] "There are definitely interesting times ahead!" ...|$|E
