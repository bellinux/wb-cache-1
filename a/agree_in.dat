5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|However, Bell was {{speaking}} only {{for himself and}} without {{the auspices of the}} owners. At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order to do this, they had to <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E
5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies <b>agree.</b> <b>In</b> 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E

50|$|Intransitive verbs inflect {{for their}} subject, <b>agreeing</b> <b>in</b> person, number and {{gender of the}} subject. Transitive verbs inflect for subject and object, <b>agreeing</b> <b>in</b> person, number, and gender of both subject and object. Transitive Animate verbs also agree for obviation.|$|R
5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode {{the gender of}} the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode {{the gender of the}} grammatical subject, creating a set of four verb subclasses. The distinction between the two genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He gave up his religious studies to study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, {{so there was no}} defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{histories}} {{describe the}} formation and destruction of the Bridge of the Gods, a land bridge that connected the Oregon and Washington sides of the river in the Columbia River Gorge. The bridge, which aligns with geological records of the Bonneville Slide, was described in some stories {{as the result of}} a battle between gods, represented by Mount Adams and Mount Hood, in their competition for the affection of a goddess, represented by Mount St.Helens. Native American stories about the bridge differ in their details but <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> general that the bridge permitted increased interaction between tribes on the north and south sides of the river.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} before Abraham Lincoln took office, parties in the seceding states {{disagreed}} over the proper course of action concerning the forts within their domains. In Florida, three forts remained {{in the possession of}} the United States Army: Fort Zachary Taylor at Key West, Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, and Fort Pickens near Pensacola. Some of the most strident secessionists proposed that they be taken over immediately, by force if needed, beginning with Fort Pickens. Cooler heads hoped to avoid bloodshed and gain possession by negotiation; they made much of the conciliatory words of William H. Seward, already selected to be Secretary of State in the incoming administration. Mallory and Florida's other Senator, David L. Yulee, and the two Senators from Alabama sent telegrams to their respective governors urging caution. Other Southern Senators lent their support, and President-elect Jefferson Davis seemed to <b>agree.</b> <b>In</b> the end, the moderates won out, and no attack was made on Fort Pickens. Although Mallory was hardly alone, his political opponents later used his perceived pro-Union stance as an excuse to attack him.|$|E

50|$|The white-capped {{albatross}} {{is part of}} {{a greater}} complex of albatrosses consisting of the shy albatross, Thasassarche cauta, Salvin's albatross, Thalassarche salvini, and Chatham albatross, Thalassarche eremita. In 1998, Robertson and Nunn recommended a four way split, some experts agreed. BirdLife International <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> 2007, ACAP <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> 2006, and Brooke <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> 2004. The SACC agreed to a three-way split, leaving steadi, the white-capped albatross grouped with the shy albatross. James Clements has yet to agree on any of these splits. Finally, following Brooke, this species was shifted from Diomedea to Thalassarche, which was generally agreed upon by most experts.|$|R
