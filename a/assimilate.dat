5|$|There is a {{relationship}} between light, primary production, and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths. Radiant energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts {{as a catalyst for}} genetic mutation. Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and <b>assimilate</b> the energy through photosynthesis. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — <b>assimilate</b> light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds.|$|E

40|$|In this article, I have {{examined}} Nishida’s philosophical development in his middle period (from April 1925 to October 1932), taking two key facets - immanence and transcendence - into account. It {{is worth noting}} that two key facets can form the following four patterns: first, “immanence <b>assimilating</b> transcendence,” second, “transcendence <b>assimilating</b> immanence,”third, “immanence separated from transcendence,” and fourth, “transcendence separated from immanence. ” I argue that Nishida’s middle period can further be divided into two: the first half (from April 1925 to December 1929) and the latter half (from January 1930 to October 1932). Nishida’s thought in the earlier period (from his earliest days through March 1925) was mainly concerned with “immanence <b>assimilating</b> transcendence,” and yet his focus gradually shifted to “transcendence <b>assimilating</b> immanence. ” In {{the first half of the}} middle period, the transition of this kind deepened more. As a consequence, “transcendence <b>assimilating</b> immanence” became dominant, while “immanence <b>assimilating</b> transcendence” came to occupy a secondary place. It is notable, however, that this relation was inverted in the latter half of the middle period: “immanence <b>assimilating</b> transcendence” turned to be primary, when “transcendence <b>assimilating</b> immanence” worked secondarily...|$|R

Treated as a sea level pressure observation, the MSLP assimilation by the EnKF enhances the hurricane warm core structure and results in a stronger and deeper analyzed vortex than that in the GFS (Global Forecast System) analysis; it also improves the subsequent 18 -h hurricane intensity and track forecasts. With a 2 -h total assimilation window length, the assimilation of MSLP data interpolated to 10 -min intervals results in more balanced analyses with smaller subsequent forecast error growth and better intensity and track forecasts than when the data are <b>assimilated</b> every 60 minutes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether lexical access {{is affected by}} a regular phonological variation in connected speech: voice assimilation in French. Two associative priming experiments were conducted to determine whether strongly <b>assimilated,</b> potentially ambiguous word forms activate the conceptual representation of the underlying word. Would the ambiguous word form [sud] (either <b>assimilated</b> soute 'hold' or soude 'soda') facilitate "bagage" 'luggage', which is semantically related to soute but not to soude? In Experiment 1, words in either canonical or strongly <b>assimilated</b> form were presented as primes. Both forms primed their related target to the same extent. Potential lexical ambiguity did not modulate priming effects. In Experiment 2, the primes such as <b>assimilated</b> soute pronounced [sud] used in Experiment 1 were replaced with primes such as soude canonically pronounced [sud]. No semantic priming effect was obtained with these primes. Therefore, the effect observed for <b>assimilated</b> forms in Experiment 1 cannot be due to overall phonological proximity between canonical and <b>assimilated</b> forms. We propose that listeners must recover the intended words behind the <b>assimilated</b> forms through the exploitation of the remaining traces of the underlying form, however subtle these traces may be...|$|R

5|$|Another {{focus of}} the Canadian {{government}} {{was to make the}} Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier to <b>assimilate.</b> In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture. When most of these model farming villages failed, the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876. With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reservations.|$|E
40|$|Radial {{velocity}} (Vr) and reflectivity (Z) {{data from}} eight coastal operational radars of mainland China and Taiwan are <b>assimilated</b> using a 3 DVAR and cloud analysis package for typhoon Meranti (2010).

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A {{method for}} {{measuring}} food carbon assimilation in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus was developed, using the diatom Ditylum brightwelli as food.

The fraction of ingested organic matter <b>assimilated</b> (U) multiplied {{by the amount of}} food carbon ingested estimated the amount of food carbon <b>assimilated,</b> assuming that the fraction of organic matter <b>assimilated</b> by the copepods was identical to the fraction of food carbon <b>assimilated.</b> Assimilation fraction determinations agreed well with those in the literature.

40|$|Assimilation {{of place}} of {{articulation}} across a nasal and a following stop consonant is obligatory in Japanese, {{but not in}} Dutch.

Japanese listeners produced significantly more <b>assimilated</b> than unassimilated forms, both with pseudo-Japanese and pseudo-Dutch materials, while Dutch listeners produced significantly more unassimilated than <b>assimilated</b> forms in each materials set.
