25|$|The 1990s saw {{the release}} of many {{compilation}} albums of Shaw's material on various minor labels, as well as reissues of some of her original albums. Shaw's autobiography, The World <b>at</b> <b>My</b> <b>Feet,</b> was published in 1991, and the following year she began studying at Oxford and the University of London and qualified as a psychotherapist in 1994. During that time, she recorded new versions of some of her 1960s songs for the album Nothing Less Than Brilliant, released in 1994. It was also around this time that Shaw divorced Powell and met her third husband, Tony Bedford. Concentrating on a new career as a psychotherapist, Shaw opened the Arts Clinic in 1997 with her husband, to provide psychological healthcare and creative development {{to those in the}} creative industries. The clinic is now styled Barefoot Therapy: The Arts Clinic and continues to provide psychological support for those in the fields of entertainment, media and sports. In 1998 she was invited to join the Royal Society of Musicians as an Honorary Professor of Music.|$|E
25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E

500|$|In 1950, Plath {{attended}} Smith College and excelled academically. She {{wrote to}} her mother, [...] "The world is splitting open <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> like a ripe, juicy watermelon". She edited The Smith Review and during the summer after her third year of college was awarded a coveted position as guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City. The experience was not what she had hoped it would be, and it began a downward spiral. She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas—a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, [...] "more than life itself." [...] She hung around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, {{but he was already}} on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs to see if she had enough [...] "courage" [...] to commit suicide. Many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar. During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar. Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt in late August 1953 by crawling under her house and taking her mother's sleeping pills.|$|E
500|$|As {{his daughters}} {{approached}} womanhood, Liszt {{felt that a}} change in their lives was called for and in 1855 he arranged (over their mother's bitter protests) for them to move to Berlin. Here they {{were placed in the}} care of Franziska von Bülow, whose son Hans was Liszt's most outstanding pupil; he would take charge of the girls' musical education while Frau von Bülow supervised their general and moral welfare. Hans von Bülow, born in 1830, had abandoned his legal education after hearing Liszt conduct the premiere of Wagner's Lohengrin at Weimar in August 1850, and had decided to dedicate his life to music. After a brief spell conducting in small opera houses, Bülow studied with Liszt, who was convinced that he would become a great concert pianist. Bülow was quickly impressed by Cosima's own skill as a pianist, in which he saw the stamp of her father, and the pair developed romantic feelings for each other. Liszt approved the match, and the marriage took place at St. Hedwig's Cathedral, Berlin, on 18 August 1857. During their honeymoon, along with Liszt they visited Wagner at his home near Zurich. This visit was repeated the following year, when Cosima, on taking her leave, shocked Wagner with an emotional demonstration: [...] "he fell <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> covered my hands with tears and kisses ... I pondered the mystery, without being able to solve it".|$|E
2500|$|Tom Wills, Australia's most revered cricketer of {{the mid-19th}} century, was also its most {{controversial}} {{and he was}} often accused of (and admitted to) throwing. Many of his contemporaries recalled his trickery: [...] " [...] {{used to say to}} the umpire, 'Just look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> will you; I have a bad habit now and then of going over the crease.' The umpire would look at Tom's feet, and Tom would let go a throw for all he was worth." [...] In 1872 he became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in a major Australian match, effectively ending his first-class career.|$|E

2500|$|For lead actor Jeremy Irvine, {{starring}} {{in his first}} film role, the filming process was intense at times, in particular the scene where the British cavalry, 130 horses in total and many hundreds of extras, charged the German machine gun lines. He explained: [...] "It’s the weapons of the old world—our men on horses—meeting the absolute destruction of these tools of mass slaughter. There was this line of machine guns and there’s this wall of lead coming out of these guns. There were real explosions <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> bodies flying through the air, stunt men getting shot at. It was terrifying. The smoke and the smell and {{the taste of the}} guns firing. It’s not difficult to act scared in that situation. There’s no doubt this was deliberate: not only to have the film look great, but to have that effect on the actors. It was an eye-opening scene." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{aroused by}} a clod of earth {{striking}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> Then from above, I {{heard a sound}} of scrambling. The next moment a young man, with a final slide down the crumbling wall, alighted <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> It was Philip Wickson, though I did not know him at the time. He looked at me coolly and uttered a low whistle of surprise.|$|E

60|$|The 25th day of August, 1751, {{about two}} in the afternoon, I, David Balfour, came forth of the British Linen Company, a porter {{attending}} me {{with a bag of}} money, and some of the chief of these merchants bowing me from their doors. Two days before, and even so late as yestermorning, I was like a beggarman by the wayside, clad in rags, brought down to my last shillings, my companion a condemned traitor, a price set on my own head for a crime with the news of which the country rang. To-day I was served heir to my position in life, a landed laird, a bank porter by me carrying my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of the saying) the ball directly <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R

Now I was walking towards that Shape--shadow or woman--like a man in his sleep, and as I came she stretched out her arms and smiled oh! as sweetly as an angel, though I felt quite sure that she was nothing of the sort.|$|R
