5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they <b>all</b> <b>should</b> use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E
5|$|The Morris {{family and}} their friend become lost, accidentally finding the HorrorLand theme park. Shortly after parking, their car explodes, but the ticket-taker reassures them {{that it will be}} taken care of. The children, Lizzy Morris, Luke Morris, and their friend Clay, explore the theme park and get on the rides. After a ride in which Lizzy is locked in a casket {{traveling}} down a river, the three of them attempt to convince the parents that they <b>all</b> <b>should</b> leave. The parents reveal that they experienced similar problems, so they all decide to confront the Horrors.|$|E

25|$|Though <b>all</b> <b>should</b> be {{unanimous}} {{for setting}} him at liberty, yet would I cut him to pieces. The prophet Samuel is my warrant, who, {{when he had}} Agag, king of Amalek, in his power, hewed him in pieces, saying, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. Do therefore the same to Hengist, who is a second Agag.|$|E
25|$|Hachikō {{became a}} {{national}} sensation. His faithfulness to his master's memory impressed the people of Japan as a spirit of family loyalty to which <b>all</b> <b>should</b> strive to achieve. Teachers and parents used Hachikō's vigil as an example for children to follow. A well-known Japanese artist rendered a sculpture of the dog, and throughout the country, a new awareness of the Akita breed grew.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} are the eight most important features to ensure an effective, verifiable Open Access (OA) mandate: (1) All research funding agency OA Mandates need to specify clearly and explicitly that the deposit of each article {{must be in the}} author’s institutional repository (so the universities and research institutions can monitor their own output and ensure compliance as well as adopt mandates of their own for their unfunded research output). (2) <b>All</b> mandates <b>should</b> specify that the deposit (of the authors refereed, revised, accepted final draft) must be done immediately upon acceptance for publication (not on the date of publication, which is often much later, variable, not known to the author, and frequently does not even correspond to the journal issue’s published date of publication, if there is one). (3) <b>All</b> mandates <b>should</b> urge (but not require) authors to make their immediate-deposit immediately-OA. (4) <b>All</b> mandates <b>should</b> urge (but not require) authors to reserve the right to make their papers immediately-OA (and other re-use rights) in their contracts with their publishers (as in the Harvard-style mandates). (3) <b>All</b> mandates <b>should</b> shorten (or, better, not even mention) allowable OA embargoes (so as not to encourage publishers to adopt them). (6) <b>All</b> repositories <b>should</b> implement the automated "email eprint request" Button (for embargoed [non-OA] deposits). (7) <b>All</b> mandates <b>should</b> designate repository deposit as the sole mechanism for submitting publications for performance review, research assessment, grant application, or grant renewal. (8) <b>All</b> repositories <b>should</b> implement rich usage and citation metrics in the institutional repositories as incentive for compliance...|$|R

25|$|Many {{health care}} {{providers}} are under the false impression that only sterile water, or no lubricant at <b>all,</b> <b>should</b> be used to lubricate the speculum. This may result in unnecessary discomfort. A {{number of studies have}} shown that using a small amount of water-based gel lubricant does not interfere with, obscure, or distort the PAP smear. Further, cytology is not affected, nor are some STD testing.|$|E
25|$|The {{word of the}} Lord came to Jeremiah after King Zedekiah made a {{covenant}} {{with the people of}} Jerusalem to proclaim liberty, that <b>all</b> <b>should</b> let their Hebrew slaves – both men and women – go free, and that none should make bondmen of them. All the princes and people listened and let their Hebrew slaves go free, but afterwards they turned and caused their servants whom they had freed to return to subjugation.|$|E
25|$|On the 20th of September, {{a report}} by the Norwegian {{consulting}} engineering company Multiconsult proposed and recommended that the houses in question, 16 in <b>all,</b> <b>should</b> be bought by the municipality and demolished. A new street would be built over the site of the houses hit by the rocks and mud. The hill over the street would be secured by a steel net secured by steel bolts drilled into the ground. Although this was a more costly solution, it was accepted by the municipality.|$|E

25|$|On 28 October 2011, the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission {{presented}} a timetable in a draft report titled, “how to scrap the Fukushima reactors”. Within 10 years, a start {{should be made}} with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then <b>all</b> <b>should</b> be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning {{would take more than}} 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the reactor vessels are damaged also. After the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage and the fact that 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned all at the same time.|$|E
25|$|In {{compliance}} with his father's express instructions, Abdulmejid immediately {{carried out the}} reforms to which Mahmud II had devoted himself. In November 1839 an edict known as the Hatt-ı Şerif of Gülhane, also known as Tanzimat Fermanı was proclaimed, consolidating and enforcing these reforms. The edict was supplemented {{at the close of}} the Crimean War by a similar statute issued in February 1856, named the Hatt-ı Hümayun. By these enactments it was provided that all classes of the sultan's subjects should have their lives and property protected; that taxes should be fairly imposed and justice impartially administered; and that <b>all</b> <b>should</b> have full religious liberty and equal civil rights. The scheme met with strong opposition from the Muslim governing classes and the ulema, or religious authorities, and was only partially implemented, especially in the remoter parts of the empire. More than one conspiracy was formed against the sultan's life on account of it.|$|E
25|$|Following the First World War, a Land Commission {{was set up}} in 1920 to {{determine}} how much of the land in Nyasaland should be made available for future European settlement and what existing rights of estate tenants should be preserved and what new ones given. The Commission recommended that all permanent rent-free tenancies under non-disturbance clauses should end, but that tenants-at-will should be given some security of tenure. Apart from the elderly or widows, <b>all</b> <b>should</b> pay rents in cash, in kind or by providing labour. The owners should also have the right to evict surplus tenants to stop their estates becoming overcrowded. The Colonial Office opposed abolishing rights under non-disturbance clauses without a long fixed tenancies, and a five-year term was agreed. By the time legislation was prepared in 1928, there was little demand for more plantations, as the existing estates were ending direct production in favour of marketing tenants’ produce. The legislation enacted in 1928 therefore emphasised that rents could be satisfied by delivering a fixed quantity of acceptable crops to the owner as well as by direct labour or in cash. It met some of the estate owners’ demands but also gave some protection to tenants from the worst excesses of thangata.|$|E

25|$|Every party {{except the}} gunshop attacking group {{gathered}} at the Matsue broadcasting station. They requested the station to broadcast their message of uprising but the station master rejected the request. The station was surrounded by 50 armed policemen and 20 soldiers. Okazaki declared {{that he and his}} group were patriots, that the Japanese forces had betrayed them, and that their enemies were traitors. A top Civil Secret Policeman whom Okazaki knew urged negotiations for fear of a gun battle. Okazaki finally surrendered on condition that their party be acquitted, except for himself. Okazaki proposed that <b>all</b> <b>should</b> bow in the direction of Tokyo and all of them present then shouted, Tennō Heika Banzai (Hail to the Emperor). The armed party members went to the Matsue Police Station without any restriction, and then entered the Japanese fencing gym of the police station while Okazaki and the special police chief negotiated. The police chief withdrew his offer made during the previous negotiation since the prosecutor now told him {{that it was impossible to}} release the members. Okazaki protested, but had to accept the situation. Issuing his last message to the members, he attempted seppuku on the abdomen and neck. He was sent unconscious to Matsue Red Cross hospital and survived. All members were investigated at the police station on suspicion of wartime rioting, invasion without permission, postal and gas service obstruction, and violation of rules on explosives. The female members were released the next day and the other members, except for the leaders of each team, were released two days later.|$|E

We <b>all</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to play}} poker on the Web if we want to, and I believe that making it illegal strips us of our rights.
