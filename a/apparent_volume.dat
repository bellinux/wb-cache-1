5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high <b>apparent</b> <b>volume</b> of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has low {{plasma protein}} binding (approximately 31%, but highly variable) and an <b>apparent</b> <b>volume</b> of {{distribution}} at steady state of around 40–50liters. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax) are reached {{one to two}} hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.|$|E

30|$|From Figures  4, 5 and 6; the <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> exhibit {{almost the}} same with {{increasing}} concentration within the examined concentration ranges in this study. Actually, in lower concentration of sodium dodecyl sulphate {{in the presence of}} cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, the <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> were concentration dependent. Such behavior was also noticed by De Lisi et al. 1990 while calculating <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> of alkyltrimethylammonium bromides. But the <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> in lower concentration of sodium dodecyl sulphate in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was not noted in our investigation because of irregular pattern of decrease in <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> at low concentration of surfactants mixture.|$|R
40|$|A Pitzer ion {{interaction}} {{model has been}} applied to the systems H 2 SO 4 ?H 2 O (0 ? 3 mol kg? 1, 0 ? 55 °C) and H 2 SO 4 ?(NH 4) 2 SO 4 ?H 2 O (0 ? 6 mol kg? 1, 25 °C) for the calculation of <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volume</b> and density. The dissociation reaction HSO 4 ?(aq) ? H+(aq) + SO 42 ?(aq) is treated explicitly. <b>Apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> of the SO 42 ? ion at infinite dilution were obtained from part 1 of this work,(1) and the value for the bisulfate ion was determined in this study from 0 to 55 °C. In dilute solutions of both systems, the change in the degree of dissociation of the HSO 4 ? ion with concentration results in much larger variations of the <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> of the solutes than for conventional strong (fully dissociated) electrolytes. Densities and <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> are tabulated. <b>Apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> calculated using the model are combined with other data for the solutes NH 4 HSO 4 and (NH 4) 3 H(SO 4) 2 at 25 °C to obtain <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> and densities over the entire concentration range (including solutions supersaturated with respect to the salts) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of lamotrigine follow first-order kinetics, with a half-life of 29 {{hours and}} volume of distribution of 1.36 L/kg. Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Its absolute bioavailability is 98% and its plasma Cmax occurs from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. Available {{data indicate that}} its bioavailability is not affected by food. Estimate of the mean <b>apparent</b> <b>volume</b> of distribution of lamotrigine following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. This is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Celecoxib was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of COX-2 approved to treat patients with rheumatism and osteoarthritis. A study showed that the absorption rate, when given orally, is moderate, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 2–4 hours. However, the extent of absorption is not well known. Celecoxib has the affinity to bind extensively to plasma proteins, especially to plasma albumin. It has an <b>apparent</b> <b>volume</b> of distribution (VD) of 455 +/- 166 L in humans and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases proportionally to increased oral doses, between 100 and 800mg. Celecoxib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 isoenzyme to carboxylic acid and also by non-CYP-dependent glucuronidation to glucuronide metabolites. The metabolites are excreted in urine and feces, with {{a small proportion of}} unchanged drug (2%) in the urine. Its elimination half-life is about 11 hours (6–12 hours) in healthy individuals, but racial differences in drug disposition and pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly have been reported. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency appear to have 43% lower plasma concentration compared to healthy individuals, with a 47% increase in apparent clearance, and it can be expected that patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment have increased steady-state AUC.|$|E
25|$|Etoricoxib, that is {{used for}} {{patients}} with chronic arthropathies and musculoskeletal and dental pain, is absorbed moderately when given orally. A study on its pharmacokinetics showed that the plasma peak concentration of etoricoxib occurs after approximately 1 hour. It has shown to be extensively bound to plasma albumin (about 90%), and has an <b>apparent</b> <b>volume</b> of distribution (VD) of 120 L in humans. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases in proportion to increased dosage (5–120mg). The elimination half-life is about 20 hours in healthy individuals, and such long half-life enables the choice to have once-daily dosage. Etoricoxib, like the other coxibs, is excreted in urine and feces and also metabolized in likewise manner. CYP3A4 is mostly responsible for biotransformation of etoricoxib to carboxylic acid metabolite, but a non CYP450 metabolism pathway to glucuronide metabolite is also at hand. A very small portion of etoricoxib (<1%) is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency {{do not appear to}} have different plasma concentration curve (AUC) compared to healthy individuals. It has though been reported that patients with moderate hepatic impairment have increased plasma concentration curve (AUC) by approximately 40%. It has been stated that further study is necessary to describe precisely the relevance of pharmacokinetic properties in terms of the clinical benefits and risks of etoricoxib compared to other clinical options.|$|E
30|$|In the {{examined}} concentration ranges, obviously, {{the concentration}} almost independence of <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> follows {{the same pattern}} at all the temperatures and solvent compositions investigated. At each temperature, <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volumes</b> are found to decrease with decreasing relative permittivity by increasing the methanol content in the system. On the other hand, the <b>apparent</b> molar <b>volume</b> is increased in the given system with increasing temperature. This is mostly due to the weakening of surfactant-solvent binding energy with increasing temperature. The same pattern has been also reported by Iqbal and Siddiquah 2006.|$|R
