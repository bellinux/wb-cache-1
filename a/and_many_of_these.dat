5|$|A {{total of}} 11 {{companies}} were ever granted licenses by the BBC to manufacture the model, {{a maximum of}} 3 at any given time. The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, {{if for no other}} reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> companies would have a chequered corporate history. Audible differences could result from the mounting screws, grille fabric, or the origin of the wool.|$|E
5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E

5|$|Although Gillis was not {{exclusively}} used on Post covers, the Willie Gillis series of covers was {{a hallmark of}} Rockwell's wartime work. In Rockwell's prime and {{at the peak of}} its popularity, the Post had a subscribership of 4 million, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> subscribers believed Gillis was a real person. Rockwell's wartime art, including Willie Gillis, the Four Freedoms and Rosie the Riveter, contributed {{to the success of the}} wartime bond sales efforts.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown's fight song is rare among U.S. {{university}} fight {{songs for}} mentioning other colleges by name. Specifically, it mentions Yale University, Harvard University, Princeton University, College of the Holy Cross, the United States Naval Academy, and Cornell University, {{who were all}} rivals of Georgetown {{in the early to}} mid-20th century, and mocks their fight songs. In recent years the Hoyas only play Cornell and Holy Cross regularly (in football), <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> schools no longer use the fight songs that Georgetown's song mocks.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{facilities}} for medical research were limited, but some {{research was conducted}} into the effects of radiation, and the absorption and toxic effects of metals, particularly plutonium and beryllium, mainly {{as a result of}} accidents. The Health Group began conducting urine tests of laboratory workers in early 1945, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> revealed dangerous levels of plutonium. Work on the Water Boiler also occasionally exposed workers to dangerous fission products. There were 24 fatal accidents at Los Alamos between its opening in 1943 and September 1946. Most involved construction workers. Four scientists died, including Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin in criticality accidents involving the demon core.|$|E

5|$|Orangutans may {{be killed}} for the {{bushmeat}} trade, crop protection, or for use for traditional medicine. Orangutan bones are secretly traded in souvenir shops in several cities in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Mother orangutans are killed so their infants {{can be sold}} as pets, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> infants die {{without the help of}} their mother. Since 2004, several pet orangutans were confiscated by local authorities and sent to rehabilitation centres.|$|E
5|$|Poison was {{discovered}} in ancient times, and was used by ancient tribes and civilizations as a hunting tool to quicken and ensure {{the death of their}} prey or enemies. This use of poison grew more advanced, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> ancient peoples began forging weapons designed specifically for poison enhancement. Later in history, particularly {{at the time of the}} Roman Empire, one of the more prevalent uses was assassination. As early as 331 BC, poisonings executed at the dinner table or in drinks were reported, and the practice became a common occurrence. The use of fatal substances was seen among every social class; even the nobility would often use it to dispose of unwanted political or economic opponents.|$|E
5|$|Application {{of social}} {{sustainability}} requires stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Coral reefs {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral reefs are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the reefs.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolutionary War {{there were}} {{fears of a}} French attack on London. In 1780, the Army carried out a {{practice}} attack on the fort with 5,000 soldiers, but there were less than 60 guns left at the fort <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were in poor condition. Thomas Hyde Page inspected Tilbury in 1788 and reported that the defences facing the Thames were seriously inadequate. As a consequence, a new battery {{was built in the}} south-east corner of the defences, armed with 32-pounders (14.5 kg) pointing down-river, and a new battery, New Tavern Fort, was built along the river to the east. Fears continued during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and smaller batteries were constructed further up the river in 1794. Tilbury continued to be {{an essential part of the}} capital's defences because of its control of the crossing point on the Thames, and the guns were upgraded with new traversing platforms; the Gravesend Volunteer Artillery was formed to man the forts on both sides of the river. During the invasion scare of 1803, the Royal Trinity House Volunteer Artillery manned ten armed hulks placed across the river as a barrier at Tilbury.|$|E
5|$|Large mammals {{found in}} the city {{includes}} urbanized coyotes and numerous whitetail deer. Eastern gray squirrel, and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal opossum and raccoon. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally {{be seen on the}} MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> areas are home to wildlife.|$|E

5|$|Major General James Robertson confiscated {{surviving}} uninhabited {{homes of}} known Patriots and assigned them to British officers. Churches, {{other than the}} state churches (Church of England) were converted into prisons, infirmaries, or barracks. Some of the common soldiers were billeted with civilian families. There was a great influx of Loyalist refugees into the city resulting in further overcrowding, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> returning and additional Loyalists from Patriot-controlled areas encamped in squalid tent cities on the charred ruins. The fire convinced the British to put the city under martial law rather than returning it to civilian authorities. Crime and poor sanitation were persistent problems during the British occupation, which did not end until they evacuated the city on November 25, 1783.|$|E
5|$|The Palace Museum holds {{close to}} 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date {{from before the}} Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). This is the largest such {{collection}} in China. The collection {{is based on the}} palace collection in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as Qianlong meant that the palace held {{one of the most important}} collections of paintings in Chinese history. However, a significant portion of this collection was lost over the years. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, many of the works were moved to Taiwan. The collection has subsequently been replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.|$|E
5|$|Worlebury Camp (also {{known as}} Worlebury Hillfort) {{is the site}} of an Iron Age hillfort on Worlebury Hill, north of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, England. The fort was {{designed}} for defence, as is evidenced by the number of walls and ditches around the site. Several large triangular platforms have been uncovered around the sides of the fort, lower down on the hillside. Nearly one hundred storage pits of various sizes were cut into the bedrock, <b>and</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> had human remains, coins, and other artefacts in them. During the 19th and 20th centuries the fort has suffered damage and been threatened with complete destruction on multiple occasions. The site has been designated a Scheduled monument; it falls within the Weston Woods Local Nature Reserve which was declared to Natural England by North Somerset Council in 2005.|$|E
