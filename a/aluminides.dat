The hardness measurements on the cross-section of nonmodified and platinum or palladium modified <b>aluminide</b> coatings were performed. Oxidation tests of modified <b>aluminide</b> coatings at the 1100 ◦C for 1000 h in the air atmosphere were carried out.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} the {{oxidation}} resistance of palladium modified <b>aluminide</b> coatings deposited by CVD method on nickel-based superalloy was evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: Palladium coatings 3 and 7 µm thick were deposited by the electroplating process. The heat treatment of electroplating coatings at the temperature 1050 °C for 2 h under argon atmosphere was performed. Low activity CVD aluminizing process of palladium heat treated coatings (3 and 7 µm thick) at the 1050 ºC for 8 h using IonBond equipment was performed. Oxidation resistance was evaluated at 1100 ºC for 1000 h in air atmosphere using furnace of Czylok company. The microstructure investigations of palladium modified <b>aluminide</b> coatings {{were conducted by}} the use of optical microscope (Nikon Epiphot 300) and a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S- 3400 N) equipped with an Energy Dispersive Spectroscope EDS (VOYAGER of NORAN INSTRUMENTS). The phase composition was identified by X-ray (ARL X’TRAX) diffractometer. The surface roughness parameter - Ra of modified <b>aluminide</b> coatings was evaluated by Perthometer S 2 MAHR equipment. Findings: The microstructure of palladium modified <b>aluminide</b> coatings (3 and 7 µm thick) consists of (Ni,Pd) Al phase and two zones: outer and internal one. Low activity CVD aluminizing at 1050 ºC for 8 h causes the increase of surface roughness parameter of modified coatings. The increase of platinum thickness from 3 to 7 µm causes a greater surface roughness of <b>aluminide</b> coatings. On the ground of the obtained results, it was found that palladium modification of <b>aluminide</b> coatings to increases the oxidation resistance of CMSX 4 Ni-base superalloy. Practical implications: The palladium modified <b>aluminide</b> coatings are used as an alternative for platinum modified <b>aluminide</b> coatings in turbine blades of aircraft engines.

40|$|To take {{advantage}} of the synergistic effects of Pt and Zr, a kind of Zr-doped, Pt-modified <b>aluminide</b> coating has been prepared by a hybrid process, first electroplating a Pt layer and then co-depositing Zr and Al elements by an above-the-pack process.

Results showed that the Zr-doped, Pt-modified <b>aluminide</b> coating was primarily composed of β-(Ni,Pt) Al phase, with small amounts of PtAl 2 - and Zr-rich phases dispersed in it. The addition of Zr diminished voids on the coating surface since Zr could hinder the growth of β-NiAl grains.

50|$|The {{bond coat}} adheres the {{thermal barrier coating}} to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the bond coat provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the <b>aluminides,</b> the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. <b>Aluminides</b> also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to hot corrosion. The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of bond coat and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the growth of grain boundaries (which can lead to flaking of the coating). Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where mechanical demands are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. Nickel-chromium coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. Nickel-chromium coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and laser glazed, while pure nickel-chromium coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|E

Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0 °C and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5) is a white solid with a melting point of 247.4 °C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride (TaCl4). While the trihalides can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen, the dihalides do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.As in the cases of most other refractory metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides.

The interaction of low pressure hydrogen with gamma titanium <b>aluminide</b> and beryllium was found to be relatively weak.

40|$|New high {{temperature}} resistant materials are necessary {{to increase the efficiency}} of combustion engines and thus fulfil current environmental regulations. Al-Cu cast alloys are potential candidates for cylinder head production. They show higher tensile and low cycle fatigue strength than the widespread Al-Si alloys, approaching even some grades of ductile iron. However, they have been rarely used for serial production owing to castability problems. In this work, the evolution of the microstructure of the cast B 206 (AlCu 4. 8 Mn 0. 24 Mg 0. 33), AlCu 7 (AlCu 6. 5 Mn 0. 4 Zr 0. 22) and AF 52 (AlCu 4. 7 Mn 0. 4 Ti 0. 17) alloys is investigated by two dimensional (2 D) and three dimensional (3 D) methods as a function of solution treatment (ST) time at 530 °C. Their tensile, compressive and thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) behaviour is correlated with the 3 D microstructural changes provoked by ST. Furthermore, the damage accumulation during RT tensile tests is investigated three dimensionally by means of synchrotron tomography. Part of the highly interconnected <b>aluminides</b> segregated during casting dissolves during the first 4 h of ST. The dissolution of Cu into the -Al matrix provokes a strength increase in all the alloys owing to precipitation hardening. The strengthening of the alloys after ST is approximated as an increase proportional to the capability of the -Al matrix to dissolve Cu atoms. The B 206 alloy shows the largest strength and strengthening potential after ST. The volume fraction (Vf) of <b>aluminides</b> remains constant for longer ST times, as well as the strength of the alloys. All the alloys experience an increase in ductility after the first 4 h of ST. The AF 52 alloy is in any ST condition the most ductile alloy at RT and at 250 °C followed by B 206 and AlCu 7. This is due to two different factors: i) the different kind of <b>aluminides</b> present and ii) the effect of the solution treatment. On one hand, needle / platelet-like Al 7 CuFe (-Fe) <b>aluminides</b> are only present in B 206 and AlCu 7. These <b>aluminides</b> are more detrimental in terms of ductility than the pseudo-chinese script Al 6 (CuMnFe) (-Fe) <b>aluminides</b> present in the AF 52 alloy. Moreover <b>aluminides</b> in the B 206 and AlCu 7 alloys present a larger fraction of concave regions with small curvature radii than the AF 52 alloy. These regions act as stress concentrators and lead to a crack formation during tensile deformation. On the other hand, the ST reduces the <b>aluminides</b> volume fraction and partially dissolves the 3 D <b>aluminides</b> network. Since cracks tend to initiate and propagate through the <b>aluminides</b> network, the ST provokes a reduction of crack nucleation sites and propagation paths. Damage mainly occurs in the form of cracks generated at large <b>aluminides</b> oriented perpendicularly to the loading direction. These cracks propagate through the <b>aluminides</b> network in alloys with large <b>aluminides</b> Vf, which implies <b>aluminides</b> networks with high interconnectiviy and connectedness. Shrinkage pores do not {{play a significant role in}} the damage generation process, particularly for the AlCu 7 alloy. Porosity growth with further crack propagation through the <b>aluminides</b> network represents the other damage accumulation mechanism, proper of alloys with lower <b>aluminides</b> Vf. This occurs partially in the B 206 alloy and particularly in the AF 52 alloy. Void generation in the -Al matrix takes place only at elevated temperature, i. e. 250 °C.

The kinetic of oxidation of zirconium modified and nonmodified <b>aluminide</b> coatings was similar. Oxides inclusions called pegs were observed on the surface of oxidized <b>aluminide</b> coating. HfO 2 oxide is more stable than Al 2 O 3 oxide, hafnium atoms can replace aluminum atoms in Al 2 O 3 oxides. This phenomena let to stabilize NiAl phase and increase of oxidation resistance of <b>aluminide</b> coating...|$|R
