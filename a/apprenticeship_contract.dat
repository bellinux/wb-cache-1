Thus, the inclusion of these two types of contracts in our sample may bias downwards the negative effect of holding temporary contracts on the probability of training. In column [6] we present estimates using the restricted sample of temporary contracts. Given that the number of training and <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>contracts</b> is very small (28 observations), the difference with the previous estimate is almost negligible.|$|R

50|$|A law on {{vocational}} training in February 1984 established employment contracts {{for six months}} for further {{training on the job}} while taking courses.

A 1983 law on apprenticeships laid down the principle that apprenticeship is a method of giving young workers having completed schooling a general theoretical and practical training, for the purpose of acquiring professional qualifications leading to technology diplomas. The law laid down a number of general rules on apprenticeship. Training is organised on the basis of alternation, part in industry, and part in theapprenticeship centre, while a contractual relationship must be created between the apprentice and the employer, by means of an <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>contract.</b> A higher education law of 1983 restored democratic representation on university councils and granted the universities greater autonomy and more power to conduct research and to make contacts with industry.|$|E
50|$|Denmark {{provides}} {{vocational education}} and training programs for those aged 16 and older. Vocational education typically consists of two to four years. It includes a mixture of theoretical courses with practical training in apprenticeships. The vocational education system {{is divided into two}} parts: the basic course and main course. The basic course ranging from 10 to 60 weeks includes attending classes with compulsory and optional subjects. The optional subjects provide the student with opportunities to acquire qualifications. The length of the basic course varies with the program. For the main course, students find a contract with a firm for an apprenticeship for two to three years. Firms receive subsidies to hire and train apprentices. The cost for an apprentice is half the cost for an ordinary employee. The wage received by an apprentice is attractive for a young person, being an average 60% higher than the state education grant. If they are not able to find an <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>contract,</b> youth find themselves in another program or continue in general upper secondary education programs.|$|E

40|$|Approximately {{half of all}} <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>contracts</b> in {{the trades}} are not completed. This review draws {{together}} existing research and data {{to find out why}} apprentices do not complete their training. Introduction: The aim of this review is to collate the existing research on the reasons why apprentices do not complete their training. The focus is on understanding the non-completion of trade apprentices, as attrition in these areas is generally viewed with particular concern. An <b>apprenticeship</b> involves a <b>contract</b> between the apprentice and their employer, together with an arrangement with a training provider. Apart from these core players, apprenticeships take place within a wider system that is influenced by government policies and incentives, industry bodies and community attitudes. With this in mind, an examination of why apprentices discontinue their training needs to be approached from several angles. The first section presents a snapshot of the apprenticeship system and the current rates of completion. Approximately half of all <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>contracts</b> are not completed, with some variation across states and occupations. Several data issues complicate the measurement of completion rates, but even accounting for these, completion rates are low. The first section presents a snapshot of the apprenticeship system and the current rates of completion. Approximately half of all <b>apprenticeship</b> <b>contracts</b> are not completed, with some variation across states and occupations. Several data issues complicate the measurement of completion rates, but even accounting for these, completion rates are low. Next, the employer’s role is examined more closely, as issues with the employment experience are frequently cited by non-completers. The characteristics of employers with high and low completion rates are examined. Employers with the highest completion rates tend to be larger, experienced employers with well-organised systems for managing apprentices. Smaller, less experienced employers tend to have lower completion rates. Given this discrepancy, we pay particular attention to the types of strategies employed by firms with high apprentice completion rates. These include rigorous recruitment processes, formal work plans and mentoring support services. The training provider and opportunities for improving the training experience are the focus of the next section. The main problems are inflexible delivery options, poor feedback about apprentice progress, and the literacy and numeracy difficulties of apprentices. The penultimate section considers the value of completing — if completion does not offer sufficient reward, it may explain the low completion rates. Benefits are examined in terms of wage premiums and employment prospects, and whether qualifications are considered necessary to work as a tradesperson. One finding is that the premium attached to becoming a qualified tradesperson is significant, but is not always enough to offset the opportunity cost of undertaking training, particularly for adult apprentices. Finally, we summarise the main findings and suggest opportunities for future policy developments. Given that apprentices often leave because they do not like the work or it didn’t meet their expectations, more effort could be put into the selection process. Further, an employer accreditation process may help to ensure that only those employers with sufficient training capacity are permitted to take on apprentices; careful consideration of employer incentive payments may also help in this regard. There is also scope to consider alternative apprenticeship models, specifically those that reduce the pressure on employers...|$|R
