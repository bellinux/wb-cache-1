50|$|A Second {{method to}} ensure the {{eutectic}} metal adheres on the Si wafer is by using an <b>adhesion</b> <b>layer.</b> This thin intermediate metal layer adheres well to the oxide and the eutectic metal. Well suitable metals for an Au-Si compound are titanium (Ti) and chromium (Cr) resulting in, e.g. Si-SiO2-Ti-Au or Si-SiO2-Cr-Au. The <b>adhesion</b> <b>layer</b> is used {{to break up the}} oxide by diffusion of silicon into the used material. A typical wafer is composed of a silicon wafer with oxide, 30 - 200 nm Ti or Cr layer and Au layer of > 500 nm thickness.|$|E
50|$|The surface {{preparation}} {{is the most}} important step to accomplish a successful eutectic bonding. This bonding procedure is due to oxide presence on the silicon substrates very limited based on the poor wettability of Au on the oxide layer. This leads to a poor adhesion of the eutectic bond. The oxide on the silicon surface acts as a diffusion barrier. The {{surface preparation}}'s main task is to facilitate the deposition of the eutectic metal by oxide removal or <b>adhesion</b> <b>layer</b> deposition.|$|E
50|$|Oxidation and {{impurities}} in {{the metal}} films affect the diffusion reactions by reducing the diffusion rates. Therefore, clean deposition practices and bonding with oxide removal and re-oxidation prevention steps are applied. The oxide layer removal can be realized by various oxide etch chemistry methods. Dry etching processes, i.e. formic acid vapor cleaning, are preferred based on the minimization of the immersion in fluids and the resulting etching of the passivation or the <b>adhesion</b> <b>layer.</b> Using the CMP process, which is especially for Cu and Al required, creates a planarized surface with micro roughness around several nanometer and enables the achievement of void-free diffusion bonds. Further, a surface treatment for organic removal, e.g. UV-ozone exposure, is possible.|$|E

50|$|The MWNTs are {{synthesized}} by the arc-discharge technique, {{suspended in}} 1,2-dichlorobenzene and deposited on degenerately doped silicon substrates with a 1 µm of SiO2. The MWNT can be aligned according to pre-made markings on the substrate {{by using an}} atomic force microscope (AFM) or a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The rotor, electrodes and the 'in-plane' stators are patterned using electron beam lithography using an appropriately masked photo-resist. Gold with a chromium <b>adhesion</b> <b>layer</b> is thermally evaporated, lifted off in acetone and then annealed at 400 °C to ensure better electrical and mechanical contact with the MWNT. The rotor measures 250-500 nm on a side. An HF etch is then used to remove sufficient thickness (500 nm of SiO2) of the substrate {{to make room for}} the rotor when it rotates. The Si substrate serves as the gate stator. The MWNT at this point displays a very high torsional spring constant (10−15 to 10−13 N m with resonant frequencies in the tens of megahertz), hence, preventing large angular displacements. To overcome this, one or more outer MWNT shells are compromised or removed in the region between the anchors and the rotor plate. One simple way to accomplish this is by successively applying very large stator voltages (around 80 V DC) that cause mechanical fatigue and eventually shear the outer shells of the MWNT. An alternative method involves the reduction of the outermost MWNT tubes to smaller, wider concentric nanotubes beneath the rotor plate.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{moisture}} on the mechanical properties of one commercial solid fiberboard grade {{and on the}} compression strength of mill-fabricated transport boxes made from this material were studied. The solid fiberboard (1220 g/m 2) has four middle layers made of old corrugated container (OCC). The middle layers are strongly internally sized with rosin sizing. The outer layers on both sides are made of bleached machine finished kraft paper. The kraft paper has extrusion coated low-density polyethylene (LDPE) doublelayer as moisture barrier. The six paper and paperboard layers are glued together in an industrial lamination process. The boxes have unusual design including double-panel walls and webbed corners, and they are used in wet and humid conditions for transporting fresh round fish. The transportation takes up to eight days at the ambient environment of 4 °C and 90 - 100 % RH. These conditions are taken as {{the framework of the}} study. Results show that the LDPE coating considerably slows down the transverse moisture penetration. The in-plane diffusivity (5. 9 · 10 - 10 m 2 /s, 27 °C, 50 / 90 % RH) was determined with an integrated unsteady state moisture transport model and was found to be nine times higher than the transverse diffusivity through the PE layer. Based on the diffusivity, water vapor can theoretically affect 80 mm from the open unsealed board edge during transport. Experiments show that liquid water penetrates 40 - 50 mm during eight days. In the middle of the sheet the moisture content increases moderately, approximately 0. 3 percentage points during transport. The packaging producer’s main concern is thus to ensure that the open material edges are at least 80 mm away from the load bearing sections of the box. Due to uneven moisture penetration into the boxes, the average moisture of a box is a questionable measure {{of moisture}} pick-up. Instead one should consider the moisture content of the load bearing parts. The role of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>layers</b> in bending stiffness of the solid paperboard was modeled with laminate models. Results show that the <b>adhesion</b> <b>layers</b> affect the mechanical properties of the combined board and need to be addressed in the models. Best agreement with the measured bending stiffness values was obtained by a 11 -layer model, where the properties of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>layers</b> are taken from the paper-glue-paper sandwich tests. The PE and kraft paper are regarded as one layer in the model. With this model, the calculated bending stiffnesses are close to the measured reference at 50 % RH in MD (difference 1 %). In 90 % RH and in MD the results are 14 % lower. Neglecting the <b>adhesion</b> <b>layers</b> gives 5 % lower values in 50 % RH and 18 % in 90 % RH compared to the reference measurement in MD. In each of the cases, the difference from reference is larger for the CD material direction. Three thickness measurement techniques (ISO, STFI, and SEM) were used to gather input data for the bending stiffness model. In this application, the ISO technique provided best results compared to the other techniques. It was found that the top-to bottom failure of a box can be expressed as a critical vertical displacement that is independent of moisture content. Similar results have been previously discovered when studying simpler structures like corrugated board panels and regular slotted containers (RSC). This research indicates that the strain dependent failure criterion also applies on more complex box structures.
