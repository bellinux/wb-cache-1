40|$|International audienceComfort may be {{considered}} as the material aspect of well-being, and its limitation, defined as discomfort, exacerbates both the patient's and caregivers' difficulties. Discomfort results from the interaction of a patient's environment, treatment, and from the nature and severity of elementary deficits, such as spasticity, ranges of motion, pain, postural disorders, motor deficit and fatigue, bladder problems, insufficient ventilatory control, and also psychological difficulties. Although discomfort reduction may represent a major challenge in disabled persons, discomfort is usually underestimated in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> disabilities, handicap, and even in quality of life (QOL) estimations. In this paper, we explain why discomfort may be a crucial problem in severe multiple sclerosis (MS) and argue for a systematic assessment of discomfort in the follow-up of the disease, especially in the following domains: dressing, washing, maintaining posture in a wheelchair and bed, food intake, mastication and swallowing, bowel control, urinary and feces emission, and also sexual life. The way to enhance comfort in MS patients is then analyzed...|$|E

Better bacterial inactivation was observed with higher ultraviolet (UV) doses. There {{is a need}} for better tank configuration (hydraulic performance) to ensure proper water circulation or a need to suppress microbial recovery. Addition of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) during UV irradiation was effective in controlling microbial recovery. 2. Higher water temperature enhanced the fouling rate on quartz sleeves, revealing the need for more frequent cleaning of UV tubes to remove the fouling and enable higher UV transmittance for bacterial inactivation. 3. In a fish tank setup, better water circulation facilitates the UV disinfection system and minimises dead zones. This can be achieved by diagonal positioned inlets and the outlets, providing inlet baffles, and enabling better artificial mixing with oxygen diffusers. 4.

FCM provides a powerful advantage over microscopy technique in terms of rapid, accurate and reproducible technology for the quantification of various cell characteristics, including chromatin status. During spermiogenesis, histones are replaced by protamines resulting in a very condensed structure of sperm chromatin.

Flow cytometry is the most suitable tool to improve assessment accuracy, {{both in terms of}} statistical analysis and for prevention of observer variation. This study provides a simple procedure to account for merocyanine 540 (M 540) or apoptotic bodies, which result in underestimation of the percentage of CMA 3 positivity, by using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the percentage of CMA 3 by PI staining to exclude M 540 bodies that prevent underestimation of CMA 3 staining.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Respiratory chain (RC) {{deficiencies}} {{are found}} in primary mtDNA diseases. Focal RC defects are also associated with ageing and neurodegenerative disorders, e. g. in substantia nigra (SN) neurons from Parkinson's disease patients. In mitochondrial disease and ageing, mtDNA mutational loads vary considerably between neurons necessitating single cell-based <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> RC <b>deficiencies.</b> Evaluating the full extent <b>of</b> RC <b>deficiency</b> within SN neurons is challenging because their size precludes investigations in serial sections. We developed an assay to measure RC abnormalities in individual SN neurons using quadruple immunofluorescence. NEW METHOD: Using antibodies against subunits of complex I (CI) and IV, porin and tyrosine hydroxylase together with IgG subtype-specific fluorescent labelled secondary antibodies, we quantified the expression of CI and CIV compared to mitochondrial mass in dopaminergic neurons. CI:porin and CIV:porin ratios were determined relative to a standard control. RESULTS: Quantification of expression of complex subunits in midbrain sections from patients with mtDNA disease and known RC deficiencies consistently showed reduced CI:porin and/or CIV:porin ratios. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S) : The standard histochemical method to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction, the cytochrome c oxidase/succinate dehydrogenase assay, measures CIV and CII activities. To also study CI in a patient, immunohistology in additional sections, i. e. in different neurons, is required. Our method allows correlation of the expression of CI, CIV and mitochondrial mass at a single cell level. CONCLUSION: Quantitative quadruple-label immunofluorescence is a reliable tool to measure RC deficiencies in individual neurons that will enable new insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying inherited and acquired mitochondrial dysfunction...|$|R
