In most BPM applications, the semantics of BPs needed for runtime management is often scattered across BP models, execution engines, and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>stores</b> of workflow systems.

40|$|Abstract We {{explore the}} {{complexity}} relationships between finite automata endowed with various data structures as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>stores.</b> It is {{shown that a}} queue automata, a finite state machine endowed {{with one or more}} queues, are Turing Equivalent. A finite automata with two stacks can simulate a (one) queue automata in constant amortized time per operation simulated. The converse question, simulating a (one) stack machine by a queue machine is not satisfactorily resolved. We give an O (n log n) amortized cost solution using a generalized queue automata. Introduction We explore the relationship between stacks, queues and double-ended queues. In practice, efficient methods exist for simulation of one of these data structures with another. These methods do not treat stacks and queues as primitive objects, and make recourse to auxiliary structures. Our goal is to investigate the necessity of these auxiliary structures. Hence, we consider a different model of computation in which stacks and queues are primitive objects admitting to a certain number of unit cost operations and having no discernible internal structure...|$|R

40|$|During the 2013 [...] 2014 {{shutdown}} of the Large Hadron Collider, ATLAS {{switched to a}} new event data model for analysis, called the xAOD. A key feature of this model is {{the separation of the}} object data from the objects themselves (the `auxiliary store'). Rather being stored as member variables of the analysis classes, all object data are stored separately, as vectors of simple values. Thus, the data are stored in a `structure of arrays' format, while the user still can access it as an `array of structures'. This organization allows for on-demand partial reading of objects, the selective removal of object properties, and the addition of arbitrary user-defined properties in a uniform manner. It also improves performance by increasing the locality of memory references in typical analysis code. The resulting data structures can be written to ROOT files with data properties represented as simple ROOT tree branches. This talk will focus on the design and implementation of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>store</b> and its interaction with ROOT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} verifying the safety of wellstructured transition systems (WSTS) with auxiliary storage. WSTSs with storage are automata that have (possibly) infinitely many control states along with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>store,</b> but which have a well-quasi-ordering {{on the set of}} control states. The set of reachable configurations of the automaton may themselves not be well-quasi-ordered {{because of the presence of}} the extra store. We {{consider the}} coverability problem for such systems, which asks if it is possible to reach a control state (with some store value) that covers some given control state. Our main result shows that if control state reachability is decidable for automata with some store and finitely many control states then the coverability problem can be decided for WSTSs (with infinitely many control states) and the same store, provided the ordering on the control states has some special property. The special property we require is defined in terms of the existence of a ranking function compatible with the transition relation. We then show that there are several classes of infinite state systems that can be viewed as WSTSs with an auxiliary storage. These observations can then be used to both reestablish old decidability results, as well as discover new ones. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Hub Labeling {{algorithm}} (HL) is {{an exact}} shortest path algorithm with excellent query performance on some classes of problems. It precomputes some <b>auxiliary</b> information (<b>stored</b> as a label) for each vertex, and its query performance depends {{only on the}} label size. While there are polynomial-time approximation algorithms to find labels of ap-proximately optimal size, practical solutions use hierarchical hub labels (HHL), which are faster to compute but offer no guarantee on the la-bel size. We improve the theoretical and practical performance of the HL approximation algorithms, enabling us to compute such labels for moderately large problems. Our comparison shows that HHL algorithms scale much better and find labels that usually are {{not much bigger than}} the theoretically justified HL labels. ...|$|R

40|$|After a bounded {{update to}} a database, a first-order {{incremental}} evaluation system (abbreviated foies) derives the new answer to an expensive database query by applying a first-order query {{on the old}} answer and perhaps some <b>stored</b> <b>auxiliary</b> relations.

It turns out that nondeterministic foies are more powerful than the deterministic ones: deterministic foies using auxiliary relations with arity 3 ̆c= k are shown to be strictly weaker than their nondeterministic counterparts for each k 3 ̆e 1, and it is shown that there is a simple query which has a nondeterministic foies with binary auxiliary relations but does not have any deterministic foies with auxiliary relations of any arity.
