The results from the Fisher statistic of both the Wald test and the Johansen test confirm {{the presence of a}} long-run relationship among the variables under investigation. The stability of estimated parameters has been tested, while Granger causality tests recommend a short-run unidirectional causality running from economic growth <b>and</b> combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption to CO 2 emissions, a bidirectional causality between economic growth <b>and</b> combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption and unidirectional causality running from economic growth <b>and</b> combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption to international tourism. In the long-run, the error correction terms confirm the presence of bidirectional causality relationships between economic growth, CO 2 emissions, combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption, and international tourism. Our long-run estimates show that combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption increases international tourism, <b>and</b> both <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption and international tourism increase CO 2 emissions and output. We recommend that (i) Tunisia should use more combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste energy as this eliminates wastes from touristic zones and increases the number of tourist arrivals, leading to economic growth, and (ii) a fraction of this economic growth generated by the increase in combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption should be invested in clean renewable energy production (i. e., solar, wind, geothermal) and energy efficiency projects...|$|R

Univariate innovation diffusion models fail to account for competition and substitution dynamics, whose understanding may be crucial both for policy implications and forecasting. In this paper we propose the application of two diffusion models for a duopolistic competition, unrestricted and standard UCRCD, to the annual time series of consumption of nuclear <b>and</b> <b>renewables</b> (wind <b>and</b> solar energy) in Germany. The data suggest a substitution effect between nuclear <b>and</b> <b>renewables.</b> Interestingly, the obtained results confirm this first conjecture <b>and</b> show that <b>renewables</b> exerted a significant and measurable effect in determining the observed decline of nuclear power consumption...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the causal relationship between combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption, exports {{and economic growth}} for a panel of eleven Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries for the period 1975 - 2008. We use the Granger causality and the vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate both the short-run and the long-run dynamic relationship between these variables. The results from the panel Granger causality test indicate that in the short-run economic growth has a positive and statically significant impact on exports. However, there is no causal link between economic growth <b>and</b> combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption, and between exports <b>and</b> combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption. In the long-run, {{the results from the}} panel error correction model indicate that there is evidence of long-run causality from economic growth and exports to combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption and from economic growth <b>and</b> combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste consumption to real exports. The policy implication of this finding is that combustible <b>renewables</b> <b>and</b> waste is not sufficiently used in private or public industrial sectors in emerging economies, and the consumption policy reserved for production encourages households to use fossil fuels or renewable energy. ...|$|R
