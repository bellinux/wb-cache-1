5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the bumper blocks {{at the end of}} the track, crashing into the wall {{at the end of the}} line.

5|$|After leaving Bradford City, {{he joined}} Sheffield United, {{where he also}} took up a {{coaching}} role. When he retired in 2004, he remained at Sheffield United as assistant to Neil Warnock. Working alongside Warnock and learning the managerial ropes from him, he helped mastermind The Blades' promotion to the Premier League in 2006. United were relegated to the Championship {{on the final day}} of the 2006–07 season and Warnock resigned three days later. McCall had already decided that the 2006–07 season would be his last as assistant manager, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> overlooked as a successor to the United manager's position, in favour of Bryan Robson, he decided to leave after five years with the club.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, bringing Lindwall to the crease. Miller's innings was {{noted for its}} driving <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> out for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker {{had been the only}} multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
5|$|Enemies of the Association soon fought back. George Henderson, {{the range}} detective who had pinned Ella Watson, {{was murdered by}} rustlers near Sweetwater Creek in October 1890, an obvious taunt to the Association. The cattle barons soon {{tightened}} their control and hunted down those who tried to oppose them. The double lynching of the Averells {{was followed by the}} lynching of Tom Waggoner, a horse trader from Newcastle, in June 1891. A friend of Waggoner named Jimmy the Butcher, who was once arrested for rustling the Standard Cattle Company, was also murdered. Range detective Tom Smith killed a suspected rustler, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> indicted for murder, political connections of the Association secured his release. These killings would precipitate more hostilities and violence in the years to come.|$|E

5|$|Life in Nelson {{remained}} {{difficult for}} Heaphy, who had by now lost his appetite for exploration. He eked {{out a living}} taking occasional jobs {{for the next six}} months. For much of 1847, he undertook survey work around Tasman Bay and later in that year was the representative of the New Zealand Company, when the government investigated the amount of land set aside by the company for the local Māori. Work had dried up by early 1848 <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> offered employment with the Auckland Survey Office in April 1848, he accepted.|$|E
5|$|Nani {{was born}} on 17 November 1986 in Praia, the capital of Cape Verde, off the West African coast. Nani emigrated {{with his family to}} Portugal at an early age. He was raised by his aunt Antónia in the Santa Filomena estate in the Amadora {{district}} of Lisbon after being abandoned by his parents. At age five, his father left for a holiday in Cape Verde but never returned, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 12 years old, his mother left Portugal {{to start a new life}} in the Netherlands. Nani has nine siblings from his mother, of which he is the youngest, and five from his father. Nani gained his nickname from an elder sister at a young age.|$|E
5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including {{the taxi driver}} who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene.

The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E

5|$|Production {{was plagued}} with problems. Bad weather during the {{shooting}} {{was a constant}} source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00, Howell, who was {{in charge}} of a post to the right of the line, noticed the {{battalion}} on the right flank was being forced out of its trench and was beginning to retire. Immediately alerting battalion headquarters, Captain Alexander MacKenzie—who had assumed temporary command of the battalion—hurriedly organised a group of non-combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a road bank in order to fend off the expected German advance. A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion, Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along the trench line throwing bombs down on the Germans, all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb fire. Forcing the Germans back along the trench, Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along the trench firing bursts from his Lewis Gun. Soon exhusting his supply of bombs, Howell began to attack with his bayonet until he fell into the trench wounded. Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> brought into the clearing station some hours later, it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty-eight separate wounds. Due to his actions, the ground which had been lost was soon retaken, and the German attack was later repulsed.|$|E
5|$|Graduating from Richardson High in 1959, Rice {{completed}} {{her freshman year}} at Texas Woman's University in Denton and transferred to North Texas State College for her sophomore year, but dropped out when {{she ran out of}} money and was unable to find employment. She soon decided to move to San Francisco, and received permission from her friend, Dennis Percy, to stay with his family there until she found work as an insurance claims processor. She persuaded her former roommate from Texas Woman's University, Ginny Mathis, to join her, and they found an apartment in the Haight-Ashbury district. Mathis acquired a job at the same insurance company as Rice. Soon after, they began taking night courses at University of San Francisco, an all-male Jesuit school that allowed women to take night courses. For Easter vacation Anne returned home to Texas, rekindling her relationship with Stan Rice. After her return to San Francisco, Stan Rice came for a week-long visit during summer break. He returned to Texas, Rice moved back in with the Percys, and Mathis left San Francisco in August to enroll in a nursing program in Oklahoma. Some time later, Anne received a special delivery letter from Stan Rice asking her to marry him. They married on October 14, 1961, in Denton, Texas, soon after she turned twenty years old, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just weeks from his nineteenth birthday.|$|E

5|$|His {{mother left}} {{soon after he}} was born, and his father {{remarried}} and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents. The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music. Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, he sang gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with other citizens of Abbott. Nelson disliked picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age 13, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about thirteen, his mother arranged {{for him to have}} painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|Leyland {{missed a}} {{substantial}} amount of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger, barely playing in July, and missing the Test series against New Zealand. He scored 1,306 runs at 36.27 and took 19 wickets. Injuries continued to trouble him in 1938. He scored 1,884 first class runs at 43.81, but a shoulder strain early in the season adversely affected his form. He was not selected for the first three Tests against Australia, not least as the England side contained several promising batsmen. However, he had his best season with the ball. A succession of hard, dry wickets gave fewer opportunities to orthodox spinners and Leyland took 63 wickets at 19.32. Early in the season, he took eight for 63 against Hampshire, the best figures of his career. Just as his batting form returned, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> likely to be recalled to the England side, Leyland broke his thumb in a match against Middlesex. However, he recovered in time to play in the final Test of the series. Australia's victory in the fourth Test had given the team a 1–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|Lieber began 2007 on the DL with a {{strained}} right oblique, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> activated on April 9, {{he was placed}} in the bullpen. After two relief outings, he returned to the rotation on April 20 when Brett Myers was moved to the bullpen. On June 9, he struck out 11 and allowed three hits in a 40 shutout of the Royals. At the time, he was 34 with a 3.72 ERA, but he allowed 14 runs (13 earned) over his next two starts, both losses. On June 23, Lieber was placed on the DL with a ruptured tendon in his right foot, which ended his tenure with the Phillies. In 14 games (12 starts), he had a 36 record, a 4.73 ERA, 54 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 91 hits allowed in 78 innings. The Phillies reached the playoffs, but Lieber was left off their postseason roster because of his injury.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
5|$|Sisler {{was born}} on October16, 1931, in St. Louis, Missouri, to George Sisler, a Baseball Hall of Fame player, and Kathleen. He played {{baseball}} in high school <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 16 {{he went to work}} for his father who was a coach in the Brooklyn Dodgers organization. Dave kept statistics and was occasionally allowed to pitch. The Dodgers did not envision a future with him and did not pursue a contract due to his commitment to Princeton and future military obligation. Sisler was signed by the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) after his time with Princeton, and began his professional baseball career at the age of 21in 1953 for the Albany Senators in the class-A Eastern League. He pitched in 21games that season, 20 as their starting pitcher; he had a 12–7win–loss record, an ERA of 2.60 in 135innings pitched. He did not play professional baseball in either 1954 or 1955 due to his active military service.|$|E
