5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and feed on skin <b>and</b> <b>debris,</b> while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E
40|$|This {{activity}} utilizes existing NOAA weather RADAR imagery {{to locate}} meteorite falls <b>and</b> space <b>debris</b> falls. The near-real-time availability and spatial accuracy {{of these data}} allow rapid recovery of material from both meteorite falls <b>and</b> space <b>debris</b> re-entry events. To date, at least 22 meteorite fall recoveries have benefitted from RADAR detection and fall modeling, <b>and</b> multiple <b>debris</b> re-entry events over the United States have been observed in unprecedented detail...|$|R

5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the side of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, but many of the peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, 2,100police and firemen dug furiously through mud <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> {{in search}} of the missing. The name Bess was {{previously}} retired in 1974 and replaced with Bonnie. However, when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979, the name was re-introduced to the roster. After this usage of the name Bess, it was retired for the second time and was replaced with Brenda. This marked the only occasion where a single name was removed twice in the same basin.|$|E
5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow cinder cone. The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris flows <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> avalanches; many, if not most, {{of these were}} not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Omayra Sánchez Garzón (August 28, 1972November 16, 1985) was a Colombian girl {{killed in}} Armero, {{department}} of Tolima, by the 1985 eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano {{when she was}} 13 years old. Volcanic debris mixed with ice to form massive lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> flows) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain, killing nearly 23,000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages.|$|E
5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E
5|$|Route 3 was the {{inspiration}} for a story in The New Yorker in 2004 by Ian Frazier. In this story, Frazier describes a bus journey along the route, mentioning scenes along the road such as traffic congestion, the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and the Tick Tock Diner off Route 3 in Clifton. He also described a walking journey he once took into New York City along Route 3, encountering heavy, noisy traffic speeding by <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> {{along the side of}} the road.|$|E

5|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is one of}} key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, {{and the absence of}} law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass <b>and</b> <b>debris.</b> The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise.

Furthermore, Frank's injuries were inconsistent with the type of injury usually incurred in an aircraft accident.|$|E

5|$|Utricularia purpurea, a bladderwort, {{comes from}} another genus of {{carnivorous}} plants {{and may have}} lost its appetite for carnivory, at least in part. This species can still trap and digest arthropod prey in its specialized bladder traps, but does so sparingly. Instead, it harbors a community of algae, zooplankton, <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> in the bladders, giving rise to {{the hypothesis that the}} bladders of U. purpurea favor a mutualistic interaction in place of a predator-prey relationship.|$|E

5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was left open {{leading into the}} shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks <b>and</b> <b>debris.</b> This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
