5|$|Although {{the search}} {{recovered}} debris, including lifeboats and rafts, no survivors were found. On her final voyage, Fitzgeralds crew of 29 {{consisted of the}} captain, the first, second and third mates, five engineers, three oilers, a cook, a wiper, two maintenance men, three watchmen, three deckhands, three wheelsmen, two porters, a cadet and a steward. Most of the crew was from Ohio and Wisconsin; their <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 20-year-old watchman Karl A. Peckol to Captain McSorley, 63years old and planning his retirement.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Emergency Management Agency alerted local {{hospitals}} {{to prepare for}} up to 100 casualties. A doctor at nearby Memorial Health hospital described patients arriving at an emergency triage as varying in condition from suffering minor burns to their hands to having received 80-90% burns, with many in critical condition, and one with 95% burns. The victims' <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 18 to 50. Many victims were placed in artificial comas because they were on life support systems. Eight were transported by helicopter to the specialized Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia, about an hour away. Five of those injured later died there while receiving treatment.|$|E
5|$|Polonium was {{administered}} to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four hospitalised patients, and orally given to a fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the Manhattan Project and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons {{who had not been}} exposed to polonium either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of polonium was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium. Patients' <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 'early thirties' to 'early forties'. The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium, Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950. Not specified is the isotope under study, but at the time polonium-210 was the most readily available polonium isotope. The DoE factsheet submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects.|$|E

25|$|The {{cornerstone}} of the building that became Old Main was laid on September 20, 1875. The doors of the university opened on September 5, 1877. At the time, there were few {{high schools in the}} state that could adequately prepare students for university work, so in addition to the University, a preparatory school was formed on campus. In the fall of 1877, the student body consisted of 15 students in the college proper and 50 students in the preparatory school. There were 38 men and 27 women, and their <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 12–23 years.|$|E

25|$|The {{injuries}} of {{the survivors}} ranged from light to critical and were inflicted either from gunshots and/or during accidents while fleeing. The victims' <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> the late teens to their 60s. Among the injuries were two women who were friends and employees at a local high school. One of them, a librarian, jumped {{on top of the}} second woman, a schoolteacher, to save her life and was shot through the leg. Both women were ultimately shot, but the woman who was jumped on was able to stand up and pull the fire alarm. Also injured were the cousin of Louisiana Representative Charles Boustany and her husband. Egedahl, the last victim discharged, left Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center on August 14. One victim was shot four times.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Turkeltaub et al., reported: [...] "The {{complexities}} of pediatric brain imaging have precluded studies that trace the neural development of cognitive skills acquired during childhood. Using {{a task that}} isolates reading-related brain activity and minimizes confounding performance effects, we carried out a cross-sectional {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study using subjects whose <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 6 to 22 years. We found that learning to read is associated with two patterns of change in brain activity: increased activity in left-hemisphere middle temporal and Inferior frontal gyrus and decreased activity in right inferotemporal cortica areas. Activity in the left-posterior superior temporal sulcus of the youngest readers was associated with the maturation of their phonological processing abilities. These findings inform current reading models and provide strong support for Orton's 1925 theory of reading development." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Graham murdered four more Alpine Manor patients, Wood alleged. Many of the victims, whose <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 65 to 97, were {{incapacitated}} and suffered from Alzheimer's disease. Wood testified that the couple turned the selection of victims into a game, first trying to choose their victims by their initials to spell M-U-R-D-E. But when that became difficult, they began counting each murder as a [...] "day," [...] as in the phrase, [...] "I will love you for forever and a day." [...] A poem by Wood to Graham, and introduced in the trial, concluded, [...] "You'll be mine forever and five days." [...] Wood also testified that Graham took souvenirs from the victims, keeping them to relive the deaths. However, no such souvenirs were ever discovered by police. Wood also portrayed Graham as being sexually, physically and emotionally dominant in their relationship.|$|E
2500|$|This {{concentration}} of features was comparable {{to what had}} previously been found at other Archaic period shell middens in the region, demonstrating the similarity of the builders to other regional peoples: {{they lived in the}} vicinity, ate substantial numbers of shellfish, used the site as a trash heap for the shells, and buried their dead in the midden. [...] Beside 390 human bodies, the site produced the skeletons of 28 dogs that showed evidence of having been buried. [...] Many of the bones at the site were substantially decomposed, so the painstaking osteological research undertaken at the comparable Indian Knoll site (15 OH 2) could not be repeated at Carlson Annis. [...] Nevertheless, some information could be determined from certain bodies: <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> infancy well into adulthood, {{more than half of the}} bodies (215) were accompanied by artifacts — of which 73% were matters of personal clothing, such as shell gorgets, beads, or hairpains — and some of the bodies were clearly those of victims of violence, such as a group of four that were buried together with projectile points embedded in some of the bones. [...] While earlier publications' analyses were based largely on the presence of these embedded projectile points, more recent scholars have found evidence that bodies were injured in other fashions, such as by clubbing, and injuries that produce no effect upon the skeleton may also have been responsible for some of the deaths. [...] Studies of other sites in the region suggest that some resources were plentiful enough to permit populations to double approximately every thirty years; this likely would have produced competition for other resources, leading to warfare. [...] Overall life expectancy at birth was somewhat more than twenty years; 29.7% of the skeletons were of children under five years of age, of which nearly three-quarters were infants, although examination of these skeletons produced no evidence of violence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was first}} {{reported by the}} Centers for Disease Control on September 12, where they stated that [...] "fifteen people in four states had been infected". On September 21, a new report was released by the CDC, bringing {{the number of deaths}} to 13 and the number of confirmed cases to 72. The report also stated that further deaths were being investigated to determine if they had also been caused by Listeria infection. The CDC report also stated that, as Listeria [...] "only sickens the elderly, pregnant women and others with compromised immune systems", the median age of all the people that had been infected was 78. On September 30, an update was released by the CDC, reporting that as of 11am (EDT) Sep 29, 2011 the number of confirmed cases was 84, number of deaths was 15 and the number of states involved was 19. On October 4, the CDC updated their report to 100 infected individuals in 20 states and a total of 18 deaths from the outbreak. The outbreak was shown to have continued to spread to new states, with the CDC update on October 7 stating that the number of cases had risen to 109 in 23 states and that three more people had died to bring the death toll to 21. The CDC update on October 12 put the number of cases at 116 with 23 deaths. An update on October 18 increased the number of cases to 123 and the number of deaths to 25. The October 25 update raised the number of cases to 133, with three more people dying to raise the total to 28. A final update on December 8 confirmed 146 cases and 30 deaths. [...] Fatalities occurred in Colorado (8), Indiana (1), Kansas (3), Louisiana (2), Maryland (1), Missouri (3), Nebraska (1), New Mexico (5), New York (2), Oklahoma (1), Texas (2), and Wyoming (1). Among persons who died, <b>ages</b> <b>ranged</b> <b>from</b> 48 to 96 years, with a median age of 82.5 years. In addition, one woman pregnant at the time of illness had a miscarriage.|$|E
