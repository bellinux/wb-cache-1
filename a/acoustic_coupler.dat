25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to dial the phone manually and use an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> for connection, and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard. Disconnecting {{at the end of}} the session was also manual, with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging it up on the phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the on-hook state and end the call.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{communication}} over telephone lines {{did not use}} any kind of error correction protocol, it was prone to interference from line noise which would result in garbled text.

25|$|Early modems were {{generally}} very simple devices using <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplers</b> to handle telephone operation.

Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.|$|R

50|$|The TDD {{concept was}} {{developed}} by James C. Marsters (1924-2009), a dentist and private airplane pilot who became deaf as an infant because of scarlet fever, and Robert Weitbrecht, a deaf physicist. In 1964, Marsters, Weitbrecht and Andrew Saks, an electrical engineer and grandson of {{the founder of the}} Saks Fifth Avenue department store chain, founded APCOM (Applied Communications Corp.), located in the San Francisco Bay area, to develop the <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler,</b> or modem; their first product was named the PhoneType. APCOM collected old teleprinter machines (TTYs) from the Department of Defense and junkyards. Acoustic couplers were cabled to TTYs enabling the AT&T standard Model 500 telephone to couple, or fit, into the rubber cups on the coupler, thus allowing the device to transmit and receive a unique sequence of tones generated by the different corresponding TTY keys. The entire configuration of teleprinter machine, <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler,</b> and telephone set became known as the TTY. Weitbrecht invented the <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> modem in 1964. The actual mechanism for TTY communications was accomplished electro-mechanically through frequency shift keying (FSK) allowing only half-duplex communication, where only {{one person at a time}} can transmit.|$|E

In addition to its HP estate a DEC PDP-10 operated as a front-end processor (FEP) connecting UK users to 16 DEC PDP-11s based in the US.

5000|$|In the United States, Commodore {{offered the}} Commodore Information Network, a CompuServe SIG devoted to its {{products}} and users. Later, Quantum Computer Services (which became America Online) offered an online service called Quantum Link for the C64 that featured chat, downloads, and online games. In the UK, Compunet {{was a very}} popular online service for C64 users (requiring special Compunet modems) from 1984 to the early 1990s. In Australia, Telecom (now Telstra) ran an online service called Viatel and sold modems for the C64 for use with the service. In Germany the very restrictive rules of the state-owned telephone system prevented widespread use of inexpensive, non-telco licensed modems, prompting the use of inferior <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplers</b> instead. Access to Bildschirmtext, the state-owned telco's own dial-up online service, was possible via special add-on hardware like the Commodore [...] "BTX Decoder Modul" [...] or the Commodore [...] "BTX Decoder Modul II".|$|R
40|$|At least 20, 000, 000 {{people in}} the U. S. are afflicted by {{physical}} disabilities which interfere with their lives. The number and distribution of disabilities such as visual, hearing and mobility impairments is considered, to motivate an examination {{of a variety of}} computer aids for the handicapped. Computerized braille systems are found to be practical and cost-effective, and a variety of devices for embossing braille are described. Research in reading machines for the blind, using voice synthesizers, appears to be proceeding rapidly. The need for large print (large type) output has not generally been sufficiently emphasized, and the use of electrostatic printers is suggested as a possible output device. A computer-independent device, the Optacon, which provides tactile input to the blind is currently in use, and is especially helpful to blind programmers. The deaf use teletypewriters and <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplers</b> to communicate via the telephone network.

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the ubiquitous fax machine, one of the first being the Exxon Qwip in the mid-1970s, facsimile machines worked by optical scanning of a document or drawing spinning on a drum. The reflected light, varying in intensity according to the light and dark areas of the document, was focused on a photocell so that the current in a circuit varied with the amount of light. This current was used to control a tone generator (a modulator), the current determining the frequency of the tone produced. This audio tone was then transmitted using an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> (a speaker, in this case) attached to the microphone of a common telephone handset. At the receiving end, a handset’s speaker was attached to an <b>acoustic</b> <b>coupler</b> (a microphone), and a demodulator converted the varying tone into a variable current that controlled the mechanical movement of a pen or pencil to reproduce the image on a blank sheet of paper on an identical drum rotating at the same rate.|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{acoustic}} phenomena {{associated with}} the presence of a synthetic gauge field in a mechanical metamaterial. Such fields minimally couple to the momentum of phonons in a low energy limit, which leads to acoustic analogs of some of the effects of a gauge field in an electronic system, such as Landau quantization. We develop two strategies for realizing a pseudo-magnetic field in a metamaterial based on the honeycomb lattice. In the first strategy, we consider deformations of the lattice that result from applied boundary stress. In the second strategy, we use nonuniform patterning of the local material stiffness. We then explore physical phenomena associated with a constant pseudo-magnetic field. We provide evidence for the existence of a mechanical Landau-level spectrum in this metamaterial. We then focus on the zeroth Landau level and show that the corresponding modes are localized in the bulk of the system and exist mostly on one sublattice. Following recent insights into similar physical systems, we investigate topologically robust sound modes along domain walls in the bulk of the metamaterial. Further, by introducing dissipation, we test selective enhancement of the domain-wall-bound topological sound mode, a feature that could potentially be exploited for the design of <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplers,</b> rectifiers, and sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (SASERs) [...] mechanical devices analogs to lasers...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems facing the telecommunications industry {{is the extent to which}} competition will be introduced into what has been, for the most part, a regulated industry. In the forefront of the competitive environment has been the telephone interconnection industry. The genesis of this industry was the Carterfone decision by the Federal Communications Commission which allowed competition in the interconnection field. It is the thesis of this project that the most significant factor affecting the telephone interconnection industry today is the continued impact of competition on the industry. To insure that the project stayed within manageable limits the authors chose to examine the issues dealing with that part of the interconnect industry providing for the connection of answering devices, <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplers,</b> personal custom telephones, intercom systems, key business systems, or private branch exchanges (PBX) to the telephone system. Issues surrounding the competitive interconnect services of microwave and satellite links provided by the specialized common carriers are beyond the scope of this project. The specialized common carrier area is a critical issue on its own right and should be the subject of investigation by future participants in the Telecommunications Program. An analysis of present, past and potential interconnect manufacturers is provided to show how the lure and promise of competition has affected the industry. Because there are hundreds of companies involved in the manufacture and marketing of interconnect devices, only a limited cross section has been chosen for this project...|$|R
