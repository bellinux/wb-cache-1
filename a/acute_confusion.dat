40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to use Minimum Data Set (MDS) data from LTC (long-term care) in one Midwestern state to test whether risk {{variables}} derived from a conceptual model developed from findings in acute care predicted <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> in long-term care residents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: MDS nursing home records. POPULATION: The sample was composed predominantly of women (n = 1, 775). INTERVENTIONS: The 1995 MIS annual reviews of nursing home residents from a Midwestern state provided the data for analysis; however missing data, on the average about 10 % for the acute confusion/delirium indicators, reduced the sample to 2, 318. Based on the conceptual model and items available in the MDS, precipitating factors selected for analysis included: dehydration, hypoxia, infections, and medications. Individual vulnerability factors selected for analysis included: age, diagnosis of dementia, various chronic medical diagnoses/conditions, indicators of frailty such as falls; multiple medications; and sensory impairments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : The prevalence of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> found in these data (13. 98 %) is similar to other studies of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> prevalence in abstracted data files. Frequencies of the indicators suggest that cognitive ability variation and periods of motor restlessness/lethargy are the most readily recognized symptoms of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> by nursing home staff. Of the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis, the only variables that contributed to the explanation of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> in the logistic regression analysis were inadequate fluid intake, dementia status, and a fall in the past 30 days. The strongest contributing factor to <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> in this population was inadequate fluid intake. Although medications are the most frequent cause of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> in older hospital patients, possibly because of the age-related sensitivity of the brain to the effects of drugs, this was not the case in these LTC residents. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Although these results support the hypothesized relationship of dehydration and <b>acute</b> <b>confusion,</b> limitations of this cross-sectional analysis need to be addressed. The items used for fluid intake lacked the accuracy of quantitative measurement in a more precise clinical investigation. There is a concern about the reliability of the delirium indicators. Hawes et al. conclude that nursing home staff do not consistently detect and document these indicators. Also, the amount of missing data is of concern. Future research endeavors should focus on refining the assessment of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> in LTC. Other research efforts should focus on using the MDS data to identify areas for clinical intervention. The MDS is one of the few mandated clinical databases that captures nursing care. Nurses involved in health services research can use the data to affect nursing care issues in long-term care. [CINAHL abstract...|$|E

This theory is supported by the fact that doxapram, a CNS stimulant, is somewhat effective in abolishing postoperative shivering.

40|$|This simple {{quantitative}} descriptive case controlled research compared cases (subjects at {{risk for}} <b>acute</b> <b>confusion)</b> with controls (subjects without the attribute); comparison was made on the exposure to potential contributing factors suspected of causing <b>acute</b> <b>confusion,</b> for example, heavy smoking, {{or the number of}} alcoholic drinks consumed per day. Case-control studies were also retrospective, because they focused on conditions in the past that might have caused subjects to become cases, rather than controls. The basic purpose of this research design was essentially {{the same as that of}} experimental research: to determine the relationships among variables. This report demonstrates that, with relatively good adherence by the nursing team, proactive screening using a structured risk assessment protocol can be successfully implemented for medical patients. This assessment was associated with a statistically significant 50 per cent reduction in the incidence of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> in the intervention group, compared with usual care retrospectively. Reduction in <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> was not associated with shortened length of stay, but length of stay was often predetermined by protocol or critical pathway. Correlation analysis demonstrated that risk screening appeared most effective in preventing or reducing <b>acute</b> <b>confusion</b> in patients without preadmission dementia or ADL impairment. In patients with significant preadmission impairment, the stress of hospitalisation may be sufficient to precipitate an episode, despite otherwise optimal management. Less-impaired patients may require additional insults to precipitate <b>acute</b> <b>confusion,</b> some of which are avertable by risk screening and subsequent early intervention. Determined risk indicators were consistent throughout the four year timeframe set for this research project. This demonstrated that although there were multiple patient types presenting to this clinical area, they were consistently the same over a longitudinal timeframe. It meant they were reproducible, which gave this research additional strength. Also, based on the descriptive statistics, this research has shown that in this clinical area where intervention was introduced the combination did have a positive impact on annual numbers of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion.</b> In summary, these findings suggest that without risk screening and the direction for appropriate management the likelihood of an episode can more than double. In the three subgroups expected to pose the greatest challenges for the risk assessment (i. e. those 70 years or older, those with suspected drug dependency, and those with symptomatic infection), risk assessment retained excellent sensitivity, (a) (d) specificity, and relevant correlation with reduction of episodes. This research has demonstrated throughout that high risk screening and associated intervention based on the risk indicator can decrease the annual number of actual episodes of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion.</b> Interventions to prevent or reduce an episode of <b>acute</b> <b>confusion,</b> as outlined by Wakefield (2002) and this research, definitely increases as a result of high risk screening. Beyond doubt, from both the literature reviewed and the findings of this research, is that risk screening does need to be adapted to the individual clinical setting and cannot be generic...|$|E

Autopsy revealed an indolent B-cell lymphoma with extensive plasmacytic differentiation infiltrating the right renal sinus and involving the submandibular and sublingual glands, cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes, multiple microscopic foci in pituitary and adrenal glands, lung, breast, liver, thyroid, and bone marrow.
