40|$|It is {{important}} to comprehend {{the characteristics of the}} noise occurring from combine harvesters {{in order to reduce the}} noise. In this study, estimation of noise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> operator’s <b>head,</b> <b>the</b> measurement of noise distribution, and the spectrum analysis of noise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> operator’s <b>head</b> were performed. As a result, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> operator’s <b>head,</b> A-weighted sound pressure level was 87 dB(A) in the time domain, and A-weighted sound pressure levels at 160 Hz and 330 Hz were 72 dB (A) and 71 dB (A) in the frequency domain. So the operator feels uncomfortable in this working environment. It was found through the measurement of noise distribution that many noise sources and forms of parts constituting a combine harvester characterized the distribution and levels of the noise occurring from a stationary combine harvester. It was found through the spectrum analysis of <b>the</b> noise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> operator’s <b>head</b> that <b>the</b> engine exhaust would characterize the frequencies of the spectrum peaks of <b>the</b> noise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> operator’s <b>head...</b>|$|R
