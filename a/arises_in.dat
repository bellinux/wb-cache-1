As an extension, Kaluza–Klein theory and string theory ascribe electromagnetism {{and the other}} fundamental forces respectively to the curvature of differently scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.|$|E

The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently {{in a state of}} decline as competition <b>arises</b> <b>in</b> countries like South Korea, the United States and China. However, despite also facing similar competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong due to an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle <b>arises</b> <b>in</b> a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E
5|$|The clique problem <b>arises</b> <b>in</b> the {{following}} real-world setting. Consider a social network, where the graph's vertices represent people, and the graph's edges represent mutual acquaintance.

Along with its applications in social networks, the clique problem also has many applications in bioinformatics and computational chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often <b>arises</b> <b>in</b> types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
