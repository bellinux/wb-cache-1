5|$|<b>Already</b> <b>on</b> September 28, 1658, a small {{fleet of}} three ships and several smaller boats landed the Norwegian forces close to Trondheim.

Two Dano-Norwegian ships attacked Gotland, thought no significant damage was inflicted on either side.|$|E

5|$|Belgian {{soldiers}} fought rearguard actions {{while other}} Belgian units <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the Dyle line worked tirelessly to organise better defensive {{positions in the}} Leuven–Antwerp gap.

5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure. Lack of crew training could amplify this problem; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units <b>already</b> <b>on</b> {{their way to}} the front.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow were <b>already</b> <b>on</b> their way.

5|$|As {{a direct}} {{connection}} between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons {{and in particular the}} Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back by the forces of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed <b>already</b> <b>on</b> February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.|$|E

5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades were <b>already</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground}} before the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945. The German defenders had been alerted, and the gliders were met by a concentrated anti-aircraft barrage. This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives. The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E
5|$|As the American {{troops were}} {{attempting}} to destroy Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march overland from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut off any of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies <b>already</b> <b>on</b> Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the drawing board.|$|E

5|$|Eyre {{returned}} to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 10 December 1826, and was almost immediately offered command of a squadron fitting out for Lisbon. The changes in climate had brought on {{an attack of}} gout, and on being informed that as Sir Thomas Hardy's squadron was <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the spot, he was at liberty to refuse the offer. Eyre did so, and retired ashore. He appears to have had no further commands, and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1830. He had married Georgiana Cooke, the daughter of Sir George Cooke, 7th Baronet, at Doncaster on 1 November 1800, {{with whom he had}} a family of eight children, including two sons named George-Hardolf and William. Sir George Eyre died on 15 February 1839 at the rectory, Carlton, Derbyshire.|$|E

The venue was the 26th indoor ice hockey arena in Norway. After the Olympic arena was built, Storhamar Ishall was renovated, and the spectator capacity reduced {{through the construction of}} storage facilities and VIP areas. The Olympic Amphitheatre later installed Norway's first media cube in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E
