5|$|Before Henry's father (Henry VII) <b>ascended</b> <b>the</b> throne, England {{had been}} beset by civil warfare over rival {{claims to the}} English crown. Henry wanted to avoid a similar {{uncertainty}} over the succession. Catherine of Aragon's only surviving child was Princess Mary.|$|E
5|$|Early Scottish monarchs did not {{inherit the}} Crown directly; instead {{the custom of}} tanistry was followed, where the monarchy alternated between {{different}} branches of the House of Alpin. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle. In 1005, Malcolm II <b>ascended</b> <b>the</b> throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and {{when he died in}} 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, Duncan I, instead of a cousin, as had been usual. In 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of Macbeth, who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan's son Malcolm. The following year, after killing Macbeth's stepson Lulach, Malcolm <b>ascended</b> <b>the</b> throne as Malcolm III.|$|E

The throne has 32 statues, who are actually apsaras who were turned into stone by a curse. When Bhoja tries to <b>ascend</b> <b>the</b> throne, one apsara comes to life and tells him to <b>ascend</b> <b>the</b> throne only if he is as magnanimous as Vikramaditya (as revealed by her tale). This leads to 32 attempts by Bhoja to <b>ascend</b> <b>the</b> throne, with 32 tales of Vikramaditya's virtue; after each, Bhoja acknowledges his inferiority. Pleased with his humility, the statues finally let him <b>ascend</b> <b>the</b> throne.|$|R
