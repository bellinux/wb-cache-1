500|$|Located on the {{mezzanine}} level, {{the hotel}} bar named Rebar bar opened on April 18, 2008.

[...] Two weeks after its opening, it was selected by David Himmel, {{a contributing editor to}} RedEye from Metromix, as the best new bar to take a date to. Himmel described Rebar as [...] "sleek" [...] and spoke highly of its eastward Chicago River views. [...] The bar was named after the [...] of reinforcing steel bars, called rebar, that support the hotel. Another Metromix contributing editor spoke highly of the views and described it as a hotel bar with <b>a</b> <b>cozy</b> feel. Rebar has both a main bar and a standing room only bar. [...] One member of the WMAQ-TV Street Team commended it for its signature cocktails and sushi, while another gave kudos for the design and the stainless steel swizzle sticks that the bar calls [...] "stirs". [...] Rebar is equipped with a 25-person VIP room overlooking the lobby.

500|$|On 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive {{which called}} for the United States to begin a {{rapprochement}} with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The paper read:Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran. Instability caused by {{the pressures of the}} Iraq-Iran war, economic deterioration and regime in-fighting create the potential for major changes inside Iran. The Soviet Union is better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime...The U.S should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance...This includes provision of selected military equipment. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane's paper: [...] "This is almost too absurd to comment on...like asking Qaddafi to Washington for <b>a</b> <b>cozy</b> chat." [...] Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, how could the United States possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane's plan to start selling arms to Iran.|$|E

Instead of quaint cottages, there's generic tract housing; instead of lush landscapes, concrete patios; instead of <b>a</b> <b>cozy</b> village, there's a bland collection of homes with nothing—not a church, not a cafe, not even a town square—to draw them together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The oldest {{restaurant}} {{still in}} operation {{along the entire}} stretch of US66, nationwide, is the Ariston Café in Litchfield. The Ariston {{is an excellent example}} of the type of mom and pop operation that flourished along Route 66 in Illinois, as is the Palms Grill Café in Atlanta. [...] Two others are the upstate fried-chicken rivals, White Fence Farm in Romeoville and Dell Rhea's Chicken Basket in Willowbrook. [...] The former is a large, rambling, old-style farmhouse, the latter more like <b>a</b> <b>cozy,</b> neon-lit roadhouse where one can hear live blues on weekend nights; the farm offers an antique-filled gallery for visitors, the roadhouse a spate of Route66 memorabilia, a neon fowl as its emblem, and loads of knick-knacks celebrating chickens. [...] Each has its fans; both offer the traveler the comfort of a relaxed sit-down meal, and both continue to flourish as unique experiences on the route.|$|E
2500|$|Tony Judt, in an {{analysis}} of liberal acquiescence in President George W. Bush's foreign policy initiatives, particularly the War on Terror and the invasion of Iraq, argued that this policy was premised on the notion there was such a thing as Islamofascism, a notion Judt considered catastrophic. In his diagnosis of this shift he detected a decline in the old liberal consensus of American politics, and what he called the [...] "deliquescence of the Democratic Party". Many former left-liberal pundits, like Paul Berman and Peter Beinart having no knowledge of the Middle East or cultures like those of Wahhabism and Sufism on which they descant authoritatively, have, he claimed, and his view was shared by Niall Ferguson, latched onto the war on terror as {{a new version of the}} old liberal fight against fascism, in the form of Islamofascism. In their approach there is <b>a</b> <b>cozy</b> acceptance of a binary division of the world into ideological antitheses, the [...] "familiar juxtaposition that eliminates exotic complexity and confusion: Democracy v. Totalitarianism, Freedom v. Fascism, Them v. Us" [...] has been revived. Judt cited many others who, once liberals have fallen in lockstep with the American idea of a global war against Islamic jihad: Adam Michnik, Oriana Fallaci; Václav Havel; André Glucksmann, Michael Ignatieff, Leon Wieseltier, David Remnick, Thomas Friedman and Michael Walzer. Christopher Hitchens was also criticized by Judt, as making unhistoric simplifications, to justify use of the term.|$|E

5000|$|Though often {{considered}} a classic of children's literature, The Five Chinese Brothers {{has been accused}} of promoting ethnic stereotypes about the Chinese, particularly through its illustrations, and many teachers have removed the book from their classrooms.

Lanes described the illustrations as [...] "cheerful and highly appealing", characterizing Wiese's [...] "broad cartoon style" [...] as [...] "well suited to the folk-tale, a genre which deals in broad truths".
