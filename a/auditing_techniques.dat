40|$|Forensic {{accounting}} and investigative auditing is a discipline {{that is used}} when investigating a complicated cheating case related to the law. Inside are investigative <b>audit</b> <b>techniques</b> that can assist forensic accountants in their implementation. In Indonesia, investigative audit is more often associated with the settlement of corruption cases, {{one of which is}} money laundering. So in this study the authors wanted to know how investigative <b>audit</b> <b>techniques</b> are most effective in its efforts to uncover cases of money laundering based on the perspective of forensic accountants. The research method used is qualitative descriptive method. Determination of respondents using key person techniques are people who work as forensic accountants. The data used is the primary data obtained from interviews with respondents. This study uses the technique of triangulation of sources in the test data. Based on the results of his analysis, the results of the investigative aduit stages are predication, hypothesis formulation, data gathering, data reliability test, data analysis, interview and interrogation call, loss calculation, and reporting. It was also concluded that in theory and practice there is no investigative <b>audit</b> <b>technique</b> selected as the most effective technique. Because previously forensic accountants need to consider the things and characteristics of the money laundering case, only then determine which investigative <b>audit</b> <b>techniques</b> to use...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Business Information Systems) [...] Tshwane University of Technology 2011. Information systems {{are defined as}} a group of {{interconnected}} components (people, organisation and technology) that function together to extract, regain, route, accumulate and distribute information, with the aim of business decision making and operational activities in an organisation and other business. As a result, nformation systems are being deployed by organisation to help assure that their daily activities are completed seamlessly. Thus, organisational stakeholders invest a vast amount of money in the deployment of these systems. Furthermore, volumes of organisational data stored within these systems increases on regular basis. As the volume of data and the complexity of information systems increase, business managers expect information systems auditors to become even more relevant and rigorous as these auditors have to ensure that possible risks that these nformation systems may inherent are mitigated. International Auditing standards and best practices emphasise the use of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> by IS auditors, within their audit engagements. However, the level of compliance to these international auditing standards and best practices by the South African information systems auditors is still questionable. An empirical study conducted by Vasile-Daniel (2010) indicated that even if technology is accepted, few (if not all) of nformation systems auditors still deploy traditional audit methods within their audit engagements. Currently, auditors were observed to use Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> only to select random test samples but not necessarily to audit entirely using Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques.</b> That is, they often revert to executing their audit engagements following the traditional methods. To the preceding point, the present study sought to explore factors that could be influencing the nformation systems auditors not to utilize Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> fully. The study, underpinned by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), investigated the use or adoption of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> by information systems auditors within a financial institution. The study revealed that senior management support, availability of resources, personal growth, increased productivity, and lack of relevant training tend to be the main factors, amongst others, influencing the use and adoption of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques...</b>|$|R

40|$|Generation {{of random}} numbers is a {{critical}} component of existing post-election <b>auditing</b> <b>techniques.</b> Recent work has largely discouraged the use of all pseudorandom number generators, including cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs), for this purpose, instead recommending the sole use of observable physical techniques. In particular, simple dice rolling has received a great deal of positive attention [4, 6, 9]. The typical justification for this recommendation is that those less comfortable with mathematics prefer a simple, observable technique. This paper takes a contrary view. Simple, observable techniques like dice rolling are not necessarily robust against sleight of hand and other forms of fraud, and attempts to harden them against fraud can dramatically increase their complexity. With simple dice rolling, we know of no techniques that provide citizens with a reasonable means of verifying that fraud did not occur during the roll process. CSPRNGs, used properly, can be simple, robust, and verifiable, and they allow for the use of <b>auditing</b> <b>techniques</b> that might otherwise be impractical. While we understand initial skepticism towards this option, we argue that appropriate use of CSPRNGs would strengthen audit security. ...|$|E
