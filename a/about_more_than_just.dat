25|$|In Trinidad and Tobago the Latin American-derived {{seasonal}} Christmas music called Parang is <b>about</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> Christmas carols. Parang {{is about}} general merrymaking and festivities around Christmas {{time and the}} food, dancing and music is all {{a part of the}} parang. The singers of parang visit the homes of family and friends and sing Christmas-themed songs in Spanish accompanied by instruments, usually the guitar, cuatro, maracas (known as chac-chacs on the islands), mandolin, bandolin, violin, bandola and sometimes the cello. Parang is mostly performed during the Christmas season but is also used at other festivals throughout the year, including the Santa Rosa Festival, the velorio del cruz, and the Sebucan festival. Parang includes both religious and non-religious songs and melodies set against the parang instrumentation. Parang festivities typically involve dancing and there are two primary dance styles, the slower castillian waltz and a quicker gavilan style.|$|E

It begins with a conversation {{with one of her}} friends, who asks Jackson the title question. Lyrically, it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well as he used to, and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I never ask for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth. You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A. McCoy in the book Lifepower: Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose, Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that [...] "life is <b>about</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> what you say. Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing sends me into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Bodyguard of Lies," [...] Clarke and Lexa rehash {{the plan}} of attack, and Lexa tells Clarke she (Clarke) was born to be a leader. Octavia figures out Clarke and Lexa knew about the missile, and Lexa decides {{she needs to be}} killed to protect that secret. Clarke stops the {{attempted}} murder. She confronts Lexa about her plan and her facade of heartlessness, and Lexa reveals she has feelings for Clarke. As they wait for the deadly fog to clear, Lexa informs Clarke she does trust her and will no longer try to hurt Octavia. She notes that the Grounder ways are just focused on survival. Clarke suggests that maybe life should be <b>about</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> surviving, and Lexa catches her off guard with a kiss. Clarke returns the kiss before she tells Lexa she is not ready to be with anyone yet. They are alerted to Raven's signal that the fog is disabled. The combined grounder/arker army marches to war with Clarke and Lexa at its head. The Mountain Men prepare to deploy acid fog, but Bellamy manages to escape a security team and destroy the system in an explosion just in time.|$|E

Clarke catches Lexa as she falls {{and they take}} her to the bed. Lexa realizes she is going to die and tells Clarke not to be afraid. She tells Titus to never harm Clarke again, and he swears he will not. She tells him serve the next commander as he served her. Clarke continues to try and save Lexa, but she tells Clarke that her spirit will find a new commander. She says her fight is over and that Clarke was right that life should be <b>about</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> surviving. Clarke recites the Traveler's Blessing, an Arkadian prayer. As Lexa dies, Clarke kisses her one last time. Titus extracts a tech from Lexa's neck, where her tattoo is. The tech is called [...] "the flame," [...] and it is revealed to be Lexa's spirit. She was augmented to carry an AI (the flame). The flame is how every new commander is chosen, with each new commander becoming a part of the flame. It is only compatible with Nightbloods.

2500|$|The {{legacy that}} Cruyff gave Barcelona, however, was <b>about</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> trophies and records, as he gave Barça a winning mentality and footballing identity/ideology {{that runs through}} the club till this day. As Barcelona manager, he laid {{systematic}} foundations for a prominent school of football: [...] "Barçajax school" [...] or [...] "Barça-Ajax school", as it has been termed by many. The predominant style of play, now known as tiki-taka or tiqui-taca, had been transferred and improved from Ajax to Barça. It was that which has sustained Barcelona since the days of Vic Buckingham, Rinus Michels and Cruyff (as player) in the early 1970s: they were the ideas of Ajax; Total Football, a predominant belief in possession-oriented football with an attack-minded 3–4–3/4–3–3 team formation, rooted in a high offside line, pressing and the interchange of players on the field. When Cruyff became Barcelona’s manager in 1988, he reinforced this footballing philosophy. He was also responsible for introducing “rondos” (a circle of players pass the ball to each other, while one in the centre tries to catch it) into the team's training sessions. About Cruyff's lasting influence on Barça's youth academy La Masia, Guillem Balagué noted, [...] "Cruyff demanded changes at the academy and La Masía began regularly producing the players he wanted as well as providing the kids with a sound education, dual ambitions of the Dutch coach and the club. “The player who has come through La Masía has something different from the rest, it's a plus that only comes from having competed in a Barcelona shirt from the time you were a child,” says Guardiola. He is talking not only about the understanding of the game and their ability, but about human qualities. The players who go through La Masía are taught to behave with civility and humility. The theory being that, not only is it pleasant to be unassuming, but also if you are humble, you are capable of learning – and the capacity to learn is the capacity to improve. If you aren't capable of learning you won't improve. Since his arrival, Johan had tried and succeeded in convincing the club to train all the junior teams {{in the same way as}} the first eleven – and to favour talent over physique.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Despite many efforts {{over the}} past decade, the ability to {{generate}} topological maps of the Internet at the router-level accurately and {{in a timely fashion}} remains elusive. Mapping campaigns commonly involve traceroute-like probing that are usually non-adaptive and incomplete, thus revealing only a portion of the underlying topology. In this paper we demonstrate that standard probing methods yield datasets that implicitly contain information <b>about</b> much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the directly observed links and routers. Each probe, in addition to the underlying domain knowledge, returns information that places constraints on the underlying topology, and by integrating a large number of such constraints it is possible to accurately infer the existence of unseen components of the Internet. We describe DomainImpute, a novel data analysis methodology designed to accurately infer the unseen hop-count distances between observed routers. We use both synthetic and a large empirical dataset to validate the proposed methods. On our empirical real world dataset, we show that our methods can estimate over 55 % of the unseen distances between observed routers to within a one-hop error. I...|$|R
