50|$|Malaria is {{a global}} health problem that threatens 300-500 million people and kills {{more than one million}} people annually. The chloroquine-based drugs that were used widely in the past have lost {{effectiveness}} because the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria has become resistant to them. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, extracted from <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> <b>L</b> is highly effective against Plasmodium spp. resistant to other anti-malarial drugs. However, there are several problems with current production methods for artemisinin. First, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are too expensive for people in the Developing World to afford. Second, artemisinin is extracted from A. annua, and its yield and consistency depend on climate and the extraction process. While there is a method for chemical synthesis of artemisinin, it is too low yielding and therefore too expensive for use in producing low-cost drugs. Third, although the World Health Organization has recommended that artemisinin be formulated with other active pharmaceutical ingredients in ACTs, many manufacturers are still producing mono-therapies of artemisinin, which increase the chance that Plasmodium spp. will develop resistance to artemisinin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract It is {{suggested}} that oxidative stress induced by cellular reactive oxygen species {{is one of the}} major causal factors of aging. The effect of dietary supplementation of anti-oxidants on response to environmental stressors and lifespan has been studied in various model organisms. In the present study, we examine the effect of <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> extract on resistance to oxidative, heat, and ultraviolet stresses in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> significantly increases survival under oxidative and heat stresses, however has no effects in response to ultraviolet stress. Then, we measured the in vivo changes in expression of stress-responsive genes by <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> using green fluorescence protein. The expression of hsp- 16. 2, known to be involved in response to heat stress, is significantly increased by <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> supplementation. An anti-oxidant gene, sod- 3, was also up-regulated by <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua.</b> However, both mean and maximum lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans was not altered by dietary supplementation of <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua.</b> These findings indicate that <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> confers health-promoting effects through increasing the resistance to environmental stressors and has no effect on lifespan in C. elegans.

40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} (CL) is {{a tropical}} disease that affects millions of individuals worldwide. The current drugs for CL may be effective but have serious side effects; hence, alternatives are urgently needed. Although plant-derived materials {{are used for}} the treatment of various diseases in 80 % of the global population, the validation of these products is essential. Gelatin capsules containing dried <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> leaf powder were recently developed as a new herbal formulation (totum) for the oral treatment of malaria and other parasitic diseases. Here, we aimed to determine the usefulness of A. annua gel capsules in CL. METHODS: The antileishmanial activity and cytotoxicity of A. <b>annua</b> <b>L.</b> capsules was determined via in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, a preliminary evaluation of its therapeutic potential as antileishmanial treatment in humans was conducted in 2 patients with uncomplicated CL. RESULTS: <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> capsules showed moderate in vitro activity in amastigotes of Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis; no cytotoxicity in U- 937 macrophages or genotoxicity in human lymphocytes was observed. Five of 6 (83. 3 %) hamsters treated with A. annua capsules (500 mg/kg/day) for 30 days were cured, and the 2 examined patients were cured 45 days after initiation of treatment with 30 g of A. annua capsules, without any adverse reactions. Both patients remained disease-free 26 and 24 months after treatment completion. CONCLUSION: Capsules of A. <b>annua</b> <b>L.</b> represent an effective treatment for uncomplicated CL, although further randomized controlled trials are needed to validate its efficacy and safety...|$|R

40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> {{contains}} the well-known antimalarial compound artemisinin, which forms {{the backbone of}} the global malaria treatment regime. In African countries a tea infusion prepared from <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> has been used for the treatment of malaria only for the past 10 - 20 years. Several informal claims in Africa exist that the <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> tea infusions are also able to inhibit HIV. Since HIV is a relatively newly emerged disease, the claims, if substantiated, could provide a very good example of "ethnopharmacology in overdrive". The objective {{of this study was to}} provide quantitative scientific evidence that the <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> tea infusion exhibits anti-HIV activity through in vitro studies. A second objective was to determine if artemisinin plays a direct or indirect (synergistic) role in any observed activity. This was done by the inclusion of a chemically closely related species, Artemisia afra, known not to contain any artemisinin in our studies. Materials and methods: Validated cellular systems were used to test <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> tea samples for anti-HIV activity. Two independent tests with different formats (an infection format and a co-cultivation format) were used. Samples were also tested for cellular toxicity against the human cells used in the assays. Results: The <b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> tea infusion was found to be highly active with IC 50 values as low as 2. 0 mu g/mL. Moreover we found that artemisinin was inactive at 25 mu g/mL and that a chemically related species Artemisia afra (not containing artemisinin) showed a similar level of activity. This indicates that the role of artemisinin, directly or indirectly (synergism), in the observed activity is rather limited. Additionally, no cellular toxicity was seen for the tea infusion at the highest concentrations tested.

Based on pharmacological and chemi— cal studies it was shown to be the antimalarial principle and named artean— mum (qinghaosu). Citronellal {{was used as a}} starting material for the total synthesis of arteannuin. The peroxide group of the arteannuin mole-cule was introduced by photooxidation. Deoxyarteannuin, arteannuin A, arteannuin B, arteannuin E, and arteannuin F which occur together with arteannuin in the same plant were also synthesized. The Chinese herbal medicine Qinghao (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> <b>L.</b> Compositae) is abundant and grows in-digenously all over China. It has been used in practice for treatment of malaria in China for more than one thousand years. However, the therapeutic effect in traditional form was not so definite and consistent. Further studies on antimalarial effect of Qinghao are done recently. An active antimalaria...|$|E

This study reveals that the mortalities after treatment of the workers of red imported fire ants varied according to the classification of workers, oil type, dosage, and exposure time. Among the {{essential oils}} tested, strong insecticidal activity was observed with the essential oils of camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), <b>artemisia</b> <b>annua</b> (<b>Artemisia</b> <b>annua),</b> eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), mugwort (Artemisia argyi), and wintergreen (Ilex chinensis). Ant mortalities from chrysanthemum oil (Dendranthema indicum), turpentine oil (Pinus massoniana), and forsythia oil (Forsythia suspense) treatments were significantly lower than those from the previously mentioned five essential oil treatments. This study showed that camphor, <b>artemisia</b> <b>annua,</b> eucalyptus, mugwort, and wintergreen oils may have potential {{to be used as}} substitutes for chemical insecticides. </span...|$|R
