25|$|On April 17 & 18, 2010, a {{group of}} {{aviation}} archaeology professionals, <b>avocational</b> and interested persons met in Broomfield, Colorado at the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport for a two-day summit. The attendees came from Arizona, California, Canada, Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, and Oklahoma representing the interests of wreck chasers, aircraft recovery teams, and <b>avocational</b> archaeologists. The North American Aviation Archaeology Summit was conducted and sponsored by the North American Institute of Aviation Archaeology and Colorado Aviation Historical Society's Aviation Archaeology Programs Staff. Some of the attendees had also attended the 2009 Symposium at Moffett Field. The group discussed all aspects of aviation archaeology, wreck chasing, recovery, modern archaeology techniques, ethics, education, training, hobby enthusiasts, and professional interests. Breakout sessions, consensus, and voting occurred to determine the Summit outcome. The Summit created an organization initially representing the United States and Canada, now to be called: Aviation Archaeology and Heritage Association, and with full agreement to expand and include all nations interested in aviation archaeology and wreck chasing.|$|E

40|$|Why Have An Archeology Week? Archeology {{is full of}} {{discovery}} and attracts a curious public, who wants to participate. State archeology week provides a venue for archeologists to involve the public, promote the preservation of archeological resources and illustrate the scientific proves of the discipline. It offers educational events for the public and increasingly for schools to generate understanding and support for archeology. In 1996, over 2, 000, 000 people visited state archeology week events, and this number is a conservative estimate. The first state archeology week was organized by Arizona in 1983. Originally, the program consisted of a small exhibit and a few events with limited publicity. It has grown to a month-long celebration including an Archaeology Expo, a fair where the public may view demonstrations, tour ancient remains, and view living his events. In 1997, thirty-nine states celebrated archeology week or month for their citizens. This large number {{is a tribute to}} the hard work and dedication of many professionals, <b>avocationals</b> and other volunteers who recognize the value of this annual outreach program.

40|$|The Red Tail site (FbNp- 10) is a {{multicomponent}} habitation site located 2. 5 km {{north of}} Saskatoon {{within the boundaries}} of Wanuskewin Heritage Park. The site was initially tested in the early 1980 s and then excavated during the summers of 1988 and 1989 by University of Saskatchewan archaeology field school students, paid crews and many volunteers. Evidence from the site indicates that it was inhabited numerous times, beginning around 4, 300 years before present with a McKean occupation, which also included the only Mckean house pit feature found on the Canadian Plains. Other associations with archaeological cultures include Sandy Creek, Besant and Avonlea, revealing that the most recent identifiable occupation to have occurred was between 1, 300 – 1, 000 years before present. The Sandy Creek component is only the second to be recovered from a site within Wanuskewin Heritage Park. As the longest running archaeological project in Canada, the sites that have been excavated at Wanuskewin have involved a number of volunteers and the success of such a cultural facility would not be possible without the interest of members of the public. The dissemination of information about archaeology to the public has a colourful past in Saskatchewan that began in 1935 with the formation of the Saskatoon Archaeological Society; a group of <b>avocationals</b> who were interested in learning and sharing information about this province’s rich cultural history. Since then, the Saskatchewan Archaeological Society and its associated chapters were formed and awareness for the importance of preserving the past has been communicated through many avenues, including programs that invite members of the public to participate in archaeological opportunities within the province. An examination of these avenues of information sharing demonstrates how important public interest and support is to archaeology and heritage works in Saskatchewan...|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} aspect of project design {{is likely to be}} managing the logistics of operating from a boat and of managing diving operations. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the Mary Rose have relied substantially on <b>avocational</b> archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.|$|E

40|$|University of South Florida field {{investigations}} in northwest Florida’s Apalachicola Valley {{have resulted in}} the relocation of some lost mounds from the Middle Woodland period (ca. A. D. 1 to 650) by trekking through the forest and consulting with <b>avocationals</b> and collectors. This thesis project was triggered by a collector’s donation of some Swift Creek pots and the attempt to relocate the mound from which they came. In the 1970 s, Gardner and Nidy recorded this site, named Poplar Springs Mound, categorized as Middle Woodland due to its Swift Creek and Weeden Island pottery. The donated collection contained pottery of the Swift Creek Complicated-Stamped series, Weeden Island series, and a couple of anomalous Mississippian sherds. To see how this mound fit in with other Middle Woodland mounds of the valley, it was necessary to compile data for all of them and relocate as many mounds as possible through additional survey. Artifact types from these mounds, such as pottery, shell, bone, and exotic materials, and burial practices were tabulated and spatial distributions were plotted. The mounds are distributed {{along the banks of the}} main navigable waterways of the Apalachicola and Chipola Rivers, on smaller streams and along the Gulf Coast. Nearly all have both Swift Creek and early Weeden Island ceramics, except for three with only Swift Creek types and a single site with only Weeden Island types. The artifact distributions show stone, bone, and shell tools clustering close to the coast and the main waterways. This is also the case for exotic (nonlocal) raw materials and artifacts made from these materials. Copper is distributed mainly along the coast, while other exotics (i. e. mica, galena, hematite) are located along the coast and close to the main rivers. The tabulation of these data, along with the documentation of the Poplar Springs Mound collection, will help archaeologists to see the manifestation of Middle Woodland ceremonial activity in the Apalachicola Valley...|$|R
