5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock <b>and</b> <b>pets,</b> including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|The boardwalk {{is within}} the barker inlet aquatic reserve, where the taking of crabs {{shellfish}} and plants is prohibited <b>and</b> <b>pets</b> are not allowed. The mangroves, saltmarsh and adjacent lagoons form a habitat for over 200 bird species with the mangroves {{being part of a}} nursery area for most of the commercial and recreational fish species of Gulf St Vincent. The 2005 Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act established a sanctuary for the Bottlenose dolphins that live in the inlet and adjacent Port River. The sanctuary's northern extent is the boat channel and dolphins can sometimes be seen at high tide in the tidal creeks passing under the boardwalk.|$|E

5|$|Drowned God was {{released}} on October31, 1996 for the Windows 95 operating system. In its first two weeks, it sold 34,000copies in the United States. It {{was one of the}} top ten best-selling video games in United States during the first month after its release, but bugs and poor support from the developers caused it to fall out of favor with gamers by December. By February 1998, the game had sold over 60,000copies. Around the time of the game's release, Horse stated that its story was incomplete, and {{that the rest of the}} story would be revealed in a sequel called CULT, planned to center around Area51.

5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt.

Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, but after a few months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, <b>and</b> <b>pets</b> him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} a novel procedure, based on the perceived exertion threshold (PET) concept, involving non-exhaustive tests (PET 14 – 17) to estimate critical power (CP), as well as to examine the reproducibility of these indices. Twenty young men performed 2 trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) of 4 exhaustive predictive tests to estimate CP, <b>PET,</b> <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> 14 – 17. The slope coefficients of the regression lines corresponding to the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) versus time relationship (y axis) obtained during the predictive tests were plotted against the power outputs (x axis) to estimate PET. PET was calculated as the intersection point of the regression line in the power axis. The 14 – 17 RPE range of each predictive test was modeled using the same mathematical procedures used to estimate PET 14 – 17. CP was derived from the power-time hyperbolic equation. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences among CP (189 – 194 W), PET (190 – 191 W) <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> 14 – 17, (191 – 195 W). The correlations between CP <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> (r = 0. 87), CP <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> 14 – 17 (r = 0. 89), <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> 14 – 17 (r = 0. 88) were all strong. Additionally, the bias 6 limits of agreement when plotting CP <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> was – 2. 16 6 31. 60 W, and – 5. 70 6 31. 21 W when comparing CP <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> 14 – 17. Relatively high reproducibility levels of CP (ICC = 0. 96), PET (ICC = 0. 85) <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> 14 – 17 (ICC = 0. 83) were recorded in the test-retest fashion. It can be concluded that the PET 14 – 17 can be utilized with relatively high accuracy and reproducibility to estimate CP without causing exhaustion in the subjects...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} and dielectric breakdown properties of polylacti cacid (PLA) <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> copolymer, which are biodegradable plastics, were examined, and physicochemical analysis were performed. At room temperature, the Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus of PLA <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> copolymer were about 3. 6 GPa and about 3. 9 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the temperature to which Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus of PLA <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> copolymer begins to decrease was about 60 ℃ and about 55 ℃, respectively. The dielectric breakdown strength (Eb) of PLA <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> copolymer {{at room temperature}} were about 6. 2 MV/cm and about 4. 8 MV/cm, respectively. The Eb of PLA increased {{with an increase in}} temperature, and was about 6. 9 MV/cm at 60 ℃(∂Eb/∂T> 0). The Eb of PET copolymer was hardly dependent on temperature in the domain of 70 °C or less (∂Eb/∂T= 0).

50|$|Preclinical SPECT <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> are {{two very}} similar {{molecular}} imaging modalities used for noninvasive visualization of biodistribution of radiolabel tracers that are injected into an animal. The major difference between SPECT <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> lies {{in the nature of}} the radioactive decay of their tracers. SPECT tracer emits single γ-photons with the energy of photons that depends on the isotope that was used for radiolabeling. In PET, the tracer emits positrons that, after annihilation with electrons in the subject, produce a pair of 511 keV annihilation photons emitted into opposite directions. Coincidental detection of these annihilation photons is used for image formation in PET. As a result, different detection principles have been developed for SPECT <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> tracers, which has led to separate SPECT <b>and</b> <b>PET</b> scanners.|$|R
30|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} will {{summarize the}} location {{and the number of}} positive cases for each lymph node using CT (where the test positive is defined as a lymph node short axis diameter[*]>[*] 1  cm), PET (where the test positive is defined as that SUV >[*] 3.0), and DECT (where the test positive is defined as that the iodine is <[*] 2.5 mgI/mL).

The diagnostic power will be summarized by the area under the curve at receiver operating characteristic analysis (AUC), comparing CT <b>and</b> <b>PET,</b> CT <b>and</b> DECT, as well as <b>PET</b> <b>and</b> DECT. Multilevel models will be used to estimate the probability of a positive, which will be used to estimate the empirical AUC. The following additional analysis will be done to further understand the performance of CT, <b>PET,</b> <b>and</b> DECT. First, the Cohen’s κ statistics will be used to assess the concordance between CT <b>and</b> <b>PET,</b> DECT <b>and</b> <b>PET,</b> <b>and</b> DECT and CT.
