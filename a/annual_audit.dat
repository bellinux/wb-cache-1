25|$|The National Commission for Higher Education officially {{accredited}} the AUM on 30 June 2016, after a 14-month {{process which}} included financial and academic evaluations.

25|$|In August, {{during the}} <b>annual</b> <b>audit</b> of Beznau 2, the 50 kV {{emergency}} power line was inactivated. Consequently, the diesel generator of Beznau 1 was switched on at low regime as prescribed {{by the security}} regulations. After the reconnection of the 50 kV line, the generator ran at higher load because of technical reasons, but it eventually failed due to a defective relay. It was therefore assumed that while the 50 kV line was not active the generator {{would not have been}} able to run at full loading. Since the unit 2 generator was also unavailable due to the planned audit, the emergency power could be provided only by the hydroelectric plant or backup generators activated in case of flood. The decrease in redundancy caused a deviation from the normal operation parameters and was therefore classified as a level 1 event (Swiss scale level B).|$|E
