Further observations on the cultural characteristics are described in Tables 1 ～ 4. The physiological characteristics are listed in Table 5 summarily, which brought {{out the fact that}} the test-yeasts dissimilate sugars rather oxidatively than fermentatively, i. e. gaseous fermentation was not observed in the liquid cultures but some strains showed it by Lindner’s method only, and no remarkable difference from the true yeasts was observed on the <b>assimilabilities</b> of nitrogen compounds and ethyl alcohol. Most of the yeasts tested showed the lipolytic abilities when tributyrin agar was used as substrate(Table 6). Their growth-pH, -temperature and thermal death points are shown in Table 7. The optimum pH of their growth (5. 0 ～ 7. 0) is comparatively higher than in the case of true yeasts(4. 0 ～ 6. 9). The salt tolerance was apparently lower than in the case of true yeasts (Table 8). Generally speaking, the properties of asporogenous yeasts in “Shiokara” seem to have some resemblances to those of Debaryomyces species, and these Candida species, at least in “Shiokara”, are not considered belonging to and imperfect stage of Saccharomyces or Hansenula species. 先に無胞子酵母の形態学的特徴について報告したが，本報においては分類学的研究特に培養的並びに生理学的性質と発酵食品の製造・保蔵などに関係のあるこれら酵母の発育条件，耐塩力等について検討した結果を報告する...|$|R

The preva-lence of anemias {{in this country}} is an embar-rassing reminder that iron fortification of var-ious foods (e. g., bread) might be improved with respect to the <b>assimilability</b> of the iron supplement (2). We have been interested in the solution chemistry and metabolism of iron, and have studied its interaction with complexing agents, which not only maintain the solubility of iron at physiological pH, but also may fa-cilitate the intestinal absorption of this metal. Fructose, because of its unusual complexing properties (3), appears to satisfy these cri-teria. The ferric fructose complex (4) is quite stable throughout a wide range of pH (5) and exists as a low molecular weight complex in equilibrium with high molecular weight ferric oxyhydroxide polymers (6). Past studies with ferric fructose have emphasized its effective absorption by man (7, 8, and M. Pollycove, personal communication), rabbits (9), rats (10, 11), and swine (J.

40|$|There {{seems to}} be a popular belief that Muslim {{fertility}} in Europe is much higher than that of non-Muslims. Part of this belief stems from the general impression of high fertility in some Muslim countries in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. This notion is typically transferred to Muslims living in Europe with their increasing migration along with concerns about numbers and <b>assimilability</b> into European society. I The first part of this paper addresses the question of how much difference there is between Muslim and non-Muslim fertility in Europe (in those countries where such information is available). At the beginning of the 21 st century, there are estimated to be approximately 40 – 50 million Muslims in Europe. Almost all of the Muslims in Central and Eastern Europe live in the Balkans. (Kosovo, although formally part of Serbia, is listed as a country in Table 1). In Western Europe the majority of Muslims immigrated after the Second World War. The post-war economic reconstruction and boom required considerably more labor than was domestically available. There were two principal types of immigration to Western Europe: (a) from countries of the respective former colonial empires; and (b) from Southern Europe, the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Turkey. As much of this immigration took place during the 1950 s and 1960 s large proportions of present-day Muslims are second and third generation descendants.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1995 Dr. Velma Joan JoynsonThe thesis seeks to find {{evidence to support the}} assumption that British migrants were the ‘pampered’ and ‘protected’ of the post-World War Two intake of migrants. Contemporary students of historical writing of the migration experience have virtually written British migrants out of the history of this era by such unsubstantiated assumptions. The assimilationist construct of the 1940 s to the 1960 s that defined non-British migrants as assimilable, and British migrants as ‘kith’ and ‘kin’ was a vital component in the ideology of governments. It enabled them to carry out a migration programme the extent of which had no precedent in Australian history. Because social participation is vital in the process of admitting new knowledge, the construction of <b>assimilability</b> needed to be developed and legitimated on the basis of shared values. In effect the imposition of ‘new’ information promulgated by the institutions of society needed an empathetic response from the community, for the successful implementation of the programme. If the concept of non-British migrants as being assimilable could be ‘sold’ to the public, then it went without saying that British migrants would be the exemplar of trouble-free assimilation; they were ‘kith’ and ‘kin’. When British migrants did not fit the archetypal mould designed and fashioned for them by others, they had to be redefined for the continuing success of a policy. The thesis examines the experience of British migrants during the assimilationist era and how their settlement was affected by this ideological construct. Open Acces...|$|E

High‐grading practices strongly modify the forestry structure by the means of bias in the dominant height and stand density. In order to achieve the silvicultural and site variability of Scots pine stands in the studied area, 75 plots from the National Forest Inventory of Spain (NFI) were selected. In these plots 46 dominant trees were cut down and 104 trees were bored at stump and at breast height (1. 3 m). In each plot a soil sample from the first 10 cm of soil was taken and signs of dimensional cutting were recorded. Site index curves and the edaphic discriminant rule were developed. The site index curve model used {{is an extension of}} the Richards model. The site factors selected in the discriminant rule represent the most important edaphic parameters for forest productivity (texture and the <b>assimilability</b> of the nutrients). Site quality of the studied stands was medium‐low as compared with other site index curves for Scots pine around the world. The edaphic discriminant rule presented is useful for estimating site index classes in stands exposed to dimensional cutting and in young stands of Scots pine in the the High Ebro Basin (northern Spain).

40|$|Protein {{content in}} cow milk (with over 20 proteins, and {{peptides}} may also {{occur as a}} result of enzymatic hydrolysis) ranges from 2. 5 % to 4. 2 % and is about 1. 5 - 2 times higher than in human milk. Its most important allergens are considered to be β-lactoglobulin (absent in human milk) and αs 1 -casein. The most similar in composition to human milk is horse and donkey milk. It contains considerably more whey proteins (35 - 50 %) than cow milk (about 20 %), and the concentration of the most allergenic casein fraction αs 1 is 1. 5 - 2. 5 g/l. In comparison, the content of αs 1 -casein in cow milk is about 10 g/l. β-lactoglobulin present in donkey milk is a monomer, while in milk of ruminants it is a dimer. Like human milk, it contains a substantial amount of lactose (about 7 %), which determines its flavour and facilitates calcium absorption. The high lysozyme content (about 1 g/l) gives it antibacterial properties (compared to trace amounts in ruminants). Camel milk is also more digestible and induces fewer allergic reactions, because it lacks β-lactoglobulin, and its β-casein has a different structure. It also contains (compared to cow milk) more antibacterial substances such as lysozyme, lactoferrin and immunoglobulins, and furthermore the number of immunoglobulins is compatible with human ones. Goat milk components have a higher degree of <b>assimilability</b> as compared to cow milk. Its main protein is β-casein, with total protein content depending on the αs 1 -casein genetic variant. Goats with the ‘ 0 ’ variant do not synthesize this allergenic protein.

40|$|Summary. Melted {{butter is}} made from dairy butter by {{rendering}} the fat phase. It has specific taste and aroma, high-calorie content and good <b>assimilability.</b> Defects of butter which appeared during the storage causes {{by the development of}} microbiological processes or by the chemical oxidation. On the development of these processes influence quality and composition of fresh butter, its physical structure, content of the increased amount of gas phase and content of heavy metals, storage conditions. Microbiological spoilage of butter occurs generally due to damage of plasma which is good environment for the development of microorganisms. Defects of microbiological origin include: unclean, sour, moldy, yeasty, cheesy, bitter taste. Defects of test and smell chemical origin are formed due to hydrolytic digestion of lipids. It's prevailed at long storage of butter in the conditions of freezing temperatures. It's picked out the following main processes of spoiling: souring, acidifying and sallowness. Often these processes take place simultaneously. It has been investigated melted butter with lactated additive. The latter improves the microbiological and toxicological safety, prolongs the storage condition of the products. Technological efficiency of the additives is achieved by a multilayer products formation from the inactive bound water, preventing microorganisms growth and by the barrier layer with lactate inhibiting hydrolytic reactions. Oil samples were obtained with the batch-type butter maker application, then they were melted and after that lactated additive were supplemented. It has been studied organoleptic and physico-chemical indices of the melted butter samples. The fatty-acid composition of melted butter were studied. Comparative analysis of fatty-acid composition of cow's milk fat and produced melted butter has shown their similarity.

40|$|Thesis [...] PU vir CHO 1. Introduction - This {{is a brief}} {{account of}} the {{education}} of immigrants at schools within an industrial growth point in the R. S. A. It comprises problems encountered in schools locally, the education of immigrants in foreign countries generally and possible improvements {{in the education of}} immigrant children in the area researched. 2. Orientation and motivation - Since the establishment of the Department of Immigration in 1961 the ever increasing numbers of immigrants entering our schools have created various educational problems. Consequently requests for research into these problems were made to the Minister of National Education. The {{purpose of this study is}} to give an objective, systematic description of the didactic-pedagogic situation within 31 schools at which immigrants are enrolled. The areas concerned are the iron and steel, and petrochemical industrial areas of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. This study was undertaken during 1971 - 72, referring back to 1961, and includes a universum of 17 608 children of whom 2 022 are immigrants. A sample of 300 •immigrants and a control group of 300 South Africans were taken from 17 schools. Further information was gained from official and non-official documents, interviews and direct observation. Research was done in the countries of origin Israel, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, England, the U. S. A. and Canada. Immigrant children are defined as follows for the purposes of this inquiry: Definition for statistical purposes: An immigrant child is a child of foreign parents who have legally immigrated into the R. S. A. intending to settle permanently and who qualify, or eventually may qualify for South African citizenship through naturalisation, or who have already obtained South African citizenship during the lifetime of the child. Definition for language teaching purposes: An immigrant who requires language instruction is: (1) a child whose mother tongue is English but who has no knowledge of Afrikaans as a second language; (2) a child whose mother tongue is neither Afrikaans nor English and who has no knowledge of either Afrikaans or English as a second language; (3) a child whose mother tongue is neither Afrikaans nor English but who has a knowledge of Afrikaans or English as a second language. These children are a potential source of linguistic problems in schools. If knowledge of the medium of instruction is taken as a criterion immigrants can be further defined as follows for the purpose of language teaching: An immigrant is a child who cannot read, write or speak the medium of instruction or the second language. Consequently this child becomes a potential source of linguistic problems in the medium of instruction and the second language. 3. Immigration in the R. S. A. - A survey of immigration in the R. S. A. is essential as it determines the extent of provision required for the education of immigrant pupils. Education is a most appropriate means of promoting successful integration. It can however be applied as a conservation mechanism for retaining the culture of the native land. The history of immigration in South Africa illustrates that education can bring about cultural changes. Where a policy of dispersal was followed as in the case of the French Huguenots they became integrated with the majority of the European population and education brought cultural changes. Many British and German settlers however retained their identity through group settlement and education in their national culture. Today immigration is necessary. European labour is required if an economic growth rate of 5 1 / 2 % is to be maintained. It is also required for demographic, social and cultural reasons. The Department of Immigration was established in 1961 to promote immigration. This Department has delegated the function of immigrant integration to State subsidised private organizations, as well as the Department of National Education and the Provincial Education Departments. The influx of 40 000 immigrants from various European and other countries yields 7 000 immigrant pupils annually. For socio-economic reasons immigrants tend to settle at industrial growth points, where this pattern of settlement influences education. 4. The education of immigrant children at an industrial growth point in the R. S. A. - Most immigrants within the specified terrain come from the over-populated heavy iron and steel industrial areas or impoverished agricultural areas of central and southern Europe and the United Kingdom. Refugees from eastern Europe also immigrate. For purposes of this research the immigrants are classified into three groups according to 1 the language of their country of origin, viz. English 34 %, Continental Germanic 28 % and Diverse 38 %. According to the medium of instruction the language ratio of Afrikaans to English is 7 : 1 in the Transvaal schools, 9 : 1 in the schools of the O. F. S. and 9 : 1 in the research area. All the English speaking immigrants are compelled to take instruction through the medium of English as English is their home language. Parents of immigrant children who have no knowledge of either English or Afrikaans choose the medium of instruction artificially for their children. This results in English being the language of choice of 97 % of the Diverse and 45 % of the Continental-Germanic immigrants. Afrikaans is the medium of instruction for the rest of the children. Thus Afrikaans is the medium of instruction for 19 % and English the medium of instruction for 81 % of the universum of immigrants. The reasons for preference of English can not always be accounted for educationally. According to their medium of instruction the immigrant children are distributed in the public, private and nursery schools of the research area so that the number of immigrants in English medium schools is > 40 %, in parallel medium schools 5 to 15 % and in Afrikaans medium schools 1 : 3. Notwithstanding the fact that less than 5 % immigrants are found in the neighbouring Afrikaans medium schools, the enrolment in these schools shows a regressive tendency because Afrikaans children are displaced from the natural school zone because of immigrant group settlement. Consequently the enrolment in Afrikaans medium schools has had to be artificially supplemented by rezoning and busing. The consistent incidence of immigrants of a specific nationality leads to the establishment of their own private schools as a defensive measure in retaining their national culture. Academic achievements of immigrants show that they meet with more success in parallel medium schools, that the Continental-Germanic children achieve better results and that the greatest erosion takes place among Diverse immigrants. English immigrant children are poorly motivated. Academic achievements of immigrant children are positively related to vocabulary, length of domicile and adjustment. Language deficiency must be taken into consideration for promotion purposes for two to three years after immigration. Matriculation concessions have to be retained for Diverse children but not for English and Continental-Germanic children Cultural deprivation, irregular school attendance and poor motivation also result in poor achievement. There is a lack of suitable teaching methods, syllabi and teaching aids. Teachers have not received the necessary training for immigrant or cross-cultural education. Parents are not involved enough in the education of their children. 6. Education of immigrants elsewhere - Inter- and intra-continental migration causes thousands of immigrant children to attend schools in foreign countries. Excellent measures are taken for the elimination of immigrant alienation and for the conservation of the national character of education, religion, language and the autochthonous population in schools. Intensive research preceded these measures and the statistics of immigration were taken into consideration in the planning of education. The majority of immigrant countries have formulated policies which provide for inter alia the dispersal of immigrants limiting them to 20 % per school, 5 % per nationality per school and four to five per class. The necessary consideration is given to the religion of immigrants, but dispersal and education are regarded as sufficient safeguard for native mores, religion and culture. Immigrants are compelled to master the medium of instruction as a prerequisite for cultural integration. The official medium of instruction is compulsory in order to prevent the formation of foreign language groups. Immigrants are exempted from the second language and allowed to study their mother tongue as a subject. In cases where a foreign language is taken, the consolidation of the medium of instruction receives priority. Although private schools exist they are not regarded as desirable because of their curbing effect on integration. The grouping of immigrants in classes depends on their varying degrees of alienation and on how soon the continuity of education can be restored. Pre-school immigrant children attend nursery schools in order to promote mastery of the-medium of instruction. Reception centres are provided from where immigrants are directed to schools. Dispersal in ordinary classes 9 flexible integration, promotion classes, intensive term and year classes are utilized. Adolescents are required to comply with the regulations regarding compulsory education in order to promote their social, cultural and economic integration. Remedial education is provided and teaching content adjusted and optimally utilized for transcultural teaching. Special methods of language teaching, for instance the audio- linguistic method - based on words and structures with the highest use frequency - are used to enable the immigrant pupils to master a functional vocabulary quickly. Various teaching aids are used, e. g. creation of realistic conditions in teaching, holiday projects and various audio-visual aids. Specially trained supernumerary teaching staff are appointed. Immigrant parents are also taught the new language in order to promote their economic value but also with a view to cultural integration. A marked deficiency in the education of immigrant pupils is encountered in countries where no research has been done on education of immigrants. In such countries the alienation of immigrant children is emphasised and prolonged by their isolation in "Ubergangklasse" and accumulation in ordinary classes. 7. Possible solutions to the problems in the education of immigrant children in the research area - In order to evaluate the education of immigrant pupils in the research area, criteria were formulated with due regard to the deficiencies of education in the research area, historical aspects of immigrant education and successful measures that have been taken abroad. Local immigrant teaching was subsequently evaluated by application of the formulated criteria, hence deficiencies and excellencies in local measures were revealed. The following proposals for the improvement of immigrant education in the research area were deduced: 7. 1. Education and immigration should be co-ordinated for the "South Africanizing” of immigrant children and for the protection of the national character of education and national identity. This demands co-ordination concerning the extent of provision of education for immigrant children and the nature and extent of immigration. (a) Research should be done immediately concerning the factors underlying the alienation of immigrants and the factors determining the national character of education. (b) National education policy demands education with a broad national character. This implies elimination of alienation amongst immigrants and cultural integration with a view to ultimate citizenship. On the other hand it implies the protection of the national identity and the national character of education. South Africanization contains an inherent dualism rooted in the division of Whites into English speaking and Afrikaans speaking groups. For the purposes of this thesis South Africanization means identification with either the Afrikaans or English section of the community. (c) Protection of the national character demands that the volume and origin of immigrants should be controlled and that the <b>assimilability</b> o:f prospective immigrants should be carefully considered. Immigrants should be limited to 20 % per school, four to five per class and 5 % per nationality per school. Immigrants should attend the schools in the immediate vicinity of their homes.
