5|$|After helping {{oversee the}} {{repatriation}} of soldiers back to Australia, Leane {{returned home to}} South Australia in late 1919. In May the following year he {{was selected as the}} next Commissioner of the South Australia Police, taking up the appointment in July. His appointment was initially controversial within the force, as there had been an established practice of selecting the commissioner from within its ranks. Leane also returned to part-time soldiering, commanding at the brigade level until 1926, not without controversy. His administration of the police force was generally praised, although he did have to weather several storms, one of which involved a royal commission into bribery of some of his officers by bookmakers. He was a foundation member and inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen. In 1928, during a major dispute over the industrial award applying to waterfront labourers, Leane provided police protection to non-union workers, and on one occasion personally led a force of 150 police that successfully confronted a crowd of 2,000 waterside labourers who wanted to remove non-union workers from Adelaide ports. As commissioner, he introduced a number of innovations, including cadets and probationary training for young recruits, police dogs, and traffic <b>accident</b> <b>analysis.</b> After the outbreak of World War II, despite being on the retired list, Leane became the state commander of the Returned and Services League-organised Volunteer Defence Corps, a form of home guard, in addition to his duties as commissioner. After retiring in 1944, he was knighted for his services during 24 years {{at the head of the}} police force. In retirement he became involved in conservative politics, and remained active with returned servicemen's associations until his death in 1962.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} new {{contributing}} factors were considered after reviewing accidents involving solo diving, diving with incapable dive partners, video or photography in caves, complex cave dives and cave diving in large groups. With {{the establishment of}} technical diving, the use of mixed gases—such as trimix for bottom gas, and nitrox and oxygen for decompression—reduces the margin for error. <b>Accident</b> <b>analysis</b> suggests that breathing the wrong gas for the depth or not analyzing the breathing gas properly has also led to cave diving accidents.|$|E
25|$|However, {{upon hearing}} of the missing airliners, Palen decided that {{what he had seen}} might have been smoke from a post-crash fire. He and his brother flew a light {{aircraft}} (a Piper Tri-Pacer) deep into the canyon and searched near the location of the smoke. The Constellation's empennage was found, and the brothers reported their findings to authorities. The following day, the two men pinpointed the wreckage of the DC-7. Numerous helicopter missions were subsequently flown down to the crash sites to find and attempt to identify victims, as well as recover wreckage for <b>accident</b> <b>analysis,</b> a difficult and dangerous process due to the rugged terrain and unpredictable air currents.|$|E

2500|$|Training: A safe cave diver {{does not}} {{intentionally}} exceed {{the scope of}} his or her training. Cave diving is normally taught in stages, each successive stage focusing on more complex aspects of cave diving. Each stage of training is intended to be reinforced with actual cave diving experience to develop competence before starting training at a more complex level. <b>Accident</b> <b>analysis</b> of cave diving fatalities has shown [...] that academic training without sufficient real world experience is not always enough {{in the event of an}} underwater emergency. By systematically building experience the diver can develop the confidence, motor skills and reflexes to remain calm and apply the appropriate procedures in an emergency. An inexperienced diver is more likely to panic than an experienced diver when confronted with a similar situation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop fatality accident scenarios for railway workers and assess the risk for each scenario. In this research, we develop accident scenarios using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method to analyze systematically and evaluate quantitatively fatality accident scenarios for railway workers. This approach was inspired by the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method, which is conventionally used in quality management and is used at the systematic <b>accident</b> scenario <b>analysis</b> (SASA) for the design of safer products. In this study, QFD provides a formal and systematic schema to devise accident scenarios while maintaining the objectivity. The <b>accident</b> scenario <b>analysis</b> method first identifies the hazardous events and explains the hazardous conditions that surround the accident and cause railway accidents. This method includes a feasibility test, a clustering process and a pattering process for a clearer understanding of the accident situation. Since this method enables an <b>accident</b> scenario <b>analysis</b> to be performed systematically as well as objectively, this method is useful in building better accident prevention strategies. Therefore, this study could serve to reduce railway accidents and could be an effective tool for a hazard analysis...|$|R

The mathematical model and correlations for the main physical processes are described. Results of computational analysis of three experimental series reported in the literature are presented. The calculations were carried out by the combined SOCRAT/VAPEX code and were aimed at validation of the predictive capabilities of the code. The experiments chosen cover a wide range of physical parameters, which enables different aspects of the code to be verified, that is, drag correlations (MAGICO- 2000), evaporation rate (QUEOS), fuel fragmentation, and interaction with the coolant in all complexity (FARO). Generally, reasonable agreement between the measured data and calculated results was obtained, which allows one to use the combined SOCRAT/VAPEX code for severe <b>accidents</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
