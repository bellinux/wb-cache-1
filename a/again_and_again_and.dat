All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and,</b> when she had finished what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E

25|$|The RMS Titanic was an Olympic class {{passenger}} liner {{owned by the}} White Star Line and was built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, {{in what is now}} Northern Ireland. At the time of her construction, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world. Shortly before midnight on April 14, 1912, four days into the ship's maiden voyage, Titanic struck an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on April 15, 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 of the 2,223 people on board, {{making it one of the}} deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. After nearly 74 years of being lost at sea on the bottom of the ocean floor, a joint Franco-American expedition led by American oceanographer Dr. Robert D. Ballard, discovered the wreckage of the RMS Titanic two miles (3km) beneath the waves of the North Atlantic on September 1, 1985. Ballard was then forced to wait a year for weather conditions favorable to a manned mission to view the wreck at close range. In 1986, Ballard and his two-man crew, in the ALVIN submersible, made the first two and-a-half hour descent to the ocean floor to view the wreck first-hand. Over the next few days, they descended <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and,</b> using the Jason Jr. remote camera, recorded the first scenes of the ruined interior of the luxury liner.|$|E

500|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspect of his}} songwriting {{involved}} {{the wide range of}} genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel and disco.

I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things." [...] Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs from Queen II which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he also claimed that he could barely read music. He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.|$|E

In {{a review of}} Unorthodox Jukebox, Slant Magazines Andrew Chan wrote {{that it is the}} album's highlight being the most energetic track on the album and found it [...] "most infectious bedroom anthem of the year." [...] Likewise, Lauren Kreisler from the Official Charts Company, described the song as an apparent bedroom antics. About.com critic Bill Lamb rated the song 3 out of 5 stars, praising the musicality, since the singer recaptures [...] "the musical spirit of Prince's arena sized ballad [...] "Purple Rain" [...] and [...] "the pounding keyboards and crunchy guitar will invite a live audience to sway along in time to the music". On the other hand, the [...] "erotic connection" [...] is misguided because [...] "the words about alcohol and cocaine fueled rough sex, {{it is difficult to see}} the song as truly erotic", making the lyrics [...] "tasteless" [...] and lacking concept.

500|$|The writers {{originally}} wanted American actor Sheldon Leonard {{to voice}} Fat Tony, {{but they were}} unable to get him, so they went with Joe Mantegna instead. Mantegna was offered the role during the show's second season, and since he had seen the show before and thought it was [...] "funny", he decided to give it a shot. He felt honored that they asked him to do a voice for the show. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Mantegna said he thinks the reason he got the role was partly due to his performance in the 1990 Mafia film The Godfather Part III, which opened just prior to when he received the role. He thought the script was smart and clever and that he enjoyed recording it. Mantegna has since appeared many times on the show as Fat Tony, who became a recurring character; it is Mantegna's longest-running role in his acting career. Mantegna commented: [...] "Who knew that Fat Tony was gonna resonate in {{the hearts and minds of}} the [...] out there? Apparently [...] got enough feedback as to how the character was liked that they wrote it in <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> I was kind of a recurring guy that they’d tap into at least a couple episodes a season." ...|$|E

[...] In Playboy, Robert Christgau claimed that while listeners unfamiliar with its style of music would not find the tracks as powerful, [...] "they are so rich and eclectic, and spun out with such a sense of flow, that this album establishes the kind of convincing aural reality other British techno experimenters only fantasize about." [...] Tom Wilkes of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "The album flips hip hop inside out all over again like a reversible glove, and <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> each time it's sudden and new. I am, I confess, totally confounded by it. I hear a lot of good records, but very few impossible ones... You need this record. You are incomplete without it." [...] Author and rock critic Greil Marcus published a glowing review of the album in his [...] "Real Life Rock Top Ten" [...] column for Interview, where he called it [...] "absolutely modern – which is to say ambient-dreamy and techno-abstract" [...] and [...] "quite brilliant throughout".|$|E

500|$|With polls {{released}} on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt {{of being a}} warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, {{but he had been}} advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's [...] "falsifications". The president stated, [...] "I have said <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> again that your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." [...] Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, [...] "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.|$|E
