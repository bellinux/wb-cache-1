40|$|In {{the past}} two decades the widely {{reported}} personal saving rate in the United States has dropped from double digits to below zero. First, we attempt to account for the decline in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) saving rate. The macroeconomic literature suggests that about half of the drop since 1988 can be attributed to households spending stock market capital gains. Another thirty percent is <b>accounting</b> <b>transfers</b> from personal saving into government and corporate saving because of the way pensions and capital gains taxes are treated in the NIPA. Second, while NIPA saving measures are well suited for measuring the supply of new funds for investment and capital accumulation, {{it is not clear that}} they should be the target of government saving policies. Finally, we emphasize that the NIPA saving rate is not useful in judging whether households are preparing for retirement or other contingencies. Many households have accumulated significant wealth, primarily through retirement saving vehicles and capital gains, even as the saving rate slid. There remains a segment of the population, however, who save little and whose behavior appears untouched either by the stock market boom or the slide in personal saving. We explore reasons and policy options for their puzzlingly low saving rate. ...|$|E

40|$|Banking {{transactions}} using smartphones or {{more commonly}} known as “smartphone banking ” are increasingly becoming popular {{as a way for}} financial transactions given the growing number of smartphone users. The smartphone banking is considered to be different from mobile banking because of the unique and innovative features of smartphones- a combination of a computer and mobile phone that can easily access the Internet. This study based on the Technology Acceptance Model(TAM), examines the factors that influence the intention to use smartphone banking by surveys and analyzing the findings gathered from previous mobile banking related researches. Furthermore, this research identifies the issues of security risk and trust in using smartphone banking in addition to its perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as key factors suggested under TAM. Statistics on the usage frequency of smartphone banking in Korea shows that the proportion of <b>account</b> <b>transfer</b> transactions are much smaller than the account check transactions, compared with the Internet banking in general. This study explains such less common usage of smartphones for account checking transactions than <b>account</b> <b>transfer</b> transactions, by showing that the key factors (i. e. perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) have greater impact in account check than in <b>account</b> <b>transfer,</b> and trust has greater impact on <b>account</b> <b>transfer</b> transactions than <b>account</b> check transactions in smartphone banking...|$|R
