The methodology is primarily aimed at the evaluators, but technical staff working for microcredit providers may also find it useful. The main purpose of the methodology is to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the evaluation process, from sign-up to post-award decision and support, and to offer detailed guidelines for the assessment of <b>applicability</b> <b>and</b> <b>compliance</b> of clauses...|$|E
40|$|Legal {{scholarship}} {{regarding the}} implementation of European Union law recognises the gap between policy, enacted law and its application. Writers typically focus {{on the role of}} the European Court of Justice, the role of the European Commission, as well as the obligations of Member States under European law stemming from the Treaties (and in a broader context, from the association with the European Union). Political science literature offers a different explanation of the same gap between policy and implementation, highlighting the presence of extra-legal factors obstructing the occurrence of desired social changes. The literature has identified a number of variables which determine implementation outcomes, and suggested contextual conditions which may be conducive to ‘giving effect to policy’. This thesis explores tensions arising from legal concepts of direct <b>applicability</b> <b>and</b> <b>compliance,</b> and political science concepts of implementation and practical effectiveness with reference to voluntary food quality schemes in Poland, in particular the laws of Protected Designations of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) and Traditional Specialties Guaranteed (TSG). The core of the research is an empirical study, using semi-structured interviews with actors at all levels of implementation of these laws in Poland: at the ministerial, regional and local level, including officials and producer consortia. An interview protocol derived from the theories of implementation in political science and law investigates the implementation chain in its entirety, from policy formation to the legislative act, and finishing with the ‘recipients’ themselves, the targets of legal intervention. The results show that a lack of effectiveness does not mean non-compliance (in law) of an EU Member State. Member States might have implemented the Community legislation fully by creating a regulatory environment indispensable to its success. Yet, for implementation to be effective, enforcement agents must themselves be committed to the behaviour required by the law, circumstances external to the implementing agency should not impose critical constraints, and the recipients must be persuaded of the benefits of participating in voluntary schemes. These findings appear to support the political science theory of perfect implementation and effectiveness of law, and highlight gaps in enforcement mechanisms available to the Union Institutions. For example, the European Court of Justice acts against non-compliance on the Commission’s motion, whereas the Commission often relies on claims lodged by Member States or other entitled actors, rather than on its own investigation. The findings also confirm that political science models designed for international or national law remain valid for European Union law and can be applied in its specific context...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} the landing gear {{is one of the}} more {{fundamental}} aspects of aircraft design. The design and integration process encompasses numerous engineering disciplines, e. g., structure, weights, runway design, and economics, and has become extremely sophisticated in the last few decades. Although the design process is well-documented, no attempt has been made until now in the development of a design methodology that can be used within an automated environment. As a result, the process remains to be a key responsibility for the configuration designer and is largely experience-based and graphically-oriented. However, as industry and government try to incorporate multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) methods in the conceptual design phase, the need for a more systematic procedure has become apparent. The development of an MDO-capable design methodology as described in this work is focused on providing the conceptual designer with tools to help automate the disciplinary analyses, i. e., geometry, kinematics, flotation, and weight. Documented design procedures and analyses were examined to determine their <b>applicability,</b> <b>and</b> to ensure <b>compliance</b> with current practices and regulations. Using the latest information as obtained from industry during initial industry survey, the analyses were in terms modified and expanded to accommodate the design criteria associated with the advanced large subsonic transports. Algorithms were then developed based on the updated analysis procedures to be incorporated into existing MDO codes...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{taxation}} causes deadweight losses [...] from substitution, evasion, and avoidance activities [...] and direct, administrative <b>and</b> <b>compliance,</b> costs. Some of these social costs tend to be discontinuous and/or nonconvex. Because most models of taxation ignore some components of the social costs of taxation, their conclusions cannot be considered all-encompassing. An alternative approach to policy evaluation is {{to rely on a}} marginal efficiency cost of funds rule that can indicate appropriate directions of reforms. The paper discusses the merits, <b>applicability,</b> <b>and</b> limitation of this rule, as well as its relationship to other concepts. ...|$|R
