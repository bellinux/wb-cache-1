5|$|Andrés Silva (Uruguay), {{who ran the}} 400 metres hurdles on July 22/23, was {{reported}} on August 19 to have tested positive for a prohibited substance in a doping control conducted by the Uruguayan <b>anti-doping</b> agency on June 2. If found to have committed an <b>anti-doping</b> rule violation, his results from the Pan American Games {{are likely to be}} disqualified.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May 2013, the Olympic bronze-medalist {{was given}} an “all-clean” {{certificate}} by the National <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency.|$|E
5|$|The Drug Control Centre at King's was {{established}} in 1978 {{and is the only}} WADA accredited <b>anti-doping</b> laboratory in the UK and holds the official UK contract for running doping tests on UK athletes. In 1997, it became the first International Olympic Committee accredited laboratory to meet the ISO/IEC 17025 quality standard. The centre was the <b>anti-doping</b> facility for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E
5|$|All the {{received}} nominations {{are sent}} to SAI and National <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency for the verification against the claimed achievements and doping clearance respectively. Any sportsperson who is either penalised or being enquired for usage of drugs or substances banned by the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency is not eligible for the award. A committee consisting of the Joint Secretary and the Director/Deputy Secretary of Department of Sports, the Secretary and the Executive Director/Director (TEAMS) of SAI verify and validate the nominations.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 2014, the Badminton World Federation {{confirmed}} that Lee was temporarily suspended from competing {{due to an}} apparent <b>anti-doping</b> regulation violation. The hearing was held on 11 April 2015 in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, Lesnar was {{notified}} {{of a potential}} <b>anti-doping</b> policy violation by the United States <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency (USADA) stemming from an undisclosed banned substance in an out-of-competition sample collected on June 28. On July 19, the UFC announced that a second sample taken in-competition on July 9 {{tested positive for the}} same banned substance discovered in the previous out-of-competition sample. On August 23, the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) confirmed that Lesnar twice tested positive for the estrogen blocker clomiphene and he was suspended.|$|E
5|$|The IFNA is {{affiliated}} with the General Association of International Sports Federations, the International World Games Association and the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations. It is also a signatory to the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Code.|$|E
5|$|Wallhead {{was tested}} {{positive}} from an out-of-competition test collected on October 7, 2017 by USADA and {{is facing a}} possible <b>anti-doping</b> violation.|$|E
5|$|An {{in-house}} {{waste water}} treatment and reuse facility, organic waste treatment facilities, and solar powered energy were among the environmentally friendly practices adopted by the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Headquarters (OC CWG Delhi 2010). At the same time, most of the transport fleet provided for the Games ran on green fuels such as battery electric vehicles and compressed natural gas. Residents and guests could also offset travel-accumulated carbon emissions by computing their footprint and then procuring carbon credits at the specifically created Green Games Carbon Neutrality Kiosk. The World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency set up an <b>anti-doping</b> education hub {{in collaboration with the}} organisers. Construction of the Games Village as a whole however was marred by delays and organisational inefficiencies, leading to concerns as expressed by athletes and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) (see below).|$|E
5|$|Dodd is a Grade IV equestrian competitor, {{coached by}} Peter Turner. Due to her sacral agenesis, when she rides her horse, she dislocates several bones every time, {{but as a}} result of <b>anti-doping</b> rules, she has had to find {{alternative}} ways of coping with pain associated with riding.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, it was {{announced}} that Gay had tested positive for a banned substance, following which he withdrew from consideration for the World Championships in Moscow. The United States <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency (USADA) suspended him until June 23, 2014, and stripped him of his silver medal from the 2012 Summer Olympics as a result.|$|E
5|$|The autumn was {{dominated}} by the Basso's involvement in Operación Puerto. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent, and the case against Basso was eventually dropped by the Federazione Ciclistica Italiana for lack of evidence, but without him authorizing a DNA test that could have cleared him conclusively. Basso adamantly denied being involved. (On 7 May 2007 Basso admitted involvement in Operación Puerto). Team CSC have since started an ambitious <b>anti-doping</b> program together with the Danish <b>anti-doping</b> expert Rasmus Damsgaard. Meanwhile, on the road, Voigt dominated the Deutschland Tour, winning overall and three stages, including a mountain finish and a time trial. Sastre came fourth in the Vuelta after starting in the lead when CSC won the initial team time trial. It was Sastre's fifth Grand Tour in a row.|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by <b>anti-doping</b> officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E
5|$|C. Floyd Landis was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Paris {{on the last day}} of the 2006 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during stage 17 of the race. The United States <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency found him guilty of using synthetic testosterone during the race and stripped him of his title on 20 September 2007.|$|E
5|$|Due to his doping ban, he {{was barred}} from the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, {{and much of the}} European racing circuit, from 2006 to 2012. The Court of Arbitration for Sport {{overturned}} his lifetime Olympic ban, deeming it non-compliant with the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Code, and he competed in the 2012 London Olympics. He produced a ghost-written autobiography with writer Ken Scott, Race Against Me, in 2009. He is of Afro-Caribbean- Jamaican descent and has two sons with his partner Leonie Daley.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, at UFC 199, the UFC {{announced}} that Lesnar {{would return to}} fight at UFC 200. Lesnar defeated his opponent Mark Hunt via unanimous decision. However, after Lesnar tested positive for clomiphene, a banned substance on the UFC's <b>anti-doping</b> policy, he was suspended from the UFC by the Nevada State Athletic Commission for one year, fined $250,000 and his victory over Hunt was overturned to a no-contest. Lesnar then retired from MMA {{for a second time}} in 2017.|$|E
5|$|LeMond is a {{longtime}} vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning {{of his relationship with}} Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him {{in the center of the}} <b>anti-doping</b> controversy.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April 2015, it was {{announced}} that Lee had been handed a backdated eight-month ban for his <b>anti-doping</b> rule violation. The panel was convinced that Lee had no intent to cheat and allowed him to resume his career by 1 May 2015. Lee was stripped of his silver medal from the 2014 World Championships but allowed to keep his two bronze medals from the 2014 Asian Games.|$|E
5|$|Riccò {{announced}} {{his intention to}} never race again in March, but signed with Continental team Meridiana-Kamen in June {{in the hope of}} competing in the Tour de Serbie. This did not transpire, as he was suspended by the Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the race, in relation to the February blood transfusion. He eventually received a twelve-year ban from the Italian National <b>Anti-Doping</b> Tribunal in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Sella confessed his doping to the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) {{and named}} {{teammate}} Matteo Priamo, also a stage winner in this Giro, as his supplier. Though Priamo never {{tested positive for}} anything, and though the Italian National <b>Anti-Doping</b> tribunal originally exonerated him, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled, upon appeal by CONI, {{that he should be}} suspended for four years.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the entire team. In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random drug tests. The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E
5|$|The {{headquarters}} of the Canadian Space Agency is in Longueuil, southeast of Montreal. Montreal also hosts the {{headquarters of}} the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO, a United Nations body); the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency (an Olympic body); the Airports Council International (the association of the world's airports – ACI World); the International Air Transport Association (IATA), IATA Operational Safety Audit and the International Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (IGLCC), as well as some other international organizations in various fields.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain {{substances}} by governing bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Code among other <b>anti-doping</b> measures. Practices such as blood doping {{and the use of}} anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E
5|$|A {{sample for}} an out-of-competition drugs test that Chambers had {{provided}} in Germany on 1 August 2003 was re-examined in October and subsequently {{tested positive for}} banned substances. The United States <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency (USADA) were investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO); the workplace of both Chambers' coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. Both men faced charges of distributing illegal drugs to athletes in the United States. The BALCO Scandal uncovered drug use {{in a wide range}} of sportsmen and women, including sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} positives {{over the}} summer, including tests from Leonardo Piepoli and Bernhard Kohl at the Tour de France, and Davide Rebellin and Stefan Schumacher from the 2008 Olympic Games, the UCI {{has sought to}} have samples taken during the Giro retested. In October 2009, {{it was announced that}} six to seven riders from this Giro had presumptive positives, while further untestable doping involving ozone was also suspected. In total, 82 samples were retested, and the presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an <b>anti-doping</b> lab in Lausanne, Switzerland. The identities of those riders who tested positive have not yet been revealed. It is believed that Rebellin and Sella are among the riders to have presumptive positives.|$|E
5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} {{during the race}} or season, the Gewiss-Ballan team has since been speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season. The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a sweep of the podium at La Flèche Wallonne weeks {{before the start of}} the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by United States <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency for distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to several of his clients.|$|E
5|$|From 1924 to 1988, {{the tournament}} {{started with a}} {{round-robin}} series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. The games of the tournament follow {{the rules of the}} International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), which differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. The tournament follows the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency's (WADA) rules on performance-enhancing drugs and the IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, a list of top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. Several players have tested positive for banned substances since the 1972 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} Summer Olympics, Solo {{received}} a public warning from the U.S. <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency (USADA) after a June 15 urine test concluded the banned substance Canrenone had been detected. Solo {{said in a statement}} she had been prescribed a pre-menstrual medication and was not aware it contained any banned substances. She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.|$|E
5|$|The IOC has retested nearly 500 doping {{samples that}} were {{collected}} at the 2006 Turin Games. In 2014, the Estonian Olympic Committee was notified by the IOC that a retested sample from cross-country skier Kristina Šmigun had tested positive. On 24 October 2016, the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency Athletes' Commission stated that Šmigun, who won two gold medals at the Turin Games, faces a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing {{before the end of}} October. If Šmigun were to be stripped of her gold medals, Kateřina Neumannová of Czech Republic could be elevated to gold in the 7.5 + 7.5 km double pursuit event. Marit Bjørgen of Norway could acquire a seventh gold medal in the 10 km classical event.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) {{requested}} {{the intervention of}} the International Association of Athletics Federations and the IOC; the samples were jointly reexamined by the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency and the IOC Sub-Commission on Doping and Biochemistry of Sport. In January 2003, the OCA announced that the IOC Medical Director had cleared Sunita of the doping charge and that appropriate action would be taken against the AGDCC. Both of Sunita's medals were reinstated on February 4, 2003, in a ceremony attended by the Secretary General of OCA Randhir Singh {{and the president of the}} IOA Suresh Kalmadi.|$|E
5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} {{that he was to}} answer to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, some {{competitors}} in cross-country skiing {{have chosen to}} enhance their performance through doping. <b>Anti-doping</b> tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used {{to cover up the}} use of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport. At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian cross-country skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the cross-country skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time {{was a lack of}} standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Agency, it falls into the category of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E
5|$|The race {{organizers}} performed <b>anti-doping</b> controls {{throughout the}} race. Riders would be selected after a stage and have thirty {{minutes to get}} tested. The results generally would be returned between thirty and sixty minutes later. No rider tested positive in this edition of the Giro, but had this happened, the following penalties would have been applied: the rider would be demoted to last place of the stage, given a ten-minute penalty in the general classification, a lengthy suspension, and a fine of one thousand francs. Although no riders tested positive, Roberto Visentini, Flavio Giuppioni and Urs Zimmermann – who placed second, third and fourth, respectively, in the eighteenth stage – showed up too late for their control tests and were given the penalties corresponding to riders testing positive; after complaints and threats to leave the race from their team leaders, the jury later reverted their decision, and no penalty was given.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing was}} at last held in November, with a verdict {{expected}} in January 2012. This, however, was also {{subject to a}} delay. Finally, on 6 February 2012, the court spoke, overturning the Spanish federation's decision to clear Contador and assessing the rider a backdated two-year ban, from the date of his adverse test at the 2010 Tour de France. The backdated ban meant any results obtained {{from the time of}} that test to the time the court announced its verdict were to be vacated and awarded in turn to previously second-placed riders. This effectively made Michele Scarponi the new Giro champion and points winner, and it made José Rujano and Vincenzo Nibali into stage winners in this Giro. The decision was reminiscent of that handed down in the Alessandro Petacchi case from the 2007 Giro d'Italia. The court's ruling opinion was that the minute amount of clenbuterol found was probably not caused by a doping regimen, but that strict liability rules meant that Contador had nonetheless violated WADA's World <b>Anti-Doping</b> Code. The court held that the adverse finding itself was never in doubt, but merely how the substance had entered the athlete's body. This was not a matter under which they could exonerate him.|$|E
