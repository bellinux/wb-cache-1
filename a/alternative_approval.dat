5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Weber {{proposed}} {{an alternative to}} the traditional [...] "plurality rule" [...] for elections involving more than two candidates. This <b>alternative,</b> <b>approval</b> voting, a multi-candidate binary rating system of social choice, has generated a substantial body of research, has been adopted by a number of professional organizations, and has been used in several public elections. His later work in this area includes [...] "A Theory of Voting Equilibria", co-authored with Roger Myerson. For a summary see [...] "Approval Voting".|$|E
40|$|In {{order not}} to hampers innovations, the Dutch National Building Regulations (NBR), allow an <b>alternative</b> <b>approval</b> route for new {{building}} materials. It {{is based on the}} principles of equivalent performance which states that if the solution proposed can be proven to have the same level of safety, protection of health, energy efficiency and protection of the environment, it is accepted as well. The framework of equivalence performance has been worked out in this paper with respect to safety. Three types of assessment criteria have been derived: for individual vales, for characteristic values and for relationships. More than one assessment criteria can apply at the same time. An example for a new material containing 50 % of recycled concrete and 50 % of recycled sand-lime brock aggregates illustrated the consequence of the assessment for two properties: compressive strength and tensile strength. The assessment procedure provides a new route for fast incorporation of new concrete-like materials in construction without compromising the safety of the structures. This will not only stimulate innovations. Since it is expected to be applicable for many newly developed green materials, it also make a significant contribution to reduction in CO 2 and energy consumption as well as raw materials in a relatively short time...|$|E
50|$|Another <b>alternative</b> is <b>{{approval}}</b> voting, {{which does}} not use a rank ballot. In approval voting, voters vote for as many candidates as they approve of. The total number of approval votes can greatly exceed the number of voters, but the candidate with the most approval votes wins.|$|R
40|$|During {{the life}} of a {{building}} one can expect an owner to make minor internal alterations to accommodate changing circumstances. Generally these minor alterations undertaken by the building owner without design advice have in the past not reduced the original safe interior design. However, there are now signs that this situation may be changing. With the easy availability {{of a wide range of}} low cost inflammable sheet materials on the market, some owners may unknowingly use these materials in a way that increases the fire risk for occupants in the building. In other situations an owner may undertake minor alterations in a performance-based designed building. If these minor changes inadvertently alter any part of the <b>Alternative</b> Solution <b>approval</b> provisions then the building approval will be automatically cancelled and the building will be illegally occupied. It could be argued that there is some responsibility on interior designers to ensure that the owners are made aware of the limitation imposed by the <b>Alternative</b> Solution <b>approval</b> and the dangers of minor alterations using inappropriate materials. This situation is further complicated by the development in Queensland with the new legislated safe design obligations for designers...|$|R

40|$|The global rise of multi-drug {{resistant}} bacteria {{has resulted}} in the notion that an antibiotic apocalypse is fast approaching. This has led to a number of well publicized calls for global funding initiatives to develop new antibacterial agents. The long clinical history of phage therapy in Eastern Europe, combined with more recent in vitro and in vivo success, demonstrates the potential for whole phage or phage based antibacterial agents. To date, no whole phage or phage derived products are approved for human therapeutic use in the EU or USA. There are at least three reasons for this: (i) phages possess different biological, physical and pharmacological properties compared to conventional antibiotics. Phages need to replicate in order to achieve a viable antibacterial effect, resulting in complex pharmacodynamics / pharmacokinetics. (ii) The specificity of individual phages requires multiple phages to treat single species infections, often as part of complex cocktails. (iii) The current approval process for antibacterial agents has evolved with the development of chemically based drugs at its core, and is not suitable for phages. Due to similarities with conventional antibiotics, phage derived products such as endolysins are suitable for approval under current processes as biological therapeutic proteins. These criteria render the approval of phages for clinical use theoretically possible but not economically viable. In this review, pitfalls of the current approval process will be discussed for whole phage and phage derived products, in addition to the utilization of <b>alternative</b> <b>approval</b> pathways including adaptive licensing and Right to try legislation...|$|E

50|$|For the Bolsover Street site, John Hitch {{obtained}} through chief engineer Mr Kindler site survey information including flood level projections {{used for the}} construction of the nearby Fitzroy River Bridge. Hitch designed three schemes for submission to the Queensland Cabinet, the first being a ten storey tower fronting Fitzroy Street, the second being two four to five storey blocks facing East and Bolsover Streets, and the third being a three storey U-shaped development fronting the three streets. The first and third schemes emphasised the Queensland Government presence on the approach to the new Fitzroy River Bridge. Cabinet opted for the larger site coverage of the third smaller scaled <b>alternative,</b> and <b>approval</b> was given to proceed with one wing to the Bolsover Street frontage. A model of the U-shaped development was constructed, which John Hitch believes was the first architectural model in Queensland.|$|R
5000|$|In Europe, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) {{has adopted}} the ISO {{standards}} on welding procedure qualification (ISO 15607 to ISO 15614), which replaced the former European standard EN 288. EN ISO 15607 defines a WPS as [...] "A document {{that has been}} qualified {{by one of the}} methods described in clause 6 and provides the required variables of the welding procedure to ensure repeatability during production welding". The same standard defines a Welding Procedure Qualification Record (WPQR) as [...] "Record comprising all necessary data needed for qualification of a preliminary welding procedure specification". In addition to the standard WPS qualification procedure specified in ISO 15614, the ISO 156xx series of standards provides also for <b>alternative</b> WPS <b>approval</b> methods. These include: Tested welding consumables (ISO 15610), Previous welding experience (ISO 15611), Standard welding procedure (ISO 15612) and Preproduction welding test (ISO 15613).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} of the processes of decision making by voters under the approval voting rule (in two variants: classical and categorization) and majority rule. Under the majority rule, each voter chooses a single <b>alternative.</b> Under <b>approval</b> voting, they can vote for as many alternatives as they wish. Under the categorization method, they divide alternatives into three groups: approvable, not approvable and neutral. We conducted a process tracing experiment with respondents choosing an office manager from 13 candidates characterized by 14 attributes. The process of collecting information on candidates from the data presented on the screen was observed by a coordinator. For this experiment, the concept of cognitive effort {{was defined as the}} quantity of information gathered. The cognitive effort made under the three methods was compared. The highest cognitive effort was observed {{in the case of the}} categorization method and the lowest in the case of approval voting. (original abstract...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies project {{management}} issues which are applicable to organizations which partake in complex engineered-to-order projects. Traditional approaches to management methods {{for planning and}} control of projects are examined, and potential problem areas are identified. An <b>alternative</b> approach, continuous <b>approval</b> methods, is developed. The potential for improved productivity is demonstrated. The acquisition of defence systems in the Department of National Defence (DND) is used to provide examples of complex engineered-to-order projects. The DND study showed how continuous approval methods improved DND's existing engineered-to-order processes with a reduction in both delivery time and cost. Although the study focused on one organization, the results are applicable to the management of any engineered-to-order project which undergoes traditional report-review-approve cycles...|$|R
40|$|Geometric {{representations}} of 3 -candidate profiles {{are used to}} investigate properties of preferential election methods. The representation visualizes both the possibility to win by agenda manipulation, i. e. introducing a third and chanceless candidate in a 2 -candidate race, and the possibility to win a 3 -candidate election through different kinds of strategic voting. Here {{the focus is on}} the "burying" strategy in single-winner elections, where the win is obtained by ranking a main competitor artificially low. Condorcet methods are compared with the major <b>alternatives</b> (Borda Count, <b>Approval</b> Voting, Instant Runoff Voting). Various Condorcet methods are studied, and one method is proposed that minimizes the number of noncyclic profiles where burying is possible.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of citizens’ preferences for different electoral systems. We use data collected through a large internet-based quasi-experiment carried out during the 2012 French presidential election where we invited subjects {{to cast a vote}} for real candidates according to four voting rules: two-round (the official system), one-round, the <b>alternative</b> vote, and <b>approval</b> voting. After voting with each of the four voting rules, subjects were also asked to report which system they liked the most. We find that voters prefer systems that are beneficial to the candidate they prefer, that their preference for the official two-round system (weakly) depends on how they actually vote under this system, and that right-wing voters are more supportive of voting rules under which one can vote for only one candidate (one-round and two-round) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} two {{series of}} experiments demonstrating the cognitive properties of approval voting. The former series is devoted to mental processes induced in decision makers who use the method of approval voting. Based on cognitive effort, the use of choice strategies is presented in this paper. The observations of respondents show {{that most of them}} use relatively effortless strategy of eliminating alternatives and attributes. Few respondents use more sophisticated methods. The other {{series of experiments}} analyses the number of <b>alternatives</b> chosen in <b>approval</b> voting. It appears that the average number is not constant, even for similar votes but it depends on the subject of voting. The number of chosen alternatives and the subjective significance of the scope of voting are negatively or positively correlated in the case of special votes. The analyzed experiments show that the cognitive properties of approval voting have a diverse structure. (original abstract...|$|R

40|$|This {{session on}} {{alternative}} fuels and vehicles, including technical but also non-technical {{aspects of their}} promotion (local initiative, public awareness) offered an instructive and broad picture, regarding the possibilities of more sustainable alternative fuels/powertain introduction. The sub-session dedicated to hydrogen demonstrated and recorded how the commission already committed themselves for research programmes funding, but also how strong are the barriers to overpass, before large hydrogen public applications in transport. Regarding alternative fuels, the most discussed pathways have been presented: methane and bio-methane, synthetic fuels from biomass (BTL), from natural gas (GTL) or coal (CTL), biodiesels, bio-ethanols. All these fuels have been assessed on their current availability and potential for future developments, also on a well-to-wheels basis, including detailed accounting of the GHG emitted during the fuels manufacturing, and not only during the final use in the vehicle. Connected to this last point, an important challenge emerged during all the sessions: the problematic of alternative fuels certification.

40|$|This {{document}} {{outlines the}} standards required for surveying fauna species listed under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 (FFG Act). These standards detail acceptable survey methods and the minimum survey effort {{to determine the}} likelihood of the species’ presence or absence at a site. They also detail appropriate record keeping and reporting standards. There are two main purposes of these standards. 1. To document the information required to determine if a record is valid – i. e. determining presence only. The standards provide the information that is required to enable an assessment to be made as to whether a record can be accepted as a valid record. All records, irrespective of how they are obtained, need to adhere to these standards. 2. To document the information required for surveys that aim to determine both presence and absence – i. e. outlining the acceptable level of survey effort required to provisionally infer absence if a species is not detected during a survey. These minimum standards are required to be met by any organisation/group undertaking a presence/absence survey. They will also be useful for an organisation/group wanting to say that an area is unlikely to provide core habitat for a wide-ranging species. Executing and reporting a survey to these standards will support the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) to make an assessment of the validity of a claim to species presence or absence at a site. Subject to DSE <b>approval,</b> <b>alternative</b> survey methods may be applied where the proponent provides an evidence-based rationale for the approach and {{a detailed description of the}} survey technique(s) and where the standards are considered to exceed those set out below. These standards should be read in conjunction with threatened species Action Statements. In the context of timber harvesting operations they should be read in conjunction with the Code of Practice for Timber Harvesting and Forest Management Plans. As further information about the species and survey techniques becomes available, these standards will be reviewed and updated. ...|$|R
