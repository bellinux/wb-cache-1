5|$|Banksia brownii, {{commonly}} known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a species of shrub that grows in southwest Western Australia. An attractive plant with fine feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> bush around two metres (7ft) high, but can also occur as a small tree or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms.|$|E
5|$|Banksia telmatiaea, {{commonly}} known as swamp fox banksia or rarely marsh banksia, is a shrub that grows in marshes and swamps along the lower west coast of Australia. It grows as <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> bush up to 2m (7ft) tall, with narrow leaves and a pale brown flower spike, which can produce profuse quantities of nectar. First collected in the 1840s, it was not published as a separate species until 1981; as with several other similar species it was previously included in B.sphaerocarpa (Fox Banksia).|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} from China to Britain {{for the first}} time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white with orange legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> stance while on land. Although not thought {{to have such a}} delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, and was roughly the same size as an Aylesbury at nine weeks.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, the American {{explorer}} Roy Chapman Andrews led a {{well documented}} expedition to China and Mongolia {{sponsored by the}} American Museum of Natural History. Various indricothere remains were found in formations of the Mongolian Gobi Desert, including the legs of a specimen standing in <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> position, indicating that it had died while trapped in quicksand, {{as well as a}} very complete skull. These remains became the basis of Baluchitherium grangeri, named by Osborn in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The hominid Australopithecus afarensis {{represents}} an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors. A number of traits of the A. afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism, {{to the extent}} that some researchers have suggested that bipedality evolved long before A. afarensis. In overall anatomy, the pelvis is far more human-like than ape-like. The iliac blades are short and wide, the sacrum is wide and positioned directly behind the hip joint, and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for the knee extensors, implying <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> posture.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> bush {{between one}} and three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can also}} grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that they}} are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E

5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were {{much smaller than the}} hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E
5|$|Engineers Stimers and Newton {{soon began}} {{repairing}} {{the damage to}} the pilot house and reconfigured the sides from <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> position to a slope of thirty degrees to deflect shot. During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband's progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return but he would be laid up for some time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude. However Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months. He returned to Naval service in 1862 as Commander of , another ironclad.|$|E
5|$|Firehawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. There are six cars with four seats in each row {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. There were three trains during the ride's first year at Geauga Lake, however only two have been used since. The third train became a parts donor for the first two. Originally, riders reclined on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> position prior to re-entering the station. However, this was changed to occur in the station due to problems that arose during the ride's first season. The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored yellow and red. Previously at Geauga Lake, the X-Flight logo was colored lime green and dark blue.|$|E

5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Gaara's initial attire, {{along with}} the costumes of his siblings, was {{difficult}} for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave {{the three of them}} simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with <b>an</b> <b>upright</b> collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there was a scene where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara's body. This shot was inspired by Akira, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of.|$|E
5|$|Isopogon anethifolius, {{commonly}} known as narrowleaf- or narrow-leafed drumsticks, is a shrub in the family Proteaceae. The species is found only in coastal areas near Sydney, Australia, and to the immediate west. It occurs naturally in woodland, open forest and heathland on sandstone soils. <b>An</b> <b>upright</b> shrub, it can reach to 3m (10ft) in height, with terete leaves that are divided and narrow. The yellow flowers appear from September to December and are prominently displayed. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name of drumsticks. The small hairy seeds {{are found in the}} old flower parts.|$|E
