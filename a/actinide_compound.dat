40|$|The {{sputtering}} of actinide {{targets in}} Ar atmosphere with a controlled partial pressure of reactive gas (e. g.

Pure UO 2 thin films have been deposited on piezoelectric quartz crystal electrodes and characterised by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The films were then examined by electrochemical techniques with a calibrated EQCM system. First cyclovoltammetric studies show the comparability of the thin film model systems with bulk UO 2 and {{the reliability of the}} EQCM method as tool for fuel corrosion studies. Thanks to the real-time mass and electrochemical information from the EQCM, the charge over mass ratios (Q/m) could be calculated from the electrochemical experiments. These ratios are then compared to theoretical values for certain corrosion reactions so the observed anodic and cathodic processes in the typical cyclovoltammograms of UO 2 electrodes can be assigned to these corrosion processes.

For URu 2 Zn 20, the low temperature susceptibility and magnetic specific heat coefficient gamma = Cmag/T take the values chi = 0. 011 emu/mole and gamma = 190 mJ/mole-K 2 at T = 2 K. These values are roughly three times smaller, and Emax is three times larger, than recently reported for the related compound UCo 2 Zn 20, so that chi and gamma scale inversely with the characteristic energy for spin fluctuations, Tsf = Emax/kB. While chi(T), Cmag(T), and Emax of the 4 f compound YbFe 2 Zn 20 are very well described by the Kondo impurity model, we show that the model works poorly for URu 2 Zn 20 and UCo 2 Zn 20, suggesting that the scaling behavior of the actinide compounds arises from spin fluctuations of itinerant 5 f electrons.

40|$|This work revisits {{the melting}} {{behaviour}} of neptunium dioxide, an <b>actinide</b> <b>compound</b> {{which can be}} produced in the nuclear fuel during operation, and which has an important impact on the nuclear fuel and waste radioactivity especially on the very long term. The present experimental approach employs remote laser heating under controlled atmosphere and fast pyrometry. This technique circumvents problems encountered by more traditional heating techniques, in particular, the reaction between sample and containment at temperatures beyond 2500 K. In addition, {{only a small amount}} of sample material is required, which is an advantage with respect to the radioactivity and limited availability of neptunium. The NpO 2 melting/freezing temperature has been measured to be 3070 K?±? 62 K, much higher than previous values (around 2830 K) obtained by more traditional thermal analysis methods. The large amount of experimental data collected allowed a consistent statistical analysis. It seems likely, although not fully evident from the present results, that the high oxygen potential at temperatures around melting leads to a slightly hypo-stoichiometric congruent melting composition, as already observed in other actinide (ThO 2, PuO 2) and lanthanide oxides (e. g., CeO 2). Finally, a recently developed phase-field model was used for the simulation of the observed thermograms, allowing a deeper insight in material properties that are difficult to directly measure. For example, a polaron contribution to the high-temperature thermal conductivity, well accepted for the commonly studied actinide oxide UO 2, is shown here to likely be present in NpO 2.

[1] For heavy ion studies often Be is required as backing material. The deposition of lanthanide and actinide elements can be performed from an organic solution (usually isopropanol) with current densities {{of only a few}} mA/cm 2 and voltages up to 1200 V. The lanthanide or the <b>actinide</b> <b>compound,</b> normally the nitrate, is dissolved in a small volume (5 - 20 µl) of 0. 1 N nitric acid and then mixed with 7 ml of the organic solvent. With this „Molecular Plating (MP) “ technique target densities in the order of 1 mg/cm 2 are possible. In order to prevent excessive heating of a stationary target at high beam currents as delivered from heavy-ion accelerators, a rotating wheel system with a multi-target device has been developed at GSI. Here, the rotation speed of the wheel is adapted to the pulse structure of the ion beam. The wheel rotates with a frequency of 2000 rpm in order to distribute each beam pulse evenly over one target segment. A multi-target device consists of three banana-shaped segments. One segment is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The target area is 1. 9 cm 2 per segment and the banana-shaped backing is mounted on a Al-frame prior to deposition. Al-frame Target area FIGURE 1.

Photoemission spectroscopy provides information on the occupied part of the electronic density of states and has been used to investigate the momentum-resolved electronic structure and the topology of the Fermi surface in a variety of <b>actinide</b> <b>compounds.</b> Furthermore, x-ray absorption and electron energy-loss spectroscopy have been used to probe the relativistic nature, occupation number, and degree of localization of 5 f electrons across the actinide series.

Their properties, particularly relevant for uranium and plutonium compounds, combine strong electron correlation and relativistic effects. Only {{the combination of}} these two effects gives a proper description of magnetic structures in <b>actinide</b> <b>compounds.</b> Therefore, we have performed a detailed analysis of the magnetic structures and properties of UO 2, PuO 2 and UN on the basis of density functional theory with Hubbard electron correlation correction (DFT+U) as well as using hybrid functionals. Two plane wave DFT computer codes were employed, namely the pseudopotential code VASP [1] and the all-electron code Wien- 2 k [2]. The so-called DFT+U method incorporated in VASP [3] and the hybrid functionals in Wien- 2 k [4] are critically compared, in order to discuss the role of electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling effects. In particular, we compare the 1 -k and 3 -k magnetic structures for oxide compounds and underline how the strong correlations affect the magnetic behavior of UN predicted from DFT computations. In the frame of this analysis, we have applied different lattice distortions for all the three compounds and identified those giving the correct (experimental) description of the magnetic structures.
