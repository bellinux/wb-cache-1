40|$|The {{fosfomycin}} resistance protein FomA inactivates fosfomycin by phosphorylation of the phosphonate {{group of}} the antibiotic {{in the presence of}} ATP and Mg(II). We report the crystal structure of FomA from the fosfomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces wedmorensis in complex with diphosphate and in ternary complex with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-(β,γ-imido) <b>-triphosphate</b> (AMPPNP), Mg(II), and fosfomycin, at 1. 53 and 2. 2 Å resolution, respectively. The polypeptide exhibits an open αβα sandwich fold characteristic for the amino acid kinase family of enzymes. The diphosphate complex shows significant disorder in loops surrounding the active site. As a result, the nucleotide-binding site is wide open. Binding of the substrates is followed by the partial closure of the active site and ordering of the α 2 -helix. Structural comparison with N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase shows several similarities in the site of phosphoryl transfer: 1) preservation of architecture of the catalytical amino acids of N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase (Lys 9, Lys 216, and Asp 150 in FomA); 2) good superposition of the phosphate acceptor groups of the substrates, and 3) good superposition of the diphosphate molecule with the β- and γ-phosphates of AMPPNP, suggesting that the reaction could proceed by an associative in-line mechanism. However, differences in conformations of the triphosphate moiety of AMPPNP molecules, the long distance (5. 1 Å) between the phosphate acceptor and donor groups in FomA, and involvement of Lys 18 instead of Lys 9 in binding with the γ-phosphate may indicate a different reaction mechanism.

Calcium-dependent Cl− currents (IClCa) were evoked by pipette solutions containing concentrations between 20 and 1000 nM Ca 2 + and the calcium and voltage dependence was determined. Under control conditions with pipette solutions containing ATP and 500 nM Ca 2 +, IClCa was evoked immediately upon membrane rupture but then exhibited marked rundown to ∼ 20 % of initial values. In contrast, when phosphorylation was prohibited by using pipette solutions containing <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ′-(β,γ-imido) <b>-triphosphate</b> (AMP-PNP) or with ATP omitted, the rundown was severely impaired, and after 20 min dialysis, IClCa was ∼ 100 % of initial levels. IClCa recorded with AMP-PNP–containing pipette solutions were significantly larger than control currents and had faster kinetics at positive potentials and slower deactivation kinetics at negative potentials. The marked increase in IClCa was due to a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation and not due to an increase in the apparent binding affinity for Ca 2 +. Mathematical simulations were carried out based on gating schemes involving voltage-independent binding of three Ca 2 +, each binding step resulting in channel opening at fixed calcium but progressively greater “on” rates, and voltage-dependent closing steps (“off” rates). Our model reproduced well the Ca 2 + and voltage dependence of IClCa as well as its kinetic properties. The impact of global phosphorylation could be well mimicked by alterations in the magnitude, voltage dependence, and state of the gating variable of the channel closure rates. These data reveal that the phosphorylation status of the Ca 2 +-activated Cl− channel complex influences current generation dramatically through one or more critical voltage-dependent steps...|$|R

Mn(II) and nucleotides were added to MF 1 (0, 0) either subsequently or together as preformed complexes. Metal-ADP inhibition kinetics analysis was performed showing that in all samples Mn(II) enters one catalytic site on a beta subunit. From the HF-EPR spectra, the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters of the various samples were obtained, showing that different metal-protein coordination symmetry is induced depending on the metal nucleotide addition order and the protein/metal/nucleotide molar ratios. The electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) technique was used to obtain information on the interaction between Mn(II) and the (31) P nuclei of the metal-coordinated nucleotide. In the case of samples containing ADP, the measured (31) P hyperfine couplings clearly indicated coordination changes related to the metal nucleotide addition order and the protein/metal/nucleotide ratios. On the contrary, the samples with AMPPNP showed very similar ESEEM patterns, despite the remarkable differences present among their HF-EPR spectra.

The kinetic data showed that the divalent metal always induces in the catalytic site the high-affinity conformation, while EPR experiments in frozen solutions supported the occurrence of different precatalytic states when the metal and ADP are added to the protein sequentially or together as a preformed complex. The different states evolve to the same conformation, the metal(II) -ADP inhibited form, upon induction of the trisite catalytic activity.

Highly enriched astroglial cultures and co-cultures of astrocytes and microglia were used to investigate the influence of microglia in the modulation of astroglial proliferation mediated by nucleotides. In highly enriched astroglial cultures, adenosine- <b>5</b> ’-triphosphate (ATP), <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ’-O-(3 -thio) <b>-triphosphate</b> (ATPγS), <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> ’-O-(3 -thio) -diphosphate (ADPβS; 0. 01 – 1  mM), and adenosine- 5 ’-diphosphate (ADP; 0. 1 – 1  mM) increased proliferation up to 382 %, an effect abolished in co-cultures containing 8 % of microglia. The loss of ATP proliferative effect in co-cultures is supported by its fast metabolism and reduced ADP accumulation, an agonist of P 2 Y 1, 12 receptors that mediate astroglial proliferation. No differences in ADPβS and ATPγS metabolism or P 2 Y 1, 12 receptors expression were found in co-cultures that could explain the loss of their proliferative effect. However, conditioned medium from microglia cultures or co-cultures treated with ADPβS, when tested in highly enriched astroglial cultures, also prevented ADPβS proliferative effect. None of the uracil nucleotides tested had any effect in proliferation of highly enriched astroglial cultures, but uridine- 5 ′-triphosphate (UTP; 0. 1 – 1  mM) inhibited proliferation up to 66 % in co-cultures, an effect that was dependent on uridine- 5 ’-diphosphate (UDP) accumulation, coincident with a co-localization of P 2 Y 6 receptors in microglia and due to cell apoptosis. The results indicate that microglia control astroglial proliferation by preventing the proliferative response to adenine nucleotides and favouring an inhibitory effect of UTP/UDP. Several microglial P 2 Y receptors may be involved by inducing the release of messengers that restrain astrogliosis, a beneficial effect for neuronal repair mechanisms following brain injury...|$|R

Such work has led to surprising new cellular roles for the P 2 X receptor family and an unusual phylogeny, with organisms such as Drosophila and C. elegans notably lacking P 2 X receptors despite retaining ionotropic receptors for other common transmitters that are present in mammals. This review will summarise current work on the evolutionary biology of P 2 X receptors and ATP as a signalling molecule, discuss what can be drawn from such studies when considering the action of ATP in higher animals and plants, and outline how simple organisms may be exploited experimentally to inform P 2 X receptor function in a wider context...|$|E
40|$|Background—The {{hypothesis}} that the failing heart may be energy-starved is {{supported in part by}} observations of reduced rates of <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-triphosphate</b> (ATP) synthesis through the creatine kinase (CK) reaction, the primary myocardial energy reservoir, in patients with heart failure (HF). Although murine models have been used to probe HF pathophysiology, it has not been possible to noninvasively measure the rate of ATP synthesis through CK in the in vivo mouse heart. The purpose of this work was to exploit noninvasive spatially localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques to measure ATP flux through CK in in vivo mouse hearts and determine the extent of any reductions in murine HF. Methods and Results—The Triple Repetition Time Saturation Transfer (TRiST) magnetic resonance spectroscopy method of measuring ATP kinetics was first validated in skeletal muscle, rendering similar results to conventional saturation transfer magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In normal mouse hearts, the in vivo CK pseudo–first-order-rate constant, kF, was 0. 320. 03 s 1 (meanSD) and the rate of ATP synthesis through CK was 3. 160. 47 mol/g/s. Thoracic aortic constriction reduced kF by 31 % (0. 230. 03 s 1, P 0. 0001) and ATP synthesis through CK by 51 % (1. 540. 25 mol/g/s, P 0. 0001), values analogous to those in failing human hearts. Conclusions—Despite the small size and high murine heart rate, the ATP synthesis rate through CK is similar in vivo in murine and human hearts and comparably reduced in HF. Because murine thoracic aortic constriction shares fundamental energetic similarities with human HF, this model and new magnetic resonance spectroscopy approac...|$|E

40|$|Enzymes of glucose {{metabolism}} were assayed in crude cell extracts of Frankia strains HFPArI 3 and HFPCcI 2 {{as well as}} in isolated vesicle clusters from Alnus rubra root nodules. Activities of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway enzymes glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase were found in Frankia strain HFPArI 3 and glucokinase and pyruvate kinase were found in Frankia strain HFPCcI 2 and in the vesicle clusters. An NADP+-linked glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and an NAD-linked 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were found in all of the extracts, although the role of these enzymes is unclear. No NADP+-linked 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was found. Both dehydrogenases were inhibited by <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-triphosphate,</b> and the apparent Km's for glucose 6 -phosphate and 6 -phosphogluconate were 6. 86 X 10 (- 4) and 7. 0 X 10 (- 5) M, respectively. In addition to the enzymes mentioned above, an NADP+-linked malic enzyme was detected in the pure cultures but not in the vesicle clusters. In contrast, however, the vesicle clusters had activity of an NAD-linked malic enzyme. The possibility that this enzyme resulted from contamination from plant mitochondria trapped in the vesicle clusters could not be discounted. None of the extracts showed activities of the Entner-Doudoroff enzymes or the gluconate metabolism enzymes gluconate dehydrogenase or gluconokinase. Propionate- versus trehalose-grown cultures of strain HFPArI 3 showed similar activities of most enzymes except malic enzyme, which was higher in the cultures grown on the organic acid. Nitrogen-fixing cultures of strain HFPArI 3 showed higher specific activities of glucose 6 -phosphate and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenases and phosphofructokinase than ammonia-grown cultures...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-triphosphate</b> (ATP) and its {{breakdown}} products ADP and adenosine {{can act as}} extracellular messengers {{in a range of}} biological processes. Extracellular adenine nucleotides are metabolized by a number of enzymes including NTPDases and 5 ’-nucleotidase, which are considered to be the major regulators of purinergic signaling in the blood. Previous work by our group demonstrated that ATPase and ADPase activities in rat serum exhibit a 24 -h temporal pattern, with higher enzyme activity during the dark (activity) phase. It was found that stress can cause disruptions in biological circadian rhythms and in the cardiovascular system. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the influence of acute stress exposure upon temporal patterns of NTPDase and 5 -nucleotidase enzyme activities in rat blood serum. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: ZT 0, ZT 6, ZT 12 and ZT 18. Each group was subdivided in 4 groups: control, immediately, 6 h and 24 h after one hour of restraint stress. ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis were assayed in the serum. Results: All stressed groups showed significant decreases in all enzyme activities at ZT 12 and ZT 18 when compared with control. Conclusion: Acute stress provokes a decrease in nucleotidase activities dependent on the time that this stress occurs and this effect appears to persist for at least 24 hours. Stress can change levels of nucleotides, related to increased frequency of cardiovascular events during the activity phase. Altered levels of nucleotides in serum may be involved in cardiovascular events more frequent during the activity phase in mammals, and with their etiology linked to stress...|$|E
40|$|Background. Small-for-size liver grafts have {{decreased}} survival compared to full-size grafts. This study investigated mechanisms of suppression of liver regeneration in small-for-size grafts. Methods. Rat liver explants were reduced {{in size to}} 50 % and implanted into recipients of different body weights, resulting in graft weight/standard liver weights of 50 % (half-size) and 25 % (quarter-size). Results. Hepatic cellular 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation increased from 0. 2 %after shamoperation to 2 %, 18 %, and 1. 2 % in full-size, half-size, and quarter-size grafts, respectively. Graft weight did not increase in full- and quarter-size grafts but increased 40 % in half-size grafts. By contrast, apoptosis remained low (0. 7 %) and stem cells did not increase in all conditions. Phospho-c-Jun increased 27 -fold in half-size grafts but only sevenfold in quarter-size grafts. Activating protein- 1 activation increased 14 -fold in half-size grafts but only fivefold in quarter-size grafts. Cyclin D 1 (CyD 1), which was barely detectable in full- and quarter-size grafts, increased 8. 3 -fold in half-size grafts. <b>Adenosine</b> <b>5</b> <b>-triphosphate</b> (ATP) per gram tissue decreased 70 % in quarter-size grafts. Treatment of quarter-size grafts with radical scavenging C. sinenesis polyphenols (20 g/ml) increased BrdU labeling and weight gain to 35 % and 56 %, respectively, reversed inhibition of CyD 1 expression, c-Jun phosphorylation, and AP- 1 activation in quarter-size grafts compared to half-size grafts, and restored ATP levels to 75 %. Conclusions. Liver regeneration is stimulated in half-size grafts but suppressed in quarter-size grafts. Defective liver regeneration in small grafts is associated with an inhibition of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun and CyD 1 pathways and compromised energy production...|$|E

40|$|Nucleoside <b>5</b> <b>-triphosphates</b> are the {{building}} blocks to synthesis of nucleic acids. Nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) participate in many important biological functions in living systems, including genetic information storage, gene expression, and catalysis. Nucleoside 5 - triphosphates have many important therapeutic and diagnostic applications. To understand how these triphosphates are utilized in living systems, numerous synthetic mimics have been prepared and used as active metabolites of certain drugs and molecular probes. Over the years, nucleic acids have been modified at the nucleobase, sugar moiety and phosphate backbone {{with the aim of}} understanding their structures and functions. We have site-specifically replaced selected oxygen atoms of nucleosides and nucleotides with selenium atom in order to enzymatically synthesize selenium-derivatized DNAs for obtaining insights into the DNA flexibility, duplex recognition and stability. Although triphosphates have important biological and medicinal significance, they are however, very difficult to synthesize and isolate in high purity and yield. There are many approaches to the synthesis of nucleoside <b>5</b> <b>-triphosphates,</b> but there is no general strategy that allows simple and direct synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates. To face the challenges, we have developed a new approach in the absence of protecting groups to quickly and efficiently synthesized native deoxynucleoside <b>5</b> <b>-triphosphates</b> and deoxynucleoside <b>5</b> -(Î±- P-seleno) - P-seleno) triphosphates. Syntheses of the triphosphates containing selenium-derivatized nucleobases were also successfully accomplished. After replacing the oxygen atoms at the 4 -position of thymidine and uridine, and the 6 -position of guanosine, we observed most strikingly, a large bathrochromic shift of over 100 nm, relative to their native counterparts of UV absorbance of 260 nm. Consequently, the synthesized selenium base modified triphosphates are yellow. We also synthesized 2 -selenothymidine and 5 -methylseleno thymidine <b>5</b> <b>-triphosphates.</b> We conducted stability study on the colored 4 -selenothymidine and used the 5 - triphosphate analog (4 -SeTTP) as substrate for polymerase recognition. The Klenow polymerase incorporated the 4 -SeTTP with efficiency equal to that of the native counterpart. Finally, 4 -SeTTP was used to demonstrate UVdamage resistance of selenium-derivatized DNAs and plasmid...|$|R

Methods A microdialysis probe was transversally implanted in the dorsal half of spinal cord L 6 -S 1 segment in female rats. Microdialysate was collected at 15 minutes intervals during 135 minutes, in anesthetized animals. <b>Adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate concentrations were determined with a bioluminescent assay. In one group of animals (n= 7) microdialysate samples were obtained with an empty bladder during a 10 -minutes bladder distension to 20 or 40 cmH 2 O with either saline, saline with acetic acid or saline with capsaicin. In another group of animals (n= 6) bladder distention was performed and the microdialysis solution contained the ectonucleotidase inhibitor ARL 67156. Results Basal extracellular adenosine triphosphate levels were 110. 9 ± 35. 34 fmol/ 15 minutes, (mean±SEM, n= 13), and bladder distention {{was associated with a}} significant increase in <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate levels which was not observed after bladder distention with saline solution containing capsaicin (10 µM). Microdialysis with solution containing ARL 67156 (1 mM) was associated with significantly higher extracellular <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate levels and no further increase in <b>adenosine</b> <b>5</b> &# 8217;-triphosphate was observed during bladder distension.
