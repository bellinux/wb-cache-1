He presided over an architectural jury which favored the project by Alexandre Marcel, despite accusations of plagiarism. In July 1894, alongside Manu, Sturdza, Triandafil, and Constantin C. Arion, he founded the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Bank.</b> His business activities were focused on Buftea, where he inaugurated a canning plant, twenty orchards, one hundred gardens, and fifty vineyards. By 1898, his property there totaled 2350 hectares (5806 acres), {{more than half of}} Buftea's territory. He also spent summers in Dărmănești, where he was neighbors and friends with a fellow Conservative, Radu Rosetti. There, Știrbei and his younger son George set up a business in forestry and wood processing. He owned other estates in Teleorman County, including Elisabeta, which he leased out to A.

25|$|By 1923, {{the scheme}} had {{effectively}} collapsed {{with the company}} going into voluntary liquidation. About 30 families stayed on. In order to remain on their selections the Kendenup Settlers Association (Inc.) took up the fight. The government established a Royal Commission 'to inquire into and report upon {{the establishment of the}} settlement at Kendenup', headed by Commissioner William Grogan. Fraud by De Garis had been alleged prior to the Royal Commission but he was exonerated in the findings. A second Royal Commission headed by barrister Ross McDonald was held to look into the difficulties faced by the settlers and possible assistance which could be offered. Changes to the Act which governed the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Bank</b> of Western Australia were made as a result. McDonald later worked pro bono on the settlers' behalf to negotiate with creditors and the banks to enable them to purchase additional land and transfer the debentures to conventional mortgages.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} and reserves were controlled {{in the mid-1980s}} by the State Administration of Exchange Control under the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Foreign exchange allocations to banks, ministries, and enterprises were all approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control. The Bank of China, the foreign exchange arm of the People's Bank of China, lost its monopoly on all foreign exchange transactions in 1984 when the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Bank,</b> People's Construction Bank, China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) were permitted to deal in foreign currency. The Bank of China remained China's principal foreign exchange bank and provided loans for production and commercial transactions related to exports, set up branches overseas, maintained correspondent relations with foreign banks, and did research on international monetary trends. The Bank of China also was active in international financial markets through such activities as loan syndication and issuing of foreign bonds. CITIC, formed in 1979 to facilitate foreign investment in China, also borrowed and lent internationally and issued foreign bonds in addition to encouraging and participating in joint ventures, importing foreign technology and equipment, and making overseas investments. In 1986 CITIC was renamed CITIC Group and shifted its emphasis to power, metallurgical, and raw materials industries, which had trouble attracting investments. In late 1986 the CITIC Group had set up 47 joint ventures, invested in 114 domestic companies, and issued US$550 million in foreign bonds. The China Investment Bank was established in 1981 as a channel for medium- and long-term loans from international financial {{institutions such as the}} World Bank.|$|E

[...] After often only one or two days of acclimatisation and processing on arrival, properties were allocated by ballot and the settlers transported to their selections. [...] After a period of establishment, the settlers were required to repay a 30-year loan (not exceeding £1,000) provided by the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Bank,</b> and at the completion of the loan repayment the settler would have freehold title to the property. [...] They were paid 10 shillings per day during the land clearing phase and offered a £10 loan for the purchase of household and agricultural equipment.

Under the Saigon administration, a rapid influx of Chinese expatriate entrepreneurs from Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan came to South Vietnam for business and investment activities. The Hoa compradore bourgeoisie in South Vietnam also had {{the economic and political}} backing of wealthy expatriate Chinese from Taiwan and Hong Kong and Overseas Chinese capitalists in the United States and other countries in Southeast Asia. As the Hoa entrepreneurs in South Vietnam became more financially prosperous, they often pooled large amounts of seed capital and started joint business ventures with expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese business moguls and investors from all over the world. In addition, prominent Hoa compradore bourgeoisie often colluding and mingling with Saigon government officials and the South Vietnamese army elite to attain even greater wealth. The most notorious of South Vietnam's Hoa compradore bourgeoisie was Ly Long Than, who reportedly held large assets in 18 major commercial and industrial manufacturing enterprises (Vinatexco and Vinafilco textile factories, Vinatefinco dye-works, Vicasa steel factory, Nakydaco edible oil factory, Rang Dong sea transport company, a real estate company, a plush hotel, an insurance provider, and many restaurants) and sixteen banks including the Bank of China, the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Bank,</b> and the Agriculture Industry Commerce Bank. Foreign investors and visitors doing business in Cholon would recall seeing the plethora of import-export shipping giants, banks, modern high-rise buildings, plush hotels and nightclubs, and restaurants all owned by Hoa businessmen. Other Hoa compradore bourgeoisie capitalists include Hoan Kim Quy, a native of Hanoi where he owned a prominent shipping firm and made his fortune from barbed wire manufacturing, the operation of a large textile and appliance import company and a gold mining and trading firm. He was the Director of the Vitako Company and was a major shareholder in several banks.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{performance}} of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>banking</b> industry using both traditional and risk-adjusted non-parametric efficiency measurement techniques. In addition to computing efficiency scores, the risk preference structure of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>banking</b> industry is examined. Design/methodology/approach – The paper used data envelopment analysis (DEA) to examine the efficiency of <b>agricultural</b> <b>banks</b> in the year 2001. Standard cost efficiency is computed and compared to both profit and risk-adjusted profit efficiency scores. The risk-adjustment is a modification of traditional DEA wherein firm preferences are represented via a mean-variance criterion. The risk-adjusted technique also provides estimates of firm level risk aversion. Findings – Results from the traditional approach that does not account for risk indicate a low degree of efficiency in the banking industry, while the risk-adjusted approach indicates banks are much more efficient. On average, 77 percent of the inefficiency identified by the standard DEA formulation is actually attributable to risk averse behavior by the firm. In addition, most banks appear to be substantially risk averse. Research limitations/implications – The risk-adjusted DEA technique used in this study should be applied to other, diverse data sets to examine its performance in a broader context. Practical implications – Results from this study support the idea that traditional DEA methods may mischaracterize the level of efficiency in the data if agents are risk averse. In addition, the paper outlines a practical method for deriving firm level risk aversion coefficients. Originality/value – This paper sheds light on the <b>agricultural</b> <b>banking</b> industry and illustrates the power of a new efficiency and risk analysis technique.
