We show that every field which <b>admits</b> a henselian valuation with non-divisible value group <b>admits</b> a parameter-definable (non-trivial) henselian valuation. In equicharacteristic $ 0 $, we give a complete characterization of henselian fields <b>admitting</b> a parameter-definable (non-trivial) henselian valuation. We also obtain partial characterization results of fields <b>admitting</b> 0 -definable (non-trivial) henselian valuations. We then draw some Galois-theoretic conclusions from our results.

5|$|After {{repairs to}} the college were {{completed}} in mid-1656, the first admissions were made. The first headmaster, Richard Dutton, was appointed in 1655, and in 1665 the institution became an incorporated charity. The number of pupils grew, with admissions rising to 100 by the 1870s. Boys were <b>admitted</b> based on the parish they lived in, and on need, health and background of the family. Illegitimate boys were not <b>admitted,</b> and all boys {{had to be able}} to read to a certain standard that meant they were not hard to teach. In 1878, a new schoolroom designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse (who designed Manchester Town Hall) was built in a Tudor style. The number of boys <b>admitted</b> was reduced to 75 in 1908 to save money, though three years later admissions increased again to 99. In 1916, no boys were <b>admitted</b> due to lack of funding caused by World War I, and in 1918 the number was limited to 70. Successful public appeals resulted in the numbers rising to 97 in 1929. In 1926 a scheme was set up which allowed boys to apply for scholarships to join a grammar school, which meant that while they lived at Chetham's, they were educated elsewhere during the day. Further, they would stay at grammar school until at least the age of 16 and sometimes 18.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} Cheeger and Gromoll’s {{question of}} which vector bundles <b>admit</b> a complete metric of nonnegative curvature, and relates their {{question to the}} issue of which sphere bundles <b>admit</b> a metric of positive curvature. We show that any vector bundle which <b>admits</b> a metric of nonnegative curvature must <b>admit</b> a connection, a tensor, and a metric on the base space which together satisfy a certain differential inequality. On the other hand, a slight sharpening of this condition is sufficient for the associated sphere bundle to <b>admit</b> a metric of positive curvature. Our results sharpen and generalize Walschap and Strake’s conditions under which a vector bundle <b>admits</b> a connection metric of nonnegative curvature. 1...|$|R
