Arsenal issued £210million worth of 13.5-year bonds with a spread of 52 basis points over government bonds and £50million of 7.1-year bonds with a spread of 22 basis points over LIBOR. It {{was the first}} publicly marketed, <b>asset-backed</b> <b>bond</b> issue by a European football club. The effective interest rate on these bonds is 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club's annual debt service cost to approximately £20million a year. In September 2010, Arsenal announced that the Highbury Square development – {{one of the main}} sources of income to reduce the stadium debt – was now debt free and making revenue.|$|E
25|$|In Europe {{there exists}} a type of <b>asset-backed</b> <b>bond</b> called a covered bond, {{commonly}} known by the German term Pfandbriefe. Covered bonds were first created in 19th-century Germany when Frankfurter Hypo began issuing mortgage covered bonds. The market has been regulated since {{the creation of a}} law governing the securities in Germany in 1900. The key difference between covered bonds and mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is that banks that make loans and package them into covered bonds keep those loans on their books. This means that when a company with mortgage assets on its books issues the covered bond, its balance sheet grows, which would not occur if it issued an MBS, although it may still guarantee the securities payments.|$|E

5000|$|Partnoy then {{questioned}} the economic theory of SIVs: [...] "How is the SIV able to earn such an 'arbitrage' spread between its assets and liabilities? If the SIV {{is simply a}} vehicle for purchasing financial assets, {{it should not be}} able to fund purchases of those assets at a lower rate than the rate on those assets. If it could, market participants with low funding rates would simply purchase the financial assets directly, and capture the spread for themselves. Put more simply, if a vehicle purchases $100 million of <b>asset-backed</b> <b>bonds,</b> priced at par, with a coupon of seven percent, and it seeks to fund that purchase by borrowing $100 million, it should not be able to borrow at a rate lower than seven percent." [...] Portnoy's theory misses the simple fact that the SIVs raised capital from third party investors with which to enhance the liabilities so these were not simple pass-through structures.|$|R

5000|$|Sportswear {{provider}} Nike {{signed a}} contract extension with Arsenal in August 2003 to remain as the club's official kit supplier. This was presented {{as a solution to}} the stadium financing; in addition to paying £55 million over seven years, Nike paid a minimum of £1 million each year as a royalty fee, dependent on sales. On 23 February 2004, Arsenal Holdings plc - the club's parent company - announced that funding for the stadium was now secured with construction work being able to resume. Wenger said of the announcement: [...] "It has been a big target of mine to participate in pushing the club forward and relocating to a new stadium is a necessity as it will enable us to become of one the biggest clubs in the world." [...] Interest on the £260 million debt was set at a commercial fixed rate over a 14-year period. To refinance the cost, the club planned to convert the money into a 30-year bond financed by banks. The proposed bond issue went ahead on 13 July 2006.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the evolution of}} three types of corporate securities in Argentina, namely, corporate <b>bonds,</b> <b>asset-backed</b> securities and deferred checks. Corporate bonds (obligaciones negociables) were legally authorized in 1988, and after a tax reform in 1991 they became an important financing vehicle. Asset backed securities (fideicomisos), legally created in 1995, have been issued since 1996. They typically bundle together small credits of a similar category. Deferred checks (cheques de pago diferido) exist since 1993, alongside standard checks. They can be negotiated on the exchange since 2003, and are akin to commercial paper. Corporate bonds have been overwhelmingly issued by large firms and banks, with an average issue size of 53 million dollars. Asset backed securities have an average value of 9 million dollars. Deferred checks are typically used by smaller firms, and those traded on the exchange of the Buenos Aires board of trade have an average value of 9 thousand dollars. private securities, corporate <b>bonds,</b> <b>asset-backed</b> securities, deferred checks...|$|R
40|$|Mortgage {{securitization}} {{has been}} tried {{several times in the}} United States and each time it has failed amid a credit bust. In what is now a familiar recurring history, during the credit boom, underwriting standards are violated and guarantees are inadequately funded; subsequently, defaults increase and investors in mortgage-backed securities attempt to dump their investments.; We focus on a specific market failure associated with asset-backed securitization and propose a tailored government remedy. Our analysis of loan market equilibriums shows that the additional liquidity provided by securitization may (or may not) lower primary loan rates, but such liquidity comes at a cost. More specifically, if guarantee-sensitive investors doubt the credit quality of <b>asset-backed</b> <b>bonds,</b> significant risk premiums can develop. If a financial crisis ensues, securitization can disappear from the market entirely, leaving banks that originate just the highest quality loans as the only source of credit. This abrupt increase in lending standards can tighten credit, exacerbate asset price declines, and impinge on economic growth.; We argue that an institutional structure for stemming "runs," analogous to the current set up for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, could be deployed to insure pre-specified asset-backed instruments. Such an insurer would likely benefit from the accumulated information and infrastructure that is embodied in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Hence, the provision of federally-backed catastrophic insurance could provide a rationale for restructuring the housing-related GSEs towards a public purpose. Regardless of its institutional structure, a federally-backed catastrophic bond insurer would provide greater financial stability and ensure credit is provided at reasonable cost both in times of prosperity and during downturns. Moreover, the explicit pricing of the government-backed guarantee would mitigate the market distortions that have been created by implicit government guarantees during prosperity.

50|$|Quantitative easing (QE) {{involves}} {{the creation of}} a significant amount of new base money by a central bank by the buying of assets that it usually does not buy. Usually, a central bank will conduct open market operations by buying short-term government bonds or foreign currency. However, during a financial crisis, the central bank may buy other types of financial assets as well. The central bank may buy long-term government <b>bonds,</b> company <b>bonds,</b> <b>asset-backed</b> securities, stocks, or even extend commercial loans. The intent is to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and promoting bank lending, even when interest rates cannot be pushed any lower.|$|R
40|$|While {{tuition and}} other education-related costs {{continue}} to rise, the federal loan limits have remained relatively stagnant. Private student loans {{have been the}} fastest growing segment of financial aid. The growth of private student loans depends on the capital markets, which include <b>asset-backed</b> securities and <b>bond</b> issues. But the subprime mortgage credit crisis occurred in August 2007 and continued disruptions in the capital markets resulted in higher funding costs for lenders who participate in the term securitization market. As {{a result of the}} confluence of legislative and capital market challenges, many players have exited or scaled back activities in the education finance industry. To make matters worse, student loans, especially private loan losses will increase in reaction to weaker economic conditions. If this happens, borrowers with high-risk characteristics such as low FICO scores don’t have a chance to borrow private loans. There is a possibility of depriving of the equality of opportunit...|$|R
40|$|Asset-backed {{securitization}} (ABS) is {{a creative}} arrangement {{to raise funds}} through the issuance of marketable securities backed by predictable future cash flows from revenue-producing assets. This paper proposes two pricing models: structural model and intensity model, to value credit spreads on Singapore ABS bonds. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the ABS credit spreads by varying {{the values of the}} key input variables within a plausible range. The property price volatility and its correlations with risk-less interest rates have been shown to have positive effects on the ABS credit spreads. However, when the market volatility is extremely high, the credit spreads decrease with an increase in the time to maturity. The positive effects of the property price volatility were significantly reduced when credit enhancements were added to the ABS bonds, and the credit risks associated with the correlation variable were fully eliminated in the credit enhanced ABS bonds. The rate of loss recovery in the event of default also has significant impact on the credit risks of the ABS bonds. ABS bonds backed by physical property will likely to have high recovery rates thus reducing the credit risks vis-à-vis non-collateralized <b>bonds.</b> <b>Asset-backed</b> securitization, credit risk, structural model, intensity model...|$|R

Under the chairmanship of Chinese Taipei ABAC member Dr. Jeffrey L. S.
