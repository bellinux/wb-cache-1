5|$|Leslie quickly seeks revenge against Lindsay {{by getting}} her parks {{employees}} to throw garbage over the Eagleton {{side of the}} fence. When Lindsay arrives to stop it, the two get into a fight amid the garbage bags. The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned the fence into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an empty room with steak, whiskey and his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him.

From January 2013 to December 2013, a total of 780 samples obtained from the public water supply systems at 35 measurement points distributed throughout the whole territory of the Republic of Macedonia were analyzed on the total <b>As</b> <b>content.</b> <b>A</b> flow injection atomic absorption spectrometry (FIAS) was employed for {{the determination of the}} total <b>As</b> <b>content</b> after wet digestion of the samples with nitric acid (67 %, W/V) and hydrogen peroxide (30 %, V/V). The results of the study revealed that in 96. 7 % of the tested samples, <b>As</b> <b>content</b> was below established maximum allowable concentration (MAC) of 10 µg/L. As concentrations up to 26. 4 µg/L were found in the samples {{of drinking water}} that comes from the water sources located in the vicinity of Kozhuf Mountain, which is due to the mineral composition of the mountain body rich with As containing minerals: lorandite, orpiment, realgar, arsenopyrite etc. Highe...|$|R

Selected students enrolled in Science and Discovery High School earn college credits while earning credits towards high school graduation. Students receive instruction from college professors on the school's campus. Students receive extra help through tutoring during and after school using computer assisted programs such as Achieve 3000 (reading) and Apangea for mathematics. In September 2011, students staged a walkout in protest over several grievances, including class size and unqualified teachers. According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education report, the school has 16 Non‐Highly Qualified Teachers and 6 with emergency certification. In Pennsylvania, a Highly Qualified teacher is one who: (1) holds full certification, (2) has at least a bachelor's degree, (3) has completed <b>a</b> <b>content</b> area major, (4) has passed <b>a</b> <b>content</b> area test, and (5) has completed teacher education coursework In 2009–10, enrollment was 176 pupils.
