5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were {{fears of a}} {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet capsized {{and sank}} {{in about two}} minutes. The ship was in poor {{condition}} at the time due to her age, which likely contributed to her rapid sinking, though there was some speculation that her <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> exploded. The destruction of the ship caught the Allies by surprise; her loss came {{during the height of}} the bombardment. Torpedo boats and other smaller vessels rushed to pick up survivors, but they rescued only a handful of men. From her complement of 710 men, some 660 were killed in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the {{two ships}} made a {{daylight}} dash up the English Channel from occupied France to Germany. After reaching Kiel in early February, the ship went into drydock. On {{the night of}} 26 February, the British launched an air attack on the ship; one bomb penetrated her armored deck and exploded in the forward <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine,</b> causing serious damage {{and a large number}} of casualties. The repairs necessitated by the damage were so time-consuming that it was determined to rebuild the ship to accommodate the 38cm guns as originally intended. The 28cm guns were removed and used as shore batteries. In 1943, Hitler ordered the cessation of conversion work, and on 27 March 1945, she was sunk as a blockship in Gotenhafen (Gdynia) in German-occupied Poland. She was eventually broken up for scrap in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Trooper Harper's {{official}} reports {{state that}} after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli {{to the back of}} the vehicle for Trooper Foerster—who had arrived on the scene—to examine his driver's license. The reports then state that after Acoli complied, and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the registration, Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red pocketbook, pulled out a nine-millimeter weapon and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|As Gotō's ships {{endeavored}} to escape, Scott's ships tightened their formation {{and then turned}} to pursue the retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from Kinugasa barely missed Boise. Boise and Salt Lake City turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving Kinugasas gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from Kinugasa exploded in Boises main <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men and threatened to blow the ship apart. Seawater rushed in through rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship's powder magazines. Boise immediately sheered out of the column and retreated from the action. Kinugasa and Salt Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed.|$|E
5|$|In September 1931, Japanese army units {{invaded the}} Chinese {{province}} of Manchuria, transforming {{it into the}} puppet state of Manchukuo. In December 1932, Hiei was reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy's training squadron. On 25 February, the League of Nations ruled that Japan had violated Chinese sovereignty and international law in her invasion of Manchuria. Refusing to accept the League's judgment, the Empire of Japan withdrew from the League the same day. This also signaled its exit from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which removed all restrictions on the Imperial Japanese Navy's construction of capital ships. From the end of May 1933 to 13 August, Hiei received upgrades that allowed her to perform regular duties for the Emperor, and she served as the Emperor's observation ship for the Imperial Naval Review three days later. From January to March 1934, her No. 4 turret and <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> were refitted. In November 1935, Hiei served as the Emperor's ship for his official visit to the Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, {{the turret}} {{layout of the}} Delawares was also retained, with its {{respective}} challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost turret, number 5, {{was placed on the}} main deck, facing rearward, the next turret, Number 4, was placed on the main deck facing forward, but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired straight forward or aft. The center turret, Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost turret, with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> for Number 3 turret to the engine room. These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.|$|E

It features Gothic Revival architecture with three large Tiffany windows, fort tunnels, and <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> cellars.|$|E
50|$|A British {{board of}} enquiry quickly {{investigated}} {{the cause of}} Hoods explosion and produced a report. After criticism that the initial enquiry did not record all the available evidence, a second board of enquiry more extensively investigated Hoods loss, and examined the vulnerabilities of other large British warships still in service {{in light of the}} probable causes of the explosion. It, like the first enquiry, concluded that a 15 in shell from Bismarck caused the explosion of Hoods aft <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazines.</b> This led to refitting some older British warships with increased protection for their <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazines</b> and some other related improvements.|$|R

25|$|Roberts legally bought four {{additional}} standard capacity 30-round ammunition {{magazines and}} the ammunition {{to fill them}} at three local stores, including a Walmart, The Gunbroker, and Wholesale Sports Outdoor Outfitters. When Roberts stole the unsecured AR-15 from a friend, it was loaded with a standard capacity 30-round <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine.</b> Between 8,000 and 10,000 people were inside the mall at the time. People who first saw him run into the mall believed the tactical clothing and hockey mask was a paintball outfit and that the rifle was a toy.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of November 4, Undine and the Confederate {{batteries}} were attacked by three Union gunboats from Johnsonville and the six Paducah gunboats. Undine was abandoned and set on fire, which caused her <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> to explode, ending Forrest's brief career as a naval commander. Despite this loss, the Confederate land artillery was completely effective in neutralizing {{the threat of the}} Federal fleets. Forrest's guns bombarded the Union supply depot and the 28 steamboats and barges positioned at the wharf. All three of the Union gunboats were disabled or destroyed. The Union garrison commander ordered that the supply vessels be burned to prevent their capture by the Confederates.|$|E
25|$|A Westland Lynx {{helicopter}} was sent after the hijackers in the motorboat heading towards the Mongolian ship. All {{four of the}} pirates from that confrontation were either killed or disappeared overboard. After the Mongolian vessel was able to proceed safely, {{the crew of the}} Choi Young recovered the remnants of the hijackers' motorboat. Three rusty AK-47 rifles and an <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> were retrieved, along with three small iron ladders for boarding and various tools, including a screwdriver, a spanner, and several fishing knives. As the pirates had only six AK-47 rifles in total and three of them had now been confiscated, they had lost half of their firearms and about a quarter of their personnel.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of November 3, 1864, Forrest's artillerist, Capt. John Morton, {{positioned}} his guns {{across the river from}} the Federal supply base at Johnsonville. On the morning of November 4, Undine and the Confederate batteries were attacked by three Union gunboats from Johnsonville under U.S. Navy Lt. Edward M. King and by the six Paducah gunboats under Lt. Cmdr. LeRoy Fitch. Capt. Frank M. Gracey (a former steamboat captain now serving as a Confederate cavalryman) abandoned Undine, setting her on fire, which caused her <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine</b> to explode, ending Forrest's brief career as a naval commander. Despite this loss, the Confederate land artillery was completely effective in neutralizing the threat of the Federal fleets. Fitch was reluctant to take his Paducah gunboats through the narrow channel between Reynoldsburg Island and the western bank, so limited himself to long-range fire. King withered under the Confederate fire, which hit one of his vessels 19 times, and returned to Johnsonville.|$|E
25|$|Although Sumter was a masonry fort, {{there were}} wooden {{buildings}} inside for barracks and officer quarters. The Confederates targeted these with Heated shot (cannonballs heated red hot in a furnace), starting fires {{that could prove}} more dangerous to the men than explosive artillery shells. At 7 p.m. on April 12, a rain shower extinguished the flames {{and at the same}} time the Union gunners stopped firing for the night. They slept fitfully, concerned about a potential infantry assault against the fort. During the darkness, the Confederates reduced their fire to four shots each hour. The following morning, the full bombardment resumed and the Confederates continued firing hot shot against the wooden buildings. By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire. The flames moved toward the main <b>ammunition</b> <b>magazine,</b> where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored. The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety, but two-thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed. He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea, but the tide kept floating them back together into groups, some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds. He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing, but the Confederates did the same, firing the hot shots almost exclusively. Many of the Confederate soldiers admired the courage and determination of the Yankees. When the fort had to pause its firing, the Confederates often cheered and applauded after the firing resumed and they shouted epithets at some of the nearby Union ships for failing to come to the fort's aid.|$|E
