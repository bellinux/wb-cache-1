5000|$|A set {{of cards}} could be rapidly sorted by drawing number or other punched data using a card sorter. Machines are now {{available}} that scan aperture cards and produce a digital version. [...] <b>Aperture</b> <b>card</b> plotters are machines that use a laser to create {{the image on the}} film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aperture</b> <b>card</b> mounted {{microfilm}} {{is roughly}} 3% {{of the size}} and space of conventional paper or vellum engineering drawings. Some military contracts around 1980 began to specify digital storage of engineering and maintenance data because the expenses were even lower than microfilm, but these programs are now finding it difficult to purchase new readers for the old formats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aperture</b> <b>cards</b> {{are used}} for {{engineering}} drawings from all engineering disciplines. The U.S. Department of Defense once made extensive use of <b>aperture</b> <b>cards,</b> and some are still in use, but most data is now digital.|$|R
50|$|Sheet film is {{supplied}} in ISO A6 size. This is either processed by hand or using a dental X-ray processor. Camera film {{is supplied}} ready mounted in <b>aperture</b> <b>cards.</b> <b>Aperture</b> <b>cards</b> are developed, fixed and washed immediately after exposure by equipment fitted to the camera.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Aperture</b> <b>cards</b> have a cut-out hole on {{the right}} side of the punched card. A 35 mm {{microfilm}} chip containing a microform image is mounted in the hole. <b>Aperture</b> <b>cards</b> are used for engineering drawings from all engineering disciplines. Information about the drawing, for example the drawing number, is typically punched and printed on the remainder of the card.|$|R
50|$|Because listing {{characters}} are a simple design, a reduction ratio of 50 gives good quality and puts about 300 pages on a microfiche. A microfilm plotter, sometimes called an <b>aperture</b> <b>card</b> plotter, accepts a stream {{that might be}} sent to a computer pen plotter. It produces corresponding frames of microfilm. These produce microfilm as 35 or 16 mm film or aperture cards.|$|E
50|$|All regular {{microfilm}} copying involves contact exposure under pressure. Then {{the film}} is processed to provide a permanent image. Hand copying of a single fiche or <b>aperture</b> <b>card</b> involves exposure over a light box and then individually processing the film. Roll films are contact exposed via motor, either round a glass cylinder or through a vacuum, under a controlled light source. Processing {{may be in the}} same machine or separately.|$|E
50|$|A {{separate}} system {{was used to}} access pages from the Walnut system. Users would look up keywords stored on an IBM 1405 hard disk system, identifying individual documents to be retrieved. The machine produced punched cards that were inserted into the Walnut. The Walnut system retrieved the documents, copied them onto a film strip and developed it, and then inserted four such images into an <b>aperture</b> <b>card.</b> The card could be read directly on a microfilm reader, or used as negatives for full-sized printouts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aperture</b> <b>cards</b> are Hollerith cards {{into which}} a hole has been cut. A 35 mm {{microfilm}} chip is {{mounted in the}} hole inside of a clear plastic sleeve, or secured over the aperture by an adhesive tape. They are used for engineering drawings, for all engineering disciplines. There are libraries of these containing over 3 million <b>cards.</b> <b>Aperture</b> <b>cards</b> may be stored in drawers or in freestanding rotary units.|$|R
50|$|Three formats are common: {{microfilm}} (reels), <b>aperture</b> <b>cards</b> and microfiche (flat sheets). Microcards, {{a format}} no longer produced, {{were similar to}} microfiche, but printed on cardboard rather than photographic film.|$|R
5000|$|Microforms like microfilm, microfiche, and <b>aperture</b> <b>cards</b> {{can be used}} to back up {{information}} that is no longer in use and does not require machine processing. It is typically used only to double-secure originally electronic information.|$|R
50|$|An <b>aperture</b> <b>card</b> {{is a type}} of {{punched card}} with a cut-out window into which a chip of {{microfilm}} is mounted. Such a card is used for archiving or for making multiple inexpensive copies of a document for ease of distribution. The card is typically punched with machine-readable metadata associated with the microfilm image, and printed {{across the top of the}} card for visual identification. The microfilm chip is most commonly 35mm in height, and contains an optically reduced image, usually of some type of reference document, such as an engineering drawing, that is the focus of the archiving process. Aperture cards have several advantages and disadvantages when compared to digital systems. Machinery exists to automatically store, retrieve, sort, duplicate, create, and digitize cards with a high level of automation. While many aperture cards still play an important role in archiving, their role is gradually being replaced by digital systems.|$|E
5000|$|While Leghorn's {{writings}} {{on the topic}} were being widely read, he was secretly informed that the United States had already taken him up on his initial proposal, and the United States Air Force (and Royal Air Force) {{were in the process}} of flying reconnaissance flights over the USSR. Aware that this would generate vast amounts of photography over long periods of time, Leghorn realized that a major problem would be storing the resulting imagery and allowing it to be easily retrieved for study. Kodak was in the process of introducing its [...] "Minicard" [...] <b>aperture</b> <b>card</b> product, and Leghorn felt this was a natural solution for the problem. [...] Leghorn sought improvement by combining it with machinery dedicated to the task of indexing the information required for reconnaissance. Leghorn contacted his long-time friend Theodore [...] "Teddy" [...] Walkowicz about forming a new company to build such a machine for the Air Force. Walkowicz was an associate of venture capitalist Laurance Rockefeller, and eventually secured a seed loan for $600,000 in exchange for a directorship.

50|$|A Microfilm {{reader is}} a device used in {{projecting}} and magnifying images stored in microform to readable proportions. Microform includes flat film, microfilm, <b>aperture</b> <b>cards,</b> microfiche, and ultra fiche. Using open reels or cassettes, microfilm {{is often used}} {{as a way to}} store many documents in a small space. It has become increasingly prevalent in the development of films, as well as storage of archived newspapers. With the invention of microfilm, microfilm readers soon developed. With the increasing popularity of computers, microform has decreased in use. However, many library archives still remain in microform.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{conversion}} is microform to digital. This is done using an optical scanner that projects the film onto a CCD array and captures it in a raw digital format. Until recently, since {{the different types}} of microform are dissimilar in shape and size, the scanners were usually able to handle only one type of microform at a time. Some scanners offer swappable modules for the different microform types, and the latest viewer/scanner can accept any microform (roll, fiche, opaque <b>cards,</b> fiche, or <b>aperture</b> <b>cards).</b> Software (normally on the scanner itself, but more recently in an attached PC) is then used to convert the raw capture into a standard image format for archival.|$|R
50|$|Many {{organizations}} were loath to alter systems that were working, so production unit record installations remained in operation long after computers offered {{faster and more}} cost effective solutions. Specialized uses of punched cards, including toll collection, microform <b>aperture</b> <b>cards,</b> and punched card voting, kept unit record equipment in use into the twenty-first century. Another reason was cost or availability of equipment: for example in 1965 an IBM 1620 computer {{did not have a}} printer as standard equipment, so it was normal in such installations to punch printed output onto cards, using two cards per line if required and print these cards on an IBM 407 accounting machine and then throw the cards away.|$|R

The analysis will begin by reviewing the current and anticipated configuration management requirements for a specific Navy program (F/A- 18) using existing information technology. A proposed consolidation of the same technical data between both government facilities and the prime contractor using a shared database with subscription based access will then be analyzed and cost comparisons presented.

[...] The NMMR {{resides in}} the Pittsburgh suburb of Green Tree, Pennsylvania, and {{collects}} and maintains mine map information and images for the entire country, including data and maps of coal mines in the anthracite coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania. The Green Tree facility provides and stores, digitally and in microfilm (<b>aperture</b> <b>cards),</b> over 182,000 maps of abandoned mines. This repository contains maps of mine workings from the 1790s to the present day. It serves as a point of reference for mine maps and other information for both surface and underground mines throughout the United States. It also serves as a location to retrieve mine maps in an emergency. The NMMR provides services ranging from retrieving mine related data for economic analysis to assessing the potential risk associated with underground mining. Through analysis of mine maps and related information, the repository assists private and public sectors in industrial and commercial development, highway construction, and the preservation of public health, safety, and welfare. In addition, they collect, reproduce, and maintain a national inventory of mine maps and supporting documentation for private and public interests.|$|R
50|$|For the {{resulting}} files to be useful, {{they must be}} organized in some way. This can be accomplished {{in a variety of}} different ways, dependent on the source media and the desired usage. In this regard, <b>aperture</b> <b>cards</b> with Hollerith information are probably the easiest since image data can be extracted from the card itself if the scanner supports it. Often, the digital image produced is better than the visual quality available prescan. Some types of microfilm will contain a counter next to the images; these can be referenced to an already existing database. Other microfilm reels will have a 'blip' system: small marks next to the images of varying lengths used to indicate document hierarchy (longest: root, long: branch, short: leaf). If the scanner is able to capture and process these then the image files can be arranged in the same manner. Optical character recognition (OCR) is also frequently employed to provide automated full-text searchable files. Common issues that affect the accuracy of OCR applied to scanned images of microfilm include unusual fonts, faded printing, shaded backgrounds, fragmented letters, skewed text, curved lines and bleed through on the originals. For film types with no distinguishing marks, or when OCR is impossible (handwriting, layout issues, degraded text), the data must be entered in manually, a very time-consuming process.|$|R

The techniques permit comparisons between standard offset printing methods and conventional distribution of bound, paper copies using less conventional publishing and distribution methods [...] <b>aperture</b> <b>cards,</b> microfiche, and microfilm cartridges. The cost appraisal methods are not dependent on the printing techniques used by the System Development Corporation, but are equally applicable to any company. The results, showing percentage differences between the alternative methods, do reflect what we are doing, and how we charge for material, labor, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and the like. But the techniques are not company specific. Seven different methods were investigated, involving three microforms. The methods are tabulated below, along with the type and percentage of distribution of each microform and a brief listing of characteristic features. In our calculations, we used the actual page counts tavolved in publishing change pages to two series of documents over a period of 43 months. We printed over 27, 000 change pages, with a total impression count in excess of 17 million. The two series were approximately equal in dollar costs. However, for one series we included a security handling charge, for the other series we did not. Results are shown for the combined totals, and, in addition, where significant differences do exist, the results for each of the series are also shown. Since dollar figures are not particularly meanins~ful, results of the calcula-tions used to determine costs for each method are expressed in percentages. Standard print costs are shown as 100 percent, and all other costs are a percentage of the standard print cost...|$|R
