25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} human rights, the courts have stated that there is no difference between the protection offered by the common law, and that guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. The right to freedom of expression has traditionally been considered as residual in character but certain types of speech are protected in positive terms. This is the case of debates in Parliament which are protected by parliamentary privilege, media reporting on parliamentary proceedings is covered by <b>absolute</b> <b>privilege,</b> while reports of court proceedings are protected by qualified privilege so long as they are fair, accurate and not published with malice.|$|E
40|$|The court {{considered}} consolidated {{appeals and}} a cross-appeal from a district court order granting {{a motion to}} dismiss complaint based on anti-SLAPP statutes and the awarding of attorney fees and costs. The Court considered whether parts of Nevada’s anti-SLAPP statute, NRS 41. 637, are unconstitutionally vague, whether statements made {{in relation to a}} conservatorship action constitute an issue of public interest under NRS 41. 637 (4), and whether those statements fall within the scope of the <b>absolute</b> litigation <b>privilege.</b> The Court found that no, NRS 41. 637 is not unconstitutionally vague; adopted a California test for determining an issue of public interest–and remanded the present case for further proceedings; and found that the district court did not conduct the specific, fact-intensive inquiry it needed to for the <b>absolute</b> litigation <b>privilege,</b> and accordingly reversed the district court’s order in part, and remanded the case for further proceedings...|$|R

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1970, Ramsey named Charlton in his squad of 22 for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. However, he favoured Labone over Charlton and only picked Charlton for his 35th and final England game in the 1–0 group win over Czechoslovakia at the Estadio Jalisco. England lost in the quarter finals to West Germany, and on the flight home, Charlton asked Ramsey not to be {{considered}} for international duty again. Charlton agonised over how to break the news to Ramsey, and eventually said: [...] "Great times... <b>absolute</b> <b>privilege...</b> getting older... slowing down... not sure I am up to it any more... time to step down." [...] Ramsey listened, then agreed with him. [...] "Yes, I had reached that conclusion myself." ...|$|E

[...] Glenn Tasker, President of the Australian Paralympic Committee said that: [...] "It has been an <b>absolute</b> <b>privilege</b> to watch Matthew develop from the quiet 15-year-old kid who competed at his first Paralympics in 2004, {{into one of the}} greats of Australian Paralympic sport.

2500|$|In {{a review}} of the case, the Washington University Law Quarterly remarked, [...] "The Ninth Circuit's {{extension}} of the free exercise clause to include a privilege against tort liability is incorrect. First, by distinguishing emotional harms from physical harms, the court downplayed the significance of an emotional injury, which is often times as great as physical harm. ... In most of the free exercise cases decided by the Supreme Court the government has acted against the religious group, either by imposing criminal sanctions for religious conduct or denying members some benefit because of their religious beliefs. In Paul, however, the religious group acted as the aggressor, violating the plaintiff's right to emotional well-being. By granting defendants an <b>absolute</b> <b>privilege</b> against tort liability, the court has allowed the Church to use the shield of the first amendment as a sword. ... The Paul decision is an unfortunate expansion of a doctrine intended to protect individual rights. To turn the doctrine on its head {{and use it as a}} means to thwart another person's rights is an ironic twist that would undoubtedly displease the drafters of the first amendment. ... At best, Paul can be viewed as a slight detour from the correct interpretation of the free exercise clause and the proper balancing of interests performed by the Supreme Court and numerous lower courts." ...|$|E

Also, he claimed Special Prosecutor Jaworski had not proven the requested materials were absolutely necessary for the trial of the seven men.

50|$|<b>Absolute</b> <b>privilege</b> is a {{complete}} defence to an action for defamation in English law. If the defence of <b>absolute</b> <b>privilege</b> applies it is irrelevant that a defendant has acted with malice, knew information was false or acted solely to damage {{the reputation of the}} plaintiff. <b>Absolute</b> <b>privilege</b> can be deployed in a narrow range of cases. Statements made in judicial proceedings are protected as are communications between a solicitor and their client. The Bill of Rights of 1689 provides that proceedings of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are also covered by <b>absolute</b> <b>privilege.</b>|$|E

50|$|Another notable {{component}} of grsecurity {{is that it}} provides a full role-based access control (RBAC) system. RBAC is intended to restrict access to the system further than what is normally provided by Unix access control lists, {{with the aim of}} creating a fully least-privilege system, where users and processes have the <b>absolute</b> minimum <b>privileges</b> to work correctly and nothing more. This way, if the system is compromised, the ability of the attacker to damage or gain sensitive information on the system can be drastically reduced. RBAC works through a collection of roles. Each role can have individual restrictions on what it can or cannot do, and these roles and restrictions form an access policy which can be amended as needed.|$|R
25|$|The tort of {{defamation}} in India {{has largely}} followed the approach {{taken by the}} UK. Indian courts have endorsed the defences of <b>absolute</b> and qualified <b>privilege,</b> fair comment and justification. In UK, if the defendant is only successful in proving the truth {{of some of the}} several charges against him, the defence of justification might still be available if the charges not proved do not materially injure the reputation. While there is no such provision in India, the law is possibly the same. Recently, incidents of defamation in relation to public figures are highlighted.|$|R
6000|$|By virtue, therefore, of his {{prerogative}} royal, and in {{consideration of}} the rents, covenants, and agreements therein expressed, His Majesty granted to William Wood, his executors, assigns, etc., [...] "full, free, sole, and <b>absolute</b> power, <b>privilege,</b> licence, and authority," [...] during fourteen years, from the annunciation of the Blessed Virgin, 1722, to coin halfpence and farthings of copper, to be uttered and disposed of in Ireland, and not elsewhere.

The same [...] "to pass and to be received as current money, by such as shall or will, voluntarily and willingly, and not otherwise, receive the same, within the said kingdom of Ireland, and not elsewhere."

60|$|Miss Marrable, Mary Lowther's aunt, lived, of course, at Uphill; {{but not in}} the Crescent, nor yet in Balfour Place. She was an {{old lady}} with very modest means, whose brother had been rector down at St. Peter's, and she had passed the {{greatest}} part of her life within those slate-coloured gates. When he died, and when she, almost exactly at the same time, found that it would be expedient that she should take charge of her niece, Mary, she removed herself up to a small house in Botolph Lane, in which she could live decently on her £300 a year. It must not be surmised that Botolph Lane was a squalid place, vile, or dirty, or even unfashionable. It was narrow and old, having been inhabited by decent people long before the Crescent, or even Mr. Balfour himself, had been in existence; but it was narrow and old, and the rents were cheap, and here Miss Marrable was able to live, and occasionally to give tea-parties, and to provide a comfortable home for her niece, within the limits of her income. Miss Marrable was herself a lady of very good family, the late Sir Gregory Marrable having been her uncle; but her only sister had married a Captain Lowther, whose mother had been first cousin to the Earl of Periwinkle; and therefore on her own account, as well as on that of her niece, Miss Marrable thought a good deal about blood. She was one of those ladies,--now few in number,--who within their heart of hearts conceive that money gives no title to social distinction, let the amount of money be ever so great, and its source ever so stainless. Rank to her was a thing quite assured and ascertained, and she had no more doubt as to her own right to pass out of a room before the wife of a millionaire than she had of the right of a millionaire to spend his own guineas. She always addressed an attorney by letter as Mister, raising up her eyebrows when appealed to on the matter, and explaining that an attorney is not an esquire. She had an idea that the son of a gentleman, if he intended to maintain his rank as a gentleman, should earn his income as a clergyman, or as a barrister, or as a soldier, or as a sailor. Those were the professions intended for gentlemen. She would not absolutely say that a physician was not a gentleman, or even a surgeon; but she would never allow to physic the same <b>absolute</b> <b>privileges</b> which, in her eyes, belonged to law and the church. There might also possibly be a doubt about the Civil Service and Civil Engineering; but she had no doubt whatever that when a man touched trade or commerce in any way he was doing that which was not the work of a gentleman. He might be very respectable, and it might be very necessary that he should do it; but brewers, bankers, and merchants, were not gentlemen, and the world, according to Miss Marrable's theory, was going astray, because people were forgetting their landmarks.|$|R
40|$|Although many {{enterprises}} in Russia have been privatized, the government still retains its influence over them; they, in turn, {{also try to}} attain state guardianship. State patronage over firms often {{takes the form of}} privileges (e. g., subsidies, tax discounts or government projects) given to firms in exchange for some “payment” (not necessarily in the monetary form). The purpose of this paper is, firstly, to reveal the incentives of both parties to set up and accept patronage and, secondly, to evaluate the economic consequences of such relations. If the government is non-benevolent, it uses privileges inefficiently. The proposed theoretical model detects the following sources of inefficiency: public goods are underprovided; the <b>absolute</b> level of <b>privileges</b> is too high; the discrimination suppressing inefficient firms may be too severe; and, finally, a self-interested government is likely to support large “old” enterprises with weak incentives to invest, which may negatively affect future economic growth.

40|$|Both, {{reputation}} {{and freedom of}} speech are constitutional rights. But whether we want it or not, they regularly meet and are in conflict with one to another. But, as many judgments show, courts rather rarely reach a judgment, what is excellent within its juridical construction. That’s why the target of this job was to examine as many judgments it’s possible and to inspect cases of defamation in the U. S. A. (as it has the most higher degree of speech protection, after Sullivan case), together with the praxis of the European Court of Human rights and of national courts. Author {{wanted to create a}} test for the courts. This work consists of seven main chapters. The second one looks at the statutory regulation about {{reputation and}} freedom of speech. The next – what is <b>absolute</b> and qualified <b>privileges</b> (for Latvian jurisdiction has no similar concept), fourth will go on and try to define different possible status of persons; fifth will examine, how an opinion might be defended; sixth will consider about factual basis and standards of liability, but the last chapter will lay down the borders to criticize persons. Finally, the test is built up from three categories of criteria – id est it includes the public interest, what varies from political questions till just private. Then, the test weighes out, whether the factual basis is true and if not, what kind of liability (malice, actual malice, bona fide) is to apply, taking into account, what is the status of the defamed person – public official, public figure, quasi-public official figure or private person. So, the most ample protection is intended for a private person (even strict liability), but the less – for public official/figure. But the protection of opinion varies from the status of the person and the interest the case involved...|$|R
