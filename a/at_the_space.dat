5|$|Amy rescues Sonic from {{imprisonment}} {{and asks}} him {{to marry her}} but yet again Sonic refuses to in Sonic Adventure 2. When she looks for Sonic (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for Sonic. Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then spends much of the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and the other characters neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his friend on the ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E

40|$|Field {{studies were}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of sowing time and <b>spacing</b> on <b>the</b> growth and fruit yield of okra in 1999 and 2000 in the farmer = s field, Lakshmipur, Bangladesh. The highest plant height was recorded 87. 5 cm when okra was sown on 5 March, 2000 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> of 45 x 45 cm and the lowest height was 73. 3 cm when okra was sown on 20 May, 1999 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> of 35 x 40 cm. The maximum number of leaves per plant was observed when it was sown on 5 March 2000 and the minimum was when sown on 20 May, 1999. Moreover, the fruit yield, number of fruit picking per plant, fruit length and weight per fruit were higher when okra was sown on 5 March, 5 April and 5 May, 2000 spaced at 45 x 45 cm than when okra was sown on 20 March, 20 April and 20 May, 1999 spaced at 35 x 40 cm. The highest number of percent mosaic infected plant was counted when okra was sown on 20 May, 1999 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> of 35 x 40 cm and the lowest was when okra was sown on 5 March, 2000 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> of 45 x 45 cm. In addition to that the highest number of vector of okra mosaic disease was counted when okra was sown on 20 May, 1999 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> of 35 x 40 cm and the lowest was when okra was sown on 5 March, 2000 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>spacing</b> of 45 x 45 cm. Percent mosaic infected plants was highest in 1999 and the lowest was in 2000 when it was sown on 20 May and 5 March due to the presence of the number of vectors of okra mosaic disease...|$|R
5|$|In August 2000, NASA asked project {{managers}} to consider looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle, {{instead of the}} previously proposed EELV, as a launch vehicle. In late November 2000, NASA announced that the project's scientific team was selected. The group included notable names {{from the world of}} extrasolar planet research including Geoffrey Marcy. The entire group consisted of 10 principal investigators and five mission specialists. At the time of this NASA announcement launch was scheduled for 2009 and the mission was still part of the Origins Program.|$|E
5|$|Originally located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> now {{occupied}} by Halifax City Hall, the college moved in 1886 to Carleton Campus and spread gradually to Studley Campus. Dalhousie grew steadily during the 20th century. From 1889 to 1962 the Halifax Conservatory was affiliated with and awarded degrees through Dalhousie. In 1920 several buildings {{were destroyed by}} fire {{on the campus of}} the University of King's College in Windsor, Nova Scotia. Through a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, King's College relocated to Halifax and entered into a partnership with Dalhousie that continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999, {{the leading}} Hubble {{outreach}} group in Europe {{has been the}} Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre (HEIC). This office was established <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including a videocast series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.|$|E

5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
