A cost model which estimates the costs associated with replacing an AIDS affected employee over time is used. The costs are not significant to the company as they are able to transfer most of the cost of illness onto their employees. There are significant risks for the company however, to the existence and costs associated with insured employee benefits into the future. This company has minimised their risks to the negative impacts of HIV/AIDS by adopting several cost saving strategies. This is however, to the detriment of their employees. ...|$|R
40|$|Working across {{knowledge-based}} research programmes, {{rather than}} institutional structures, should be central to interdisciplinary research. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to facilitate interdisciplinary research, {{with the goals}} of promoting communication, understanding and collaborative work. Three core elements need to be addressed to improve interdisciplinary research: the types (forms and functions) of theories, the underlying philosophies of knowledge and the combination of research styles; these three elements combine to form the research <b>programme.</b> <b>Case</b> studies from sustainability science and environmental security illustrate the application of this research programme-based framework. This framework may be helpful in overcoming often oversimplified distinctions, such as qualitative/quantitative, deductive/inductive, normative/descriptive, subjective/objective and theory/practice. Applying this conceptual framework to interdisciplinary research should foster theoretical advances, more effective communication and better problem-solving in increasingly interdisciplinary environmental fields...|$|R

The professional accrediting {{body in the}} United Kingdom, the Royal Town Planning Institute, stipulates the core planning skills required, differentiating between formal classroom-based learning and professional competencies, derived in practice. Previous research identified the need to address perceived inadequacies in graduate planners’ practical skills, such as decision-making, leadership, and communication, including negotiating, influencing and using evidence. Emphasis has also been placed on planning schools sharing innovative practice to improve student learning. This paper critically reflects on the challenges of teaching diverse cohorts and presents the findings from a sponsored teaching exchange research <b>programme.</b> <b>Case</b> studies drawn from each institution are used to illustrate practice-orientated planning education approaches in the classroom to better equip students for the workplace...|$|R

Based on the Pro-Poor Tourism Pilot Programme conducted in southern Africa, this article argues that 'mainstream' commercial tourism can do much to embrace pro-poor approaches. In particular, the tourism sector needs to go further in shifting from philanthropic approaches to pro-poor approaches that entail doing business differently, with more committed changes to strategy and business structures. The pilot <b>programme</b> <b>case</b> studies reveal a range of potential business benefits companies can achieve through pro-poor approaches, such as enhanced social licence to operate and increased brand recognition. They also show that implementing a pro-poor approach depends on the company's context and circumstances. Such a shift entails a number of challenges and companies need to commit to making the necessary effort. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{critically}} examines {{programme structure}} as {{a dimension of}} programme strategy {{within the context of}} large-scale-multi-site (LSMS) information system (IS) based change programmes. While a centralized programme structure is often assumed both in literature and in practice, we argue that programme structure should be a strategic decision contingent upon programme environment. Following the structural contingency theory, we characterise programme environment by two dimensions of the programme environment as programme authority over the participating organizations and homogeneity of the business processes among the participating organizations. Based on these two dimensions, we develop an authority-homogeneity matrix. Given a programme of low authority and low homogeneity, the programme should adopt a matching decentralized structure supported by standard process and data interfaces. By comparing two <b>programme</b> <b>cases,</b> we demonstrate how a decentralized approach can work for a LSMS IS-based change programme while a centralized programme structure fails...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} aid flowing to smaller (less populous) {{countries}} {{has a negative}} impact on the quality of institutions in terms of performance and policy as opposed to that flowing to larger countries, where evidence suggests that the impacts are positive. The analysis here suggests that the level of development, the size of an economy, and the level of aid receipts matter for institutional performance as quantified by measures of economic freedom. Cross-country evidence is presented that suggests the impact of aid is damaging in small vis- 0 -vis large countries, and that, while aid increases economic freedom as a whole, the impact of aid on economic freedom is negative for nations with a population less than 1. 4 million. This is significant for small island economies in the Pacific, where increasing amounts of overseas development assistance fund governance <b>programmes.</b> <b>Case</b> studies of Fijian economic governance initiatives are used to illustrate the difficulties encountered when donors fund institutional reform programmes in Pacific states...|$|R
