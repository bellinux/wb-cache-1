5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was {{released}} on October 24, 2005 for the Xbox, and on March 27, 2006 for the PC. The game contains a number of software bugs, which have never been officially patched; these bugs are generally intermittent, and restoring from an earlier saved game can be enough to get past them. There is also an unofficial patch available that fixes some glitches <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the game's overall difficulty level. The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise, {{along with}} other ships in the sector, {{experience}} a localized time-distortion, and soon after receive a distress-call from Dr. Paul Manheim in a nearby system. Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) recalls that Manheim was ejected from the Federation Science Institute for conducting unauthorized experiments. They find the distress signal coming from a facility on a planetoid surrounded by a force-field. When they {{make contact with the}} facility, a woman requests help to save her husband, Dr. Manheim, <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the shields.|$|E

50|$|One can {{differentiate}} many continuity concepts, primarily closed graph property <b>and</b> upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> hemicontinuity. (One {{should be}} warned that often the terms upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> semicontinuous are {{used instead of}} upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> hemicontinuous reserved for the case of weak topology in domain; yet we arrive at the collision with the reserved names for upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> semicontinuous real-valued function). There exist also various definitions for measurability of multifunction.|$|R
5|$|The {{territorial}} {{call of the}} Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah {{with the}} last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species {{are very difficult to}} tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Environment Agency {{constructed}} a tidal barrier {{at the mouth}} of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be lowered into the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new drive mechanism, which raises <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the gate, and pivots it when it is at the top of the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage {{at the mouth of}} the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the Abercrombie report, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War. The estimated cost of such a project was around £195million in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Most free-market thinkers detest subsidy and {{intervention}} because they waste resources. Terry Anderson and Donald Leal {{think that all}} recycling programmes should be privately operated, and therefore would only operate if the money saved by recycling exceeds its costs. Daniel K.

25|$|Efficiency is a {{function}} of power output. A moderate load makes for high efficiency. Too heavy a load increases the slip in the turbine <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the efficiency; with too light a load, little power is delivered to the output, which also decreases efficiency (to zero at idle). This behaviour is not exclusive to Tesla turbines.|$|E
25|$|Titan's {{atmosphere}} supports an opaque {{cloud layer}} that obscures Titan's surface features at visible wavelengths. The haze {{that can be}} seen in the adjacent picture contributes to the moon's anti-greenhouse effect <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the temperature by reflecting sunlight away from the satellite. The thick atmosphere blocks most visible wavelength light from the Sun and other sources from reaching Titan's surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{double-deck}} design usually includes {{lowering the}} bottom floor to below {{the top level}} of the wheels, closer to the rails, and then adding an upper floor above. Such a design will fit under more bridges, tunnels and power wires (structure gauge). For cost and safety, this design also minimizes car height (loading gauge) <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the centre of gravity.|$|E

25|$|In {{contemporary}} time {{researchers and}} health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims {{for each of}} their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces conflict {{of interest in the}} healthcare industry, unnecessary health care, <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The 2CV {{used the}} fixed-profile convertible, where {{the doors and}} upper side {{elements}} of its bodywork remain fixed, while its fabric soft top can be opened. This reduces weight <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the centre of gravity, and allows the carrying of long or irregularly shaped items, but the key reason was that fabric was cheaper than steel which was in short supply and expensive after the war. The fixed-profile concept was quite popular in this period.|$|E

40|$|A two-person zero-sum {{differential}} {{game with}} unbounded controls is considered. Under proper coercivity conditions, the upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> value functions are characterized as the unique viscosity {{solutions to the}} corresponding upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> Hamilton [...] Jacobi [...] Isaacs equations, respectively. Consequently, when the Isaacs' condition is satisfied, the upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> value functions coincide, leading {{to the existence of}} the value function. Due to the unboundedness of the controls, the corresponding upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> Hamiltonians grow super linearly in the gradient of the upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> value functions, respectively. A uniqueness theorem of viscosity solution to Hamilton [...] Jacobi equations involving such kind of Hamiltonian is proved, without relying on the convexity/concavity of the Hamiltonian. Also, it is shown that the assumed coercivity conditions guaranteeing the finiteness of the upper <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> value functions are sharp in some sense. Comment: 34 page...|$|R
25|$|As {{with other}} seafood, shrimp {{is high in}} calcium, iodine and protein but low in food energy. A shrimp-based meal is also a {{significant}} source of cholesterol, from 122mg to 251mg per 100g of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation. Shrimp consumption, however, is considered healthy for the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels of saturated fat in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp actually improves the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> triglycerides.|$|E
25|$|Releasable abseil - Used by some guides with inexperienced abseilers. A rope {{is set up}} by {{anchoring}} it with a munter hitch and locking off the non-rappelling {{strand of}} the rope. The client descends on the non-locked strand of the rope. The guide unlocks the other strand <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the client or the rappeller if the client gets into trouble.

25|$|A {{receiving}} woman's {{legs and}} arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in some other way. A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the level of clitoral stimulation.|$|E

25|$|Facebook's {{platform}} is efficient because it lowers {{barriers to entry}} <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> costs for businesses to rapidly innovate new ideas. Scalability is accomplished with less wasted resources and monetized by collecting user behavior and usage data for targeted advertising. Facebook advertising allows firms to reasonably scale up operations to reach Facebook users. Facebook's daily active users have increased 18% year-over-year and burgeoning from 1 million users in 2004, to over 1.9 billion in 2017. Facebook is a leader among tech companies who continues to improve their carbon impact through more efficient data centers and clean renewable energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} is {{hyperplastic}} and overstimulated, with no impairment of the mineralocorticoid pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, corticosterone, and 18-deoxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion, blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some persons with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% {{do so by}} late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by hypokalemia due to urinary potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. These features of mineralocorticoid excess are the major clinical clue distinguishing the more complete 17α-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex steroids. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal, <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{modified}} properties of copolymer are more desirable {{for a particular}} application. For example, cyclohexane dimethanol (CHDM) {{can be added to}} the polymer backbone in place of ethylene glycol. Since this building block is much larger (6 additional carbon atoms) than the ethylene glycol unit it replaces, it does not fit in with the neighboring chains the way an ethylene glycol unit would. This interferes with crystallization <b>and</b> <b>lowers</b> the polymer's melting temperature. In general, such PET is known as PETG or PET-G (Polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified; Eastman Chemical, SK Chemicals, and Artenius Italia are some PETG manufacturers). PETG is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection molded or sheet extruded. It can be colored during processing.|$|E
