5|$|The {{conflict}} between the Welsh princes and the English kings continued in the reign of Edward I. In 1282 Llywelyn fought a final campaign against Edward, ending in the prince's death near Builth that December. His brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, assumed power but during 1283 was forced south into Snowdonia. Meanwhile, forces {{under the command of}} Roger Lestrange and William de Valence marched from south Wales and Shropshire, placing Castell y Bere under siege <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> on 25 April. Edward deployed 7,000 troops to detain Dafydd who was finally captured and executed in October. A team of five masons and five carpenters, under the command of Master Bertram the Engineer, were left at Castell y Bere to conduct unspecified work after the English army had left.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a four-day}} reprieve {{away from the}} frontline, the 12th Battalion {{relieved}} the 9th Battalion at Lagnicourt on 14 April. Around dawn the following day, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack against the 1st Australian Division's line. Breaking through the Australian line, the Germans forced back the 12th Battalion's D Company, which was {{to the left of}} Newland's A Company. Soon surrounded and under attack on three sides, Newland withdrew the company to a sunken road which had been held by Captain Percy Cherry during the capture of the village three weeks earlier, and lined the depleted company out in a defensive position on both banks. Establishing his platoon in position, Whittle noticed a group of Germans moving a machine gun into position to enfilade the road. As the gunners began to set up the weapon, Whittle, under heavy rifle fire, jumped from the road and single-handedly rushed the crew. Using his bombs, he succeeded in killing the entire group before collecting the gun <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> back to A Company's position.|$|E

25|$|Modafinil (Provigil) is a {{stimulant}} {{approved in}} the US {{for treatment of}} shift-work sleep disorder, which shares some characteristics with DSPD. A number of clinicians prescribe it for DSPD patients, as it may improve a sleep-deprived patient's ability to function adequately during socially desirable hours.

25|$|A {{dark age}} of poverty, low {{population}} and metals starvation is not {{compatible with the}} idea of great population movements of successful warriors wielding the latest military equipment sweeping into the Peloponnesus <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> over to rebuild civilization their way. This dark age consists of three periods of art and archaeology: sub-Mycenaean, Proto-geometric and Geometric. The most successful, the Geometric, seems to fit the Dorians better, but there is a gap, and this period is not localized to and did not begin in Dorian territory. It is more to be associated with Athens, an Ionian state.|$|E
25|$|War came in 1914, and Liège {{became the}} early focus of German {{attack on the}} way to France. The forts were known to have {{shortcomings}} in their ability to resist heavy artillery, and had never been modernised. During the Battle of Liège the forts were pounded by heavy German artillery of 21cm, 28cm and 42cm. The forts had never been designed to resist such heavy artillery. The bombardment exposed the forts' shortcomings in living arrangements, sanitation, ventilation, construction and protection, culminating with the explosion of the Fort de Loncin under bombardment. Even before this the forts had begun to surrender one by one as they became uninhabitable and unable to respond to attack. German forces defeated the troops assigned to defend the intervals between forts, penetrating to Liège <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> before the first fort had surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Darius Just had {{previously}} helped novice writer Giles Devore produce a breakthrough novel. Just credits himself with ruthlessly editing Devore's original drafts and forcing the young author to turn an incoherent mess into a masterwork.

Just volunteers to run an errand for Devore – collecting a parcel for him <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> to his hotel room – but he forgets to do so until the next day. Entering Devore's hotel room, Just discovers Devore dead in the bathroom, apparently having slipped in the shower and hit {{his head on the}} faucets. Others take this to be a tragic accident and nothing more, but Just suspects murder, based on Devore's compulsive tidiness and the disarray in which Just found the room. He interviews Devore's ex-wife, who tells him that the parcel contained Devore's monogrammed pens.|$|E

In shock he allows himself to be taken with them as they take the body out to sea to dispose of it. However, when they throw the body into the sea, it miraculously escapes its weighted sheet floats back to shore. This Dan takes as a sign of God's will and so he steers the ship back to shore.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. had to run a balance of payments current account deficit to provide liquidity for the conversion of gold into U.S. dollars. With more U.S. dollars in the system than were backed with gold under the Bretton Woods agreement, the U.S. dollar was overvalued. This meant that the United States had less gold as foreign governments started converting U.S. dollars to gold <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> offshore. Foreign speculators were not a direct part of the gold flow out of the US, as under the Bretton Woods Agreement, only governments could exchange US currency for physical gold. Additionally, while the Bretton Woods Agreement was in place, direct speculation by US citizens who were banned from owning any gold other than jewelry following Executive Order 6102 which was enacted in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and enabled the US Government to confiscate all gold coinage, gold certificates, and gold bullion held by any citizen, did not contribute to the price imbalance and arbitrage opportunity via a wide disparity of gold prices between the US and other markets. A price ceiling had been enacted which fixed the price of gold at $35/oz USD following the previously mentioned gold confiscation from US citizens in 1933. As with all price controls, this caused supply and demand imbalances and an arbitrage opportunity which rapidly depleted the United States gold reserves. This led to less gold in the country and caused the US Dollar to become more overvalued, leading to a self-propagating cycle. Furthermore, the US had to run a balance of payments current account surplus to maintain confidence in the U.S. dollar.|$|E
