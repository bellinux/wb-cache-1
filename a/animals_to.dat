5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of <b>animals</b> <b>to</b> mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small <b>animals</b> <b>to</b> within striking distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} humans {{must have}} had and passed on knowledge about plants and <b>animals</b> <b>to</b> increase their chances of survival. This may have included knowledge of human and animal anatomy and aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants for farming, then livestock <b>animals</b> <b>to</b> accompany the resulting sedentary societies.|$|E

Officers responding to such reports {{make every effort}} {{to save the life of}} the <b>animal</b> or <b>to</b> relocate the <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> a more suitable habitat to reduce conflict between the animal and humans. In the case of injured wildlife, if possible, the officer will turn the <b>animal</b> over <b>to</b> a licensed wildlife rehabilitator for care with the goal of eventual return of the <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> its natural environment.|$|R

5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many <b>animals</b> <b>to</b> find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
5|$|Because of its name, Prosaurolophus {{is often}} {{associated}} with Saurolophus.

5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other <b>animals</b> <b>to</b> their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from <b>animals</b> <b>to</b> humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
