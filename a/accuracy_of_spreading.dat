40|$|Wildfires have {{significant}} impact on both ecosystems and human society. To effectively manage wildfires, simulation models are used to study and predict wildfire <b>spread.</b> The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> wildfire <b>spread</b> simulations depends on many factors, including GIS data, fuel data, weather data, and high-fidelity wildfire behavior models. Unfortunately, due to the dynamic and complex nature of wildfire, it is impractical to obtain all these data with no error. Therefore, predictions from the simulation model will be different from what {{it is in a}} real wildfire. Without assimilating data from the real wildfire and dynamically adjusting the simulation, the difference between the simulation and the real wildfire is very likely to continuously grow. With the development of sensor technologies and the advance of computer infrastructure, dynamic data driven application systems (DDDAS) have become an active research area in recent years. In a DDDAS, data obtained from wireless sensors is fed into the simulation model to make predictions of the real system. This dynamic input is treated as the measurement to evaluate the output and adjust the states of the model, thus to improve simulation results. To improve the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> wildfire <b>spread</b> simulations, we apply the concept of DDDAS to wildfire sprea...|$|R

To include data assimilation in FARSITE, uncertainty on both the simulated wildfire perimeter and the measured wildfire perimeter is used to formulate optimal updates for the prediction <b>of</b> the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the wildfire.

40|$|Both the Wenchuan {{earthquake}} on May 12, 2008, and the Lushan earthquake on April 12, 2013, produced many coseismic landslides {{along the}} Nanya River in Shimian City. Subsequent debris flows that initiated from these landslides and are triggered by intense rainfall become the secondary hazard {{in the years}} after the earthquake; in particular, some debris flows led to a serious river blocking event. For example, the Guangyuanbao debris flow which occurred on July 04, 2013, partly blocked the Nanya River, presenting a major threat to the national highway and residential areas. To analyze the pattern of landslide damming, we analyzed numerical simulations of the movement characteristics of the Guangyuanbao debris flow using rainfall intensities with varying recurrence periods of 5, 20, and 50 years.

40|$|Positioning {{accuracy}} in satellite navigation systems depends on time-delay estimation (TDE) between satellite transmitted codes and local receiver replicas. This thesis explores the fundamental limits <b>of</b> TDE <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> spectrum (SS) signals {{making use of}} estimation theory and signal synchronization tools, which makes the proposed analysis suitable for both navigation and communication systems and independent from receiver configurations. In particular, this contribution derives some criteria to improve positioning {{accuracy in}} the additive white Gaussian noise (multipath-free) scenario, focusing on the (satellite) transmitter side of a SS system. Four different solutions, based on the minimization of the variance of the TDE, are presented by means of signal design. The first method speculates on the shaping of the pulse format of a linearly modulated Direct Sequence (DS) -SS signal. A pulse loss parameter useful for comparing performance of different pulse signals in a dedicated receiver bandwidth is thus defined. The second approach still considers DS-SS linearly modulated signals, proposing a joint shaping pulse-spreading code optimization. A design criterion to derive an optimal spreading waveform is thus derived both theoretically and numerically. A set of non-binary band-limited (NBBL) spreading waveforms that further improve the TDE accuracy while maintaining good properties of code acquisition and interference management are thus obtained. The third solution encompasses the design of SS-Continuous Phase Modulation (SS-CPM) that allows good TDE performance while guaranteing a constant complex envelope of the signal, thus showing high robustness to non-linear distortions introduced by non-linear HPA. Finally, as fourth approach, we show how a multicarrier signal can be formatted to obtain maximum estimation accuracy. Capitalizing on this, we also demonstrate that the inherent flexibility about power and frequency allocation possessed by such signal is expedient to the achievement of a cognitive localization system that adapts to the changing situation of availability and interference of a wideband radio channel. Performance of the proposed solutions for future GNSS systems is {{compared with that of}} existing DS-SS signals for current satellite positioning systems. Performance of some schemes is evaluated as signal options {{to be used in the}} C-band portion envisioned for GNSS evolutions.

Noninvasive, highly accurate measurement <b>of</b> the energy <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> {{the electron}} beam in the storage ring remains a challenge. Conventional techniques are limited to measuring a relatively large energy spread using the energy spread induced broadening effect of radiation source size or radiation spectrum. In this work, we report a versatile method to accurately measure the electron beam relative energy spread from 10 - 4 to 10 - 2 using the optical klystron radiation. A novel numerical method based on the Gauss-Hermite expansion has been developed to treat both spectral broadening and modulation on an equal footing. A large dynamic range of the measurement is realized by properly configuring the optical klystron. In addition, a model-based scheme has been developed {{for the first time}} to compensate the beam-emittance-induced inhomogeneous spectral broadening effect to improve the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the energy <b>spread</b> measurement.

Methods: Between January 2012 and October 2013, 82 patients affected by Tis-T 1 a glottic cancer were treated with TLM by type I or II cordectomies. Intraoperative NBI evaluation was performed using 0 -degree and 70 -degree rigid telescopes.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades several {{simulation}} systems were developed to provide information about temporal and spatial variations <b>of</b> fire <b>spread</b> and behaviour. FARSITE (Fire Area Simulator), {{one of the most common}} simulators, is a spatially and temporally explicit fire simulation system. The simulator is based on Rothermel's fire spread model, and describes the fire spread and behaviour as a function of relationships among fuels, topography and weather conditions. The use of FARSITE on areas different from those where the simulator was originally developed requires a local calibration in order to produce reliable results. This is particularly true for the Mediterranean ecosystems, where plant communities are characterized by high specific and structural heterogeneity and complexity, determined by the interaction of sub-arid Mediterranean climate and human factors. Therefore, to perform FARSITE calibration, the choice of the appropriate standard fuel models or the development of specific custom fuel models are required. In addition, the capabilities of FARSITE simulator can be affected by other environmental characteristics, as complex steep terrains with the resulting high spatial and temporal variability of wind speed and direction. In this work, FARSITE was employed to simulate <b>spread</b> and behaviour <b>of</b> four real fires occurred in North Sardinia during 2003, 2004 and 2006 summer seasons.

Two types of bridges, simply supported bridges and bridges with integrated backwalls, have been modeled with 2 D beam elements. When analyzing the load spreading effect, two types of load shapes have been considered. The first one is the load shape proposed in Eurocode where the axle load is modeled with three point loads where 50 % of the axle load acts on the sleeper located underneath the wheel and 25 % on the two adjacent sleepers, respectively. Therefrom the loads are further distributed through the sleepers and the ballast. The second load shape that has been studied is a triangular load shape. These two load shapes have been modeled both with different numbers of point loads and as distributed line loads to see how the dynamic response of the bridges is affected and thereby find what level <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> that is required to capture the full effect <b>of</b> the load <b>spreading.</b> For the bridges with integrated backwalls the supports were also modeled as springs with varying stiffness to see how the dynamic response was affected. The response was measured in terms of vertical acceleration and bending moment. From the simulations the conclusion can be drawn that the triangular load shape gives significantly lower bridge responses than the Eurocode load shape. It is further found that modeling the axle loads with point loads can give spurious acceleration peaks, which in the case of bridges with integrated backwalls often are critical.
