40|$|A {{preliminary}} study {{was carried out}} for the effect of far UV radiation on the morphology and germination of the conidia of Fusarium culmorum. It can be established that the UV radiation was effective mainly on the width {{and the number of}} transversal walls of conidia developed on the air mycelia. For the examination of the effect of UV radiation, conidia were prepared from the irradiated mycelia {{as well as from the}} mycelia developed after the irradiation. As a result of our investigations, it can be established that the conidia developed in the mycelia irradiated by 0, 81 J/cm 2 dose were resistive for the far UV radiation. The germination percent of these conidia were about 20 percent even at the dose of 1, 728 J/cm 2 applied at the start of germination. The conidia isolated from mycelia developed after irradiation already lost their <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> at the irradiation of the smallest dose...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The grass B. decumbens is {{the most}} {{cultivated}} pasture establishment in Brazil pastures and on areas used for other crops is amongst the more undesired weeds, due to hard control and rusticity. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the effects of sowing depths on B. decumbens emergence. The tests were performed on green house using the following sowing depths (0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0, 6. 0, 7. 0, 8. 0, 9. 0 e 10. 0 cm). From 7. 0 cm deep occurred significant emergence speed index (SEI) and seedlings emergence percentage (%ESI) reduction. In assessing the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> of B. decumbens occurred suppression effect of germination in greater depth evaluated, while the other depths were tested emergency plan, with lower occurrence between 5 and 7 cm and topsoil.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a variable magnetic field of 30 mT magnetic induction and frequency f = 50 Hz, at different exposure times (8, 15, 30, 60 and 120 s), {{as well as an}} electric field of 5 kV cm- 1 intensity and the same frequency and exposure times on kernel vigour of triticale with Aegilops hybrids and triticale (cv. Tewo), were studied. The aim of the research has been to choose suitable parameters for kernel biostimulation and find the application for results in further studies. The following methods for vigour evaluation have been used: germination ability, sprout length, germ necroses using the topographic tetrasolin method, electric conductivity of exudates from kernels and a-amylase activity. Positive effects of variable magnetic and electric fields on kernel vigour have been found. Grains subjected to an electric rather than a magnetic field have been characterized as having higher vigour. The best exposure time for kernels in a magnetic field was 60 s and in an electric field 30 s. The cross-combination produced using Ae. crassa 4 x was characterized as having higher vigour than that obtained with Ae. juvenalis 6 x. Tewo cultivar had a higher power and <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> than hybrid lines...|$|E
40|$|A {{trial with}} four maize inbred lines {{with the ability}} to have {{different}} durations <b>of</b> seed <b>germination</b> {{in the course of the}} accelerated ageing (AA) treatment was set up. Changes of the content of total, reduced and oxidized glutathione (expressed as monomers) were observed in the seeds and seedlings before and after the treatment. For the first time, changes of glutathione in whole seedlings, as well as in the rest of the seed, were analysed. It was noticed that maize inbreds with a smaller decrease of the total glutathione but with an increase of the oxidized form had the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> prolonged <b>germination.</b> In the control seedlings, the amount of total glutathione was lower than in the treated ones. Maize seeds which lost germination faster had greater losses of total glutathione with an increased content of the oxidized form in seedlings. The <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> prolonged <b>germination</b> together with the possibility of glutathione synthesis in seedlings are genotypic traits...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{understand}} the conditions promoting activation and <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> spores, and {{to contribute to}} the control of tempe starters. Methods and Results: Using microscopic counts of fluorescent labelled spores, the following results were obtained: (1) L- alanine plays an important role (of the same order as that of peptone) in stimulation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> dormant spores. Alanine can satisfy the requirements of carbon as well as nitrogen for spore germination; (2) L- proline, on the other hand, inhibits alanine uptake presumably by blocking/ congesting transporters of spore cells, resulting in apparent low viability on agar media; (3) L- leucine and L- isoleucine slightly favour spore germination while L- arginine and L- lysine do not have any stimulating effect; (4) The stimulatory role of glucose was only evident in the presence of phosphate (in minimal medium); when glucose is used in the absence of phosphate, either alone or in combination with single amino acids its role is hardly distinguishable; (5) Phosphate plays a facilitating role in spore germination. Conclusions: Glucose and amino acids play important roles in activation and <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> sporangiospores of Rhizopus oligosporus in tempe starter (stored for 12 months). The <b>ability</b> and rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> dormant/ old sporangiospores of R. oligosporus, depend on their <b>ability</b> for uptake <b>of</b> individual amino acids and/ or glucose. Significance and Impact of Study: New light was shed on the counteractive role of proline and the stimulating effect of phosphate. Soybeans subjected to traditional preparation for tempe making are heavily leached; <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> starter spores on such beans is sub- optimal, and bean processing could be optimized...|$|R
40|$|The {{restoration}} of the species composition of the meadow habitats is often linked {{to the introduction of}} the typical species’ seeds. The effectiveness of that treatment requires getting the acquired detailed knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>germination</b> biology <b>of</b> peculiar species. Eight typical plant species of four non-forest habitats of the river valleys, representing the following types: Cnidion dubii (6440), Molinion (6410), Arrhenatherion (6510) and Festuco-Brometea (6210) were investigated. The diasporas were collected in the years 2014 – 2015 on the meadows of PLH 140016 protection area near Mniszew (Kozienice county, Mazovian voivodeship). The <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> seeds’ <b>germination</b> in the laboratory conditions was studied. It was stated that Cnidion and Molinion meadows’ species require pre-chilling to break the seeds’ dormancy, while the Arrhenatherion meadows and xerotermophilous swards do not require such treatment. The Allium angulosum, Plantago lanceolata, Achillea millefolium and Eryngium planum were characterized by high vigour and germination capability as well as the low share of dead seeds. The extremely drought in 2015 caused the decreasing in germination capability and increasing in the dead seeds’ share. The preliminary studies, presented in this paper, show that Cnidion and Molinion meadows may be most difficult to restore because of the necessity of breaking the seeds’ dormancy and higher sensitiveness for the unfavourable weather conditions during the seed ripening stage. The studies have practical significance for the works connected with the floristic diversity’ increasing of threatened communities and the {{restoration of}} the destroyed meadow habitats...|$|R
40|$|Wheat seed is a {{very good}} medium for {{development}} of numerous saprophytes and parasitic fungi species that influence biological characteristics of seed and its value. The presence of fungi, especially parasitic species, causes some changes (colour changes, empty seed, spots, mould, deformation) in seed macroscopically visible. The most common agents are facultative parasites (Fusarium graminearum, Helminthosporium sativum, Septoria nodorum). They are believed to be extremely harmful since their influence on the essential seed functions are negative. The research was done on two wheat cultivars (Ţitarka and Demetra). Significant differences in micopopulation were registered at two points - immediately after harvesting and after seed storage - despite the used methods (filter paper, moist chamber, deep-freezing, germination in sand) and applied fungicides (Raxil 2 WS and Vitavax 200 FF). The most numerous micopopulation was established in non-treated seed after harvesting by freezing method. There were 9 fungi genera determined of which weretwo facultative parasites. All research done on treated seed showed that there was a smaller number of fungi species and the percentage of the infected seed was lower. Under the influence of Fusarium graminearum as well as other fungi species the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> was decreased. According to all used methodes both wheat cultivars seed treated with fungicides were chacarterized by a lower level of infection and better germination during both research periods.

40|$|Recently, the {{traditional}} formulations of essential food products are actively including malt – a valuable dietary product rich in extractives and hydrolytic enzymes, obtained by germination in artificially created conditions. Containing {{a full set}} of essential amino acids and a high saccharifying ability of malt, obtained from grain cereals, determines its wide use in the production of beer, alcohol, mono- and poly-malt extracts, bakery products, special types of flour, food additives, cereals, non-alcoholic beverages, lactic acid products and, in particular, in the production of natural coffee substitutes. However, the classical germination technology, which includes 2 - 3 days of soaking and 5 - 8 days of germination due to the considerable duration and laboriousness of the process, does not meet the requirements of modern technology and the constantly growing rates of industrial production, so this problem requires finding new and improving existing scientific and technical solutions. The features of malt production using organic acids of different concentrations are presented. The malt production technology has been analyzed and investigated. It includes washing, disinfection, air and water soaking of grains, germination and drying. The feature of the technology under investigation is using of aqueous solutions of butadiene, 3 -pyridinecarboxylic acid and pteroylglutamic acid. The results of the inquiry of the effect of these organic acids on energy and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> of the grain are presented. The optimal values of concentrations of active substances in solutions are revealed. The influence of organic acids on the absorption of grain moisture has been investigated. It has been established that in comparison with the classical technology, the use of these acids as a growth stimulator can reduce the overall length of the reproduction process of the material from 1. 5 to 2 times and increase the yield of flour grains in the batch of malt. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of Lithopanspermia {{investigations}} have been performed to investigate the ability of different organisms to resist scenarios of the natural interplanetary transfer of life from a donor planet (host planet) to an acceptor planet. Whereas {{the main focus of}} previous studies was on the resistance of bacteria and their colony forming capacity after space exposure, only a few experiments on eukaryotic microorganisms and especially on symbiotic organization forms such as lichens, have been performed in space (de la Torre et. al. 2007, Sancho et al. 2007). These experiments have concentrated on photosynthesis analysis as a first step to understand the maintenance of physiologic activity of eukaryotic organisms after exposure to space conditions. As a next step, physiologic activity, reproduction capacity and “healthy” cell structures as essential parts of vitality check were analyzed after the last ESA experiment on BIOPAN- 6 on Foton M 3. Besides the examination of photosynthetic activity determination by use of chlorophyll a-fluorescence, CLSM analysis by the use of LIVE/DEAD staining dyes and culture experiments for verification of germination and growth capacity of both of the lichen symbionts (alga and fungi), were performed. In this case, new results are now clearly emphasizing quantitatively the high survival capacity and maintenance of germination and growth capacity of both of the investigated symbionts which form the epilithic lichen species of Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, although they were exposed to harsh space conditions with an exposure time of 10 days. About 80 % to 90 % of ascospores of both of the analyzed lichens were able to germinate and to grow into well-developed mycelia. In detail: results of germination and growth capacity analysis of ascospores of the lichen X. elegans have shown no damage on growth behavior, if compared to the control analysis, differing only in the starting point of germination, which is about 1 to 2 days earlier than under control conditions (1 to 2 days after sporulation instead of 2 to 4 days). Results of analysis on ascospores of R. geographicum indicate an important role of desiccation for successful germination. Without the vacuum treatment in space, the control samples were not able to germinate. This implicates the necessity of very dry conditions for the break down of ascosporic cell walls to foster the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> what can be expected also in natural habitats (high mountain regions). Analyses on the growth multiplication factor of photobiont cells (alga) are indicating a higher degree of space influence on X. elegans. Photobiont cells of R. geographicum maintained their doubling rate of about 12 days compared to control conditions, whereas the doubling rate of photobiont cells of X. elegans was seriously affected after space exposure, showing a severe retardation (control conditions: doubling rate (d r) = 7 days, after space exposure: d r = 12 days) ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{includes}} {{research on}} the effect of ultrasound on the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> seed <b>germination</b> and coleoptile development of cereal landraces (fam. Poaceae) : oat (Avena sativa L.) brodski, rye (Secale cereale L.) rakotinska, Triticale svetinikolsko and soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) govrlevska. The experiment with ultrasound was carried out at frequency of 30 - 40 kHz on the thermostatic ultrasonic bath. Seeds were sonicated at a constant temperature (25 ºC) for 15 min. Ultrasound effect is reflected in the length of the coleoptyl and mesocotyl, although in a good deal is genetically predetermined. Coleoptile length was the longest in Triticale (3. 3 - 5. 5 cm) and approximately the same lengths are evident in rye (3. 0 - 6. 1 cm). Concerning the mesocotyl the longest one (5. 525 cm ± 0. 697) is recorded at rye, even significantly longer than control of oat and Triticale. Longer coleoptile of sonicated seeds indicates faster seedling development, good water supply and rapid development and emergence of first leaves. Correlation coefficient showed very high (0. 821) and high R 2 (67, 472 %) dependence among variables both, in length of coleoptiles (as dependent variable) and mesocotyl (as independent) with low standard error (0. 225).

Based on phenotypic features, strains E 31 and E 57 were identified as Bacillus cereus; E 76, E 93, E 102 and E 121 as Bacillus subtilis; and E 130 as Pseudomonas fluorescens bv. III. All bacterial strains inhibited mycelial growth of F. o. f. sp. dianthi by production of non-volatile and volatile metabolites under laboratory condition.

40|$|Ribes sardoum, {{the most}} {{threatened}} endemic plant of Sardinia, {{is included in}} the Habitats Directive (92 / 43 /EEC) and it was considered Critically Endangered in the global IUCN Red Lists. This species has been reported to have an extremely low fertility, scarce fruit production, low seed viability and a general inability to reproduce sexually. Fruits were collected for the first time from the remnant population, and the requirements for seed germination were investigated in the laboratory. Seeds were incubated at different temperatures (10, 15, and 20 °C) and, in addition, they were exposed to a warm stratification (W) or a move-along treatment characterized by three cold temperature regimes (CCC). Seeds were also sown on the surface of 1 % agar water with 250 mg·L− 1 of GA 3. At maturity, seeds have a linear underdeveloped embryo. Germination percentage between 35 % and 65 % were detected in the control and W groups. A low germination percentage occurred after CCC and during GA 3 treatment. W treatment speeds up seed germination. Our results demonstrate that fruits of R. sardoum produce viable seeds, that are able to germinate under controlled conditions, with the assumption that the seeds have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD), and that propagation from the seeds is possible. Although the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> seed <b>germination</b> was demonstrated, the lack of seedlings in the natural population seems to be a consequence of unfavourable climatic conditions for recruitment.

The levels of temperature including 10 oc (intense stress), 14 0 C (critical temperature) and 32 0 C (improving temperature, control) and levels of stress time 12, 24, 48 hours and cultivars of local Tarom, Domsiya, Hybrid, Nemat, Gerde, Unda were selected two by two based on quality of product and then performed in unit area and finally resistance against cold respectively. On the period <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> with decreasing temperature from 32 0 C to 14 0 C and from 14 0 C to 10 0 C, total decrease studied indices with exception of percentage of damage to seed are meaningful and similar reaction in recovery section <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> is obvious. In the period of seedling, we can see a meaningful decrease in significant level 1 % about of decreasing temperature of total stress, percentage of damage to seedling, vigour of seedling. By increasing temperature in the period <b>of</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> there is a meaningful increase level 1 % of total studied features with the exception of damage of seed. In the period <b>of</b> recovery <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> there is a meaningful increase in significant level 1 % of total studied features with the exception of damage to seed. In the period <b>of</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> there is a meaningful decrease at total features with the exception of sensitive to stress, percentage of damage to seedling and vigour of seedling and aceous recovery are similar in the period of seedling. By decreasing time of stress in the period <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> there is a meaningful decrease by percent of damage total features with exception <b>of</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> In the period <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> recovery, there is a meaningful increase in length if radicle, length of stem, percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and other features have meaningful decrease. In the period of seedling recovery, by decreasing time of stress, length of shoot, length of radicle, weight of wet, dry root and other features have meaningful increase. The effects of cultivar in total tests and stages, was significant level 1 %. The results show that, feature <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and length <b>of</b> stem and percentage of damage to seed in different cultivars are various. In the period of recovery, percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and percentage <b>of</b> damage to seeds, had correct criteria for selecting cultivars sensitive to cold stress. Low temperature can delay pitch and growth of transplant for more time. We can use height of shoot in rice as an index for determining of cultivars resistant to cold. According to these results, we decide precisely for re cultivate rice store or selecting to resistant cultivar by introducing Nemat cultivar in the period <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and hybrid cultivar in the period of seedling aceous as resistant cultivar during occurring stress of cold. </p...|$|R
40|$|Descriptive and {{quantitative}} {{observations of the}} plasmalemma and nuclear envelope of freeze-fractured root cells are reported for quiescent and early germinating maize embryos. The numerical density of particles exposed on the extracellular fracture faces of the plasmalemma increases significantly between 12 and 24 hr <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> while it remains unchanged on the protoplasmic fracture faces. The plasmalemma is significantly thicker after 24 hr <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> probably due partially to its enrichment in particles. Between 24 and 72 hr <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> {{there is a significant}} increase in the density of nucleopores. The fine structure of the nucleopores changes between 4 and 24 hr <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> The first 24 hr <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> are also characterized by a spectacular rise in the density of particles of the two nuclear membranes.

40|$|High-throughput {{analysis}} <b>of</b> seed <b>germination</b> for phenotyping large genetic populations or mutant collections is very {{labor intensive}} and would highly {{benefit from an}} automated setup. Although very often used, the total germination percentage after a nominated period of time is not very informative as it lacks information about start, rate, and uniformity <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> which are highly indicative of such traits as dormancy, stress tolerance, and seed longevity. The calculation <b>of</b> cumulative <b>germination</b> curves requires information about germination percentage at various time points. We developed the GERMINATOR package: a simple, highly cost-efficient, and flexible procedure for high-throughput automatic scoring and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> that can be implemented {{without the use of}} complex robotics. The GERMINATOR package contains three modules: (I) design of experimental setup with various options to replicate and randomize samples; (II) automatic scoring <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> based on the color contrast between the protruding radicle and seed coat on a single image; and (III) curve fitting <b>of</b> cumulative <b>germination</b> data and the extraction, recap, and visualization <b>of</b> the various <b>germination</b> parameters. GERMINATOR is a freely available package that allows the monitoring and analysis of several thousands <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> tests, several times a day by a single person. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effects of different pre-treatments on the <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> the seeds as well as the emergence velocity of the seedlings of Erythrina velutina and Erythrina falcata. The treatments utilized for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> were intact seeds (control); mechanical scarification with sandpaper number 120 in the opposite side of the embryo; and immersion in water at room temperature for 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours. Four replications of 25 seeds each were used per treatment and the experimental design was completely randomized, and the comparison among the averages was made using the Tukey test at 5 % of probability. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> the emergence velocity index and the relative frequency <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> were calculated 31 days after sowing. For both species, better percentages <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and values <b>of</b> emergence velocity were obtained with the mechanical scarification of seeds. That treatment was efficient in the uniformization and anticipation <b>of</b> the <b>germination</b> process. However, the tests done with seed immersion in water at room temperature for up to 48 hours do not increase the percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> E. velutina and E. falcata seeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} arsenate, arsenite, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, and {{anaerobiosis}} on early events in seed germination was investigated using both intact and punched seeds of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). It {{was found that}} punching the seed removes penetration barriers {{to the entrance of}} inhibitors without an undue loss <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> or light responses. The kinetics of the action <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> inhibitors were established by 2 -hour pulse experiments. Arsenate and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol have very different kinetics. The inhibition <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> in punched seeds by arsenate given in conjunction with phosphate compared with the lack of inhibition of arsenate plus phosphate on the growing seedling, suggest a distinct metabolic change in the germinating embryo at some time between the onset <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and subsequent seedling growth...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming {{bacterium}} that is {{the most}} common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea in developed countries. Control of C. difficile is challenging because the spores are resistant to killing by alcohol-based hand hygiene products, antimicrobial soaps, and most disinfectants. Although initiation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> has been shown to increase susceptibility of spores of other bacterial species to radiation and heat, it was not known if triggering <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> could be a useful strategy to increase susceptibility of C. difficile spores to radiation or other stressors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrated that exposure of dormant C. difficile spores to a germination solution containing amino acids, minerals, and taurocholic acid resulted in initiation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> in room air. <b>Germination</b> <b>of</b> spores in room air resulted in significantly enhanced killing by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation and heat. On surfaces in hospital rooms, application <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> solution resulted in enhanced eradication of spores by UV-C administered by an automated room decontamination device. Initiation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> under anaerobic, but not aerobic, conditions resulted in increased susceptibility to killing by ethanol, suggesting that exposure to oxygen might prevent spores from progressing fully to outgrowth. Stimulation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> also resulted in reduced survival of spores on surfaces in room air, possibly due to increased susceptibility to stressors such as oxygen and desiccation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that stimulation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> could represent a novel method to enhance killing of spores by UV-C, and suggest the possible application of this strategy as a means to enhance killing by other agents...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} chemical and physical factors on the rate and extent <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> Clostridium difficile spores. METHODS AND RESULTS: <b>Germination</b> <b>of</b> C. difficile spores following exposure to chemical and physical germinants was measured by loss of either heat or ethanol resistance. Sodium taurocholate and chenodeoxycholate initiated germination together with thioglycollate medium at concentrations of 0. 1 - 100 mmol l(- 1) and 10 - 100 mmol l(- 1) respectively. Glycine (0. 2 % w/v) was a co-factor required for germination with sodium taurocholate. There {{was no significant difference}} in the rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> C. difficile spores in aerobic and anaerobic conditions (P > 0. 05) however, the initial rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> was significantly increased at 37 degrees C compared to 20 degrees C (P < 0. 05). The optimum pH range for germination was 6. 5 - 7. 5, with a decreased rate and extent <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> occurring at pH 5. 5 and 8. 5. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that sodium taurocholate and chenodeoxycholate initiate <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> C. difficile spores and is concentration dependant. Temperature and pH influence the rate and extent <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This manuscript enhances the knowledge of the factors influencing the <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> C. difficile spores. This may be applied to the development of potential novel strategies for the prevention of C. difficile infection...|$|R
