SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the <b>abdominal</b> <b>aorta</b> and the superior mesenteric artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle.

40|$|Nondegradable {{synthetic}} polymer vascular grafts {{currently used}} in cardiovascular surgery have no growth potential. Tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) may solve this problem. In this study, {{we developed a}} TEVG using autologous bone marrow–derived cells (BMCs) and decellularized tissue matrices, and tested whether the TEVGs exhibit growth potential and vascular remodeling in vivo. Vascular smooth muscle–like cells and endothelial-like cells were differentiated from bone marrow mononuclear cells in vitro. TEVGs were fabricated by seeding these cells onto decellularized porcine <b>abdominal</b> <b>aortas</b> and implanted into the <b>abdominal</b> <b>aortas</b> of 4 -month-old, bone marrow donor pigs (n¼ 4). Eighteen weeks after implantation, the dimensions of TEVGs were measured and {{compared with those of}} native <b>abdominal</b> <b>aortas.</b> Expression of molecules associated with vascular remodeling was examined with reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay and immunohistochemistry. Eighteen weeks after implantation, all TEVGs were patent with no sign of thrombus formation, dilatation, or stenosis. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of the retrieved TEVGs revealed regeneration of endothelium and smooth muscle and the presence of collagen and elastin. The outer diameter of three of the four TEVGs increased in proportion to increases in body weight and outer native aorta diameter. Considerable extents of expression of molecules associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation (i. e., matrix metalloproteinase and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase) and ECM precursors (i. e., procollagen I, procollagen III, and tropoelastin) occurred in the TEVGs, indicating vascular remodeling associated with degradation of exogenous ECMs (implanted decellularized matrices) and synthesis of autologous ECMs. This study demonstrates that the TEVGs with autologous BMCs and decellularized tissue matrices exhibit growth potential and vascular remodeling in vivo of tissue-engineered artery.

Materials and methodsThis study used human abdominal aortic tissues with or without AAA as a research model. Aneurysmal <b>abdominal</b> <b>aortas</b> were collected from Chinese patients with AAA (n =  12) during open surgical aneurysmal repair at our institution, and normal control non-aneurysmal <b>abdominal</b> <b>aortas</b> were collected from Chinese healthy organ donors (n =  12) during organ transplantation.

40|$|AbstractConclusionThoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAAs) {{are characterized}} by significant molecular heterogeneity, suggesting different pathophysiologic mechanisms of aortic and thoracic aneurysm disease. SummaryThe authors compared patterns of gene expression in normal thoracic and <b>abdominal</b> <b>aortas</b> and in TAAs and AAAs. Aortic tissue was obtained during surgical repair of TAAs and infrarenal AAAs (n = 4 each). Normal thoracic and abdominal aortic control tissue was obtained from organ donors. Radiolabeled complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared for each specimen. This was hybridized to cDNA microarrays, and levels of gene expression were determined for each site. There were 1185 genes examined, with 112 genes differentially expressed between normal thoracic aorta and TAAs (P < 0. 05). In a comparison of infrarenal AAAs and normal <b>abdominal</b> <b>aortas,</b> 104 genes were differentially expressed. Quantitative increases in gene expression unique for TAAs occurred for 97 genes. Quantitative increases in gene expression that were unique for infrarenal AAAs occurred for 61 genes. Only four directionally concordant alterations in gene products occurred in both TAAs and infrarenal AAAs: matrix metalloproteinase 9 /gelatinase b, V-yes- 1 oncogene, mitogen-activated protein kinase 9, and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 /cd 54. CommentThe authors examined end-stage aneurysm tissue and compared it with normal control tissue. Differences in genetic expression delineated in this study may reflect age differences, changes resulting from aneurysm degeneration, and other factors that differ between patients and control subjects. It cannot be determined whether differential gene expressions represent cause or effect...|$|R
25|$|However, the {{degradation}} of the tunica media {{by means of a}} proteolytic process seems to be the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases in individuals with AAA. This leads to elimination of elastin from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of blood pressure. Other reports have suggested the serine protease granzyme B may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of decorin, leading to disrupted collagen organization and reduced tensile strength of the adventitia. There is also a reduced amount of vasa vasorum in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>aorta</b> (compared to the thoracic aorta); consequently, the tunica media must rely mostly on diffusion for nutrition, which makes it more susceptible to damage.|$|E
25|$|The transesophageal {{echocardiogram}} (TEE) is {{a relatively}} good test in the diagnosis of aortic dissection, with a sensitivity up to 98% and a specificity up to 97%. It has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected aortic dissection. It {{is a relatively}} noninvasive test, requiring the individual to swallow the echocardiography probe. It is especially good {{in the evaluation of}} AI in the setting of ascending aortic dissection, and to determine whether the ostia (origins) of the coronary arteries are involved. While many institutions give sedation during transesophageal echocardiography for added patient comfort, it can be performed in cooperative individuals without the use of sedation. Disadvantages of TEE include the inability to visualize the distal ascending aorta (the beginning of the aortic arch), and the descending <b>abdominal</b> <b>aorta</b> that lies below the stomach. A TEE may be technically difficult to perform in individuals with esophageal strictures or varices.|$|E

The assassin used a Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol, shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times. John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his mesenteric artery and <b>abdominal</b> <b>aorta,</b> he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds. Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal. When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation. One of the few people allowed in to see him at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery.
