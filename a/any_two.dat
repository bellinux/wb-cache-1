5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} {{data points}} in a metric space into two clusters is to choose the clusters {{in such a way}} as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between <b>any</b> <b>two</b> of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever <b>any</b> <b>two</b> points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E

5|$|The {{input to}} a {{clustering}} problem {{consists of a}} set of points. A cluster is any proper subset of the points, and a hierarchical clustering is a maximal family of clusters with the property that <b>any</b> <b>two</b> clusters in the family are either nested or disjoint.|$|E
5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining <b>any</b> <b>two</b> objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
5|$|A normal tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{for which}} every tile is topologically {{equivalent to a}} disk, the intersection of <b>any</b> <b>two</b> tiles is a single connected set or the empty set, and all tiles are uniformly bounded.

5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between <b>any</b> <b>two</b> pointers in the allocation model.|$|E

See classification of amplifiers. The objective for the feedback amplifier may be {{any one of the}} four types of amplifier and is not necessarily the same type as the open-loop amplifier, which itself may be any one of these types. So, for example, an op amp (voltage amplifier) can be arranged to make a current amplifier instead.|$|R
5|$|Gene flow {{involves}} {{the exchange of}} genes between populations and between species. The {{presence or absence of}} gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, <b>any</b> <b>two</b> completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner {{found out}} that the {{differences}} in properties between neodymium and samarium were the largest between <b>any</b> <b>two</b> consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them. This prediction was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87. With the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment.|$|E
5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is because, in a predecessor, <b>any</b> <b>two</b> consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice for the states of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no Garden of Eden in Rule 90, a configuration with no predecessors. The Rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this configuration is not a Garden of Eden because it does have predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes <b>any</b> <b>two</b> electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E
5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from pairs of points to pairs of clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between <b>any</b> <b>two</b> points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E
5|$|Players {{start off}} with 5 {{vehicles}}, and 5 more are unlockable; the vehicles available range from a Volkswagen New Beetle and a Ford F-350 to a city bus and a Freightliner Century truck. Unlocking vehicles requires completing goals such as placing within the top three of <b>any</b> <b>two</b> races. If the player has previously won a certain race mission, they can change the race's duration and the weather when replaying it. The Checkpoint mode allows players to also set the frequency of traffic, police cars, and pedestrians.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of these}} special cases are {{much easier to}} solve than the general case of three given circles. The two {{simplest}} cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by Euclid in his Elements. For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the perpendicular bisector line of <b>any</b> <b>two.</b> Hence, the center {{is the point of}} intersection of <b>any</b> <b>two</b> perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must lie on a line bisecting the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between <b>any</b> <b>two</b> courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between <b>any</b> <b>two</b> slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E
