5|$|On September 29, 2006, Monsoor's platoon engaged four {{insurgents in}} a firefight, killing one and {{injuring}} another. Anticipating further attacks, Monsoor, three SEAL snipers and three Iraqi Army soldiers {{took up a}} rooftop position. Civilians aiding the insurgents blocked off the streets, and a nearby mosque broadcast a message for people {{to fight against the}} Americans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> soldiers. Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet away from him. Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, the Republican Guard, the Fedayeen Saddam, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 750 CE, {{the last}} Umayyad caliph Marwan II was {{defeated}} by the Abbasid As-Saffah in the Battle of the Zab {{on the banks of}} the Khazir River, a tributary to the Great Zab. When the Mongols swept over Iraq in the 13th century and sacked Arbil, many survivors sought a refuge in the inaccessible valleys of the Great Zab. The Sapna Valley was home to both Christian and Muslim communities, as evidenced by Christian artefacts found at Zawi Chemi Shanidar. During the 19th century, the area was controlled by local Kurdish leaders. During World War I, heavy fighting took place in the area, and Rowanduz was pillaged by Russian soldiers in 1916. Following World War I, episodes of heavy fighting took place between the Barzani tribe – striving for the establishment of an independent Kurdish polity – and several other Kurdish tribes, and between the Barzanis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Government. The last of these uprisings started in 1974 and led to heavy bombardments of towns and villages in the Great Zab basin.|$|E

5|$|On 8 February 1963, the Iraqi Regional Branch, led by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, {{took power}} in Iraq by overthrowing Abd al-Karim Qasim. He {{was a far}} more {{formidable}} opponent than al-Kudsi, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Regional Branch managed to take power through an alliance not only with military officers, but also with segments of the middle class. Qasim's downfall changed the rules of Arab politics – the Nasserists had monopolised the Arab nationalist movement since the UAR, but the takeover made the Ba'ath Party {{a force to be}} reckoned with. In contrast to the Iraqi regional branch, the Syrian regional branch did not have mass support or a significant support base in the middle class. While Aflaq cautioned the plotters because of the party's lack of support, they failed to share his worries, and launched the coup on 7 March. However, that day the military intelligence raided the apartment where the plotters were planning to assemble. Assad was given the task of reporting to other units that the coup had been postponed to 8 March.|$|E

25|$|On April 30 Iraqi Army units {{took the}} high ground {{to the south of}} RAF Habbaniya. An Iraqi envoy was sent to demand that no movements, either ground or air, were to take place from the base.

25|$|In August 1921, the British {{installed}} Hashemite King Faisal I as {{the client}} {{ruler of the}} British Mandate of Iraq. Faisal had been forced out as the King of Syria by the French.

25|$|The Shia {{uprising}} in Karbala {{was one of}} many major points of unrest in Iraq following the Gulf War.

25|$|Before {{he entered}} the Baghdad Academy of Music, Al Saher's self-education through the radio {{had given him a}} firm {{grounding}} in the rich repertoire of mid-twentieth-century Arab vocal music.

50|$|Casey {{served as}} the senior {{coalition}} commander in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2007. He replaced Lieutenant General Ricardo S. Sanchez.

50|$|Beginning in 1923, British and Iraqi negotiators held acrimonious discussions {{over the}} new oil concession.
