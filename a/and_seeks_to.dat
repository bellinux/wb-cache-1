5|$|Crimson Echoes {{features}} all the playable {{characters of}} the original game, and is set {{five years after the}} events of Chrono Trigger. Crono and Marle are junior regents of the Kingdom of Guardia; Lucca continues her scientific endeavors. The three struggle to ease tensions with Porre, which has modernized its military <b>and</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> end Guardia's economic hegemony. Frog lives in 605A.D., restored to his human form, though this was not implemented before the cease and desist letter. Magus searches for Schala in the still-frozen 11,995B.C., and feuds with Dalton, obsessed with finding artifacts from the lost Kingdom of Zeal. Ayla dwells in 64,999,995B.C., and has given birth to her tribe's successor. Robo assists the Guru of Time Belthasar, who has established a clandestine temporal research facility named Chronopolis in 2305A.D. Belthasar claims it will be a guardian of time to ensure a threat such as Lavos will never arise. He nonetheless harbors darker wishes to leave a grand legacy in history, and is almost recklessly pragmatic. He fixes the Epoch during the story's course, which returns as the Neo-Epoch (akin to its design in Chrono Cross).|$|E

5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of logic that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data <b>and</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn is wet. But if it is raining, then it would be unsurprising that the lawn is wet. Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E

Ansem, still possessing Riku's body, tries to regain control of Riku, but Mickey's power keeps Ansem at bay. On the way, Riku battles and defeats Lexaeus, a member of Vexen's circle, only to be dragged into the realm of darkness. However, he is saved by King Mickey when Ansem nearly succeeds in taking Riku's body as his own.

5|$|In {{over half}} of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action. In the rest he played {{a wide range of}} characters, {{included}} doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players. Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career. In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (The Virginian). After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (A Farewell to Arms). During the height of his career, from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (Mr. Deeds, Meet John Doe, and For Whom the Bell Tolls). In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (The Fountainhead and High Noon). In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the violence of the past, <b>and</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> reclaim lost honor and find redemption (Friendly Persuasion and Man of the West). The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.|$|E
5|$|Their party expands {{to include}} Ayla and Frog after they visit the prehistoric era to repair Frog's sword.

In 12,000 BC, Crono and friends find that the Kingdom of Zeal recently discovered Lavos <b>and</b> <b>seeks</b> <b>to</b> drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine.

They travel back to Zeal for the Mammon Machine's activation at the Ocean Palace.
