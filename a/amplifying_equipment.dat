5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, the effectiveness of physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, the effectiveness of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be <b>amplified</b> by worn <b>equipment</b> of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|R

50|$|A {{wireless}} microphone is a microphone without a physical cable connecting it {{directly to the}} sound recording or <b>amplifying</b> <b>equipment</b> with which it is associated. Also known as a radio microphone, it has a small, battery-powered radio transmitter in the microphone body, which transmits the audio signal from the microphone by radio waves to a nearby receiver unit, which recovers the audio.

Wireless microphones are widely used in the entertainment industry, television broadcasting, and public speaking to allow public speakers, interviewers, performers, and entertainers to move about freely while using a microphone to amplify their voices.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{required}} to house electrical apparatus in pressure vessels capable of with-standing considerable pressure, either external or internal, {{and to make}} connection with such apparatus. For this purpose, electrical cables containing one or more insulated conductors must be passed through {{the walls of the}} vessel. This paper deals with glands forming the entry of such cables into the vessel. I t states the fundamental requirements of cable entry glands and gives a summary of the principles of construction employed. Experimental work is described which {{led to the development of}} two designs of gland. The first of these was developed specifically for the entry of submarine telecommunication cables into submerged repeaters containing electronic <b>amplifying</b> <b>equipment,</b> in particular the submerged repeaters used on the British section of the first transatlantic telephone cable system. Both manufacture and testing of these glands are reviewed. The second design dealt with is a simplification of the first, based on the experience gained. Some special operating conditions encountered are mentioned and the means of meeting the resulting additional requirements are discussed...|$|E
50|$|The STC {{number is}} derived from sound {{attenuation}} values tested at sixteen standard frequencies from 125 Hz to 4000 Hz. These Transmission Loss values are then plotted on a sound pressure level graph and the resulting curve is compared to a standard reference contour. Acoustical engineers fit these values to the appropriate TL Curve (or Transmission Loss) to determine an STC rating. The measurement is accurate for speech sounds, but much less so for <b>amplified</b> music, mechanical <b>equipment</b> noise, transportation noise, or any sound with substantial low-frequency energy below 125 Hz. Sometimes, acoustical labs will measure TL at frequencies below the normal STC boundary of 125 Hz, possibly down to 50 Hz or lower, thus giving additional valuable data to evaluate transmission loss at very low frequencies, such as a subwoofer-rich home theater system would produce. Alternatively, Outdoor-Indoor Transmission Class (OITC) is a standard used for indicating the rate of transmission of sound between outdoor and indoor spaces in a structure that considers frequencies down to 80 Hz (Aircraft/Rail/Truck traffic) and is weighted more to lower frequencies.|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes the}} operation of the Jamaican reggae dancehall sound system session as a popular cultural laboratory for understanding the biopolitics of sensation. The paper explores the sensorial apparatus (Agamben) or dispositif (Foucault) of the open-air street sound system session. This engineers the supra liminal excesses of sensorial experience in the biopolitical economies of pleasure that constitute thedancehall scene {{at the heart of the}} island’s popular culture. The set of <b>equipment</b> <b>amplifies</b> intensities and accentuates rhythmic patterning, thereby serving as a means of subjectification (Lazzarato, Guattari) under popular control, sustained on the margins of police and state hegemony. The sound system set of equipment produces tens of thousands of watts of music power that is subject to the engineers’ manipulation (a sonic knowledge developed over generations) to balance, fine-tune, spatialise and mix the audio frequencies. The sensory surfaces of the entire corporeal envelope of the bodies of the crowd operate in multi-sensory flux (Gibson), in parallel and synaesthetically, outside the conventional Aristotelian five-fold sensory hierarchy, as well as reciprocally (with leading and following dance moves) and antiphonically (between MC and crowd). The dancehall culture further configures the rhythmic dynamics of the session from dance choreography to nightly, weekly and seasonal patterns of activity. The biopolitics of this sensorial apparatus contrasts with that of Virtual Reality by configuring the actual embodied reality of the experience of affective intensities. In contrast with personalised digital monitoring technologies of the quantised self, those of the sound system configure a shared multi-sensory sociality...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the application of the technique of scintillation counting to the detection of gamma radiation. In counters of this type the scintillations produced in a luminescent medium are detected by means of a photo-multiplier tube and the electrical pulses at the output of the latter are amplified and counted electronically. An attempt is made to interpret the behaviour of such counters and to relate the observed counting rates to the physical processes occuring in the luminophor. Following a brief historical review of the scintillation counting technique, a theoretical analysis of the gamma scintillation counter is developed. This analysis describes how the number and energy distribution of the secondary electrons produced in a luminophor of known composition and dimensions subjected to a known flux of gamma radiation can be calculated. It shows that, providing the luminescent decay of the luminophor is rapid, each secondary electron will produce a single scintillation the intensity of which will be proportional to the energy of the electron. When the luminophor has a slow decay, on the other hand, this simple behaviour is not to be expected. The amplitude distribution of the resulting electrical pulses will be modified by statistical processes in the photo-multiplier tube, and by the resolving time of the <b>amplifying</b> and counting <b>equipment.</b> Experimental studies designed to test the validity of the theoretical analysis ore described. The first part of these studies is an investigation of the statistics of the type 1 P 21 photo-multiplier tube, stimulated by both continuous and pulsed light. The results of this investigation are in good accord with the theoretical predictions. The crystalline lumisophors investigated experimentally included calcium tungstate, thallium-activated potassium iodide, and thallium-activated sodium iodide. Following some preliminary studies on the effect of resolving time on counting rate, the absolute counting rates obtained when specimens of ench of these luminophors were irradiated under scatter-free conditions with the gamma radiation from sodium 24, cobalt 60, bromine 82, iodine 131 and gold 198 were measured. These rates were then compared with the calculated rates of production of secondary electrons in the media. In the case of calcium tunstate under appropriate conditions, good agreement between counting rate end rate of secondary electron production was obtained. In the alkali halide luminophors, on the other hand, counting rates were abnormally high because of their relatively slow phosphorescent decay. These findings were confirmed by the study of the pulse amplitude distributions obtained with the luminophors under various experimental conditions. Studies on the variation in luminescent efficiency with temperature of eaoh of these luminophors, and on the spectral distributions of the emitted light are also described. Comparative measurements on a large number of liquid luminescent systems were made, with particular reference to the variation in luminescent efficiency with concentration of solute. These variations are interpreted in terms of a general theory due to Johnson and Williams. The system p-terpheny 1 -benzene was selected for more detailed study and the absolute counting rates obtained in this medium when irradiated by the gamma rays from ench of the five radio-isotopes already mentioned were measured. When a correction is applied for the electrons scattered into the medium from the walls of the containing vessel, the observed rates are found to be in good agreement with the calculated rates of production of secondary electrons. It was observed {{in the course of the}} above studies that both pure liquids such as water and transparent solids such as Perspex luminesce under gamma irradiation, and this luminescence is shown to be often explicable in terms of the Cerenkov effect. Detailed studies of this effect in Perspex were carried out, and the angular distributions and relative intensities of the emission due to each of the radio-isotopes: sodium 24, cobalt 60, bromine 82 and iodine 131 were measured. Good agreement is obtained between the observed results and the classical theory due to Frank and Tamm for the effect. Finally, experimental studies made on the luminescent decay of a copper-activated zinc sulphide phosphor of long afterglow following excitation by gamma radiation from each of the five radio-isotopes mentioned are described. The decay is shown to be non-exponential in form, but provided that certain precautions are observed, the counting rate at a known time after irradiation can be related to the gamma radiation flux through the phosphor during the exposure. The thesis ends with a critical discussion of the experimental results and an assessment of their implications, together with some suggestions for future research in this field.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to integrated perspective, combining thermal environment with acoustic environmental studies {{to understand the}} environment and urban park complex relationship between park users. This study discuss during the hot season in different shading level under the distribution of urban parks user activity situation by using research method of observation records, and selecting indicators of PET and Leq, to the physical measurements of urban parks thermal and acoustic environment. Chiayi Park according to their size and level of urban parks belong to the park, and its non-holiday periods of high activity levels at 06 : 00 - 08 : 00 and 16 : 00 - 18 : 00, but mainly for the shaded area of activity space is is under the trees,and non-shaded area is the sport square. On the aspect of shading level, {{the total number of}} activities in shaded area number of activities 65. 90 %, compared with non-shaded area of more than 34. 10 %, while shaded area and unshaded area in the high-activity periods were less than the average PET low activity periods the average PET, and the average Leq in high activity periods generally higher than low activity. Because the unshaded area of the larger changes in thermal comfort, each time the amount of increase or decrease in the activity trend is also the largest and therefore the volume change of trend in the background shaded areas are more significant. This study further found that the measured distribution of urban parks user activity and thermal, acoustic environment relationship : In thermal comfort classes of cooler, comfortable, slightly warmer, which was positively correlated PET and Leq, and the PET Leq was negatively correlated with the situation. In thermal comfort classes of warm, hot, very hot, the PET Leq was negatively correlated with the situation, and which was positively correlated PET and Leq. Compared with usage behaviors at foreign parks, urban parks in Taiwan using <b>amplifying</b> <b>equipment</b> activities are specific. Thermal comfort studies in the past, activity density calculations in parks to be the investigated factor in thermal environment. However, this study had found in Leq measurement extra help to understand the user''s activity and the scale of activity of urban parks in different times. In addition, this study pointed out it is first element that changes in activity space of thermal comfort for the user to select active urban park space, and the second element was while the activity acoustic environment was affecting urban park space for user activity. 近年來由於環境發展議題的持續發酵，加上人類對於都市公園休閒與遊憩需求的提升，並有鑑於過去熱舒適與音環境的研究，對於戶外都市公園空間的研究甚少。本研究試圖以整合性的角度，結合熱環境與音環境的研究，了解都市公園內環境與都市公園使用者之間的複雜關係。 本研究透過觀察紀錄研究法以及都市公園熱、音環境物理量測，選定熱環境量測指標PET與音環境量測指標Leq，探討熱季期間在不同空間遮蔽程度下，都市公園使用者活動分佈情形。嘉義公園依其規模與等級屬於都市公園中的綜合公園，其非假日之高活動量時段在 06 : 00 - 08 : 00 與 16 : 00 - 18 : 00 之間，而主要活動空間為陰影區之樹下空間與非陰影區之運動廣場空間。 在遮蔽程度方面，陰影區活動人數佔總活動人數 65. 90 %，較非陰影區之 34. 10 %多，而陰影區與非陰影區在高活動量時段下的平均PET均小於低活動量時段下的平均PET，而高活動量的平均Leq普遍大於低活動量的平均Leq，又由於非陰影區的熱舒適性變動較大，其每時段增減之活動量變化趨勢也最大，因此背景音量增減的趨勢也較陰影區顯著。整體而言，都市公園使用者與熱、音環境的關聯上，熱環境影響都市公園使用者活動分布，而都市公園使用者活動類型則影響音環境之構成。本研究由量測結果發現都市公園使用者活動分布與熱、音環境間的四種關係,分別為： 1. 較舒適(稍涼、舒適、稍暖) 熱舒適尺度下，其PET與Leq呈正相關情形 2. 較舒適(稍涼、舒適、稍暖) 熱舒適尺度下，其PET與Leq呈負相關情形。 3. 較不舒適(溫暖、熱、非常熱) 熱舒適尺度下，其PET與Leq呈正相關情形 4. 較不舒適(溫暖、熱、非常熱) 熱舒適尺度下，其PET與Leq呈負相關情形 相較於國外公園綠地多為在草地上休憩、曬日光浴等使用行為，台灣地區都市公園使用擴音設備進行活動是較特別且少見的情形。在過去熱舒適相關研究中，關於都市公園使用率、活動強度的計算，多以人數作為熱環境活動分布的調查因子之一，然而在本研究中發現Leq的量測可額外幫助了解不同時段都市公園使用者活動分佈，與都市公園使用者活動規模。此外，本研究也進一步活動空間之熱舒適變化，為都市公園使用者選擇活動空間的第一要件，而活動音環境則是影響都市公園使用者活動空間推移的第二要件。誌謝 [...] i 摘要 [...] iii Abstract [...] . iv 章節目錄 [...] . v 表目錄 [...] vi 圖目錄 [...] viii 照片目錄 [...] x 【第一章 緒論】 第一節 研究動機與目的 [...] . 1 第二節 研究流程 [...] 2 【第二章 文獻回顧】 第一節 都市公園及遮蔽程度 [...] 4 第二節 都市公園使用者活動型態 [...] . 5 第三節 都市公園熱環境 [...] . 8 第四節 都市公園音環境 [...] . 12 【第三章 研究方法】 第一節 研究問題 [...] 17 第二節 研究地點之選定及背景資料 [...] 17 第三節 都市公園測點之選定與及背景資料 [...] . 26 第四節 實地量測方法 [...] 35 【第四章 都市公園使用者活動分佈與熱、音環境量測結果】 第一節 都市公園熱、音環境量測結果 [...] . 41 第二節 都市公園使用者活動型態之熱、音環境量測結果 [...] . 53 【第五章 都市公園遮蔽程度、活動量及熱、音環境之關係】 第一節 都市公園使用者活動量與熱、音環境物理量測結果說明 [...] 64 第二節 都市公園熱、音環境因子之關係 [...] . 66 第三節 公園空間遮蔽程度與熱、音環境因子關係 [...] 76 第四節 活動量與公園熱、音環境因子關係 [...] 	 82 【第六章 結論與建議】 第一節 結論 [...] 87 第二節 建議 [...] 90 【參考文獻】 中文部分 [...] 93 英文部分 [...] 95 日文部分 [...] 96 網路資料 [...] 9...|$|E
