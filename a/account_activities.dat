Shared information referenced from object graphs that reside in other databases and resolution {{of that information}} is transparent at runtime. For example, several physical databases may hold user information models that are partitioned by account number holding aggregations on <b>account</b> <b>activities</b> such as trades and then have some more databases holding actual trade models and these users and trades can be related. A query across all of the user databases and return a user (or set of users), then as messages are sent to user objects involving trades, the trade models will automatically be resolved across the distribution. After updates of any of those objects, at commit time Versant will ensure that all changes commit back to their respective physical nodes in a completely ACID 2phase commit process.|$|E

The proposals {{are expected to have}} a working plan and the approval of the maintainers in charge of the projects involved. To help reaching consensus, the release team may guide the discussions to increase the community participation, make sure that all major concerns from developers are raised and addressed, minimize potential conflicts between proposals and long term plan, and keep under control new dependencies. Because of the lack power over developers, the release team must rely on their social skills and technical merits before taking decisions that may be controversial within the ecosystem (see Section 4.5. 1); however, the diversity of backgrounds among release team members is useful to understand and better address the variety of projects and teams within the ecosystem.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of asymmetric information {{has always been}} a major concern for financial institutions. Financial intermediaries such as commercial banks need to study the quality of potential borrowers in order to make their decision on corporate loans. Classical methods model the default probability by financial ratios using the logistic regression. As one of the major commercial banks in France, we have access to the the <b>account</b> <b>activities</b> of corporate clients. We show that this transactional data outperforms classical financial ratios in predicting the default event. As the new data reflects the real time status of cash flow, this result confirms our intuition that liquidity {{plays an important role in}} the phenomenon of default. Moreover, the two data sets are supplementary to each other to a certain extent: the merged data has a better prediction power than each individual data. We have adopted some advanced machine learning methods and analyzed their characteristics. The correct use of these methods helps us to acquire a deeper understanding of the role of central factors in the phenomenon of default, such as credit line violations and cash inflows...|$|E
40|$|Any {{organization}} that develops software strives {{to improve the}} quality of its products. To do this first requires an understanding of the quality of the current product version. Then, by iteratively making changes, the software can be improved with subsequent versions. But this must be done in a systematic and methodical way, and, for this purpose, we have developed a specific strategy called SIQinU (Strategy for understanding and Improving Quality in Use). SIQinU recognizes problems of quality in use through evaluation of a real system-in-use situation and proposes product improvements by understanding and making changes to the product’s attributes. Then, reevaluating quality in use of the new version, improvement gains can be gauged along with the changes that led to those improvements. SIQinU aligns with GOCAME (Goal-Oriented Context-Aware Measurement and Evaluation), a multipurpose generic strategy previously developed for measurement and evaluation, which utilizes a conceptual framework (with ontological base), a process, and methods and tools. Since defining SIQinU relies on numerous phase and activity definitions, in this paper, we model different process views, for example, taking into <b>account</b> <b>activities,</b> interdependencies, artifacts, and roles, while illustrating them with excerpts from a real-case study...|$|E

40|$|The {{ingestion}} {{rate and}} the resulting assimilation calculated {{by means of a}} law taking into <b>account</b> <b>activities</b> of the digestive enzymes (amylase and trypsin) on the carbohydrates and proteins ingested, are determined in two experiments on Artemia. They are fed the same species of phytoplankton (Tetraselmis suecica), at the same concentration but with two chemical compositions. In one experiment, the cells are rich in carbohydrates and poor in proteins, and in the second one they are poor in carbohydrates, rich in proteins. Different observed ingestion rates induce a balance in proteins, and a large difference in the carbohydrates ingested. When digestive enzymes are taken into account, the assimilated carbohydrates and proteins are similar (explaining the similitude of the growth rate observed). The assimilation yield study shows that digestive enzymes induce a better digestion of chemical compounds in low concentrations in the food. That could correspond to a regulation of assimilation as a function of requirements of Artemia. Requirements would be the first interna 1 factor that regulates the nutritional behavior. So two processes are possible for Artemia to obtain the sufficient quantity of food: regulation of ingestion rate, probably depending also on olfactory mechanisms, and regulation of assimilation by the way of digestive enzymes. The importance of these processes is discussed as a function of environmental conditions. -...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the links between revenue {{management}} and business‐to‐business (B 2 B) relationships and explains how revenue management can both support and damage B 2 B relationships. Design/methodology/approach – A single case study method {{was employed to conduct}} qualitative research into a company and its key accounts. In‐depth data were collected from three divergent sources (company revenue managers, company account managers and nine of the company's key accounts) through semi‐structured interviews, observations and document studies. Findings – The research findings reveal that from the company's perspective, managers acknowledge that revenue management has positively influenced the process of identifying and analysing key <b>account</b> <b>activities</b> and conducting contractual decision making with key accounts. However, from the key accounts' perspective, revenue management practices were found to have significant negative consequences which damage trust and undermine long‐term relationships and commitment. Research limitations/implications – Although the research findings cannot be generalised to other service sectors because of the single‐case study research method, the implications {{of this study suggest that}} the impact of revenue management practice on B 2 B relationships should be further investigated in a wide range of organisational and industry settings. Practical implications – The research findings confirm the long‐held assumption that revenue management can negatively affect B 2 B relationships. The benefits of revenue management primarily reward the company, whilst long‐term B 2 B relationship development suffers from the short‐term consequences of the company's opportunistic behaviour. Originality/value – This paper bridges the gap in the literature between revenue management and key account management. It also explores the conceptual incompatibility between revenue management and a long‐term relational approach to B 2 B relationships and provides evidence to support this proposition...|$|E
40|$|Audits {{have been}} present since the Egyptian and Roman Empires in {{relation}} to the principal-agency relationship. Corporate governance {{is the way in which}} those managing an organisation (the agents) carry out their responsibilities towards their stakeholders (the principal). Agency problems mainly due to wealth maximization of agents result in agency costs detrimental to the principal. Internal audit acts as a monitoring mechanism within the organisation. Poor corporate governance has pointed to the ineffectiveness of internal audits to report on possible mismanagement, thus failing to give indications for preventive measures to be taken in due course by the management and stakeholders. World disasters like Enron, WorldCom and HIH group are classical cases in recent times. This calls for a measurement on the effectiveness of internal audits. The purpose of this research is to measure the effectiveness of internal audits conducted by internal auditors. The data were collected by way of questionnaire survey sent to internal auditors in Malaysian public institutions of higher learning and corporate members of the Institute of Internal Auditors Malaysia. The study considers the internal audit activities from the planning stage to the follow-up of reported audit findings. Best practices in internal auditing have been reviewed taking into <b>account</b> <b>activities</b> within the audit process cycle. Results suggest that the effectiveness of the internal audit can be measured by using a performance index and the indicators used provide reasonable insight into the internal audit activities assessed. The significant of deriving at an internal audit index may serve as a benchmark of best practices in internal audit. The internal audit activities assessed in this study give some indication of areas for improvement to be considered in the management of the internal audit function. It is the novelty of this unidimensional measurement method where it can be further applied to all other institutions of higher learning to determine the effectiveness of their internal audit, hence useful for national benchmarking purposes...|$|E

SMEs performance on the other hand can be measured (in addition to others) in terms of profitability (Malhorta, 1997; Carney, 1997; and Goldstein, 1999). In terms of theoretical backing, several researchers have adopted the core competency theory which emphasized the outsourcing of functions which are outside of a firm’s core area of operation. This is also true for SMEs for due to their minimal resource base, especially in developing countries like Nigeria, these organizations turn to source for knowledge and expertise of outsiders who are not on their payroll.
