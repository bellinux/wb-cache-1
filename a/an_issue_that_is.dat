25|$|I think {{global warming}} is <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and {{a symptom of the}} shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force. When things are going wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world. I think this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global implications.|$|E

According to archaeologist W. F. Grimes, it was Merrifield's [...] "work in and about London [...] an honoured place in British Archaeology". In Ronald Hutton's introduction for Physical Evidence for Ritual Acts, Sorcery and Witchcraft in Christian Britain, edited by him and published in 2016, he referenced a work from 2012 by Roberta Gilchrist, who noted then [...] "a stubborn reluctance to address [...] phenomenon [...] in relation to later medieval archaeology". Hutton noted further that, [...] "when a top-ranking scholar like Gilchrist expresses concern about <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a sign in itself that it is emerging into greater prominence."

2500|$|The 23(a) {{criteria}} {{are referred to}} as numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. Numerosity refers to {{the number of people in}} the class. To be certified, the class has to have enough members that simply adding each of them as a named party to the lawsuit would be impractical. There is no bright-line rule to determine numerosity, but classes with hundreds of members are generally deemed to be sufficiently numerous. To satisfy commonality, there must be a common question of law and fact such that [...] "determination of its truth or falsity will resolve <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke." [...] The typicality requirement ensures that the claims or defenses of the named plaintiff are typical of those of everyone else in the class. [...] Finally, adequacy requirement states that the named plaintiff must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the absent class members.|$|E
2500|$|In the West, some {{elements}} of determinism {{seem to have been}} expressed by the Presocratics Heraclitus and Leucippus. The first full-fledged notion of determinism appears to originate with the Stoics, as part of their theory of universal causal determinism. The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom, <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> known in theology as the paradox of free will. The writings of Epictetus as well as Middle Platonist and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development. The Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god: [...] "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [...] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…" ...|$|E
2500|$|Jacobs' book {{advances}} {{the view}} that Quebec's eventual independence is best for Montreal, Toronto, the rest of Canada, and the world; and that such independence can be achieved peacefully. As precedent, she cites Norway's secession from Sweden and how it enriched both nations. The origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the Quiet Revolution are examined, along with Canada’s historical reliance on natural resources and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own economic development. Jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward, citing by example Canada buying its skis and furniture from Norway or Norwegian-owned factories in Canada, the latter procedure being a product of Canadian tariffs designed specifically to foster such factories. The relevant public views of René Lévesque, Claude Ryan, and then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau are also critically analyzed, an example being their failure to recognize that two respective, independent currencies {{are essential to the}} success of an independent Quebec and a smaller resultant Canada, <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> central to her book. Jacobs stresses the need for Montreal to continue developing its leadership of Québécois culture, but that such a need can ultimately never be fulfilled by Montreal's increasing tendencies toward regional-city status, tendencies foretelling economic, political, and cultural subservience to English-speaking Toronto. Such an outcome, Jacobs believed, would in the long run doom Quebec's independence as much as it would hinder Canada's own future. She concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure {{is the result of the}} Enlightenment, which perceived nature as a force for [...] "standardization, uniformity, universality, and immutability." [...] Since then, naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity, and that, [...] "diversity itself is of the essence of excellence." [...] The right kind of secession, Jacobs states, can lead to the right kind of diversity, and Quebec and Canada are capable of both, and must achieve both, to survive.|$|E

2500|$|Diet was <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> often {{discussed}} {{through this}} time, as {{an aspect of}} medical care. [...] Since our idea of modern technology did not exist, diet was a simple way for Romans to attain a healthy life. [...] This remains true in the Roman Military as the soldiers required appropriate nutrition in order to function at high activity levels. Because {{of the number of}} the people requiring food, there were unique circumstances in the acquisition of food. [...] During a campaign the soldiers would often forage food from their enemies land. [...] In fact as part of the standard kit, Roman soldiers would carry a sickle, which would be used to forage food. [...] They would carry a three-day ration of food in case they were in a situation where foraging was not available. [...] This would largely consist of items such as wheat and barley. [...] During a time of peace, the Roman Army would have had a typical diet consisting of bacon, cheese, vegetables, and beer to drink. Corn is mentioned in their works as well, however; this was a [...] common term that was applied to their use of grain. [...] The Roman use of the term corn is {{not to be confused with}} maize, which did not come to Europe until the discovery of the New World. [...] Items such as poultry and fish were also likely part of the standard diet. [...] The soldier was given a ration, which was taken from his pay. [...] This shows that the soldiers were well fed in times of peace. [...] If the soldiers were well fed, they were healthier and able to maintain a high level of physical activity, as well as stave off disease. [...] Disease is something that is easier to prevent rather than treat. [...] This idea holds true in the event a fort was under siege; certain food items were rationed such as poultry. [...] The reasoning behind this was that poultry was very inexpensive to maintain and in the event of a siege it did not require a lot of resources to maintain. [...] It was also noted that poultry had benefits for those who were sick. [...] This demonstrates the idea was present that the army needed to maintain the health of its members regardless of circumstances. [...] These discoveries were made while looking at the remains of Roman military sites. [...] By excavating these sites and looking at fecal matter found, scientists were able to determine what was eaten. [...] It is a simple fact that poor diet negatively affects a military's combat readiness. [...] The variety of food found shows the Romans were not focused on just caloric intake, as they knew a variety of food was important to health.|$|E
