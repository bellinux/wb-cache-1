5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Baggio's {{former manager}} at Juventus, Marcello Lippi, was {{appointed}} as Inter's new coach. Lippi did not favour Baggio <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> {{out of the}} squad {{for most of the}} season, stating Baggio was out of shape. In his autobiography, Baggio stated Lippi had dumped him after Baggio refused to point out which of Inter's players had expressed negative opinions about the coach, also highlighting an incident during a training session where he called out Christian Vieri and Christian Panucci for applauding Baggio for a notable assist.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Salih's {{head was}} sent to Cairo and put on display, while Salih's body was nailed to the gateway of Sidon, a town he had enjoyed {{residing}} in. The Fatimids went on to conquer Sidon, Ba'albak, Hims, Rafaniyya and Hisn Ibn Akkar from Salih's deputy governors, who all fled. Salih had designated his second eldest son, Thimal, as his successor <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> in charge of Aleppo. However, his eldest son, Nasr, who fought at al-Uqhuwanah, escaped the battle to wrest control of Aleppo. For a brief period, the two sons ruled Aleppo jointly with Nasr controlling the city and Thimal the citadel, until sometime in 1030 when Nasr compelled Thimal to relocate to al-Rahba. In 1038, Anushtakin killed Nasr and seized Aleppo. Thimal later restored Mirdasid rule in the city, which continued, with occasional interruption, until 1080.|$|E
5|$|Another {{knee injury}} ended his 2008–09 season after 75 games <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> {{unavailable}} for the playoffs. He expressed his frustrations with coach Mike Keenan, {{who was fired}} by the team after failing to advance past {{the first round of}} the playoffs, criticizing Keenan's lack of structure and expressing optimism for the team's chances under a new coach. After failing to score a goal in 2008–09 and the first half of the 2009–10 season, Regehr scored his first goal in 141 games on January 18, 2010, against the San Jose Sharks. He finished with 2 goals and 17 points that season and matched those totals in 2010–11. Upon playing his 804th game late in the season, Regehr surpassed Al MacInnis as the team's all-time leader in games played by a defenceman.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} of his career as a {{director}} Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Darrin, {{a shallow}} New York {{advertising}} executive, traveled {{to a small}} town in the deep south upon receiving word that his aunt has died <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> a sizable inheritance. Once in town, Darrin is informed that he will only receive the money if he successfully leads a local gospel group to victory at an upcoming competition. Reluctant but strapped for cash, Darrin takes on the task of finding the best singers in town and shaping the group up. Along the way, he becomes acclimated to the town {{with the help of his}} cousin Lucius (played by Mike Epps) and meets Lilly, a single mother who not only possesses an incredible voice but also the ability to warm Darrin's cold heart.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his deformities, {{at some point during}} his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> permanently lame. Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an engine driver at a cotton factory, as well as running a haberdashery business. On 29 May 1873, less than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.|$|E

5|$|In the World Championships 200 m, Bolt cruised {{through to}} the final which he won {{in a time of}} 19.40. Though this was short of his world record times of the two {{previous}} major tournaments, it was the fourth fastest run ever at that point, after his own records and Michael Johnson's former record, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> three tenths of a second ahead of runner-up Walter Dix. This achievement made Bolt one of only two men to win consecutive 200m world titles, alongside Calvin Smith. Bolt closed the championships with another gold with Jamaica in the 4 × 100 metres relay. Nesta Carter and Michael Frater joined world champions Bolt and Blake to set a world record time of 37.04.|$|E
5|$|Named {{after the}} South American mammal, Kinkajou was the younger {{half-sister}} of Mozart and appeared sporadically throughout the programme. In the first series, a teenage Kinkajou took {{her younger brother}} Mitch from the burrow <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> alone in the desert after she got bored with watching him. She became a more reliable babysitter as she grew older, but followed in her mother Flower's footsteps with an unauthorised pregnancy in the second series. As Kinkajou was evicted between {{the second and third}} series, it remains unanswered how she was reunited with her sisters Mozart and De la Soul.|$|E
5|$|Raúl Alfonsín was the {{president}} of Argentina from 1983 to 1989. He died on March 31, 2009, aged 82. He had lung cancer and died at his home; a massive candlelight vigil took place in the vicinity of it. Vice president Julio Cobos, the acting president at the time, arranged three days of national mourning and a state funeral at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Alfonsín was seen by 40,000 people and the senior politicians of the country; people from other countries also voiced their respect for him. A military escort took his coffin to the La Recoleta Cemetery, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> at the pantheon for the veterans of the Revolution of the Park.|$|E

5|$|The sinking smack was {{abandoned}} by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered {{that he should be}} thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> where he lay. He died in his son's arms a few minutes later. It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him. The Ethel & Millie had just arrived on the scene as the Nelson sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for Nelson's lifeboat to come alongside. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink.|$|E
5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away with it as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{was born}} and raised in Longview, Texas. He {{attended}} Navarro Junior College and was selected by the Texas Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft. Davis ascended quickly through the Rangers' minor league system, getting named their Minor League Player of the Year in 2007. He was called up in the middle of 2008 and had a strong start to his major league career. He was the Rangers' starting first baseman for 92 games in 2009 and hit 21 home runs, but a low batting average and a tendency to strike out left the Rangers dissatisfied with him. Because of this, the Rangers sent Davis back and forth between the minors and the majors over the next two years <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> off their playoff roster in 2010. On July 30, 2011, they traded him to the Baltimore Orioles with Tommy Hunter for Koji Uehara.|$|E

5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the {{residents}} living in the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In previous episodes, Mike Delfino (James Denton) learns {{that he is the}} biological father of Zach Young (Cody Kasch), whose adopted parents, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) and Paul (Mark Moses), killed Mike's previous girlfriend and Zach's biological mother years earlier. Mike kidnapped Paul <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> stranded in the desert while Zach holds Mike's current girlfriend, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) hostage as part of his plan to kill Mike. Tom Scavo (Doug Savant) quit his job and decided to become a stay-at-home father, forcing his wife, Lynette (Felicity Huffman) to reenter the work force. Gabrielle Solis's (Eva Longoria) affair with her teenage gardener, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe), is exposed just as she discovers she is pregnant and her husband, Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira), is sentenced to time in prison. Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross) learned that her husband, Rex (Steven Culp), died while awaiting surgery. Also, Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and her son, Matthew (Mehcad Brooks), moved to Wisteria Lane.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{a visionary}} who {{produced}} designs and ideas {{far ahead of}} their time. He {{was the first to}} describe vapor-compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805, but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example. Similarly, he drew up designs for a solar boiler, machine gun, steam-carriage gearshift, dough-kneading machine, perpetual baking oven, marine salvage process, quadruple-effect evaporator, and a scheme for urban gas lighting, ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death. Evans had influential backers and political allies, but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers. Disappointed and then angry at the perceived lack of recognition for his contributions, Evans became combative and bitter in later years, which damaged his reputation <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> isolated. Despite the importance of his work, his contributions were frequently overlooked (or attributed to others after his death) so he never became a household name alongside the other steam pioneers of his era.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} {{served in}} the Virginia House of Delegates and as a presidential elector, the aging Scott now ran for governor. His 1808 campaign was skillfully managed by his step-son-in-law, Jesse Bledsoe, and he won a convincing victory over John Allen and Green Clay. A fall on the icy steps of the governor's mansion early in his term confined Scott to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> heavily reliant on Bledsoe, whom he appointed Secretary of State. Although he frequently clashed with the state legislature over domestic matters, the primary concern of his administration was the increasing tension between the United States and Great Britain that eventually led to the War of 1812. Scott's decision to appoint William Henry Harrison as brevet major general in the Kentucky militia, although probably in violation of the state constitution as Harrison was not a resident of the state, was nonetheless praised by the state's citizens. After his term expired, Scott returned to his Canewood estate. His health declined rapidly, and he died on October 22, 1813. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, as are the cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Richard is {{the prince}} of Windor who befriends Asbel and Sophie after his visit to Lhant. Before meeting Asbel, Richard has a strong {{distrust}} in others due to others using his status for their own gain and his uncle Cedric's attempts to murder him. When Cedric poisoned <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> {{to die in the}} underground passage, Lambda saves his life by fusing with him. Seven years later, Lambda's influence causes Richard to become violent and urges him to destroy humanity by fusing with the Lastalia. After separating from Lambda, Richard is determined to atone for his crimes which causes his popularity to soar in all three countries. He is voiced by Yuko Sanpei as a child and Daisuke Namikawa as an adult. In the English dub, he is voiced by Wendee Lee as a child and David Vincent as an adult. Since his debut, Richard has ranked on the Tales character popularity polls.|$|E
5|$|Thanjavur was {{successfully}} conquered in 1674 by Ekoji I (1675–84), the Maratha feudatory of {{the sultan of}} Bijapur and half-brother of Shivaji (1627/30-80) of the Bhonsle dynasty. Ekoji founded the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom which ruled Thanjavur till 1855. The Marathas exercised their sovereignty over Thanjavur throughout {{the last quarter of}} the 17th and the whole of the 18th century. The Maratha rulers patronized Carnatic music. In 1787, Amar Singh, the regent of Thanjavur, deposed the minor Raja, his nephew Serfoji II (1787–93) and captured the throne. Serfoji II was restored in 1799 with the assistance of the British, who induced him to relinquish the administration of the kingdom <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> in charge of Thanjavur fort and surrounding areas. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the Doctrine of Lapse when Shivaji II (1832–55), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died without a legitimate male heir. The British referred to the city as Tanjore in their records. Five years after its annexation, the British replaced Negapatam (modern-day Nagapattinam) with Thanjavur as the seat of the district administration. Under the British, Thanjavur emerged as an important regional centre. The 1871 India census recorded a population of 52,171, making Thanjavur the third largest city in the Madras Presidency. After India's independence, Thanjavur continued as the district headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>him</b> with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E
