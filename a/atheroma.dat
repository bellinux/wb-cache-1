25|$|Because artery walls enlarge at {{locations}} with <b>atheroma,</b> detecting <b>atheroma</b> {{before death}} and autopsy {{has long been}} problematic at best.

40|$|Ablation {{of human}} <b>atheromas</b> with laser pulses that {{had only a}} small effect on normal artery tissue was shown in vitro in air and under saline using 1 -mu sec pulses at 465 nm from a flashlamp-excited dye laser. At this wavelength, there is {{preferential}} absorption in <b>atheromas</b> due to carotenoids. The threshold fluence for ablation was 6. 8 +/- 2. 0 J/cm 2 for <b>atheromas</b> and 15. 9 +/- 2. 2 J/cm 2 for normal aorta tissue. At a fluence of 18 J/cm 2 per pulse, the ablated mass per unit of energy ranged from 161 to 370 micrograms/J for <b>atheromas</b> and from 50 to 74 micrograms/J for normal aorta tissue. Ablation products consisted of cholesterol crystals, shredded collagen fibers, and small bits of calcific material. Most debris was less than 100 micron in diameter, but a few pieces were as large as 300 micron. High-speed photography of ablation in air suggested explosive ejection of debris, caused by vapor formation, at speeds {{on the scale of}} 300 m/sec. Histological analysis showed minimal thermal damage to residual tissue. These data indicate that selective laser ablation of <b>atheromas</b> is possible in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{analysis}} of the extracellular matrix of human aortas was per-formed on samples of ascending and descending aortas affected by atherosclero-sis in comparison with a control group of nonatherosclerotic aortas. Ulcerated or heavily calcified <b>atheromas</b> were excised and excluded from the analysis in order to differentiate biochemical alterations leading to the forma-tion of <b>atheromas</b> from those due to complications of already formed athero-mas.

25|$|Angiography, {{since the}} 1960s, {{has been the}} {{traditional}} way of evaluating for <b>atheroma.</b> However, angiography is only motion or still images of dye mixed with the blood with the arterial lumen and never show atheroma; the wall of arteries, including <b>atheroma</b> with the arterial wall remain invisible. The limited exception to this rule is that with very advanced <b>atheroma,</b> with extensive calcification within the wall, a halo-like ring of radiodensity {{can be seen in}} most older humans, especially when arterial lumens are visualized end-on. On cine-floro, cardiologists and radiologists typically look for these calcification shadows to recognize arteries before they inject any contrast agent during angiograms.|$|E
25|$|Levels of {{arterial}} pressure put mechanical {{stress on the}} arterial walls. Higher pressures increase heart workload and progression of unhealthy tissue growth (<b>atheroma)</b> that develops {{within the walls of}} arteries. The higher the pressure, the more stress that is present and the more <b>atheroma</b> tend to progress and the heart muscle tends to thicken, enlarge and become weaker over time.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{understanding}} what drives <b>atheroma</b> development is complex with multiple factors involved, {{only some of}} which, such as lipoproteins, more importantly lipoprotein subclass analysis, blood sugar levels and hypertension are best known and researched. More recently, some of the complex immune system patterns that promote, or inhibit, the inherent inflammatory macrophage triggering processes involved in <b>atheroma</b> progression are slowly being better elucidated in animal models of atherosclerosis.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose— Severely stenotic, {{symptomatic}} carotid <b>atheromas</b> {{are associated}} with a high risk of stroke in the short term. Although carotid endarterectomy is effective in reducing this stroke risk, it is frequently not applied within the time window for significant benefit.

40|$|This paper reports what is {{apparently}} the first observation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae {{in association with}} Chlamydia pneumoniae in thrombosed ruptured <b>atheromas.</b> We performed electron microscopy and in situ hybridization in specimens from three patients who died of acute myocardial infarction. These patients had typical symptoms of acute ischemic syndrome. Mycoplasmas were present mainly in the lipid core of the ruptured thrombosed plaque. Vulnerable <b>atheromas</b> are rich in cholesterol and may favor the growth of mycoplasmas, the only microorganisms that require cholesterol for survival. We suggest that the association of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae may increase the virulence of these microorganisms, favoring proliferation, plaque inflammation and possibly plaque rupture...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT About {{one-half}} of infants {{in the first}} 6 mo of life have small collections of macrophages and macrophages filled with lipid droplets (foam cells) in susceptible segments of the coronary arteries. In subsequent years, fewer children have foam cells but around puberty (12 – 15 y) foam cell accumula-tions mostly larger than those in infants occur in 69 % of ado-lescents. Lesions that represent the previously missing link between foam cell accumulations and <b>atheromas</b> have now been identified in a subgroup of highly susceptible locations. Such “preatheroma ” lesions contain small pools of lipid droplets and dead cell remnants (extracellular lipid) in addition to macro-phage foam cells. <b>Atheromas,</b> which emerge in some adoles-cents and young adults in the same locations, have a lipid core in which increased extracellular lipid displaces structural smooth muscle cells and the normal extracellular matrix. As soon as lipid cores form, calcium granules appear in some smooth muscle cells and among the extracellular lipid of the core. The degree of calcification is variable and, in youth, gen-erally small. In {{the age group of}} 16 – 19 y, 15 % of persons have either preatheromas or <b>atheromas</b> in coronary arteries; foam cell accumulations only are present in an additional 53 % of 16 – 19 -y-olds. Because the lipid cores of <b>atheromas</b> may be an underly-ing cause of lesion rupture, hematomas, and thrombosis, and because their development begins soon after puberty, it would be prudent to attempt to lower the influx of excessive athero-genic lipoproteins into the arterial wall by that age.

25|$|These capped fatty {{deposits}} (now called 'atheromas') produce {{enzymes that}} cause the artery to enlarge over time. As long as the artery enlarges sufficiently {{to compensate for the}} extra thickness of the <b>atheroma,</b> then no narrowing ("stenosis") of the opening ("lumen") occurs. The artery becomes expanded with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a circular opening. If the enlargement is beyond proportion to the <b>atheroma</b> thickness, then an aneurysm is created.|$|E

25|$|If {{the muscular}} wall {{enlargement}} eventually fails {{to keep up}} with the enlargement of the <b>atheroma</b> volume, or a clot forms and organizes over the plaque, then the lumen of the artery becomes narrowed as a result of repeated ruptures, clots & fibrosis over the tissues separating the <b>atheroma</b> from the blood stream. This narrowing becomes more common after decades of living, increasingly more common after people are in their 30s to 40s.|$|E

40|$|A-disintegrin-and-metalloproteinase-domains (ADAMs) are membrane-anchored glycoproteins {{involved}} in cell adhesion, cell migration and proteolysis. ADAM 15 has {{been implicated in}} atherosclerosis, with an effect on vascular smooth muscle cell migration. We investigated whether ADAM 33, which is evolutionally closely related to ADAM 15, was expressed in <b>atheromas</b> and whether it {{had an effect on}} vascular smooth muscle migration. We also tested whether ADAM 33 gene variation had an influence on the extent of atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery disease. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that ADAM 33 was expressed in smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall and that the expression was increased in smooth muscle cells in <b>atheromas.</b> ADAM 33 immunostaining on inflammatory cells in <b>atheromas</b> was also observed. Primary vascular smooth muscle cells in culture were also found to express ADAM 33. Boyden chamber assays showed that a neutralising antibody against ADAM 33 increased the ability of arterial smooth muscle cells to migrate through a reconstituted basement membrane, suggesting that ADAM 33 has an inhibitory effect on vascular smooth muscle migration. Moreover, we detected an association between ADAM 33 genotype and the extent of atherosclerosis in a large cohort of coronary artery disease patients. These findings suggest that ADAM 33 is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis...|$|R

25|$|An <b>atheroma</b> is an {{accumulation}} of degenerative material in the inner layer of an artery wall. The material consists of mostly macrophage cells, or debris, containing lipids, calcium and a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue. The accumulated material forms a swelling in the artery wall, which may intrude into the channel of the artery, narrowing it and restricting blood flow. <b>Atheroma</b> occurs in atherosclerosis, {{which is one of}} the three subtypes of arteriosclerosis (which are atherosclerosis, Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis).|$|E
40|$|Panoramic {{radiography}} {{is a basic}} {{diagnostic tool}} in the dental field where calcifications are seen occasionally in the lateral parts of the x-ray. The differential diagnosis are carotid artery <b>atheromas,</b> calcified submandibular lymphnodes and sialoliths of the submandibular gland. 4007 panoramic radiographs (100 %) from patients < 40 years were scanned retrospectively. Special emphasis {{was given to the}} carotid artery territory (CAT). 225 soft tissue calcifications were found (5. 6 %). 144 patients had calcifications in the CAT (3. 6 %), 73 showed calcified submandibular lymphnodes (1. 8 %), and 8 (0. 2 %) sialoliths. The female to male ratio was 54. 7 %: 45. 3 %. Pneumatic diseases were beside hypertension and smoking a risk factor for CAT calcification.

40|$|Plaque {{angiogenesis}} {{promotes the}} growth of <b>atheromas,</b> but the functions of plaque capillaries are not fully determined. Neovascularization may act as a conduit for the entry of leukocytes into sites of chronic inflammation. We observe vasa vasorum density correlates highly with the extent of inflammatory cells, not the size of <b>atheromas</b> in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. We show atherosclerotic aortas contain activities that promote angiogenesis. The angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin reduces plaque angiogenesis and inhibits atherosclerosis. Macrophages in the plaque and around vasa vasorum are reduced, but we detect no direct effect of angiostatin on monocytes. After angiogenesis blockade in vivo, the angiogenic potential of atherosclerotic tissue is suppressed. Activated macrophages stimulate angiogenesis that can further recruit inflammatory cells and more angiogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that late-stage inhibition of angiogenesis can interrupt this positive feedback cycle. Inhibition of plaque angiogenesis and the secondary reduction of macrophages may have beneficial effects on plaque stability...|$|R

25|$|Though not {{the focus}} of the test, {{calcification}} within the artery walls, located in the outer edges of <b>atheroma</b> within the artery walls, is sometimes recognizable on fluoroscopy (without contrast injection) as radiodense halo rings partially encircling, and separated from the blood filled lumen by the interceding radiolucent <b>atheroma</b> tissue and endothelial lining. Calcification, even though usually present, is usually only visible when quite advanced and calcified sections of the artery wall happen to be viewed on end tangentially through multiple rings of calcification, so as to create enough radiodensity to be visible on fluoroscopy.|$|E
25|$|If the fibrous cap {{separating}} a soft <b>atheroma</b> {{from the}} bloodstream within the artery ruptures, tissue fragments are exposed and released. These tissue fragments are very clot-promoting, containing collagen and tissue factor; they activate platelets and activate {{the system of}} coagulation. The result is {{the formation of a}} thrombus (blood clot) overlying the <b>atheroma,</b> which obstructs blood flow acutely. With the obstruction of blood flow, downstream tissues are starved of oxygen and nutrients. If this is the myocardium (heart muscle) angina (cardiac chest pain) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) develops.|$|E
25|$|The older {{methods for}} {{understanding}} <b>atheroma,</b> dating to before World War II, relied on autopsy data. Autopsy data has long shown initiation of fatty streaks in later childhood with slow asymptomatic progression over decades.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{research}} projects have further determined the prevalence rate of these <b>atheromas</b> {{in the general}} population (3-5%) and among high-risk groups (over 25% in: recent stroke victims, individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, postmenopausal women, type 2 diabetics, individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy, and among individuals who have received radiotherapy directed at the neck,).

50|$|Atherosclerosis is {{attributed}} to risk factors that include cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (high blood pressure). These factors, however, do not fully account for the risk of disease. Atherosclerosis has been conceptualized as a chronic inflammatory response to endothelial cell injury and dysfunction possibly arising from chronic dental infection. In 2010, using the previously validated Mattila panoramic radiographic index to quantify the totality of dental infection (i.e., periapical and furcal lesions, pericoronitis sites, carious tooth roots, teeth with pulpal caries, and vertical bony defects), Friedlander’s group determined that individuals with carotid artery <b>atheromas</b> on their panoramic radiographs had significantly greater amounts of dental infection/inflammation than atherogenic risk-matched controls devoid of radiographic <b>atheromas.</b> While the Mattila index had been previously used to relate the extent of dental infection to coronary artery disease, this research {{is the first to}} link the full range of dental disease that it measures to panoramic radiographs evidencing calcified carotid artery atherosclerosis.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAtherosclerotic lesions of the {{thoracic}} aorta {{have recently been}} recognized as an important cause of stroke and peripheral embolization, which may result in severe neurologic damage as well as multiorgan failure and death. Their prevalence is ∼ 27 % in patients with previous embolic events. Transesophageal echocardiography is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of these <b>atheromas,</b> although computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound are complementary. Two clinical syndromes account for the embolic phenomena, atheroemboli and, more commonly, thromboemboli. In addition to such superimposed thrombi, plaque thickness (especially ≥ 4 mm) also correlates with embolic risk. This risk is high, with 12 % of patients having a recurrent stroke within approximately one year, and up to 33 % of patients having a stroke or peripheral embolus. In addition, aortic <b>atheromas</b> (as seen with intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound) are an important cause of stroke during heart surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Such strokes occur during ∼ 12 % of cardiac operations employing cardiopulmonary bypass when aortic arch <b>atheromas</b> are seen with transesophageal echocardiography (six times the general intraoperative stroke rate). Although anticoagulant strategies have been reported with encouraging results in nonrandomized studies, prospective, randomized data must be developed before an effective and safe treatment strategy can be determined. This review details {{the current state of}} knowledge in this area, including the clinical and pathologic evidence that thoracic aortic atherosclerosis is an important embolic source, data which guide current therapy and future directions for clinical investigation...|$|R
25|$|For most people, {{the first}} {{symptoms}} result from <b>atheroma</b> progression within the heart arteries, most commonly {{resulting in a}} heart attack and ensuing debility. However, the heart arteries, because (a) they are small (from about 5mm down to microscopic), (b) they are hidden deep within the chest and (c) they never stop moving, have been a difficult target organ to track, especially clinically in individuals who are still asymptomatic. Additionally, all mass-applied clinical strategies focus on both (a) minimal cost and (b) the overall safety of the procedure. Therefore, existing diagnostic strategies for detecting <b>atheroma</b> and tracking response to treatment have been extremely limited. The methods most commonly relied upon, patient symptoms and cardiac stress testing, do not detect any symptoms of the problem until atheromatous disease is very advanced because arteries enlarge, not constrict in response to increasing <b>atheroma.</b> It is plaque ruptures, producing debris and clots which obstruct blood flow downstream, sometimes also locally (as seen on angiograms), which reduce/stop blood flow. Yet these events occur suddenly and are not revealed in advance by either stress testing, stress tests or angiograms.|$|E
25|$|In effect, {{the muscular}} {{portion of the}} artery wall forms small aneurysms just {{large enough to hold}} the <b>atheroma</b> that are present. The muscular portion of artery walls usually remain strong, even after they have remodeled to {{compensate}} for the atheromatous plaques.|$|E
25|$|However, {{clinical}} trials {{have shown that}} only about 14% of clinically debilitating events occur at sites with more than 75% stenosis. The majority of cardiovascular events that involve sudden rupture of the <b>atheroma</b> plaque do not display any evident narrowing of the lumen.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study of the carotenoid content of human aortic atherosclerosis it was concluded by Blankenhorn, Freiman, and Knowles that these dietary lipids accumulate {{in direct proportion to}} the extent and relative age of the lesions in which they occur. A series of graded aortic segments was assayed, and it was found that increased severity of atherosclerosis was accompanied by a parallel increase in the concentration of carote-noids (1). Exact location of these pigments in relation to the microscopic anatomy of athero-sclerotic lesions should aid in evaluation of the role of exogenous lipids of this class in the initiation of <b>atheromas</b> and their continued growth. It seemed possible that this might be accomplished by fluor-escence microscopy, since carotenoids and vitamin A, on exposure to ultraviolet light, produce a characteristic pale green fluorescence by which they can be exactly localized and roughly quanti-tated in tissue sections (2). Although Popper (2), and Hamperl (3), who performed surveys of the fluorescence in human tissue, reported no evidence of carotenoids or vitamin A in <b>atheromas,</b> it was decided to reinvestigate this matter in view of the findings of Blankenhorn, Freiman, and Knowles. The surveys of Popper and Hamperl were performed on tissues fixed in formalin, a pro-cedure known to diminish the fluorescence of car-otenoids and vitamin A. Therefore, in the study here reported unfixed <b>atheromas</b> were examined. Green fluorescence was found and evidence will be presented to show that this fluorescence is a valid means of localizing carotenoids and/or 'Supported in part by grants-in-aid from the America...|$|R
