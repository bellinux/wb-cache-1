5000|$|The Association {{was formed}} in March 1969 by {{residents}} of Carlton and neighbouring Carlton North, in order to mobilise opposition to the Housing Commission of Victoria's (HCV) plans to redevelop large tracts of the two suburbs under its program of slum clearance. The HCV had long considered much of the housing stock of the inner suburbs of Melbourne to be unfit for habitation. [...] The Commission’s modus operandi involved the compulsory <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> in a designated block, the wholesale demolition of these, and construction of high-rise flats of public housing. The commission flats, as they are known to locals, feature prominently in the skyline of Melbourne’s inner suburbs to this day. [...] The first such complex of high-rise Commission flats in Carlton, announced in 1957, was constructed in the block bordered by Lygon, Rathdowne, Princes and Neill Streets. Despite vocal protests by residents whose houses were ‘reclaimed’ {{to make way for}} this development, the response from the Commission to these and other voices of opposition was invariably that ‘broader community goals must take preference over individual interests’.|$|E

40|$|Households buy life {{insurance}} {{as part of}} their liquidity management. The option to surrender such a policy can serve as a buffer when a household faces a liquidity need. In this study, we investigate empirically which individual and household specific sociodemographic factors influence the surrender behavior of {{life insurance}} policyholders. Based on the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), an ongoing wide-ranging representative longitudinal study of around 11, 000 private households in Germany, we construct a proxy to identify life insurance surrender in the data. We use this proxy to conduct fixed effect regressions and support the results with survival analyses. We find that life events that possibly impose a liquidity shock to the household, such as birth of a child and divorce increase the likelihood to surrender an existing life insurance policy for an average household in the panel. The <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> a <b>dwelling</b> and unemployment are further aspects that can foster life insurance surrender. Our results are robust with respect to different models and hold conditioning on region specific trends; they vary however for different age groups. Our analyses contribute to the existing literature supporting the emergency fund hypothesis. The findings obtained in this study can help life insurers and regulators to detect and understand industry specific challenges of the demographic change...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with examining the origin {{and development of the}} social and spatial inequalities in the provision of urban housing in Peninsular Malaysia. This is done within a theoretical framework which stresses the need to understand the forces that have moulded the Malaysian space economy. Conventional housing provision is analysed using data on the activities of private development firms, which like other modern capitalist activity, are spatially and structurally concentrated. The conventional sector builds mainly high cost dwellings which the urban poor cannot afford and, despite an increasing quantity of cheaper accommodation provided by the public sector, the bulk of the poor search for alternatives in the unconventional sector. Unconventional housing, built outside the formal regulation and standards of the modern sector, is found in most Malaysian cities, where it has evolved since the early 1900 s. Despite the importance of unconventional housing in many cities, government policy has been concerned with its clearance and eradication and has been based on a misunderstanding of the processes inherent in the development of these shelter types. The third part of the study examines in detail the construction and <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> squatter <b>dwellings</b> {{and the manner in which}} low income families accumulate capital which is invested in the development and improvement of such housing. Although squatter settlements do permit such activities to occur, they are not a vehicle for socio-economic mobility for all low income households because of the constraints of the urban political economy. ...|$|R
