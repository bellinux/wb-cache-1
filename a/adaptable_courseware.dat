A predictive agent is defined as a system that is able to predict the expected effectiveness of various composable products from current product attributes. The described research addresses the questions of how to acquire the necessary knowledge for a predictive agent, how to organize this knowledge, and how to link it with methods and tools for courseware authoring and adaptation. We propose to use a methodology, derived from the field of machine learning, and present a framework for applying inductive knowledge acquisition based upon the empirical evaluation of <b>adaptable</b> <b>courseware</b> products...|$|E

Areas of applications are modular courseware documents and the collaborative authoring process of didactical units. A number of requirements for a suitable document format are identified. After comparing existing solutions, TeachML, an XML based document format for <b>adaptable</b> <b>courseware</b> documents and reusable didactical units, is introduced. The paper describes how courseware documents can be adapted to the learner's previous knowledge, aims, and infrastructure. Then the process of creating different output documents from a TeachML source is explained. Considerations about the development process of learning material within a professional publishing environment are outlined, leading to the necessity of a virtual repository for storing courseware documents and media assets. (Contains 17 references.) (AEF) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document...|$|E

The intention of this innovative technology is to have such repositories to collect a database of learning objects catalogued by the learning content management system. However, for users to perform an efficient search, these learning objects would need to use metadata standards or specifications to describe their properties. For learning objects stored within the repositories, metadata standards are often used to descibe them so users of the respositories are able to find the accurate resources they required, hence metadata standards are important elements of any learning object repository. In this paper, a courseware example is used to demonstrate how to define a set of characteristics that we want to describe for our courseware, and attempt to map the data schema in the database with the available metadata standards. The outcome is to identify a set of metadata elements that would fully describe our learning objects stored within the learning object repository, and these metadata elements will also assist instructors to create <b>adaptable</b> <b>courseware</b> that can be reused by different instructors. Metadata standard is known as a critical element for the management of learning objects, not only will it increase the accuracy of the search results, it will also provide more relevant and descriptive information about the learning objects to the searchers...|$|E
