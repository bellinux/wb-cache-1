50|$|Fuchsia tissue {{becomes so}} {{distorted}} {{as a result}} of gall mite infestation that affected plants fail to produce normal growth and flowers, which seriously impacts their horticultural amenity value. The mites are resistant to chemical treatments, because once symptoms are visible, the mites have already entered leaf and flower buds, which afford them protection. Products that contain <b>abamectin</b> or spirodiclofen provide some control, though repeated applications at four-day intervals may be necessary to break the mite life cycle. Insecticidal soap and horticultural oils can also be used, and acephate may provide control on susceptible Fuchsia cultivars. Some mites can be removed from plants by cutting off distorted tissue, though regrowth is likely to be recolonised. Trials in California showed that the best control was achieved by combining the removal of tissue with pesticide application. The options for biological control are also limited, though the predatory mite Amblyseius californicus might depress fuchsia gall mite populations.|$|E
40|$|Nematode parasites may be {{controlled}} with drugs, but their regular application {{has given rise}} to concerns about the development of resistance. Drug combinations may be more effective than single drugs and delay the onset of resistance. A combination of the nicotinic antagonist, derquantel, and the macrocyclic lactone, <b>abamectin,</b> has been found to have synergistic anthelmintic effects against gastro-intestinal nematode parasites. We have observed in previous contraction and electrophysiological experiments that derquantel is a potent selective antagonist of nematode parasite muscle nicotinic receptors; and that <b>abamectin</b> is an inhibitor of the same nicotinic receptors. To explore these inhibitory effects further, we expressed muscle nicotinic receptors of the nodular worm, Oesophagostomum dentatum (Ode-UNC- 29 :Ode-UNC- 63 :Ode-UNC- 38), in Xenopus oocytes under voltage-clamp and tested effects of <b>abamectin</b> on pyrantel and acetylcholine responses. The receptors were antagonized by 0. 03 μM <b>abamectin</b> in a non-competitive manner (reduced Rmax, no change in EC 50). This antagonism increased when <b>abamectin</b> was increased to 0. 1 μM. However, when we increased the concentration of <b>abamectin</b> further to 0. 3 μM, 1 μM or 10 μM, we found that the antagonism decreased and was less than with 0. 1 μM <b>abamectin.</b> The bi-phasic effects of <b>abamectin</b> suggest that <b>abamectin</b> acts at two allosteric sites: one high affinity negative allosteric (NAM) site causing antagonism, and another lower affinity positive allosteric (PAM) site causing a reduction in antagonism. We also tested the effects of 0. 1 μM derquantel alone and in combination with 0. 3 μM <b>abamectin.</b> We found that derquantel on these receptors, like <b>abamectin,</b> acted as a non-competitive antagonist, and that the combination of derquantel and <b>abamectin</b> produced greater inhibition. These observations confirm the antagonistic effects of <b>abamectin</b> on nematode nicotinic receptors in addition to GluCl effects, and illustrate more complex effects of macrocyclic lactones that may be exploited in combinations with other anthelmintics...|$|E

40|$|O ácaro Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes, 1939) (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) é importante em cafeeiro (Coffea spp.), por ser o vetor do vírus da mancha-anular, responsável por queda de folhas e má qualidade da bebida do café, e o ácaro-vermelho, Oligonychus ilicis (McGregor, 1917) (Acari: Tetranychidae), por reduzir a área foliar de fotossíntese. Alguns ácaros da família Phytoseiidae são eficientes predadores associados aos ácaros-praga. Com este trabalho teve-se como objetivo estudar o controle dos ácaros-praga e o impacto do <b>abamectin</b> e {{emamectin}} sobre fitoseídeos. Em laboratório, foram estudados os efeitos ovicida, tópico, residual, tópico mais residual aos ácaros-praga e a seletividade fisiológica aos fitoseídeos. Em semicampo, foi estudada a persistência dos produtos no controle dos ácaros-praga. O efeito ovicida foi avaliado em ovos no início e fim de incubação; os efeitos residual, tópico e tópico mais residual foram avaliados pela mortalidade de larvas, ninfas e adultos após 48 horas da aplicação, enquanto a persistência foi avaliada pela mortalidade até 30 dias após a pulverização. A seletividade aos ácaros fitoseídeos foi avaliada pelo efeito total às fêmeas adultas, em teste residual em superfície de vidro. Pelos resultados, verificou-se que <b>abamectin</b> e emamectin não possuem ação ovicida, para ambas as espécies de ácaros-praga estudadas. Considerando o efeito tópico mais residual, o <b>abamectin</b> e emamectin foram altamente eficientes no controle de larvas, ninfas e adultos de B. phoenicis; apenas <b>abamectin</b> foi eficiente no controle de O. ilicis. <b>Abamectin</b> foi levemente a moderadamente nocivo e emamectin mostrou-se inócuo a levemente nocivo aos fitoseídeos. Devido à eficiência de controle e seletividade a fitoseídeos, conclui-se que <b>abamectin</b> e emamectin podem ser utilizados em programas de manejo integrado do ácaro B. phoenicis, e <b>abamectin</b> para o {{manejo de}} B. phoenicis e O. ilicis em cafeeiro.

The red spider mite, Oligonychus ilicis (McGregor, 1917) (Acari: Tetranychidae) is also important, for reducing the areas of photosynthesis in leaves. Some mites of the family Phytoseiidae are efficient predators associated to the pest-mites. This work had as objective to study the control of the pest-mites and the impact of the <b>abamectin</b> and emamectin on phytoseiids. Studies were carried out in laboratory to investigate the ovicidal, topical, residual, topical plus residual effects of the products on the pest-mites and the physiologic selectivity to the phytoseiids. The persistence of the products in the control of pest-mite was studied in semi-field conditions. The ovicidal effect was evaluated in eggs in {{the beginning and end of}} incubation; the residual, topical and topical plus residual effects on larvae, nymphs and adults were assessed through mortality evaluation 48 h after spraying, while the persistence was evaluated until 30 days after spraying. The phytoseiids selectivity was evaluated by the total effect in adult females, in residual test in glass surface. The results showed that <b>abamectin</b> and emamectin do not possess ovicidal action, in both pest-mite species studied. Considering the topical plus residual effect, the <b>abamectin</b> and emamectin was highly efficient in the control of larvae, nymphs and adults of the B. phoenicis; only the <b>abamectin</b> was efficient for O. ilicis control. <b>Abamectin</b> was slightly and moderately noxious and emamectin was shown to be innocuous and slightly noxious to the phytoseiids. Due to efficiency presented in the pest-mites control, and selectivity to the phytoseiids, it is concluded that <b>abamectin</b> and emamectin can be used in integrated pest management programs of B. phoenicis, and <b>abamectin</b> for the management of B. phoenicis and O. ilicis in coffee trees...|$|E
40|$|On 18 farms for rose {{culture in}} {{greenhouses}} in The Netherlands dermal exposure of hands and forearms to <b>abamectin,</b> dodemorph and bupirimate during crop activities has been measured. Furthermore, dermal exposure of hands and forearms to <b>abamectin</b> and dodemorph during application by high-volume spraying has been measured. Dermal exposure to <b>abamectin,</b> dodemorph and bupirimate during cutting by 75 workers in total is respectively 13 microg/h, 1. 8 mg/h and 2. 2 mg/h (geometric mean; activity ingredient). During sorting and bundling of roses by respectively 21 and 30 workers, dermal exposure to <b>abamectin</b> and dodemorph is 18 microg/h and 1. 9 mg/h. An indicative prevalence of handeczema of 14 % {{was found in}} 50 workers using a validated questionnaire and an additional interview. A health risk evaluation of the observed levels of dermal exposure after re-entry of greenhouses leads {{to the conclusion that}} a health risk may exist, especially after high application doses of relatively toxic pesticides with good skin penetrating properties...|$|E
40|$|Acaricides may {{interfere}} with a myriad of interactions among arthropods, particularly predator?prey interactions. The coconut mite, Aceria guerreronis Keifer (Acari: Eriophyidae), and its phytoseiid predator, Neoseiulus baraki (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), {{provide an opportunity to}} explore such interference because the former is a key coconut pest species that requires both predation and acaricide application for its management. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the effect of the acaricides <b>abamectin,</b> azadirachtin and fenpyroximate on the functional response of N. baraki to A. guerreronis densities. The following prey densities were tested: 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 preys. The type of functional response and prey handling time (Th) were not altered by the acaricides. However, the attack rate (a 0) was modified by <b>abamectin</b> and fenpyroximate, and the consumption peak was reduced by <b>abamectin.</b> All of the acaricides allowed for the maintenance of the predator in the field, but exposure to <b>abamectin</b> and fenpyroximate compromised prey consumption. 201...|$|E
