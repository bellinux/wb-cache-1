5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{visits a}} Seattle hospital {{to pick up}} his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher), who works there as a counsellor. Rothenburg is brought in on a stretcher by paramedics. Black notices a peculiar slash <b>across</b> <b>her</b> palm, and glances down at his own, which bears a scar matching the woman's cut exactly. Rothenburg then dies of her injuries.|$|E
5|$|Some time afterwards, as Ervine is {{wandering}} through the woods she stumbles upon a deer and, startled, faints. Adolf comes <b>across</b> <b>her</b> and brings {{her back to the}} plantation, where van Kempen recognises him and takes him on as a supervisor. Frederick, however, is jealous of Adolf and Ervine's relationship and entices the workers at van Kempen's plantation to go on strike until Adolf is fired. Although heartbroken, van Kempen must fire his son.|$|E

5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls <b>across</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and down <b>across</b> <b>her</b> arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, <b>across</b> <b>her</b> hair and on her mantle.|$|E
5|$|Dean deduces John's {{message was}} {{coordinates}} {{to where he}} has headed. Sam still {{does not want to}} join the search, so Dean drops him off at his apartment. Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica pinned to the ceiling with a slash <b>across</b> <b>her</b> stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt to put out the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica.|$|E

5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with her legs outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting <b>across</b> <b>her</b> legs rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|Ianto {{returns to}} the {{basement}} and is devastated to find Lisa dead. He then sees the delivery girl, who has a large cut <b>across</b> <b>her</b> forehead; Lisa implanted her brain into the delivery girl. At first reluctant, Ianto aims his gun at her, but cannot bring himself to shoot her. The girl tries to explain she did this for Ianto, but then promises {{that they can be}} upgraded together. The rest of the Torchwood team, arriving to hear that, open fire and kill her, leaving Ianto to mourn.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 in Lawrence, Kansas, Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) investigates a sound {{coming from}} her infant son Sam's nursery. She sees a figure {{standing}} over his crib, and confronts him. Her husband, John (Morgan), is awoken by her screams and finds her pinned to the ceiling with a slash <b>across</b> <b>her</b> stomach.

5|$|On March 13, 2015 DC Comics {{released}} 25 Joker-themed variant {{covers for}} its various monthly series for release that June, {{in celebration of}} the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to Batgirl #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke. The cover depicts the Joker {{standing next to a}} tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted <b>across</b> <b>her</b> mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.|$|E
5|$|When Chandler was 14, {{he began}} {{stealing}} cars and was arrested 20times as a juvenile. As an adult, {{he was charged}} with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery. He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the barrel of his revolver <b>across</b> <b>her</b> stomach.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Graf Spees Arado {{floatplane}} {{located the}} merchant ship Doric Star: Langsdorff fired a shot <b>across</b> <b>her</b> bow {{to stop the}} ship. Doric Star was able to send out a distress signal before she was sunk, which prompted Harwood to take his three cruisers {{to the mouth of}} the River Plate, which he estimated would be Langsdorff's next target. On the night of 5 December, Admiral Graf Spee sank the steamer Tairoa. The next day, she met with Altmark and transferred 140 prisoners from Doric Star and Tairoa. Admiral Graf Spee encountered her last victim on the evening of 7 December: the freighter Streonshalh. The prize crew recovered secret documents containing shipping route information. Based on that information, Langsdorff decided to head for the seas off Montevideo. On 12 December, the ship's Arado 196 broke down and could not be repaired, depriving Graf Spee of her aerial reconnaissance. The ship's disguise was removed, so it would not hinder the ship in battle.|$|E

5|$|All four cover sleeves for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer ND Chow. The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding {{the door to}} a red telephone box in Covent Garden, London, with the album title and her name superimposed on the booth. This marks Hamasaki's third album cover to be photographed and directed outside of Japan, after LOVEppears and (Miss)understood. The CD and music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with parts of the British stripes <b>across</b> <b>her</b> face. The box set is coloured black with the red British cross near the corner; the album version is the CD and DVD format, with the CD and DVD cover imprinted onto the mug, red tea tin, and the bag. The digital release uses the standalone CD format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Chow, and the design was based on Hamasaki's first visit to the UK and Britannia. First pressing issues for both the standalone CD format, the CD and DVD format, and the box set included a 36–page photo album of Hamasaki roaming the streets and wondering around stores and markets in London.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00, Ceylon spotted Hamelin's {{ships in}} pursuit and her crew {{increased}} {{their efforts to}} escape, mistaking Victor, which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As night fell, Gordon slowed Ceylon by shortening sail {{in the hope of}} meeting Vénus (which had outdistanced Victor) alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, Vénus caught up with Ceylon, which began firing on the larger French frigate as she passed. Hamelin, recognising that his vessel had the advantage in size and weight of shot, did not wait for Victor but attacked immediately, passing Ceylon and tuning <b>across</b> <b>her</b> bows to open a raking fire.|$|E
5|$|The sitters are {{presented}} in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo {{and in many ways}} counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially {{the manner in which the}} folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress <b>across</b> <b>her</b> chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.|$|E

5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared <b>across</b> <b>her</b> body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E
5|$|Hilda instructs Link to {{find and}} rescue the Seven Sages, who have been {{scattered}} <b>across</b> <b>her</b> kingdom, {{in order to gain}} the Triforce of Courage. With help from Ravio's services, Link accomplishes this and returns to Lorule Castle, where he discovers Hilda taking the Triforce of Wisdom from Zelda. Hilda reveals that Lorule fell into ruin after her ancestors destroyed their own Triforce. Deciding that in order to restore her kingdom back to its former glory, she needs Hyrule's Triforce, arranging everything so that Link would bring it to her. Hilda attempts to use Yuga to obtain the Triforce of Courage from Link, but Yuga betrays her and turns her into a painting, stealing the Triforce of Wisdom for himself. With Zelda's help, Link manages to defeat Yuga. He then restores Zelda and Hilda from their paintings. As Hilda feels bitter over her loss, Ravio, who is revealed to be Link's counterpart, convinces her that stealing Hyrule's Triforce isn't the right way to save Lorule, having secretly sought out Link to help her see the light. After Link and Zelda return to Hyrule, they use the power of their Triforce to restore Lorule's Triforce and bring Lorule back to its full glory. With his quest completed, Link returns the Master Sword to its resting place once more.|$|E
5|$|Linois {{had escaped}} so swiftly that his anchors and boats {{had been left}} in the bay, where he had {{abandoned}} them rather than draw attention to his movements by drawing them in. He had also just missed the transport Côte d'Or with its 326 soldiers, which arrived {{on the evening of}} 13 July and was swiftly surrounded by Centurion and Concorde. Detaching most of his squadron to Madras, Rainier waited off Pondicherry for further French movements and on 15 July spotted Belle Poule just off the coast. Linois had detached the frigate to investigate the anchorage at Madras, but she had been intercepted and followed by the frigate , whose insistent shadowing had forced Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac to return to Pondicherry. Belle Poule and Côte d'Or exchange signals during the morning, and at 11:00 the transport suddenly raised sails and departed the anchorage, Terpsichore pursuing closely. Early on 16 July, Terpsichore overtook the transport and fired several shots <b>across</b> <b>her</b> bow, forcing her captain to surrender. Bruilhac had used the distraction to sail Belle Poule to Isle de France without pursuit. Côte d'Or was returned to Pondicherry and, since there was no news of war from Europe, released on 24 July on condition that she only sail to Isle de France and no other destination. Dedaigneuse was detached to ensure that the transport followed these conditions and Rainier returned to Madras, joined by Dedaigneuse the following day once the transport's course was ensured. Rainier immediately ordered his ships to take on military supplies in preparation for military operations, although news of the declaration of war, made on 18 May, did not reach him until 13 September.|$|E
