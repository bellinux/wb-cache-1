5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

50|$|Audio {{amplifier}} {{power ratings}} are typically established by driving the {{device under test}} to the onset of clipping, to a predetermined distortion level, variable per manufacturer or per product line. Driving an amplifier to 1% distortion levels will yield <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rating</b> <b>than</b> driving it to 0.01% distortion levels. Similarly, testing an amplifier at a single mid-range frequency, or testing just one channel of a two-channel amplifier, will yield <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rating</b> <b>than</b> if it is tested throughout its intended frequency range with both channels working. Manufacturers can use these methods to market amplifiers whose published maximum power output includes some amount of clipping {{in order to show}} higher numbers.|$|R
50|$|A film may be {{produced}} {{with a particular}} rating in mind. It may be re-edited if the desired rating is not obtained, especially to avoid <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rating</b> <b>than</b> intended. <b>A</b> film may also be re-edited to produce an alternate version for other countries.|$|R
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims {{to a greater}} emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
5|$|Silk weaving is the {{dominant}} industry in Varanasi. Muslims are the influential community in this industry with {{nearly half a million}} of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons. Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are Momin Ansari Muslims. Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and Banarasi saris, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> elsewhere in India. The silk weaving industry has recently been threatened by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.|$|E
50|$|The agency {{issued its}} first {{sovereign}} debt ratings in 2013, giving Russia <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rating</b> <b>than</b> the United States, after complaints from the Russian government that ratings issued by US-based agencies were not fair.

25|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} (k, also denoted as λ or κ) is {{a measure}} of a material's ability to conduct heat. Heat transfer across materials of high thermal conductivity occurs at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> across materials of low thermal conductivity. In the International System of Units (SI), thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter Kelvin (W/(m•K)). In the Imperial System of Measurement (British Imperial, or Imperial units), thermal conductivity is measured in Btu/(hr•ft⋅F).|$|E

25|$|The rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum {{is one of}} few obligate monogamous marsupial species. A consistent {{characteristic of}} obligate monogamy displayed by this species is the existence of cohesive and persistent pair bonds with mutual or asymmetrical attraction between adults. Both sexes of this species maintain strong pair bonds, {{as shown by the}} wide array of maintenance behaviours, which is a measure of bond 'strength'. However, males maintained the pair bond at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> females. Both sexes shared the decision-making process in terms of changing group activity.|$|E
25|$|As adults, {{military}} brats {{can share}} {{many of the}} same positive and negative traits identified in other populations that experienced very mobile childhoods. Having had the opportunity to live around the world, military brats can have a breadth of experiences unmatched by most teenagers. Regardless of race, religion, nationality, or gender, brats might identify more with other highly mobile children than with non-mobile ones. Military brats also graduate from college at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> the civilian population and divorce at a lower rate.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the x-ray}} source P98, located in M101, was {{identified}} as an ultra-luminous X-ray source - a source more powerful than any single star but less powerful than a whole galaxy - using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. It received the designation M101 ULX-1. In 2005, Hubble and XMM-Newton observations showed {{the presence of an}} optical counterpart, strongly indicating that M101 ULX-1 is an x-ray binary. Further observations showed that the system deviated from expected models - the black hole is just 20 to 30 solar masses, and consumes material (including captured stellar wind) at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> theory suggests.|$|E

25|$|Securitization is {{the process}} of {{creating}} asset-backed securities by transferring assets from the issuing company to a bankruptcy remote entity. Credit enhancement is an integral component of this process as it creates a security that has <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rating</b> <b>than</b> the issuing company, which allows the issuing company to monetize its assets while paying a lower <b>rate</b> of interest <b>than</b> would be possible via a secured bank loan or debt issuance by the issuing company.|$|R

25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus banks will want to earn <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.|$|E
25|$|H-2A visas are {{temporary}} visas {{that allow}} {{people from other}} countries {{to work in the}} United States, with some benefits contractors need to provide to them. Examples include, “farmers are required to these workers with housing and pay for transportation to the job,..pay them at least three-quarters of the season at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>than</b> the average paid rate of that work”. Yet, the circumstances of the law states for free housing, “prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended employment”. For farmers who are working and have families, means that they are not guaranteed housing situations. Farm workers being controlled greatly, their lives are vulnerable in fears that they may be deported back to their homeland.|$|E
25|$|Fewer than a {{third of}} those aboard Titanic survived the disaster. Some {{survivors}} died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard Titanic. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first and second class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> women from the Third Class. In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.|$|E
