25|$|Libby {{does not}} dispute that he {{initially}} heard <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Wilson from Cheney, but {{he claims that}} he had no recollection of that fact when he told the FBI in October 2003 and the grand jury in March 2004 that he remembered first learning <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Wilson in a conversation with NBC’s Tim Russert on July 10, 2003.|$|E
25|$|Critics such as Ronald L. Numbers writing <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> White's {{position}} {{in respect to}} health and masturbation in particular, claims that White plagiarized medical literature reflecting {{the views of the}} medical establishment at the time.|$|E
25|$|Earlier on, in {{the third}} segment, Mrs. Potts' Party, the Beast makes several cameos {{sleeping}} in his bed in the West Wing. Dialogue between Lumiere and Cogsworth shows that {{he had spent the}} entire previous night mending leaks in the castle roof, and is still resting. An argument between Lumiere and Cogsworth <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Potts' favourite flowers lead to them having to hide several bunches of flowers around the Beast's bed. At one point, the Beast begins to smell one of the flowers and almost wakes up, but it is removed just in time, and he falls asleep again.|$|E
25|$|In July 1879, Langtry {{began an}} affair with the Earl of Shrewsbury; in January 1880, Langtry and the earl were {{planning}} to run away together. In the autumn of 1879, rumours were published in Town Talk that her husband would divorce her and cite, among others, the Prince of Wales as co-respondent. Adolphus Rosenberg was the journalist. He wrote separately <b>about</b> <b>Mrs</b> Cornwallis-West, which resulted in her husband suing him for libel. At this point, the Prince of Wales instructed his solicitor George Lewis to sue. Rosenburg pleaded guilty to both of the charges brought against him {{and was sentenced to}} 2 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Eileen Eggington, {{a retired}} {{police officer who}} had served 34 years in the Metropolitan Police, {{including}} a period as deputy head of Special Branch, wanted to help a friend, Mary Grestny, who had worked as personal assistant to Vaz's wife. After leaving the job in May 2000, Grestny dictated a seven-page statement <b>about</b> <b>Mrs</b> Vaz to Eggington in March 2001, who sent it to Elizabeth Filkin. Grestny's statement included allegations that Mr and Mrs Vaz had employed an illegal immigrant as their nanny, {{and that they had}} been receiving gifts from Asian businessmen such as the Hinduja brothers. The allegations were denied by Vaz, and the Committee found no evidence to support them.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1904, Potter {{was putting}} the {{finishing}} touches on Benjamin Bunny and Two Bad Mice. At the same time, she began giving serious thought to developing the tale <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Tiggy-winkle and Lucie. She had been working on backgrounds and had been carrying her pet hedgehog with her when travelling. On March 15, she wrote her editor Norman Warne, [...] "I have been drawing the stump of a hollow tree for another hedgehog drawing".|$|E
500|$|Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter {{writes in}} Secret Gardens The Golden Age of Children's Literature that Potter's work shows {{thematic}} shifts, seeing in The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle a utopian theme of nature-as-redemption {{in which the}} background represents a return to Arcadia of sorts. Young Lucy finds in Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's kitchen a place of refuge, and although unlike Potter's previous stories the main character is unthreatened by other characters or external circumstances, Carpenter writes [...] "while no external threat enters this most utopian of Potter's books, there is none the less something faintly sinister <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Tiggy-winkle herself".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} has received positive reactions from critics and fans. Fashion designer Peter Jensen, who designed {{a line of}} sweatshirts inspired by SpongeBob, called Mrs. Puff his [...] "absolute favorite" [...] character {{in an interview with}} Women's Wear Daily. In 2004, New York Times chief film critic A. O. Scott named Mrs. Puff as one of his favorite characters on SpongeBob SquarePants, along with Squidward Tentacles and Sandy Cheeks. Mrs. Puff was ranked second on Chilangos list of favorite cartoon teachers. KSL-TV listed Mrs. Puff in their countdown of [...] "13 teachers from pop culture you can't help but love". Andrew Whalen of IBT Media called Mrs. Puff's role in the [...] "Doing Time" [...] episode [...] "a series highlight". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported in 2002 that episodes <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Puff's Boating School were fan favorites. Scott Lecter of DVD Talk said in his review of the show's first theatrical film that Mrs. Puff, Sandy and Squidward [...] "make for some of the biggest laughs in the episodes".|$|E
500|$|Potter sent {{miniature}} {{letters to}} the Moore children, to the Warne children, Lucie Carr and her older sister Kathleen, Master Drew Fayle, and to Master John and Miss Margaret Hough. Seven letters <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Tiggy-Winkle are extant. Mrs. Josephine Rabbit writes to complain of starch in her handkerchiefs, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle responds with apologies, Mrs. Rabbit then writes to compliment Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle on the [...] "getting up of the children's muslin frocks" [...] and promises not to seek another laundress. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle writes Master Fayle warning him that [...] "verything has got all mixed up in wrong bundles" [...] and wondering if he has received Mr. Jeremy Fisher's shirt or Mrs. Flopsy Bunny's apron? Mrs. Bunny writes Master Drew that she is looking for her apron. She has received a shirt marked J.F. that is 3-inches long. Jeremy writes twice to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Once, to complain that he has received an apron marked F.B. and then to complain in a letter dated January 22, 1910:Mr. J. Fisher regrets to have to complain again about the washing. Mrs. T. Winkle has sent home an enormous handkerchief marked 'D. Fayle' instead of the tablecloth marked J.F. If this continues every week, Mr. J. Fisher {{will have to get}} married, so as to have the washing done at home.|$|E
2500|$|According to Collins, [...] "What we're {{in court}} {{deciding}} {{seems to be}} a level or two down from what, before we went into the jury, we supposed the trial was about, or had been initially about, which was who leaked [...] Some jurors commented at some point: 'I wish we weren't judging Libby. You know, this sucks. We don't like being here.' But that wasn't our choice." [...] Collins described how after 10 days of deliberations, [...] "What we came up with from that was that Libby was told <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Wilson nine times...We believed he did have a bad memory, but it seemed very unlikely he would not remember about being told <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Wilson so many times....Hard to believe he would remember on Tuesday and forget on Thursday." [...] Collins told the press [...] "Well, as I said before, I felt like it was a long, you know, haul to get this jury done. And if Mr. Libby is pardoned, I would have no problem with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was clear}} that among the servants, feeling against Mrs. Warbucks ran high and public opinion was {{on the side of}} Annie and Oliver. Earlier on, the butler and the chauffeur voice their displeasure <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Warbucks and her terrible abuse of Annie, with the latter saying [...] "Commoner nothin'! He (Warbucks) is a prince, see?! But wot a wife! [...] If she were mine, I would bend a wrench over her nut!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon Brown became Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, {{after the}} {{resignation}} of Tony Blair. As wife of the Prime Minister, Sarah Brown was generally viewed favourably. The Guardian noted her public image, describing her as [...] "a truly modern public figure: talkative, empathetic, informal but infinitely connected, ubiquitous as any celebrity, an avid exploiter of new digital media, an expert assembler of charitable and political coalitions", noting [...] "her positive profile {{could be the best}} thing Labour has got going for it with the election looming." [...] The Telegraph noted that [...] " [...] It is hard to find people with a bad word to say <b>about</b> <b>Mrs</b> Brown." ...|$|E
2500|$|Filch has a cat named Mrs Norris {{to whom he}} has a {{particular}} and possessive attachment. She acts as a hallway monitor or spy for Filch. If she observes students engaging in suspicious activity or out of bed after curfew, she finds Filch and he arrives in seconds. She {{has been known to}} follow Hagrid everywhere he goes in the school, apparently under Filch's orders. According to J.K. Rowling, there is nothing particularly magical <b>about</b> <b>Mrs</b> Norris, other than her being [...] "just an intelligent (and unpleasant) cat." [...] It's the ambition of many Hogwarts students to [...] "give her a good kick". In the Chamber of Secrets incident, Mrs Norris is temporarily petrified by the Basilisk, which causes Filch extreme distress.|$|E
2500|$|According to Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, Libby {{first learned}} of Valerie Wilson's {{employment}} at the CIA in early June 2003 from Vice President Dick Cheney {{and proceeded to}} discuss her with six other government officials in the following days and months before disclosing her name to reporters Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper in early July 2003. Fitzgerald asserts that Vice President Cheney told Libby <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Wilson's CIA employment as the two crafted a response to an inquiry about Wilson's trip from reporter Walter Pincus. While her name was not disclosed to Pincus, Fitzgerald asserts that Pincus's inquiry [...] "further motivated [...] to counter Mr. Wilson’s assertions, making {{it more likely that}} [...] disclosures to the press concerning Mr. Wilson's wife were not casual disclosures that he had forgotten {{by the time he was}} asked about them by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and before the grand jury." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2015, the New York Times {{reported}} on [...] "interviews {{with more than}} 75 Democratic governors, lawmakers, candidates and party members" [...] on the email issue. The Times reported, [...] "None of the Democrats interviewed {{went so far as}} to suggest that the email issue raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Clinton's ability to serve as president, and many expressed a belief that it had been manufactured by Republicans in Congress and other adversaries." [...] At the same time, many Democratic leaders showed increasing frustration among party leaders of Clinton's handling of the email issue. For example, Edward G. Rendell, former governor of Pennsylvania, a Clinton supporter, said that a failure of the Clinton campaign to get ahead of the issue early on meant that the campaign was [...] "left just playing defense." [...] Other prominent Democrats, such as Governor Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, were less concerned, noting the campaign was at an early stage and that attacks on Clinton were to be expected.|$|E
2500|$|Smailey {{says he has}} {{no desire}} to be hard on her, but that [...] "it is a fraud". Ruth points out he was guilty of fraud, and she has {{evidence}} to prove it. Smailey tries to buy it from her, but she's respectable now: She won't take his money, though she keeps the papers as she [...] "ain't a fool"; Smailey leaves. Fitz-Partington interviews Ruth, to her confusion. Mrs. Van Brugh re-enters, and Fitz-Partington warns her about Smailey, explaining that his detective agency was called on to find out about Smailey's fraud, but as Smailey then hired him to investigate Mrs. Van Brugh, they had combined the cases. However, Fitz-Partington goes on to ask several further questions <b>about</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Van Brugh's marriage, and she begins to realise what Smailey is looking for: if Mrs. Van Brugh's godfather had called her Captain Van Brugh's wife in his will, her secret might be revealed. Smailey returns with the will, and reads out the relevant section about the farm, ending with the section referring to her as [...] "Catherine Ellen, wife of Captain Richard Van Brugh." [...] She faints into a chair.|$|E
