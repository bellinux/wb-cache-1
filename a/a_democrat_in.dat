5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E
5|$|Deady {{was elected}} to the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1850, where he {{represented}} Yamhill County as <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> the lower chamber House of Representatives. He attended the session held in Oregon City beginning in December, where he met James W. Nesmith and Asahel Bush for the first time. Those three would become influential leaders of the Democratic Party in the Oregon Territory, and later the state of Oregon. Deady was an early member of the Democratic Party in the territory.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, McCreary {{returned}} to his legal practice. In 1884, he sought election to Congress from Kentucky's Eighth District. His opponents for the Democratic nomination were Milton J. Durham and Philip B. Thompson, Jr., both of whom had held the district's seat previously. McCreary bested both men, and {{in the general election}} in November, defeated Republican James Sebastian by a margin of 2,146 votes. It was the largest margin of victory by <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> the Eighth District.|$|E
5|$|In October 1987, {{encouraged}} by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, McEwen {{announced he would}} challenge Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, <b>a</b> <b>Democrat,</b> <b>in</b> his 1988 bid for re-election, but McEwen found he lacked statewide support and would face a strong primary challenger in Cleveland mayor George V. Voinovich. He {{dropped out of the}} race in December. McEwen's name was floated in 1991 as a possible challenger in 1992 to Ohio's other senator, John Glenn, another Democrat, but McEwen did not enter the race.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over Bush in the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> the Senate election was not assured, {{because in recent decades}} the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E

5|$|New York allows electoral fusion, {{which is}} an {{arrangement}} allowing two or more qualified parties to list the same candidate on a ballot. The Conservative Party chose to cross-endorse Tedisco on February 9, while the Working Families Party gave its endorsement to Murphy on February 17. On March 1, the Independence Party, the largest third party in the 20th district, gave its endorsement to Murphy. This {{was the first time}} the Independence Party had endorsed <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> the district.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Sherman {{was active in}} {{politics}} as a perennial candidate. In 2006, he unsuccessfully ran for the 53rd district in the Illinois House of Representatives as <b>a</b> <b>Democrat.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, after meeting Green Party gubernatorial candidate Rich Whitney, Sherman joined the party. That same year, he ran as a Green for the same seat. He ran unsuccessfully for Buffalo Grove Village Clerk in 2011, for Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2016 as a Green – receiving 4.7% of the vote – and he had {{announced that he would}} run for Illinois's 12th congressional district in 2018. He served as the Cook County Green Party chairman in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, {{the son of}} Czech immigrants, {{had been}} elected New York Secretary of State as <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E

5|$|The state's liquor {{prohibition}} law was a {{major political}} issues at the time, and Talbot was a strict prohibitionist. During this term he vetoed {{a bill that would}} have disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since it was the first victory for <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Bert Combs {{was born}} in the Town Branch section of Manchester, Kentucky on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven {{children}} of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs. Combs's father Stephen, a part-time logger and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> a county where a large majority of residents were Republicans. His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the importance of a good education. Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek grade school. When he reached the seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to Oneida Baptist Institute in nearby Oneida because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek. Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to Clay County High School. Combs excelled academically and skipped some grades, graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1927 at age 15.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 1918, {{incumbent}} senator Ollie M. James died. Stanley appointed George B. Martin {{to finish}} James' term, {{which was to}} expire on March 3 of the following year. James had already been nominated for re-election in 1918 by the Democratic primary, and the task of selecting the party's new nominee fell to the Democratic State Committee, which nominated Stanley. Stanley enjoyed {{the advantage of a}} united Democratic party; J. C. W. Beckham supported Stanley for this seat so Stanley would not challenge him for his own seat when he faced re-election. The Republicans chose a relative unknown, Dr. Ben L. Bruner. Stanley was attacked for his veto of the German language bill and for his long-standing views against temperance. Though the national mood was against the Democrats, a letter of support from President Woodrow Wilson bolstered Stanley's campaign, and he defeated Bruner by more than 5,000 votes. He resigned as governor to assume the Senate seat in May 1919. As <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> a mostly Republican Senate, he wielded little influence.|$|E

5|$|The 1920 Republican National Convention {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on June 8, 1920, {{assembling}} delegates who were bitterly divided, most recently over {{the results of a}} Senate investigation into campaign spending, which had just been released. That report found that Wood had spent $1.8 million, lending substance to Johnson's claims that Wood was trying to buy the presidency. Some of the $600,000 that Lowden had spent had wound up in the pockets of two convention delegates. Johnson had spent $194,000 and Harding $113,000. Johnson was deemed to be behind the inquiry, and the rage of the Lowden and Wood factions put an end to any possible compromise among the frontrunners. Of the almost 1,000 delegates, 27 were women—the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the vote, was within one state of ratification, and would pass before the end of August. The convention had no boss, most uninstructed delegates voted as they pleased, and with <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> the White House, the party's leaders could not use patronage to get their way.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> April, 2009).|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and <b>a</b> <b>Democrat,</b> <b>in</b> Maryland.|$|E
