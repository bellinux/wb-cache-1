50|$|In all years, the Indy {{cars have}} {{utilized}} the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>starting</b> line {{located at the}} mid-point of the backstretch. This allows the entire field to properly assemble into the grid formation, and start the race heading towards the best passing zone on the circuit. The pace car will pull off into the pits as normal, and allow the pole position car to pace the field {{all the way to}} the backstretch. Since the start/finish line at the pit straight is immediately proceeded by the tight and slow carousel, it does not allow for optimum racing into the first turn. The finish line and all other scoring is done at the line on the pit straight.

It was found that dental therapists, in terms of their working pattern and family profile, are typical of women of their age and level of qualification in Britain. The return to work by therapists, after a break from practice because of family commitments, will depend mainly on the availability of posts, particularly part-time posts.

25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>starting</b> motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|R
5000|$|For the 118th {{running of}} the Kentucky Derby on May 2, 1992, Arazi drew post {{position}} 17 {{in a field of}} 18 horses. The outside post meant he would begin the race from an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>starting</b> gate. Despite this handicap, bettors wagered as much on Arazi to win as on the other seventeen horses combined. Having raced only once in the previous seven months (apart from the Prix Omnium at St Cloud), {{from the start of the}} Derby the energetic colt had to be kept under wraps by his jockey. Near the back of the field for most of the race, after the quarter pole Arazi made a quick move. Running eight horses wide, and mirroring his dramatic performance in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, the colt flew past horse after horse with ABC television announcer Dave Johnson exclaiming, [...] "Arazi is flying! - Arazi is gaining ground with every stride!" [...] The colt moved into third place, tightly bunched with the leaders. But as they approached the homestretch, instead of pulling away as he had always done previously, Arazi tired and faded to finish eighth. Lil E. Tee, a little-known colt and an 18-1 longshot, won the race.|$|R
5000|$|Because inertia {{makes it}} {{difficult}} to instantly accelerate the rotor from stopped to synchronous speed, these motors normally require some sort of special feature to get started. Some include a squirrel-cage structure to bring the rotor close to synchronous speed. Various other designs use a small induction motor (which may share the same field coils and rotor as the synchronous motor) or a very light rotor with a one-way mechanism (to ensure that the rotor starts in the [...] "forward" [...] direction). In the latter instance, applying AC power creates chaotic (or seemingly chaotic) jumping movement back and forth; such a motor will always start, but lacking the anti-reversal mechanism, the direction it runs is unpredictable. The Hammond organ tone generator used a non-self-starting synchronous motor (until comparatively recently), and had an <b>auxiliary</b> conventional shaded-pole <b>starting</b> motor.

40|$|Most UAS {{propulsion}} systems currently utilize either Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) or Electric Motor (EM) prime movers. ICE are favoured for aircraft use {{due to the}} superior energy density of fuel compared to batteries required for EM, however EM have several significant advantages. A major advantage of EM {{is that they are}} inherently self starting have predictable response characteristics and well developed electronic control systems. EMs are thus very easy to adapt to automatic control, whereas ICE have more complex control response and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>starting</b> motor is required for automated starting. This paper presents a technique for determining the performance, feasibility and effectiveness of powerplant hybridisation for small UAS. A Hybrid Powerplant offers the possibility of a radical improvement in the autonomy of the aircraft for various tasks without sacrificing payload range or endurance capability. In this work a prototype Aircraft Hybrid Powerplant (AHP) was designed, constructed and tested. It is shown that an additional 35 % continuous thrust power can be supplied from the hybrid system with an overall weight penalty of 5 %, for a given UAS. Dynamometer and windtunnel results were obtained to validate theoretical propulsion load curves.

40|$|We {{present a}} new (variant) {{formulation}} of N= 1 supersymmetric compensator mechanism for an arbitrary non-Abelian group in four dimensions. We call this `variant supersymmetric non-Abelian Proca-Stueckelberg formalism'. Our field content is economical, consisting {{only of the}} two multiplets: (i) A Non-Abelian vector multiplet (A_μ^I, λ^I, C_μνρ^I) and (ii) A compensator tensor multiplet (B_μν^I, χ^I, φ^I). The index I is for the adjoint representation of a non-Abelian gauge group. The C_μνρ^I is originally an auxiliary field Hodge-dual to the conventional auxiliary field D^I. The φ^I and B_μν^I are compensator fields absorbed respectively into the longitudinal components of A_μ^I and C_μνρ^I which become massive. After the absorption, C_μνρ^I becomes no longer <b>auxiliary,</b> but <b>starts</b> propagating as a massive scalar field. We fix all non-trivial cubic interactions in the total lagrangian, and quadratic interactions in all field equations. The superpartner fermion χ^I acquires a Dirac mass shared with the gaugino λ^I.
