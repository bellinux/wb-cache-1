This study aims to evaluate the reliability and validity of the PCL-C as a screen for detecting PTSD symptoms among pregnant women. METHODS: A total of 3372 pregnant women who attended their first prenatal care visit in Lima, Peru participated in the study. We assessed the reliability of the PCL-C items using Cronbach's <b>alpha.</b> <b>Criterion</b> validity and performance characteristics of PCL-C were assessed against an independent, blinded Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) interview using measures of sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{construct}} a multidimensional questionnaire that analyses the epileptic child {{quality of life}} from the parental point of view. METHOD: The pilot questionnaire was composed of 157 questions distributed in several dimensions. Fifty-one epileptic children's parents answered the questionnaire. The instrument was tested in its diverse properties: frequency of endorsement, homogeneity (Cronbach <b>alpha),</b> <b>criterion</b> and face validity, and later it was reduced. RESULTS: Endorsement frequency excluded 65 questions that did not attain a minimum of 5 % response per item. Cronbach alpha was as follows: physical (0. 93), psychological (0. 91), social (0. 91), familiar (0. 70), cognitive (0. 92), medical (0. 30) and economical (0. 37). Patient groups, in relation to seizure control, significantly differed only in physical domain and total score, {{although there was a}} trend to differences in other domains. The final questionnaire (QVCE 50) has 50 items, with good homogeneity in the physical, psychological and cognitive domains.

40|$|In {{pediatric}} chronic pain, {{research indicates}} a positive relation between parental psychological flexibility (i. e., the parent’s willingness to experience distress {{related to the}} child’s pain {{in the service of}} valued behavior) and level of functioning in the child. This points to the utility of targeting parental psychological flexibility in pediatric chronic pain. The Parent Psychological Flexibility Questionnaire (PPFQ) is currently the only instrument developed for this purpose, and two previous studies have indicated its reliability and validity. The current study sought to validate the Swedish version of the 17 -item PPFQ (PPFQ- 17) in a sample of parents (n = 263) of children with chronic pain. Factor structure and internal reliability were evaluated by means of principal component analysis (PCA) and Cronbach’s <b>alpha.</b> Concurrent <b>criterion</b> validity was examined by hierarchical multiple regression analyses with parental anxiety and depression as outcomes. The PCA supported a three-factor solution with 10 items explaining 69. 5 % of the total variance. Cronbach’s alpha (0. 86) indicated good internal consistency. The 10 -item PPFQ (PPFQ- 10) further explained a significant amount of variance in anxiety (29 %), and depression (35. 6 %), confirming concurrent validity.

40|$|Background: To {{explore the}} {{validity}} of the short Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) version – 5 items – in Portuguese community-dwelling older adults. Depression is reported to affect between 1 % and 3 % community-dwelling older adults, whereas depressive symptoms are two to four times more prevalent. Community surveys targeting older adults should have reliable and valid instruments to assess depressive symptoms. Methods: Two samples were considered: a convenience sample (N= 71) to compare GDS 5 with the 15 -item GDS version and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); and a population-based sample (N= 1030) to compare GDS 5 with self-reported depression diagnosis. Internal consistency (Cronbach's <b>alpha</b> coefficient), <b>criterion</b> validity (sensitivity and specificity), diagnostic capacity (area under the ROC curve) and factorial analysis (tetrachoric) were analyzed. Results: The cut-off point was taken as 2 or more. GDS 5 was found to be internally consistent: Cronbach Alpha= 0. 69. GDS- 5 and GDS 15 : Sensitivity= 85. 7 %; Specificity= 83. 3 %, AUC= 94. 3. GDS 5 and BDI: Sensitivity= 70 %; Specificity= 85. 3 %, AUC= 84. 1. GDS 5 and self-reported depression: Sensitivity= 79 %; Specificity= 47. 4 %, AUC= 72. 2. Conclusions: Results are similar to other GDS 5 studies. The low specificity results for the depression diagnose indicating false positives can be due to self-reporting.

40|$|A 24 -item multidimensional nurse-administered Nursing Home Disabilities Instrument (NHDI) was {{developed}} to measure disabilities in nursing home residents. We present the psychometric features and value of this instru-ment, with the following domains assessed: Mobility, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Alertness, Resistance to Nursing Assistance, Incontinence, Cognition, and Perception. Test-retest and interrater reliability was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was examined by Cronbach's <b>alpha.</b> <b>Criterion</b> validity tests were performed by comparing the scales with scales of the Elderly Residents Rating Scale (BOP). Test-retest reliability correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 63 to 0. 94. Interrater reliability was high for the scales Cognition, Mobility, ADL, and Incontinence (0. 79 to 0. 93), moderate for Resistance (0. 51), and low for Per-ception (0. 33). Cronbach's alpha of the scales was high, ranging from 0. 78 (Alertness) to 0. 93 (Mobility); only Perception showed a low alpha: 0. 54.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} tools to measure the {{information}} patients need in order for healthcare professionals in general, and particularly pharmacists, to communicate effectively and play an active part in the way patients manage their medicines. Previous research has developed and validated constructs to measure patients’ desires for information and their perceptions of how useful their medicines are. It is important to develop these tools for use in different settings and countries so that best practice is shared and is based on the best available evidence. Objectives: this project sought to validate of a survey tool measuring the “Extent of Information Desired” (EID), the “Perceived Utility of Medicines” (PUM), and the “Anxiety about Illness” (AI) that had been previously translated for use with Portuguese patients. Methods: The scales were validated in a patient sample of 596 : construct validity was explored in Factor analysis (PCA) and internal consistency analysed using Cronbach’s <b>alpha.</b> <b>Criterion</b> validity was explored correlating scores to the AI scale and patients’ perceived health status. Discriminatory power was assessed using ANOVA. Temporal stability was explored in a sub-sample of patients who responded at two time points, using a T-test to compare their mean scores. Results: Construct validity results indicated the need to remove 1 item from the Perceived Harm of Medicines (PHM) and Perceived Benefit of Medicines (PBM) for use in a Portuguese sample and the abandon of the tolerance scale. The internal consistency was high for the EID, PBM and AI scales (alpha> 0. 600) and acceptable for the PHM scale (alpha= 0. 536). All scales, except the EID, were consistent over time (p> 0. 05; p< 0. 01). All the scales tested showed good discriminatory power. The comparison of the AI scale with the SF- 36 indicated good criterion validity (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{increasing}} international {{interest in the}} concept of mental well-being and its contribution to all aspects of human life. Demand for instruments to monitor mental well-being at a population level and evaluate mental health promotion initiatives is growing. This article describes the development and validation of a new scale, comprised only of positively worded items relating to different aspects of positive mental health: the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). Methods WEMWBS was developed by an expert panel drawing on current academic literature, qualitative research with focus groups, and psychometric testing of an existing scale. It was validated on a student and representative population sample. Content validity was assessed by reviewing the frequency of complete responses and the distribution of responses to each item. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the scale measured a single construct. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's <b>alpha.</b> <b>Criterion</b> validity was explored in terms of correlations between WEMWBS and other scales and by testing whether the scale discriminated between population groups in line with pre-specified hypotheses. Test-retest reliability was assessed at one week using intra-class correlation coefficients. Susceptibility to bias was measured using the Balanced Inventory of Desired Responding. Results WEMWBS showed good content validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the single factor hypothesis. A Cronbach's alpha score of 0. 89 (student sample) and 0. 91 (population sample) suggests some item redundancy in the scale. WEMWBS showed high correlations with other mental health and well-being scales and lower correlations with scales measuring overall health. Its distribution was near normal and the scale did not show ceiling effects in a population sample. It discriminated between population groups {{in a way that is}} largely consistent with the results of other population surveys. Test-retest reliability at one week was high (0. 83). Social desirability bias was lower or similar to that of other comparable scales. Conclusion WEMWBS is a measure of mental well-being focusing entirely on positive aspects of mental health. As a short and psychometrically robust scale, with no ceiling effects in a population sample, it offers promise as a tool for monitoring mental well-being at a population level. Whilst WEMWBS should appeal to those evaluating mental health promotion initiatives, it is important that the scale's sensitivity to change is established before it is recommended in this context. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the criterion validity and the diagnostic accuracy of the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4 DSQ) regarding the identification of depressive and anxiety disorders in an insurance medicine setting. Participants: Our sample consisted of 230 individuals who applied for a work disability benefit due to mental health problems. Methods: Depressive and anxiety disorders were assessed using the 4 DSQ and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Internal consistency was determined by calculating Cronbach's <b>alpha</b> values. <b>Criterion</b> validity was evaluated by regression techniques. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. Results: Of the 230 participants 109 (47. 4 %) had a current DSM-IV depressive disorder and 146 (63. 5 %) an anxiety disorder. The 4 DSQ scales showed an excellent internal consistency. The depression scale of the 4 DSQ had specific sensitivity for major depressive disorder. The anxiety scale was also sensitive for the anxiety disorders. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicated good diagnostic accuracy of the 4 DSQ for assessing depressive and/or anxiety disorders: AUC-value 0. 81 for both depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Although the 4 DSQ shows good criterion validity and diagnostic accuracy with respect to depressive and anxiety disorders in applicants for a work disability benefit due to mental health problems, the feasibility of the 4 DSQ as a screening measure for depressive and anxiety disorders is limited due to the high prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Therapeutic decisions, including somatostatin-analogues (SAs) and (non) -transplant surgery are besides the existence of hepatomegaly, also guided by the severity of complaints. We developed and validated a self-report instrument to capture the presence and severity of disease specific complaints for PCLD. METHODS: The study population consisted of 129 patients. Items for the PCLD-complaint-specific assessment (POLCA) were developed based on the chart review of symptomatic PCLD patients (n= 68) and literature, and discussed during expert-consensus-meetings. 61 patients who needed therapy {{were asked to complete}} the POLCA and the short form health survey version 2 (SF 36 V 2) at baseline and after 6 months of SA-treatment. CT-scans were used to calculate liver volumes (LV). Factor analysis was conducted to identify subscales and remove suboptimal items. Reliability was assessed by Cronbach's <b>alpha.</b> Convergent, <b>criterion</b> validity and responsiveness were tested using prespecified hypotheses. RESULTS: In the validation group (n= 61), 47 received lanreotide (LAN) and 14 were offered LAN as bridge to liver transplantation (LTx). Factor analysis identified four subscales, which correlated with the physical component summary (PCS). Baseline POLCA scores were significantly higher in LTx-listed patients. In contrast to SF 36 V 2, POLCA-paired observations in 47 patients demonstrated that 2 subscales were lowered significantly and 2 borderline.

Repeated measures data from 92 social-competitive tennis players at five points in time were subjected to principal axis factoring with promax rotation. Results supported the hypothesized, 3 -factor measurement model. The measurement model was recovered cleanly at all time points, explaining between 58. 1 % and 68. 8 % of variance. Minimal complexity among items was evident.

40|$|Many {{behavioral}} {{measures of}} visual perception fluctuate continually in a rhythmic manner, reflecting {{the influence of}} endogenous brain oscillations, particularly theta (â 8 ̆ 8 ¼ 4 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 37 Hz) and alpha (â 8 ̆ 8 ¼ 8 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 312 Hz) rhythms [1 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 33]. However, {{it is unclear whether}} these oscillations are unique to vision or whether auditory performance also oscillates [4, 5]. Several studies report no oscillatory modulation in audition [6, 7], while those with positive findings suffer from confounds relating to neural entrainment [8 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 310]. Here, we used a bilateral pitch-identification task to investigate rhythmic fluctuations in auditory performance separately for the two ears and applied signal detection theory (SDT) to test for oscillations of both sensitivity and criterion (changes in decision boundary) [11, 12]. Using uncorrelated dichotic white noise to induce a phase reset of oscillations, we demonstrate that, as with vision, both auditory sensitivity and criterion showed strong oscillations over time, at different frequencies: â 8 ̆ 8 ¼ 6 Hz (theta range) for sensitivity and â 8 ̆ 8 ¼ 8 Hz (low <b>alpha</b> range) for <b>criterion,</b> implying distinct underlying sampling mechanisms [13]. The modulation in sensitivity in left and right ears was in antiphase, suggestive of attention-like mechanisms sampling alternatively from the two ears. Using signal detection theory, Ho et al. report that both perceptual sensitivity and decision criterion oscillate in audition (at 6 Hz and 8 Hz, respectively). The oscillations in sensitivity suggest alternate sampling of the two ears by attention-like mechanisms. Rhythmic oscillations seem to be a general phenomenon of many aspects of perception...|$|R
40|$|Background: Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is a form}} of anxiety disorder that arises after exposure to a traumatic event or stressor. It is characterized by persistent invasive thoughts, emotional detachment, hypervigilance and sleep disturbances. These sleep disturbances include nightmares, insomnia and distressed awakenings and are often refractory to multiple medications, including SSRIs, which are the only FDA approved medication for PTSD. Prazosin is an alpha- 1 adrenergic antagonist that has been studied for use in nighttime symptoms of PTSD in civilian populations, however most data exists for its use in combat-related PTSD. This review examines the differences in these two populations and investigates the off-label use of prazosin for sleep disturbances in noncombat posttraumatic {{stress disorder}}. Methods: Exhaustive search of available medical literature via MEDLINE, CINAHL, PILOTS, and PsychINFO databases using combinations of the terms PTSD, Stress Disorder, Prazosin, Alpha Antagonist and <b>Alpha</b> Blocker. Inclusion <b>criteria</b> were set to incorporate studies that used prazosin to treat nighttime symptoms of PTSD in a noncombat, non-military population. Exclusion criteria eliminated studies pertaining to combat PTSD, military or veteran population. Non peer-reviewed Letters to Editor were also excluded. Results: Four studies, including one randomized control trial, one retrospective cohort, one case series and one case study were found. Conclusion: Prazosin has potential as a treatment for the sleep disturbances of noncombat related PTSD. Both the prevalent female gender and heterogeneity of individual traumas in this civilian population were much different than previous trials and reviews that examined combat PTSD. While the demographics and experiences were diverse compared to the veteran population, the positive response to prazosin was similar to past findings.

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a correlation exists between proprioceptive ability and other components of physical performance such as lower body muscular power and change of direction. It was hypothesized that significant correlations would exist. Participants included 7 males and 2 females (age 15 ± 2 yrs., height 1. 51 ±. 15 m, mass 68. 2 ± 17. 14 kg) who did not have a lower extremity injury or surgery within 6 months of this investigation. Proprioceptive testing included the Stork Standing test (SST) and ankle Joint Position Sense (JPS). Lower extremity proprioceptive testing was performed unilaterally in both eyes closed and open conditions. Lower body muscular power and change of direction were assessed via the vertical jump (VJ), one step vertical jump (1 VJ), standing long jump (SLJ), 9. 14 m (10 -yard) dash, and pro agility (PA). Associations were determined via a Pearson Product Moment Correlation and the <b>criterion</b> <b>alpha</b> was set a priori at p ≤ 0. 05. Significant correlations were observed between SST with eyes closed on the non-dominant leg and both VJ (r = - 0. 82) and 1 VJ (r =- 0. 82). In addition, a significant correlation was observed between SST with eyes closed on the dominant leg and the 9. 14 m dash (r = - 0. 90). The results of our investigation suggest a link between proprioception and lower body muscular power. Additional investigations should examine the causal relationships between these variables to attempt to determine the efficacy of interventions designed to improve one or more of the aforementioned characteristics as well as any potential influence on injury risk...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the current}} study is to test the {{validity}} and reliability of the Shame Questionnaire among traumatized girls in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: The Shame Questionnaire was validated through both classical test and item response theory methods. Internal reliability, criterion validity and construct validity were examined among a sample of 325 female children living in Zambia. Sub-analyses were conducted to examine differences in construct validity among girls who reported sexual abuse and girls who did not. Results: All girls in the sample were sexually abused, but only 61. 5 % endorsed or reported that sexual abuse had occurred. Internal consistency was very good among the sample with <b>alpha</b> =. 87. <b>Criterion</b> validity was demonstrated through a significant difference of mean Shame Questionnaire scores between girls who experienced 0 - 1 trauma events and more than one traumatic event, with higher mean Shame Questionnaire scores among girls who had more than one traumatic event (p=. 004 for 0 - 1 compared to 2 and 3 events and p=. 016 for 0 - 1 compared to 4 + events). Girls who reported a history of witnessing or experiencing physical abuse had a significantly higher mean Shame Questionnaire score than girls who did not report a history of witnessing or experiencing physical abuse (p<. 0001). There {{was no significant difference in}} mean Shame Questionnaire score between girls who reported a sexual abuse history and girls who did not. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a two-factor model of the Shame Questionnaire, with an experience of shame dimension and an active outcomes of shame dimension. Item response theory analysis indicated adequate overall item fit. Results also indicate potential differences in construct validity between girls who did and did not endorse sexual abuse. Conclusions: This study suggests the general utility of the Shame Questionnaire among Zambian girls and demonstrates the need for more psychometric studies in low and middle income countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In Sri Lanka, {{behavioural}} {{problems have}} grown to epidemic proportions accounting second highest category of mental health problems among children. Early identification of behavioural problems in children is an important pre-requisite of the implementation of interventions to prevent long term psychiatric outcomes. The objectives {{of the study were}} to develop and validate a screening instrument for use in the community setting to identify behavioural problems in children aged 4 - 6 years. Methods An initial 54 item questionnaire was developed following an extensive review of the literature. A three round Delphi process involving a panel of experts from six relevant fields was then undertaken to refine the nature and number of items and created the 15 item community screening instrument, Child Behaviour Assessment Instrument (CBAI). Validation study was conducted in the Medical Officer of Health area Kaduwela, Sri Lanka and a community sample of 332 children aged 4 - 6 years were recruited by two stage randomization process. The behaviour status of the participants was assessed by an interviewer using the CBAI and a clinical psychologist following clinical assessment concurrently. Criterion validity was appraised by assessing the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values at the optimum screen cut off value. Construct validity of the instrument was quantified by testing whether the data of validation study fits to a hypothetical model. Face and content validity of the CBAI were qualitatively assessed by a panel of experts. The reliability of the instrument was assessed by internal consistency analysis and test-retest methods in a 15 % subset of the community sample. Results Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis the CBAI score of > 16 was identified as the cut off point that optimally differentiated children having behavioural problems, with a sensitivity of 0. 88 (95 % CI = 0. 80 - 0. 96) and specificity of 0. 81 (95 % CI = 0. 75 - 0. 87). The Cronbach's <b>alpha</b> exceeded Nunnaly's <b>criterion</b> of 0. 7 for items related to inattention, aggression and impaired social interaction. Conclusions Preliminary data obtained from the study indicate that the Child Behaviour Assessment Instrument is a valid and reliable screening instrument for early identification of young children at risk of behavioural problems in the community setting. </p...|$|R
40|$|Context. Star-forming dwarf galaxies may {{have played}} an {{important}} role in the reionization of the Universe, provided that some fraction of their ionizing radiation were able to escape into the intergalactic medium.  Local galaxies exhibiting such Lyman-continuum(LyC) leakage could potentially shed light on the escape mechanisms involved, but only two low-redshift cases of LyC leakage have been identified so far. Here, we argue that this meager harvest may be caused by unsuitable selection criteria.  Candidates for LyC leakage are normally selected by indicators of starburst activity, one of which is a high equivalent width in H <b>alpha.</b> Such a <b>criterion</b> will guarantee a high production of LyC photons but will also bias the selection in favour of a high column density in the neutral gas, effectively ruling out LyC escape.  Aims. In this work we want to investigate whether the lack of local LyC emitters can be caused in part by biased selection criteria, and we present a novel method of selecting targets with high escape fractions. By applying these criteria, we assemble a sample of observation targets to study their basic properties.  Methods. We introduce a new selection strategy here where the potential LyC leakers are selected by their blue colours and weak emission lines. The selection is based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We also take a closer look at the properties of 8 LyCleaking candidates at z similar to 0. 03 which we have observed with ESO/NTT in broadband B and H alpha.  Results. We find that 7 of the 8 target galaxies are involved in interaction with neighbours or show signs of mergers. In 7 cases the young stellar population is clearly displaced relative to the main body of these galaxies, often directly bordering the halo region. In about half of our targets the absorption spectra show young post-starburst signatures. Comparing the scale lengths in H alpha with those of the stellar continua shows that the scale lengths in H alpha typically are 30 % smaller, which is characteristic of galaxies influenced by ram pressure stripping. We tentatively identify a few mechanisms that could improve the conditions for leakage: 1) the combined effects of ram pressure stripping with supernova winds from young stars formed in the front, 2) merger events that increase the star formation rate and displace stars from gas, 3) starbursts in the centres of post-starburst galaxies, whose previous activity has cleared channels for leakage into the intergalactic medium, and 4) a low dust content. Although our target galaxies are rare species in the local universe, we argue that related types could have played a major role in producing ionizing radiation at high redshifts...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to estimate the anthropometric characteristics and jump performance differences between professional and college volleyball players. Thirteen professional players group (TG) and twenty-eight college volleyball players group (NG) performed anthropometric (i. e., height, standing reach height, body mass) and performance tests (i. e., flexibility, squat jump [SJ], countermovement jump [CMJ], countermovement jump with arms [CMJA], repeated rebound jump [RJ], repeated rebound jump with arm [RJA], standing long jump, standing 3 -steps jump and spike jump reach height with one step [SPJ 1] and three steps [SPJ 3]). RJ-index (RJ-index) was calculated by dividing the jumping height by the corresponding contact time (jumping height / contact time). Anthropometric and performance comparisons between college and professional players were accomplished by unpaired student’s t-tests. A <b>criterion</b> <b>alpha</b> level of p< 0. 05 was used to determine statistical significance. Height (187. 2 ± 6. 8 cm vs. 180. 7 ± 8. 4 cm: p< 0. 05), standing reach height (243. 0 ± 11. 6 cm vs. 232. 3 ± 12. 8 cm: p< 0. 05), and body mass (82. 0 ± 7. 3 kg vs. 73. 9 ± 5. 3 kg: p< 0. 001) were significantly higher in TG than NG. Flexibility (51. 8 ± 7. 0 cm vs. 53. 4 ± 11. 4 cm) was not significant difference between groups. While standing long jump (273. 5 ± 16. 4 cm vs. 261. 8 ± 18. 4 cm) was not significant difference between groups, standing 3 -steps jump (793. 4 ± 60. 2 cm vs. 736. 1 ± 45. 7 cm: p< 0. 01) was significantly higher in TG than NG. CMJ (50. 2 ± 4. 9 cm vs. 46. 7 ± 3. 6 cm: p< 0. 05), RJ-index (2. 05 ± 0. 29 vs. 1. 79 ± 0. 28 : p< 0. 01) and RJA-index (2. 40 ± 0. 35 vs. 2. 07 ± 0. 45 : p< 0. 05) were significantly higher in TG than NG. However, SJ (46. 1 ± 4. 4 cm vs. 43. 9 ± 3. 8 cm) and CMJA (60. 3 ± 6. 9 cm vs. 57. 2 ± 4. 5 cm) were not significant difference between groups. SPJ 1 relative height (83. 9 ± 8. 0 cm vs. 72. 3 ± 7. 1 cm: p< 0. 001) and SPJ 3 relative height (88. 5 ± 9. 5 cm vs. 80. 4 ± 8. 7 cm: p< 0. 05) in TG were significantly higher than NG. These results indicate that anthropometric and stretch-shortening cycle efficiency differences exist between groups...|$|R
