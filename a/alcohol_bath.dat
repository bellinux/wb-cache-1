The cross-linked membranes were subjected to sorption studies to evaluate the extent of interaction and degree of swelling in pure as well as binary mixtures of the two liquids. In order to gain a more detailed picture of the molecular transport phenomenon, we have performed sorption gravimetric experiments at 30 degrees C to compute diffusion, swelling, sorption, and permeability coefficients of phosphorylated chitosan (P-CS) membranes in the presence of ethylene glycol and water. The effects of experimental parameters such as feed composition, membrane thickness, and permeate pressure on separation performance were determined. The membranes were characterized before and after cross-linking by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to verify cross-linking and to observe the thermal degradation range of the polymer. The membrane appears to have a good potential for breaking the boiling mixture of ethylene glycol/water since a moderately good selectivity of 234 was obtained at a reasonable flux of 0. 37 kg/m(2) center dot h. The separation factor was found to improve with decreasing feedwater concentration whereas flux decreased correspondingly. Increasing the membrane thickness decreased the flux but had a less profound effect on the separation factor. Higher permeate pressure caused a reduction in flux and an increase in selectivity...|$|R

40|$|Electrophoretic {{deposition}} (EPD) is {{a method}} to deposit particles dispersed in a liquid onto a substrate under the force of an applied electric field, and has been applied for depositing phosphors for application in solid state lighting. The objective is to deposit phosphors in a "remote phosphor" configuration for a UV-LED-based light source for improved white light extraction efficiency. It is demonstrated that EPD {{can be used to}} deposit red-, green-, blue-, yellow- and orange-emitting phosphors to generate white light using a near UV-emitting LED by either depositing a phosphor blend or sequentially individual phosphor compositions. The phosphor coverage was excellent, demonstrating that EPD is a viable method to produce phosphor layers for the "remote phosphor" white light design. The deposition rates of the individual phosphor films were ̃ 1 - 5 [mu]m/min. The blend depositions composed of both three and four phosphor compositions emit white light located on or near the black body locus on the CIE chromaticity diagram. Phosphor films were also prepared by sequential deposition of red/orange and green/ blue compositions, to generate white light. The layered films were flipped over and illuminated in this orientation, which showed approximately the same luminescence characteristics. No change in the reabsorption ratio of green/blue emission by the red/ orange phosphor was found regardless of the deposited order of the layered films. These applications of EPD of phosphor for white solid state lighting are promising and effective due to easy tuning of emissive color by varying the phosphor blend compositions. Although nanoparticles of a variety of materials have been coated by EPD, there have been few direct comparisons of EPD of nano- and micron- sized particles of the same material. Another field {{of the study was to}} compare EPD of nano-, nano core/SiO₂ shell and micron-sized (Ba₀. ₉₇Eu₀. ₀₃) ₂SiO₄ phosphor particles for application in a near-UV LED-based light source.

The objective of this study is the characterization of the collagen network in sound and carious dentin using NLOM to study non decalcified teeth. Materials and methods: Longitudinal slices with thickness up to 0. 5 mm were prepared from freshly extracted teeth: 4 from a sound tooth without caries and 4 from a carious tooth. The samples were polished to 0. 25 µm and cleaned up in an ultrasound <b>alcohol</b> <b>bath</b> for 5 min.

Results and conclusion: We have visualized groups of collagen fibres that are constituents of the healthy dentin extracellular matrix and succeeded to differentiate between healthy and carious tooth dentin structure. In a carious lesion, the SHG signal is low and the collagen network is difficult to observe. The obtained 2 PEF and SHG three-dimensional images of dentine reveal the tubule network.

40|$|Cold {{plates are}} {{critical}} for cooling electronic systems in the shuttle. As {{a result of the}} environmental conditions in which they operate, water can condense between them and a support shelf. In some cases, this water results in intergranular corrosion in the face sheet. If the intergranular corrosion sufficiently penetrates the face sheet, a coolant leak could occur and jeopardize cold plate operation. This paper examines techniques for detecting and characterizing the intergranular corrosion, to enable recertification of cold plates that have been in operation for 15 plus years. Intergranular corrosion was artificially induced in the face sheets of a series of cold plate specimens using an electrochemical process. Some of the cold plate specimens were separated for destructive characterization of the extent of corrosion produced by the electrochemical process and to insure the induced corrosion was intergranular. The rest of the specimens were characterized nondestructively using several techniques. X-ray tomography and ultrasonic techniques provided the best indication of corrosion in these specimens and will be the focus of this paper. An x-ray tomography technique was shown to be the most effective technique for characterizing depth of the intergranular corrosion. From these measurements, corrosion profile maps were developed that were consistent with subsequent destructive evaluations of the specimens. This enabled the assessment of NDE (ondestructive evaluation) standards to evaluate the viability of other NDE techniques. Due to system constraints, a different technique must be used to inspect an entire cold plate. An ultrasonic technique was shown to be very reliable for detection of corrosion in the unbacked regions of the face sheet. The ultrasonic technique was performed in an <b>alcohol</b> <b>bath</b> to avoid additional corrosion during the NDE evaluation.

Trunnion-Hub-Girder (THG) assembly plays a role as a fulcrum in the bascule bridge. To make the fulcrum, the trunnion is shrink-fitted into the hub, and then the trunnion-hub assembly is shrink-fitted into the girder. Hundreds of thousands of dollars could be lost due to failures during this step. Crack formations in the hubs of various Florida bascule bridges during assembly led the Florida Department of Transportation to commission a project with USF professors to investigate. Finite elements method (ANSYS package) is employed to model the THG assembly procedure and solve for the critical crack length and critical stress in this transient thermal structural problem. Design of experiments (DOE) is used with different cooling processes and the geometrical dimensions of the THG assembly to find the sensitivity of these parameters on the outputs.

30|$|Since {{the first}} use of mild {{hypothermia}} induction for clinical treatment by the American neurosurgeon Fay in 1938, clinical studies of mild hypothermia have been successively reported. Since the 1980 s, several studies on the application of mild hypothermia for cerebral ischemia {{have been carried out}} (Baker et al. 1991; Ridenour et al. 1992; Zausinger et al. 2000). These {{studies have shown that the}} induction of mild hypothermia between 28 and 33  °C has neuroprotective effects. In the clinic, ice blankets, ice caps, and <b>alcohol</b> sponge <b>baths</b> are often used to reduce body temperature. At the International Stroke Conference in 2010, a preliminary report of a clinical trial using endovascular hypothermia combined with intravenous thrombolysis for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke showed that mild hypothermia treatment is safe and feasible (Hemmen et al. 2010). Another study used mild hypothermia combined with interventional arterial thrombolysis for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and achieved the desired cerebral protective effects (Ding et al. 2002). Subsequently, numerous studies have confirmed that mild hypothermia after stroke can protect brain structure and function at the cellular level (De Georgia et al. 2004; Hemmen and Lyden 2007; Krieger et al. 2001; Zausinger et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2009). One meta-analysis of 101 animal experiments showed that mild hypothermia can simultaneously reduce infarct volume by 44 % on average and increase neurobehavioral scores by 46 % (van der Worp et al. 2007). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that localized mild hypothermia combined with intra-arteriovenous thrombolysis is highly effective (Chen et al. 2013; Choi et al. 2010; Guluma et al. 2006; Hong et al. 2014; Konstas et al. 2007; Piironen et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2009). Here, we found that the average infarct volume decreased from 25 to 13  cm 3 in the first 24  h for the hypothermia group, which was nearly a 50 % volume reduction. Several experimental studies have confirmed that the therapeutic effects of mild hypothermia occur through blocking of reperfusion injury. In the early stage of a cerebral infarction, mild hypothermia therapy can reduce brain tissue injury in the ischemic penumbra and improve cerebrovascular autoregulation, thereby reducing neuronal cell death. In addition, mild hypothermia can protect the blood–brain barrier, reduce cerebral edema, and decrease the influx of calcium to block its neurotoxic effects (Krieger and Yenari 2004; Rogalewski et al. 2006). In addition to the significant infarct volume reduction, average NIHSS scores at various time points were roughly 2 points lower in the hypothermia group. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. The clinical symptoms improved have three time points, and infarct volume has three time points. The average NIHSS scores for the hypothermia group at 24  h and 7  days after surgery were lower than the average pre-operation score. Although the NIHSS scores were very close at 7 days post-operation, we confirmed that the scores were true and accurately measured. The present study used a small sample size; therefore, the results could not be further analyzed by stratification of the ischemia and reperfusion duration after mild hypothermia and thrombolysis treatment. Thus, future studies should continue to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of mild hypothermia combined with intra-arteriovenous thrombolysis after cerebral infarction.|$|R

The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), the Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire (AEQ), the Concerns About Change Scale (CCS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability scale (SDES), and an addiction severity questionnaire (ASQ), were administered to 48 :residents of publicly fumed substance abuse treatment programs. Positive and negative reinforcement dimensions were created for the AEQ (AEQ-P and AEQ-N) and the CCS (CCS-P and CCS-N) using an expert rating procedure. Subjects were divided into alcohol and stimulant groups based on reported drug of choice. It was hypothesized that CCS-P would be predicted by EPQ-E and AEQ-P, and CCS-N by EPQ-N and AEQ-N. These hypotheses did not receive significant support: results indicated that BDI was the best predictor of both CCS-P and CCS-N, followed by age and SDES. These results were interpreted in terms of a response set in which a general tendency to endorse concerns about change is correlated positively with level of reported depression, and negatively with socially desirable responding and age. It was also hypothesized that the alcohol group would score higher than the stimulant group at EPQ-N, AEQ-N, am CCS-N, and lower on EPQ-E, AEQ-P, and CCS-P. The results partially supported these hypotheses. The alcohol group differed significantly from the stimulant group in terms of AEQ-N am EPQ-E. The stimulant group scored higher than the <b>alcohol</b> group on <b>bath</b> dimensions of the CCS, These results were interpreted in terms of the response set noted above. Of the CCS subscales, 12 (Problem Provides Reason for Avoidance of Responsibility) and 5 (Concern About Maturity) yielded the highest mean scores in both groups. This finding was interpreted as an indication that this population term to be composed primarily of individuals who perceive themselves as lacking adaptive skills, and who are consequently concerned about their ability to assume adult responsibilities. In conclusion, a link was hypothesized between this population am the response set noted above...|$|R
