40|$|Geophysics {{has long}} been a {{companion}} to geologic studies in Minnesota, where most of the bedrock lies beneath a thick cover of glacial drift. In 1979 the Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS), through funding by the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCMR), began an ambitious geophysical project-a state-wide program of high-resolution <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveying.</b> On the occasion of the completion of this highly successful program, the MGS through LCMR support hosted an international geophysics workshop during March 3 - 6, 1991. The main objective of the workshop was to determine how the LCMR data and other geophysical information can most effectively be used, and what sorts of new geophysical investigations are desirable for Minnesota. Such an assessment must address private, academic, and governmental needs and must consider a diversity of topics, including mineral exploration, environmental and ground-water studies, geologic mapping, and crustal studies. The recommended tasks must also be consistent with the MGS mission of geologic mapping and framework studies. Sessions were centered on near-surface studies, geologic mapping, mineral exploration, and crustal studies. Speakers were selected from diverse perspectives and included individuals from the United States, Canada, Australia, and Finland. Posters included presentations by some of the speakers, as well as other geophysicists working in the region. The workshop attracted over 100 earth scientists, representing 10 states and 4 countries, and the sessions stimulated many useful discussions and ideas. This report summarizes the workshop, and discusses some of its most important recommendations. These recommendations will help set the course for Minnesota geophysics into the 21 st century. Funding for this project approved by the Minnesota Legislature as recommended by the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources From the Minnesota Future Resources Fun...|$|E
40|$|The Cedar Mountain Complex is {{a roughly}} {{circular}} composite intrusion, 500 to 600 m in diameter, in the Archean gneiss terrane of southwestern Minnesota. Emplaced during early Proterozoic time, the complex {{consists of a}} central core of monzonite surrounded by slightly older, compositionally layered dioritic rocks. Existing geophysical and geologic data indicate that the complex may reflect a widespread igneous event that also formed the granite-rhyolite terrane of central Wisconsin. A gravity and magnetic survey was conducted over the Cedar Mountain Complex to (1) delineate the contacts which are nowhere exposed; (2) interpret {{the configuration of the}} intrusion at depth; and (3) determine what relationships the complex may have with similar intrusions in the area and determine how they might be detected geophysically. Magnetic anomaly and rock property data indicate that the dioritic rocks are the principal sources of anomalies and that they are polarized near or along the present earth's field. Magnetic anomaly data indicate an angular and irregular configuration for the diorite-gneiss contact and a somewhat rectangular configuration for the monzonite-diorite contact. Model studies of the magnetic data imply that some contacts may dip steeply outward, but most are nearly vertical. The gravity anomaly data indicate that the core monzonite may be in part underlain by dioritic rocks. The configuration of the outermost contact and the density constraints indicate forceful injection as the mechanism for emplacement of the dioritic rocks. Similar emplacement is possible for the core monzonite, but the regular configuration of the inner contact, density constraints, and gravity interpretation favor stoping out of large blocks of diorite. Upward continuation of the magnetic data indicates that gross anomaly attributes of the complex and related intrusions would be detectable by <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveying</b> using a flight-line spacing of 400 m and terrain clearance of 150 m...|$|E

40|$|Since <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveying</b> started {{immediately}} after World War II, a considerable {{area of the}} earth's surface both onshore (in excess of 25 million sq. km) has been magnetically surveyed. For about the first 15 years or so, fluxgate magnetometers were employed in aeromagnetic surveys, but the introduction of proton free-precession magnetometers resulted in absolute readings being recorded. Proton precession magnetometers have now been replaced {{to a large extent}} by the more sensitive optical absorption magnetometers. Some care has to be taken to calibrate aeromagnetic survey systems and this is best done using a calibration range tied to a magnetic observatory so that accuracies of 10 nT or better are achieved for the total field values recorded. Survey navigation has always posed a problem for aeromagnetic surveys, especially offshore. Over land, vertically pointed 35 mm cameras were initially used to recover the aircraft track using a combination of aerial photos and topographic maps. Over featureless areas, it was necessary to utilize existing electronic positioning systems such as Loran C or set up special navigation systems. The advent of the satellite-based Global Positioning Systems (GPS) has to a larger extent solved the navigational problem because there is now almost continuous worldwide coverage to 10 m accuracy in the differential mode. The resultant aeromagnetic data is normally compiled into contour maps in which the diurnal variation and aircraft heading effects are removed. The resultant digital data are normally made publicly available both in gridded and profile form along with the published contour maps. Most aeromagnetic coverage has been obtained in the developed western countries, but elsewhere a considerable amount of surveying has been carried out; as an example, some 80 percent of Africa has been surveyed mostly as a result of aid programs. The data is usually held by the national geological survey or equivalent organizations, but in a number of cases the data (e. g., for the Magnetic Anomaly Map of North America) is also held by the World Data Centres...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} and analyse {{the nature and}} behaviour of the external field variations of the geomagnetic field for quiet and moderately disturbed days using geomagnetic observatory measurements and field models. We use spherical harmonic modelling, led by available geomagnetic observatory measurements and past models (particularly the Comprehensive Model of Sabaka et al. 2004). As an initial step, we extended the lifespan of the Comprehensive Model (CM 4) beyond its 2002. 5 lifespan to allow for use of current data. We produced profile plots of the diurnal field and generated global maps {{of the field and}} compare these with the CM 4 model, to see how well the CM 4 model could reasonably predict ground variation of the diurnal field outside its lifespan and for days away from quiet time. The comparison shows that away from quiet time period, the CM 4 model is producing more reasonable predictions than expected, despite the lack of active data in the original model dataset. The CM 4 model fits the regional type features of the geomagnetic components, but not doing well predicting the short term features during period of rapid variations (seen as ‘wiggles’ in the profile plots), especially for the X- component. Also, comparing the modelled diurnal maps of the CM 4 and observatory data shows that increasing the spherical harmonic degree produces a better match between the CM 4 model and the data. Our result reveals that the external field description included in the CM 4 model could not sufficiently explain the field variation for days away from quiet time. The CM 4 model predicts the Y- and Z- components variations better than the X; {{this may be due to}} the fact that the X component is more affected by external field sources. As a result we introduced the use of an additional geomagnetic activity index (the RC index), to enable us to establish the nature of the rapid variation seen in the data for days away from quiet time. We looked for this using eigenanalysis (covariance matrices, eigenvectors and eigenvalues), detrending the data sequences with spline fits, and comparing the observatory data residuals with the RC index values. We also looked at the coherence and correlation between small scale features showing up in the rapid variation, to try to establish the global scale of the variations. We analysed this by simple running average method, correlation and cross-correlation coefficients between the residuals of the observatory data components and the RC index. Our results show that our data for days away from quiet time, particularly the X component, include a strong component in the rapid variations related to large-scale external field variation arising from the magnetospheric ring current. For example we are able to reproduce features in our plots that show a very strong coherence and correlation existing between the X component of our observatory data residuals and the RC index. This is also seen in the same components of the observatories at different locations within the same geographical region, and at some different geographical regions. This allows us to characterise the RC index as being a good representation for rapid variations globally. Also, it makes us optimistic that it may be useful to look at rapid variation observatory results for combined observatory stations as a good technique for remote referencing in <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveying...</b>|$|E
30|$|An <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> {{targeting}} the entire Kyushu area {{was conducted in}} 1981 (Okubo et al., 1985), in which the flight path spacing was 3 km and thus the resolution around Shinmoe-dake was insufficient for our purposes. In that sense, our measurement is the first attempt at a highresolution <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> focusing on Shinmoe-dake. In this paper, we introduce the <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> system using an unmanned autonomous helicopter, following {{a brief description of}} the 2011 eruption of the Shinmoe-dake volcano, Kirishima, in Kyushu, Japan. After describing the analysis method and its results, we interpret the obtained magnetization distribution and the change in magnetic field intensity.|$|R

30|$|We {{needed an}} {{observation}} method in which <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> could {{be conducted in}} the summit area without risk to human lives. For this purpose, we used an aeromag-netic survey system based on an unmanned autonomous helicopter. By using this system, {{we were able to}} conduct <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> above the summit crater in late May 2011, and late October through early November, 2011, in order to investigate the magnetization of Shinmoe-dake, and the surrounding area, and changes associated with the 2011 eruption.|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} the first <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> at Iwate volcano, northeast of Japan. Our initial and ultimate purpose is detection of geomagnetic changes by repeated <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys.</b> One cause of geomagnetic secular change is thermal effect due to magnetization changes by heat supply or dissipation. This effect {{is supposed to}} be most significant at active volcanic regions. The positioning techniques by satellite system such as GPS have promoted recent years. It becomes more applicable to geomagnetic changes, since such changes are very sensitive against the observed position. We have not carried out sufficient repeated <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> yet. Iwate volcano, however, is appropriate field for detection of magnetic changes. We introduce the outline of our survey in order to be helpful to figure out the possible problem in the future study. In addition, we discuss at some extent about obtained magnetic anomalies with mainly topography and describe the obtained knowledge at present...|$|R
5000|$|Finn Spur (...) is a rock spur 3.5 nmi km {{northeast}} of Mount Ayres {{on the north}} side of Longhurst Plateau, in the Cook Mountains of Antarctica. It was named after Carol Finn, a geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who was USGS project chief on a cooperative USGS-German <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> over the Butcher Ridge - Cook Mountains - Darwin Névé area, 1997-98, and also performed additional <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> from 1991, including seasons over the West Antarctic ice sheet from 1994 as a principal investigator and USGS project chief.|$|R

The deposit was discovered as result of an <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> of the Soldiers Cap Group in the eastern Mount Isa inlier. The area was selected for survey based upon extrapolations from known prospects and associated lithostratigraphy. In other words, the rocks {{were the same as}} other known prospects, only slightly more deeply buried. The <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> pinpointed Cannington as a potential site and subsequent drilling proved it out.|$|R

30|$|On October 31, and November 8, 2011, we again {{conducted}} an <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> over Shinmoe-dake. The flight conditions were {{almost identical to}} those of the May <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey.</b> We again measured the geomagnetic total intensity at 10 Hz, using the same magnetometer. Although the flight path was not exactly the same as for the May survey due to the difference in weather conditions, the area covered during the October-November survey is the same as in May (Fig. 3, bottom). We slightly modified the flight path so that the areas covered by coarse intervals due to bad weather conditions in May had denser flight intervals.|$|R
30|$|The {{low-level}} <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> {{was carried}} over significant urban areas and manmade structures, particularly {{over the city}} of Strasbourg, causing significant magnetic anomalies called anthropogenic anomalies. These anthropogenic anomalies are normally not removed from <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> data (Coyle et al. 2014) but were still removed {{to aid in the}} interpretation of the current study by painstaking examination of satellite imagery and manual editing of magnetic profiles. In the centre of the Strasbourg area, the shear volume of anthropogenic anomalies may have completely masked the magnetic signature of the geology underneath. An enlightened attempt to interpolate the measurements over the city centre of Strasbourg has been made, but with limited success.|$|R

40|$|Steel, was {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} additional iron ore at the company’s historic Cornwall mines near Lebanon, Pa., by means of ground magnetic surveys. Then, in 1948, the company’s Geology Department contracted with Aero Service Corporation in Philadelphia to make <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> of the major lower Mesozoic basins in Pennsylvania, because these were known hosts for several important Cornwall-type iron deposits. Technical equipment for airborne magnetometer surveys had been developed by Gulf Research and Development Company, just before World War II, and improvements were made during the war through research for the U. S. Navy, which was interested in antisubmarine detection. An Aero Service geophysicist, William Agocs, was assigned to Bethlehem Steel to help evaluate the numerous magnetic anomalies shown on the new aeromagnetic maps. Two of the most promising anomalies were near Morgantown, Berks County, and at Pine Swamp, near Warwick, Chester County. An aeromagnetic map of the Morgantown anomaly is shown in Figure 1. The map is a one of the products of <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> flown in 1957 by the U. S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, nine years after the initial surveys for Bethlehem Steel. <b>Aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> were a tremendous advance over the traditional ground magnetic surveys. They could cover large areas quickly and at modest cost, with no need for permission from landowners. They could also cover very rough terrain without difficulty. The <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> not only were important for discovering buried mineral deposits but also were helpful in mapping subsurface geology and structure, thereby becoming a standard and useful too...|$|R

In addition, the California {{part of the study}} area needs to be analytically continued downward to 305 meters (m) above ground level to provide a consistent data set for interpretation of subsurface geologic structures...|$|R

The strategy involves standard geologic and geophysical techniques but includes early deployment of high-resolution <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> to establish intra-basin fault patterns. This provides reliable information to focus deployment of more detailed and expensive geophysical surveys, and to site exploration wells.

40|$|Popocatépetl volcano is {{characterized}} by a high amplitude dipolar anomaly that is normally polarized and centered on the summit cone. The anomaly shows the effects of topographic relief and of major fault zones. Similar characteristics are documented over the Iztaccíhuatl volcanic complex, where a large composite dipolar anomaly is correlated with topography and with effects of deeper-seated source bodies. The dipolar anomaly is normally polarized over the summit elevations, with superimposed lower amplitude anomalies over the volcano flanks. An <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> over the adjacent volcanic and sedimentary terrains to the east and south of the Iztaccíhuatl-Popocatépetl complex also reflect the surface and deep geological features, with high-amplitude, high-frequency anomalies over the volcanic units and small volcanoes and low-amplitude, long-wavelength anomalies over the volcano-sedimentary deposits.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> of the Hawaiian Islands have {{revealed}} that the pr imary magnetic anomalies associated with the islands are dipole anomalies caused by the intrusive rocks of the volcanic centers and rift zones.

30|$|The {{advantages}} of an <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>survey</b> using an unmanned helicopter {{is not limited}} to being risk-free for human lives. There are two other major advantages: one is that an unmanned helicopter can fly at a much lower altitude. Due to the civil aeronautics act in Japan, the lowest flight altitude allowed for manned helicopters is 150 m, while there is no altitude limitation for our unmanned helicopter because it weighs less than 100 kg. Since the magnetic field rapidly attenuates as one over the cube of the source-receiver distance, being able to fly at low altitudes is a big advantage for obtaining data with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Another advantage is that the flight path is far more accurate. By conducting <b>aeromagnetic</b> <b>surveys</b> several times using exactly the same path, small changes in the magnetic field, and, thus, small changes in the temperature inside volcanoes, can be detected without being hidden by the noise due to inaccurate flight paths.|$|R
