5|$|Saint Botolph {{began to}} build his monastery at Icanho, now {{conclusively}} identified as Iken, Suffolk, in the year that <b>Anna</b> <b>was</b> killed, possibly to commemorate the king. <b>Anna</b> <b>was</b> succeeded in turn by his two brothers Æthelhere and Æthelwold, who may have ruled jointly. It is possible that Æthelhere was set up as a puppet ruler by Penda or was his ally, as {{he was one of}} the 30 duces that accompanied Penda when he attacked Oswiu of Northumbria at an unidentified location called the Winwæd in 655 or 656. Penda himself was killed at the Winwæd, after having steadily increased his power over a period of 13 years.

5|$|Dynastic alliances bound Æthelwold's kingdom {{strongly}} to the Christian kingdom of Kent, where Seaxburh, the eldest daughter of Æthelwold's elder brother <b>Anna,</b> <b>was</b> Eorcenberht of Kent's queen.

There was also an important Northumbrian connection: in 657, Hilda established the monastery of Streoneshalh (identified with Whitby), which later became the burial-place of Edwin and other Northumbrian kings. Hilda's sister Hereswitha married Æthelwold's youngest brother Æthelric in around 627–629.|$|E

When Anna runs out of tomato ketchup, she uses Sally's without permission, leading to a physical fight as <b>Anna</b> <b>is</b> on one side of the fence and Sally is on the other.

5|$|Ecgric's successor, Anna, {{acted as}} a {{challenge}} to the increasing power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile. <b>Anna</b> <b>was</b> strong enough to offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E

5|$|These {{developments}} {{placed the}} regency in considerable difficulties. In spite of Apokaukos' adroit {{management of the}} state's finances, the devastation caused by the prolonged wars had emptied the treasury. In August 1343, Empress <b>Anna</b> <b>was</b> forced to pawn the crown jewels to Venice for 30,000 ducats. In addition, Turkish ravages in Thrace led to a scarcity of food in Constantinople. Hoping for Western aid, Anna appealed to the Pope, promising the submission of herself, John V, Apokaukos and even the Patriarch to his authority, and began persecuting the pro-Kantakouzenists and anti-Western Palamists.|$|E

5|$|Following the battle, Santa <b>Anna</b> <b>was</b> {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E
5|$|In 631 <b>Anna</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, {{according to the}} Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth {{is said to have}} been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and the headwaters of the River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.|$|E
