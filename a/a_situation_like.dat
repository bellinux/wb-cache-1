25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{was concerned that}} <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> the Suez Crisis might repeat itself, one that would once again incite a response from the Soviets. The Americans developed a plan to force the UK into the Multilateral Force concept, a dual-key arrangement that would only allow launch if both parties agreed. If those weapons {{were part of a}} single larger force, attacking them would require attacks on the other hosting countries as well, making the prospect far less interesting. The US also feared that other countries would want to follow the UK lead and develop their own deterrent forces, leading to a proliferation problem even among their own allies. If a deterrent was being provided by a larger international force, the need for individual forces would be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Once a naval {{battle was}} underway, {{for the men}} involved, there were {{numerous}} ways for them to meet their end. Drowning {{was perhaps the most}} common way for a crew member to perish. Once a trireme had been rammed, the ensuing panic that engulfed the men trapped below deck no doubt extended the amount of time it took the men to escape. Inclement weather would greatly decrease the crew's odds of survival, leading to <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> that off Cape Athos in 411 (12 of 10,000 men were saved). An estimated 40,000 Persians died in the Battle of Salamis.

25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is {{an emotion}} that is felt in {{all stages of}} infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to get angry at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

Theobald managed to secure peace between the parties, saying that Foliot could not refuse to swear homage [...] "to the prince approved by the papacy". Foliot also attempted to hold Hereford in plurality, or at the same time, with the abbey of Gloucester, but the monks of Gloucester objected. Rather than accept <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> that of Henry of Blois, who held the Diocese of Winchester {{as well as being}} Abbot of Glastonbury, the monks of Gloucester held an election three weeks after Foliot's selection as bishop, and chose their prior as the new abbot.|$|E

He concluded that the provisions requiring that unlawful non-citizens be detained were ambiguous in that in a situation such as Al-Kateb's, where it became impossible to fulfil the purpose {{for which he was}} detained, the law was not clear as to whether {{the result is that the}} detention should be suspended until the purpose becomes possible again, or that the detention should continue indefinitely.

[...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism.

The loan would be given across three or four years, with an interest rate of 30 to 50 basis points (0.3% to 0.5%) above LIBOR. Central Bank of Iceland governor Davíð Oddsson later clarified that the loan was still being negotiated. According to RÚV, prime minister Geir Haarde had been investigating the possibility of a Russian loan since the mid-summer.

500|$|Martin is firm about {{ending the}} {{series with the}} seventh novel [...] "until I decide not to be firm".

Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> the finale of the TV series Lost, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires. In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing A Dream of Spring together with The Winds of Winter, and in early 2016, {{he said he did not}} believe A Dream of Spring would be published before the last season of the HBO show.|$|E

500|$|Amrita Daityari, {{author of}} Sourav Ganguly: the fire within, {{noted that in}} ODIs, where Ganguly usually opened the innings, he {{used to try to}} take the {{advantage}} of fielding restrictions by advancing down the pitch and hitting pace bowlers over extra cover and mid-off. She commented: [...] "Ganguly was notorious for attacking left-arm spin bowlers. Due to excellent eye–hand coordination, he was noted for picking the length of the ball early, coming down the pitch and hitting the ball aerially over mid-on or midwicket, often for a six. However, he did have a weakness in running between the wickets and judging quick singles." [...] There were many instances where Ganguly's batting partner was run out due to Ganguly's calling for a run, and then sending him back while halfway down the pitch. <b>A</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> this happened in an ODI against Australia where he took a single when on 99, but he coasted and did not ground his bat. Although the bat was past the crease, it was in the air and he was consequently run out. Ganguly said, [...] "I love to watch myself hit a cover drive, to watch myself hit a hundred." [...] Ganguly's relationship with former Indian coach John Wright has been well documented in contemporary media, with them denoting the relationship as a [...] "symbiotic process". They credited Wright and Ganguly with bringing out international class performers, through academic, coaching and scientific fitness regimens. According to Dubey, Ganguly and Wright, along {{with other members of the}} team like Tendulkar and Dravid, were the first to understand the importance of a foreign coach for the Indian cricket team and was convinced that the domestic coach has outlived its utility. Ganguly's aggressive style and Wright's importance on fitness ushered in the development of a better cricket team for India.|$|E
