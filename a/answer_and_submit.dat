40|$|This building-wide science {{enrichment}} program {{consists of a}} series of posters and accompanying questions designed to pique student interest in science concepts and their application to {{the world in which we}} live. Accompanying each poster are question sheets of increasing difficulty levels that students <b>answer</b> <b>and</b> <b>submit</b> at a designated location (collection box, office, etc.). Random prize drawings can be used to recognize/celebrate student participation. The purpose is to expose students to and create school-wide interest about science so students want to "STOP for Science" as displays are changed throughout the year. Although the focus is on enhancing building-wide science interest, content can also be linked directly to science classroom activities through use of accompanying teacher resource guides that provide science background, fun facts, typical questions and misconceptions, and several demonstrations or experiments related to the poster concepts.

The contest saddened and mortified him; he felt that he was using wrong means to obtain an end that perhaps was not right (for so his secret conscience must have told him); he was derogating from his own honour in tampering with political opinions, submitting to familiarities, condescending to stand by whilst his agents solicited vulgar suffrages or uttered claptraps about retrenchment and reform.

These figures were five times those found in similar surveys in other countries. the findings suggest a critical drinking-and-driving problem in Belo Horizonte (and probably elsewhere in Brazil) and the need for on-going research, the development of specific public policies to deal with the problem, and effective enforcement of the existing law.

40|$|Background/PurposeUnder-utilization of Papanicolaou (Pap) smear {{causes a}} gap in the {{prevention}} of cervical neoplasms. A prospective population-based study was conducted investigating whether a self-sampling human papillomavirus (HPV) test was feasible for under-users of Pap smear and factors associated with under-screening in Taiwan. MethodsWomen not having Pap smear screening for > 5 years were invited to participate in this study. Invitation letters and educational brochures were mailed to 4 % of randomly selected eligible women from Taoyuan City, Taiwan, and responders received an HPV self-sampling kit. Those with HPV-positive results were recalled for a Pap smear and colposcopy. ResultsBetween March 2010 and June 2012, 10, 693 women were invited, 354 responded (3. 3 %), and 282 (2. 6 %) gave valid informed consent, <b>answered</b> the questionnaire, <b>and</b> <b>submitted</b> HPV samples. The median age of enrolled women was 48. 1 years. Forty-seven women (16. 7 %) had a positive HPV test, and 14 women accepted further survey to find two CIN 2 +. Another two cases of CIN 2 + were identified from a national registry database. The cost of direct mailing self-samplers was less than that done on request (from NT$ 434, 866 to NT$ 164, 229, response rate of 5 % to 15 %, respectively, versus NT$ 683, 957 for detecting 1 CIN 2 +). Reasons for not attending screening included lack of time, embarrassment, assumed low risk, fear of positive results, and perceived potential pain. Among the responders, 90. 8 % found the method acceptable. ConclusionOur study indicated that different approaches (e. g., direct mailing self-samplers to under-users and/or various educational interventions) must be explored to improve coverage in populations with culture characteristics similar to Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|Testicular cancer (TC) {{is among}} the most common {{malignancies}} in the young male. Awareness plays an important role, because delay in diagnosis affects outcome. Testicular self-examination (TSE) is controversial, but recent evidence shows some cost benefits in performing this exam versus a late-stage diagnosis. The aims of this study are to determine and compare awareness for TC and TSE in males and females with the actual knowledge to this disease in an academic population. An exploratory study using an online questionnaire about TC and TSE was performed in a public university. <b>Answers</b> were collected <b>and</b> <b>submitted</b> to statistical analysis. A total of 815 participants- 507 males (62. 2  %) and 308 females (37. 7  %) -answered the survey. The participants that responded that they were aware of TC were 399 / 507 (78. 7  %) males and 275 / 308 (89. 3  %) females. About half (48. 9  %) of male and 42. 2  % of female respondents did not answered correctly to most common symptom, and only 15  % of males and 25  % of females answered to the question on age at diagnosis. Both gender subjects rated TSE as very important, and the majority of females were motivated to advise male partners or friends to perform TSE. This study reported a good awareness on TC and TSE, but comparing to the correct knowledge about this disease, results are disappointing. The actual knowledge about TC is low and comparable in men and women. Women revealed a better understanding of this disease and importance of TSE, suggesting that they can assume an important role in promoting health behaviors in men...|$|R
