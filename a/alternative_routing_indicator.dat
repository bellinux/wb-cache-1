40|$|This paper {{examines}} the routing {{implications of the}} potential shipment of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The authors describe a model {{which can be used}} to evaluate the impacts of transporting spent nuclear fuel nationally and in the State of Nevada. The authors used this model to evaluate the cross-country highway routes identified in the DOE's Final Environmental Impact Statement and three <b>alternative</b> <b>routing</b> scenarios. The authors evaluate these routing scenarios based on four attributes: counties, exposed populations, total county populations, and shipment miles. The authors further evaluate the impacts of these <b>alternative</b> <b>routing</b> scenarios on two selected corridor states.

40|$|Abstract. Ad hoc routing {{protocols}} that use broadcast for route discovery may be inefficient if the path between any source-destination pair is frequently broken. We propose and evaluate a simple mechanism that allows fast route repair in on demand ad hoc {{routing protocols}}. We apply our {{proposal to the}} Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. The proposed system {{is based on the}} Controlled Flooding (CF) framework, where alternative routes are established around the main original path between source-destination pairs. With <b>alternative</b> <b>routing,</b> data packets are forwarded through a secondary path without requiring the source to re-flood the whole network, as may be the case in AODV. We are interested in one-level <b>alternative</b> <b>routing.</b> We show that our proposal reduces the connection disruption probability as well as the frequency of broadcasts...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a random sequence of calls between nodes {{in a complete}} network with link capacities. Each call first tries the direct link. If that link is saturated, then the 'First-fit dynamic <b>alternative</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm' sequentially selects up to d random two-link alternative routes, and assigns the call to the first route with spare capacity on each link, {{if there is such}} a route. The 'Balanced dynamic <b>alternative</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm' simultaneously selects d random two-link alternative routes; and the call is accepted on a route minimising the maximum of the loads on its two links, provided neither of these two links is saturated.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{performance}} of a variant of the standard Dynamic <b>Alternative</b> <b>Routing</b> (DAR) technique commonly used in telephone and ATM networks to a path selection algorithm that is based on the balanced allocations principle [4, 18] - the Balanced Dynamic <b>Alternative</b> <b>Routing</b> (BDAR) algorithm. While the standard technique checks alternative routes sequentially until available bandwidth is found, the BDAR algorithm compares and chooses the best among a small number of alternatives. We show that, at the expense of a minor increase in routing overhead, the BDAR gives a substantial improvement in network performance in terms of both network congestion and blocking probabilities. 1 Introduction Fast, high bandwidth, circuit switching telecommunications systems such as ATM and telephone networks employ a limited path selection algorithm in order to fully utilize the network resources while minimizing routing overhead.

40|$|Routing in {{cognitive}} radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) is {{a daunting task}} owing to dynamic topology, intermittent connectivity, spectrum heterogeneity, and energy constraints. Other prominent aspects such as channel stability, path reliability, and route discovery frequency should also be exploited. Several routing protocols have been proposed for CRAHNs in the literature. By stressing {{on one of the}} aspects more than any other, however, they do not satisfy all requirements of throughput, energy efficiency, and robustness. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and robust multipath routing (ERMR) protocol for CRAHNs by considering all prominent aspects including residual energy and channel stability in design. Even when the current routing path fails, the <b>alternative</b> <b>routing</b> path is immediately utilized. In establishing primary and <b>alternative</b> <b>routing</b> paths, both residual energy and channel stability are exploited simultaneously. Our simulation study shows that the proposed ERMR outperforms the conventional protocol in terms of network throughput, packet delivery ratio, energy consumption, and end-to-end delay...|$|R
