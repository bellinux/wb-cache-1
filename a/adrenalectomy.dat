25|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is a minor}} {{contributor}} to total circulating catecholamines (L-DOPA is at a higher concentration in the plasma), though it contributes over 90% of circulating epinephrine. Little epinephrine is found in other tissues, mostly in scattered chromaffin cells. Following <b>adrenalectomy,</b> epinephrine disappears below the detection limit in the blood stream.|$|E
25|$|Low, or absent, {{concentrations}} of epinephrine {{can be seen}} in autonomic neuropathy or following <b>adrenalectomy.</b> Failure of the adrenal cortex, as with Addisons disease, can suppress epinephrine secretion as the activity of the synthesing enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, depends on the high concentration of cortisol that drains from the cortex to the medulla.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} some newer {{approaches}} to optimizing growth have been researched and {{are beginning to}} be used. It is possible to reduce the effects of androgens on the body by blocking the receptors with an antiandrogen such as flutamide and by reducing the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This conversion is mediated by aromatase and can be inhibited by aromatase blockers such as testolactone. Blocking the effects and conversions of estrogens will allow use of lower doses of glucocorticoids with less risk of acceleration of bone maturation. Other proposed interventions have included bilateral <b>adrenalectomy</b> to remove the androgen sources, or growth hormone treatment to enhance growth.|$|E

2500|$|Glucocorticoids {{have also}} been shown to have a {{significant}} impact on vigilance (attention deficit disorder) and cognition (memory). This appears to follow the Yerkes-Dodson curve, as studies have shown circulating levels of glucocorticoids vs. memory performance follow an upside-down U pattern, much like the Yerkes-Dodson curve. For example, long-term potentiation (LTP; the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated, whereas significant decreases of LTP are observed after <b>adrenalectomy</b> (low-GC state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high-GC state). Elevated levels of glucocorticoids enhance memory for emotionally arousing events, but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal. In contrast to the dose-dependent enhancing effects of glucocorticoids on memory consolidation, these stress hormones have been shown to inhibit the retrieval of already stored information. Long-term exposure to glucocorticoid medications, such as asthma and anti-inflammatory medication, has been shown to create deficits in memory and attention both during and, to a lesser extent, after treatment, a condition known as [...] "steroid dementia." ...|$|E
50|$|Nelson’s {{syndrome}} is {{also referred to}} as post <b>adrenalectomy</b> syndrome and is a result of an <b>adrenalectomy</b> performed for Cushing’s disease.

Corticotroph adenomas are also detected in the younger population compared to the older population. Earlier, Nelson's syndrome was observed in 20-40% of patients who had a bilateral <b>adrenalectomy</b> with a pituitary adenoma.

50|$|Common causes include {{bilateral}} <b>adrenalectomy</b> for {{the treatment}} of Cushing's disease, and hypopituitarism.

A preventative measure that can be utilized is prophylactic radiotherapy when a bilateral <b>adrenalectomy</b> is being performed in order to prevent Nelson's syndrome from manifesting. Screening can also be done with the help or an MRI in order to visualize the pituitary for tumors. If tumors are not present then an MRI should be performed at intervals. Hyper-pigmentation and fasting ACTH levels within plasma above 154 pmol/l are predictive of Nelson's syndrome after an <b>adrenalectomy.</b> Risk factors include being younger in age and pregnancy.|$|E
