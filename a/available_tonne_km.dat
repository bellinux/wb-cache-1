40|$|This paper {{describes}} the seasonal and spatial variations of diffusive sediment- water ammonium fluxes {{in the western}} part of the Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic). It assesses the potential environmental controls of these fluxes, such as the inflow of organic matter to bottom sediments and its quality, temperature-induced degradation of organic matter, and the redox potential of sediments. Ammonium fluxes, calculated using Fick's first law, were always in the direction from the sediment into the water column and differed significantly with respect to sediment type. Fluxes were most intensive in sediments with the highest silt-clay fraction located in the deepest parts of the study area. The mean annual diffusive fluxes of ammonium from sediments to near-bottom water were estimated at 5. 24 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> - 2 year - 1 for silty-clays, 1. 85 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> - 2 year - 1 for silty-sands and 1. 03 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> - 2 year - 1 for sandy sediments. There was a high seasonal variation, with the greatest ammonium release in summer and early autumn, when the temperature of near-bottom water was the highest. On the basis of the calculated diffusive ammonium fluxes, we estimated that approximately 2700 tonnes of N-NH 4 + are released annually from the surface sediments of the western part of the Gulf of Gdansk, providing a minimum of 10 % of the mineral nitrogen essential for primary production in surface waters. Our results are undoubtedly underestimated, as we disregarded advective ammonium fluxes, which in some areas of the Gulf of Gdansk could well be comparable to diffusive fluxes...|$|R
40|$|Background: CO 2 {{emissions}} from cleared mangrove areas may be substantial, increasing {{the costs of}} continued losses of these ecosystems, particularly in mangroves that have highly organic soils. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured CO 2 efflux from mangrove soils that had been cleared for up to 20 years on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We also disturbed these cleared peat soils to assess what disturbance of soils after clearing may have on CO 2 efflux. CO 2 efflux from soils declines from time of clearing from, 10 600 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> 22 year 21 {{in the first year}} to 3000 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> 2 year 21 after 20 years since clearing. Disturbing peat leads to short term increases in CO 2 efflux (27 umol m 22 s 21), but this had returned to baseline levels within 2 days. Conclusions/Significance: Deforesting mangroves that grow on peat soils results in CO 2 emissions that are comparable to rates estimated for peat collapse in other tropical ecosystems.

40|$|Estuaries in {{tropical}} Australia {{have a low}} sediment yield (about 5 - 20 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> - 2 yr - 1). The estuaries formed when rising post-glacial sea level invaded coastal valleys 7 to 9000 years ago. Geomorphological and stratigraphic data show that mangrove swamps developed on the flooded plains {{and in some cases}} their substrate kept pace with the rising sea level. The bulk of the sediment originated from the sea. When sea level stabilised, 6000 years ago, the flood plains prograded seaward. The channels now are generally stable and in some cases are inherited from the progradation phase. The response of these estuaries to a sea level rise may be inferred both from their evolution during post glacial sea level rise and from hydrodynamics-sedimentological models calibrated against measurements of tidal processes. This was undertaken for Coral Creek, the South Alligator River and the Norman River in north Australia. Modelling indicates that a future sea level rise will generate changes in the dynamics and channel dimensions which mimic post glacial changes. In the macrotidal South Alligator the floodplain will revert to mangrove, the mouth region will widen and sediment will move upstream and onto the floodplain. In the mesotidal, diurnal Norman the channel will widen throughout and sediment will be transported seawards. In Coral Creek the mangrove will retreat landwards...|$|R
40|$|Transferring {{the freight}} burden from road to railwould bring about many {{environmental}} benefits. The Rail Contribution to the Energy Review (Dept. for Transport 2006) indicated that rail freight produces eight times less CO 2 per <b>tonne.</b> <b>km</b> than road freight. Implementing this strategy successfully will require {{further development of}} rail infrastructure to cope with additional capacity. Many new proposals, such as the EuroRail Freight Route, would utilise redundant and under-used infrastructure, much of which was constructed during {{the latter part of}} the nineteenth century.

40|$|Problem statement: A {{sediment}} analysis {{study was}} conducted at the Chini River on 16 and 31 August 2008. This {{study was conducted}} to review the formation of suspended sediment load in the Lake Chini catchment area, which flows into the Pahang River via the Chini River. Approach: Three sampling stations were chosen, the first one at upstream Chini River (S 1), mid-stream Chini River (S 2) and downstream Chini River (S 3). Three parameters were quantified for this study, namely: distribution of sediment grain size (g), concentration of suspended sediment (mg L - 1) and river discharge values (in m 3 sec - 1). Results: The findings of the study show that the sizes of sediment fall between phi Ø- 1. 00 and phi Ø- 2. 00 with very rough particle sizes falling between phi- 1. 00 and phi 0. 00. At the study area, the daily discharge value is estimated at 722, 304, 00 L day - 1. The average suspended sediment concentration recorded for each station shows varying values for both timelines. The values were 27. 33 mg L - 1 on 16 / 08 / 08 and 2. 233 mg L - 1 on 31 / 08 / 08. Conclusion: The average value for all stations calculated based on the formation of suspended sediment load per day falls between 16, 480. 4627 kg day - 1 on 16 / 08 / 08 and 1, 540. 43 kg day - 1 on 31 / 08 / 08.

40|$|Three {{different}} {{energy analysis}} approaches (energy and embodied energy, exergy and emergy analysis) {{have been applied}} to the road and railway systems of a medium size district of central Italy, in order {{to shed light on}} the dynamics of the local transport sector and develop a tool for analysis capable of taking the system complexity into account. Road and railway systems, respectively, support passenger flows of 3. 57 E 9 p-km (passengers per km) per year and 0. 17 E 9 p-km per year and commodity flows of 2. 5 E 9 t-km (<b>tonnes</b> per <b>km)</b> per year and 0. 35 E 9 t-km per year, generating a total energy consumption equal to 1. 84 E 5 tonnes of oil equivalent per year. The passenger mass transport on road (buses) shows globally the best performance among the patterns investigated, while railway ranks higher for commodity transport, according to most of the calculated intensity indicators. Several improvement options are also evaluated {{on the basis of the}} first- and second-order exergy efficiency. Some of the suggested improvements, even showing high theoretical possibility, do not match the transport needs of the investigated area, as indicated by their huge material and emergy intensities (measures of ecological footprints) even if it cannot be excluded that they may appear more appropriate to nationwide transportation patterns. In conclusion, although data and indicators refer to a well identified region under specific geographic and socio-economic conditions, results suggest that a complex system such as transport is very unlikely to be described by a linear relation between input resource and output service delivered. Even when thermodynamically based approaches are properly used to describe the system behavior, findings very often do not converge, and require that different indicators are compared to yield a comprehensive picture of the system dynamics. An integrated approach is therefore suggested to support decision making in the presence of diverging results...|$|R
40|$|Seagrasses {{provide an}} {{important}} habitat for gillfish, crustacea and migratory birds. Extensive losses of seagrass in the Northern Hemisphere have occurred since the 1930 's {{in what has}} been described as a 'wasting disease'. More recently, point-source contamination by nutrient inflows, herbicides (anti-fouling agents used on commercial shipping), heavy metals and fresh water inflows have helped explain localised losses of seagrass amounting to 20 % in the case of Adelaide's metropolitan coastline, South Australia. However, losses of seagrass acreage have also occurred in regions that are far removed from anthropogenic activity and these are less easily explained by pointsource contamination. Intertidal seagrasses, such as Zostera muelleri, are subjected to environmental pressures imposed on them by the marine and terrestrial environments. For the purpose of this thesis, the intertidal environment is regarded as a complex of several components or micro-environments, each imposing a selective pressure or stress upon seagrass. The many stress factors create a tolerance zone in which Z. muelleri can survive. Zostera muelleri has adapted its physiology and biochemistry to the selective pressures that operate within the intertidal region. Zostera muelleri's internal leaf morphology has many gas storage compartments (lacunae) that extend from the leaves to the roots of the plants and its photosynthetic biochemistry has also adapted to the intertidal region enabling the sequestering of carbon under conditions of high irradiance and temperatures. It is evident from the literature that the survival of intertidal seagrasses requires effective photosynthesis. It is also evident that events that interfere with the synthesis, translocation and release of photosynthesised oxygen from the roots of Z. muelleri will compromise seagrass survival. The present study has revealed that herbicides, used in broad- acre farming, can be transported to the intertidal environment and negatively impact upon Z. muelleri. Extensive studies by others have shown that transport mechanisms, such as 'spray drift' and 'run-off', can move herbicides from their point of usage. However, 'dust' (wind-eroded soil) as a transport mechanism for herbicides to the intertidal environment is less well studied. This is surprising, inasmuch as there is a known rate of pedogenesis in Adelaide of five to ten <b>tonnes</b> per <b>km</b> 2 per annum from the accretion of dust. Results of the present study suggest that farmed soils of the Yorke Peninsula have a range of potentials to form fine particulate matter ('dust') and this potential is likely determined by the soil type and farming practices. Soil surface applied herbicides, such as 2, 4 -D, are 'lost' from land at 5 % of the applied rate while soil-incorporated herbicides, such as treflan (trifluralin), are lost at 1. 5 % of the applied rate. Indeed, such herbicides can be transported as dust for tens to thousands of kilometres. Instrumental analytical techniques used in the present study have detected 2, 4 -D, trifluralin and sulfonylurea herbicides on whole soil. Additionally, 2, 4 -D- like chemicals have also been detected in whole soil and in dust obtained from whole soil. Bioassay techniques using Z. muelleri have shown that its photosynthetic pathways are negatively impacted upon by micromolar concentrations of 2, 4 -D that are similar to the known losses of this herbicide from land. It is concluded that, at these concentrations, 2, 4 -D acts as an auxin, up-regulating growth in affected plants. Such up-regulation is unlikely to be problematic in terrestrial plants since gas flows to the external environment are largely controlled by stomata. However, seagrasses lack stomata and the auxin-like activity of 2, 4 -D appears to have a negative impact on Z. muelleri. This is probably caused by an up - regulation in oxygen production and a subsequent oxygen-inhibition of a key enzyme (ribulose 1, 5 - bisphosphate carboxylase, RUBISCO) used in the carbon-sequestering photosynthetic process. The proposed inhibition of RUBISCO is then likely to cause a carbon deficit and a subsequent energy deficit within affected plants. One interpretation of the results presented is that Z. muelleri simply outgrows its intertidal environment after a transient exposure to an auxin-like concentration of 2, 4 -D. With increasing use of auxin-like herbicides, and the associated increasing stress imposed on photosynthetic processes, it is likely that further negative impacts will occur on intertidal seagrass species. Continued depletion of seagrass acreage will further adversely affect fishing yields unless appropriate measures are not taken. Closer collaboration between regulators, farm managers and herbicide manufacturers is now necessary in order to minimise the negative impact of herbicides on intertidal species. Thesis (M. App. Sc.)

40|$|Les résultats d'analyse graphique des valeurs instantanées des débits solides en {{suspension}} dans le cours d'eau de l'Oued Mouilah et leurs relations avec les débits liquides, durant les compagnes de prélèvements de 1977 à 1993, ont permis de montrer l'existence de deux périodes d'érosion actives. Le flux des matières solides en suspension dans le cours d'eau est très variable d'une année à une autre et la dégradation spécifique moyenne annuelle sur les 16 années d'étude est estimée à 126 <b>tonnes</b> par <b>km</b> 2. Cette valeur est relativement faible {{par rapport}} à celles trouvées pour d'autres régions à régime hydrologique similaire. The extent {{and rates of}} alluvial deposit and dam siltation caused by sediment deposition from Maghreb streams have prompted a number of attempts to quantify and explain the complex mechanisms of suspended sediment transport. In Algeria, a country with scarce water resources, deposition of sediments in dams is estimated to average 20 million m 3 /year, which contributes to a 0. 3 % yearly loss of storage capacity from a total capacity estimated at 6. 2 billion m 3. Of interest in this context are suspended sediment loads in Mediterranean Algeria's Mouilah River, on which is built the Hammam Boughrara, a 117 million-m 3 capacity dam put into service in 1998. The Mouilah River basin, situated in northwest Algeria, covers a 2650 -km 2 area and has a 230 -km perimeter (Table I). The Mouilah runs along 124 km, rising {{at an altitude of}} 1250 m in Algeria then flowing into Morocco. It is ephemeral; perennial flow sets in near Oujda (Morocco), below which it re-enters Algeria near Maghnia (Figure 1). The study zone is characterized by a semi-arid climate. From 1977 to 1993, annual mean temperature was 16. 7 °C. Rainfall was relatively scarce and unequally distributed throughout the year, with an inter-annual average of 300 mm over the same period (Figure 2). Analysis of hydrological dataThe study used instantaneous water discharge values (m 3 /s) measured {{at the mouth of the}} Mouilah from September 1977 to August 1993 (results calculated and furnished by the National Agency of Hydric Resources [ANRH]). For measured values, suspended loads (g/l) were evaluated using samples taken from the river: total suspended loads were calculated as the product of these concentrations and water discharge. The number of samples was adapted to the hydrological regime: They were taken every other day or, during flood periods, as frequently as quarter-hourly. Analysis of the instantaneous discharges showed that suspended loads were related to discharge by a power law (Figure 3). To study the responses of the basin over the hydrological year, we grouped the results - 16 years' worth of data - according to season, and analysed the relationship between liquid discharge and suspended sediment load (Table II). Graphical analysis of Figure 4 reveals that autumn and the spring are distinguished by strong river discharges leading to important transport of solids. The maximum flow of solids was about 104 000 kg/s, resulting from a water discharge of 1880 m 3 /s in November 1986. By contrast, winter and summer discharges were much smaller; values did not exceed 220 m 3 /s in winter and 83 m 3 /s in summer. After the dry season, the first rains of autumn encounter dry, hard and barely erodible soil. The response of the basin in terms of suspended-solids generation is therefore very small. It is the heavy rains of October and November that remove large quantities of solids transportable by streams. After the very dry and cool winter and a succession of freezes and thaws, spring rains fall on poorer soil, leading to relatively high loads, though still lesser than those of autumn. Summer is marked by very dispersed values encompassing the smallest discharges of the year and some relatively high suspended loads associated with low discharges, the latter arising from seasonal storms. In summary, stream discharge is very variable throughout the hydrological year. Suspended sediment transport in the Mouilah River basin occurs principally during flood periods. We distinguished two periods of active erosion, one in autumn and another, lesser period in spring. Annual contributions An annual balance sheet of solid and liquid contributions shows that these two parameters vary regularly and as a function of rainfall (Figure 5). Annual liquid contributions from 1977 to 1993 were evaluated at 48. 7 million m 3, which corresponds to a mean flood depth of 18. 4 mm, and a low flow coefficient of 6 %. Due to very dispersed and extreme values and variability, rainfall-discharge relations are varied. This leads to inter-annual irregularity for flood depths: consequently, a relationship with annual rainfalls (Figure 6) was difficult to establish. However, we noted a tendency of the form: LE= 0. 0009 P 1. 69 (R= 0. 74). The annual mean contribution of suspended sediment at the mouth of the river was estimated at 335 000 tons, which corresponds to a soil erosion rate of 126 tons/km 2 /year. This value is moderate compared to other basins of the region, such as the Mazafran (Algiers) and Isser (Lakhdaria) river basins, where erosion rates are about 1610 and 2300 tons/km 2 /year, respectively (Table III). The inter-annual solid and liquid contributions contrast markedly. Indeed, for liquid contributions, the first and third quartiles are 21. 8 and 64. 7 million m 3, respectively, which shows that 25 % of the annual moduli representing humid years were three times more important than those representing dry years (Figure 7). Furthermore, in annual loads expressed as stream turbidity, variation between the temperate and arid reaches of the stream is apparent. Figure 8 shows that the highest annual liquid contribution, 117. 8 million m 3, was recorded during the year 1979 - 80, and generated a solid contribution of 670 000 tons. This liquid contribution is higher than that of 1986 - 87, evaluated at 106. 4 million m 3, which carried 2. 69 million tons - an erosion rate of more than 1000 tons/km 2 /year...|$|R
