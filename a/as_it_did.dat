5|$|Both the Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS {{versions}} were {{criticized for}} {{limiting the number}} of players to two. The Windows version was particularly criticized <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not allow for online play, a feature available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 releases, nor would receive the downloadable content for the game. The lack of multiplayer in the pulled iOS version was lamented though the other facets of the game's humor remained.|$|E

5|$|Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' {{isolation}} and {{dependence on the}} bounty {{of the natural world}} meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Philippe {{initially}} {{formed to}} the east of the Lesser Antilles on September 17 and moved to the north strengthening <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> so. Philippe became a hurricane on September 18 and stayed as such for two days before increasing wind shear from a non-tropical system took its toll on September 20 and weakened Philippe into a tropical storm. Philippe continued to weaken as it looped around this low and was absorbed by it on September 23.|$|E

5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Mafia of Villalba was of {{relatively}} recent origin, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not go back}} to the 1860s, considered to be the period when the Mafia emerged around Palermo. It started as a form of private protection and {{has little to do with}} large estates as was the case in many other rural areas where many mafiosi started as caretakers and lease-holders (gabelloto or bailiff) for absentee landlords.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at the National Hurricane Center, in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17mph (28km/h), intensifying <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|After this NSS {{decided not}} to obtain many {{additional}} restaurants, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not see value in such a strategy. From 1930 through 1934 the company took over restaurants at Ål, Jaren, Lillestrøm and Tønsberg, along with dining service on the steamship Skibladner, which ran on Mjøsa. During {{the first half of}} the 1940s it again acquired new restaurants, including the one at Kristiansand Station. In 1940 and 1941 the company made a solid profit, but lack of food from 1942 onwards transformed the profit to a loss. During the late 1940s NSS also took over the restaurants at Drammen and Sarpsborg, as well as the one at Oslo Airport, Fornebu.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in urban areas. Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> during the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, {{from the beginning of the}} 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Bloodless {{heart surgery}} was pioneered by American surgeon Denton Cooley. It was also {{performed}} by doctor Jerome Kay in Los Angeles and the procedure soon {{spread around the}} world. Panday, who trained under the Canadian surgeon Wilfred Gordon Bigelow, adopted the technique and tailored it to Indian conditions. He performed bloodless open heart surgeries at KEM in the 1970s and 1980s. Bloodless heart surgery was cost-effective in India, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not require blood transfusions, reduced the chances of infection in case of infected blood, and further reduced postoperative costs. Bloodless heart surgery was also performed on Jehovah's Witnesses, as they refused donated blood.|$|E

The Belgians refused to yield but Montgomery claimed to have got his way by placing himself under the command of the Belgian forces, knowing that when the Germans came within artillery range the Belgians would withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the district's mines, the Wells Fargo office was used as a {{residence}} by Alex and Mayme Colbath until the 1950s. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 11, 1971, and currently serves as an art gallery and a museum. The Rice Building burned down, and was rebuilt in 1991. The Cosmopolitan Restaurant was reconstructed to appear <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> in the 19th century, and it served European cuisine until it was closed in 2010. There are many remnants of houses and other buildings, and there are also markers indicating where some buildings once stood, such as the Elk Horn Saloon. Some of the area has been preserved for its history.|$|E
5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.|$|E
