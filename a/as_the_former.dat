5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is ring species.|$|E
