30|$|Recently, {{researchers}} proposed QoS+ (beyond {{the usual}} QoS) parameters for TR models in Cloud environments [12]. These parameters are identified {{based on the}} state-of-the-art survey of threats and risks discussed in [12]. Moreover, a recent article [3] published a list of functional and non-functional trust <b>affectors</b> based on a extensive survey conducted among the Cloud entities. This survey clearly shows the consumers’ interest and need of reckoning the trust <b>affectors</b> for establishing trust on Cloud providers. The QoS+ parameters map quite closely to the trust <b>affectors</b> identified in the survey article. The mapping shows the usefulness and absolute need of such parameters for selecting trustworthy service providers in Cloud environments. Therefore, considering the cloud-specific parameters (i.e., QoS+) for trust models in Cloud environments in turn support the consumers to know the capabilities and competencies of the CPs before interacting with them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of direction-correlations to improve branch prediction. There {{are two types of}} direction-correlation: <b>affectors</b> and affectees. This work considers for the first time their implications at a basic level. These correlations are determined based on dataflow graph information and are used to select the subset of global branch history bits used for prediction. If this subset is small then <b>affectors</b> and affectees can be useful to cut down learning time, and reduce aliasing in prediction tables. This paper extends previous work explaining why and how correlation-based predictors work by analyzing the properties of direction-correlations. It also shows that branch history selected using oracle knowledge of direction-correlations improves the accuracy of the limit and realistic conditional branch predictors, that won at the recent branch prediction contest, by up to 30 % and 17 % respectively. The findings in this paper call for the investigation of predictors that can learn efficiently correlations from long branch history that may be non-consecutive with holes between them. ...|$|R

5000|$|RGS2 {{is thought}} to have {{protective}} effects against myocardial hypertrophy as well as atrial arrhythmias. Increased stimulation of Gs coupled β1-adrenergic receptors and Gq coupled α1-adrenergic receptors in the heart can result in cardiac hypertrophy. In the case of Gq protein coupled receptor (GqPCR) mediated hypertrophy, Gαq will activate the intracellular <b>affectors</b> phospholipase Cβ and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor to stimulate cell processes which lead to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. RGS2 functions as a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) which acts to increase the natural GTPase activity of the Gα subunit. [...] By increasing the GTPase activity of the Gα subunit, RGS2 promotes GTP hydrolysis back to GDP, thus converting the Gα subunit back to its inactive state and reducing its signalling ability. Both GsPCR and GqPCR activation can contribute to cardiac hypertrophy via activation of MAP Kinases as well. RGS2 has been shown to decrease phosphorylation of those MAP kinases and therefore decrease their activation in response to Gαs signalling.|$|R
40|$|Deep {{pipelines}} {{and fast}} clock rates are necessitating {{the development of}} high accuracy, multi-stage branch predictors for future processors. Such a predictor uses a collection of predictors, each of which provides its predictions at a different stage of the pipeline front-end. A simple 1 -cycle latency line predictor provides predictions in the first stage, followed {{in a couple of}} stages later by predictions from a more accurate global predictor. Finally, one or two stages later, a highly accurate corrector predictor selectively corrects the global predictor’s prediction. As the corrector predictor has the final say, its accuracy must be very high. The focus {{of this paper is to}} propose and evaluate techniques to build high-accuracy corrector predictors. Our techniques rely on using a long global history, and identifying correlated branches in this history by using runtime dataflow information. In particular, we identify for each dynamic branch a set of branches called “affectors”, which control the computation that affect that branch’s outcome. We propose efficient hardware structures to track dataflow and to identify the <b>affector</b> branches for each dynamic branch; the hardware overhead for identifying affectors for all dynamic branches from a 64 branch global history is only 312 bytes. We then propose two prediction schemes that put to use the <b>affector</b> branch information. Experimental studies show that adding an 8 KB corrector predictor (that uses <b>affector</b> information) to a 16 KB perceptron predictor (total size 24. 2 KB) reduces the average misprediction rate for 12 benchmarks from 6. 3 % to 5. 7 %, an improvement achieved only by a 64 KB perceptron predictor. 1...|$|E

The model has three levels: 1) an ecosystem model that identifies five spheres (Atmosphere, Biosphere, Hydrosphere, Lithosphere, Sociocultural), 2) sphere models that identify key ecosystem processes (e. g., photosynthesis), and 3) key process models that identify the "essential elements " that are required for the process to operate (e. g., solar radiation), the human activities ("affectors") that have negative and positive effects on the elements (e. g., air pollution), and the "consequences "of <b>affectors</b> acting on essential elements (e. g., change in primary productivity).

40|$|Background: The {{pathophysiology}} {{of obesity}} and {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus is associated with abnormalities in endocrine signaling in adipose tissue {{and one of the}} key signaling <b>affectors</b> operative in these disorders is the nuclear hormone transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c (PPARc). PPARc has pleiotropic functions affecting a wide range of fundamental biological processes including the regulation of genes that modulate insulin sensitivity, adipocyte differentiation, inflammation and atherosclerosis. To date, {{only a limited number of}} direct targets for PPARc have been identified through research using the well established pre-adipogenic cell line, 3 T 3 -L 1. In order to obtain a genome-wide view of PPARc binding sites, we applied the pair end-tagging technology (ChIP-PET) to map PPARc binding sites in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocyte cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: Coupling gene expression profile analysis with ChIP-PET, we identified in a genome-wide manner over 7700 DNA binding sites of the transcription factor PPARc and its heterodimeric partner RXR during the course of adipocyte differentiation. Our validation studies prove that the identified sites are bona fide binding sites for both PPARc and RXR and that they are functionally capable of driving PPARc specific transcription. Our results strongly indicate that PPARc is the predominant heterodimerization partner for RXR during late stages of adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, we find that PPARc/RXR association is enriched within the proximity of the 59 region of the transcription start site and thi...|$|R

Notably, the MDM 2 homolog MDMX facilitates the inhibition of MDM 2 E 3 ligase activity by S 7. Further, ablation of S 7 inhibits MDM 2 and p 53 accumulation induced by different stress signals in some cell types. Thus, ribosomal/nucleolar stress is likely a key inte-grating event in DNA damage signaling to p 53. Inter-estingly, S 7 is itself a substrate for MDM 2 E 3 ligase activityboth in vitroand in vivo. AnS 7 -ubiquitin fusion protein (S 7 -Ub) selectively inhibits MDM 2 degrada-tion of p 53 and is unaffected by MDMX. S 7 -Ub promotesapoptosis to agreater extent thanS 7 alone.

A time delay associated with the mechanical response of the valves is incorporated into the model to reflect the finite time required to open or close the valves.

40|$|Many {{different}} cell types {{respond to}} substrate elasticity as sensitively as more well studied soluble or immobilized ligands, yet {{mechanisms by which}} mechanical cues are transduced to cells have been far less explored. Sufficient substrate stiffness, i. e. [...] -Young 2 ̆ 7 s Modulus E, appears important to anchorage-dependent, contractile cells, relying on finite resistance to cell-generated forces to induce outside-in mechanical signals and maintain cell function. Muscle cells, in particular, transmit large actomyosin contractions to surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), appearing mechanochemically sensitive very early as cell adhesion depends on substrate compliance and adhesive ligand density; limited spreading on soft gels (E ∼ 1 kPa) is surprisingly insensitive to adhesive ligand density. On rigid matrices or substrates, cells produce isometric contractile efforts not conducive to cell function; in contrast, a more compliant matrix, i. e. [...] -a collagen or polyacrylamide gel, permits cell contractions. Thus, longer-term cultures indicate that muscle cell striation and cardiomyocyte function is stiffness sensitive, with an intermediate range similar to passive muscle (Emuscle ∼ 8 [...] 12 kPa) being most favorable. Remarkably, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation also appears mechanosensitive, with cells adopting a myoblast-like elongation and expressing myogenic markers on substrates only near ESk Muscle, while matrices 10 -fold softer or several fold stiffer generate cells which commit to neuronal or osteogenic lineages, respectively. Incomplete expression by mechanosensing is augmented by growth factors thus inducing full differentiation; chemical or physical stimulus alone cannot, and when altered, as in fibrotic scarring post-myocardial infarct, cell therapies are ineffective at regenerating functional tissue as the physical microenvironment inhibits contraction. ^ Underlying these mechanosensitive observations are key signaling 2 ̆ 7 sets-points. 2 ̆ 7 Cytoskeletal proteins expression and phosphorylation, myosin II contractility and organization, and Rho-GTPases and their <b>affectors</b> when perturbed, alter cell function and can be fit to novel biphasic mechanochemical functions to explain the coupling observed in muscle and stem cells. Gene expression arrays and site specific amino acid labels from these cells implicate several mechanically active proteins and signaling pathways. Overall, our data implies that, in addition to soluble or immobilized ligands, tissue and/or matrix elasticity and structure is critical for musculoskeletal cell signaling, development, and subsequent therapies. ...|$|R

Many {{patients}} {{are not able}} to get a transplant, but even those who recieved it, may undergo painful process of organ rejection and be on the transplant waiting list again. Organ transplants shortage is severe problem in current medicine that has many ethical and medical issues. To solve this problem, the new direction in regenerative medicine was formed, organ prinitng. The main goal of organ printing is fabrication of organ replacements that would mimic the original ones in terms of complexity and functionality. By direct fabrication and maturation of organs in vitro, the problem of organ shortage can be solved, moreover, based on the advances in cell therapy, these organs can be printed with patients own cells, which will eliminte the problem of transplant rejection. Organ printing is multistep and complex process, composed of three main steps: tissue design, or theoretical modelling of replacement composition; tissue fabrication, or direct cell encapsulation and controlled assembly of building units; at last, tissue maturation to reach desirable functionality of the replacement. In the past decade, there was developed a variety of methods for the second step of organ printing, cell encapsulation, which is practicaly the main procedure for tissue fabrication. However, all these methods of cell encapsulation are complex and they might affect cells viability and functionality, which will result in changed tissue function. Thus, starting from the detailed analysis of the tissue fabrication process (encapsulation and assembly methods) the list of possible cell behavior <b>affectors</b> was composed. Based on this list, we designed a multistep protocol for coherent evaluation of cells behavior parameters, in terms of viability, functionality and activity during the tissue fabrication and its maturation steps. Three main materials were used for this study, two naturally (alginate and modified gelatin) and one synthetically (polyethilene glycol) derived polymers. 3 The encapsulation step was performed with two different methods based on chemical or photo crosslinking of the material. Cell parameteres were evaluated on the molecular level for variety of parameters, including viability, activity, proliferation, stress markers expression, at last ability to adapt artificial environment to the cell functional niche with extracellular matrix markers expression, and proteoglycans. The innovation of the presented study consists in the developing a unique protocol for detailed cell functionality evaluation during the organ printing procedures. In fact, based on the conducted study, it was proved the safety of the encapsulation methods. Moreover, based on the cell parameters post-encapsulation, there was suggested the optimal time for tissue maturation for application of the fabricated structures in organ printing, but also in other fileds, like developmental and pathological biology, or drug screening. Eventully, a novel way of simple blocks assembly into 3 D complex structures was developed and proved to be safe for cell parameters. At last, for the future research in organ printing, a detailed study over a cell behavior and functionality has to be performed for every fabrication method, what will improve the organ production process drastically...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop and administer a series of treatments that resulted in evidence of Visual Problem Solving ability changes and increased levels of visual differentiation in children. Piaget has posited the possibility of a lag in the exhibition of new percepts in observable form due to psychomotor limitations. Gibson and Gagne have described various components of visual perceptual growth that emphasize first hand experiences in the environment and a problem solving orientation as possible perceptual <b>affectors.</b> A series of Visual Problem Solving tasks were constructed that employed the medium of photography and encouraged children to closely attend to stimuli in the visual array. The sample utilized in this investigation was comprised of 75 students equally divided between three intact second and third grade level combined classroom groups at the Burris Laboratory School, Muncie, Indiana. The three groups were assigned to experimental or control group status by use of a table of random numbers. One group received Visual Problem Solving training that stressed Perceptual Principles; a second group received Visual Problem Solving training that emphasized the traditionally taught Visual Elements of Design; and a third group served as a control which received no specific training or treatments. The subjects in all three groups were pre- and post-tested using the Children's Embedded Figures Test (CEFT) and the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test (MVPT) as measures of visual perceptual functioning. In addition to these standardized instruments, a rating scale was developed expressly for this study. The Dunn Photographic Rating Scale (DPRS) was employed for measurement of possible visual information handling differences between Groups 1 and 2 with regard to photographic activities. The data collected during this research was subjected to multivariate analysis of variance and covariance. Correlation coefficients were computed to evaluate possible relationships between the measures and to obtain estimates of instrument reliability. An alpha level of. 05 was employed to test the null hypotheses. Review of the data led to the following conclusions:Subjects receiving treatments that emphasized Visual Problem Solving in conjunction with Perceptual Principles achieved significantly higher results on the Children's Embedded Figures Test than subjects in the other two groups. Analysis of data obtained from subject performance on the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test was inconclusive. Photographic performance as measured by the Dunn Photographic Rating Scale uncovered significant differences between the Perceptual Principles Group and the Elements of Design Group. The Perceptual Principles Group achieved significantly higher levels throughout the five treatments. The most important general finding in this investigation concerned the facilitating effect between Visual Problem Solving methodologies and photographic activity by children. Increases in visual perceptual performance by Perceptual Principles Group 1 provided strong support for instructional strategies that seek to guide children in the formation of higher order visual rules, and contiguity in the application of these guidelines. The evidence tentatively suggested that the photographic medium may have provided a form of visual perceptual activity that increased the mobility of the perceiver, thereby increasing the perceiver's first hand experiences with the environment and ability to isolate visual data. In addition, the lack of emphasis on psychomotor development engendered by the photographic medium was considered to be of value in eliciting new percepts in visual form. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

We found that DZNep effectively depleted cellular levels of PRC 2 components EZH 2, SUZ 12, and EED and inhibited associated histone H 3 Lys 27 methylation (but not H 3 Lys 9 methylation).

Large-scale research efforts aim {{to understand the}} molecular and social/behavioral mechanisms of energy homeostasis, body weight, and food intake. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) could provide a model for these studies since individuals vary in food-related behavior and social factors can be controlled. Here, we examine a potential role of peripheral insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression in honey bee foraging behavior. IRS is central to cellular nutrient sensing through transduction of insulin/insulin-like signals (IIS).

These results reveal a new <b>affector</b> pathway of honey bee social foraging, and suggest that IRS expressed in peripheral tissue ca...|$|E
40|$|In every discourse, {{whether of}} the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. Whatever may be {{the extent of the}} field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the "universe of discourse" (UOD) (Boole, 1854 / 2003). According to Piaget, human adults normally know how to use properly classical propositional logic to manage their UOD. Piaget also showed that human propositional competence is realized via the integration of algebraic composition and relational ordering in formal logic based on the mathematical Klein group structure (KGS) (Inhelder & Piaget, 1955). In the last fifty years, many experiments made by psychologists of reasoning have often shown most adults commit logical fallacies in propositional inferences. They have so concluded, relying on many empirical evidences, that Piaget's claim about adults' competence in propositional logic was wrong and much too rationalist. In other words, according to experimental psychologists, Piaget was overestimating the logical capacities of average human adults in the use of classical propositional logical connectives. So, they abandoned his approach. Nevertheless, the KGS Piaget used can be reused to help us understand better what happens in spontaneous single human reasoning and in the production of fallacies. In fact, the KGS generates squares of opposition (SOO), and an important component of human rationality resides in the diagram of the SOO, as formal articulations of logical dependence between connectives. SOO are considered as important basic components of logical competence and of human predicative rationality (Beziau & Payette, 2012). The KGS captures all the fundamental transformations needed for the predicative proficiency of single human subject. But the formal rationality provided by the SOO is not spontaneous and therefore, should not be easy to learn for adults. By an abstract point of view, the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM) (De Giacomo et al., 2016) {{can be seen as the}} fundamental, logic description of two KGSs interacting with each other. In other words, EPM can model all the elementary interactions between two rational, interacting human subjects. Again, predicative competence for humans does not come for granted! This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic proficiency and competence, like EPM. EPM was developed in the late 1960 s following Gregory Bateson's constructivist participant observer concept in the "second order cybernetics". Later it was applied to develop interactive psychotherapy strategies, online counseling and E-therapy. EPM is a quite flexible tool for mapping cross- inter- and trans- disciplinary expertise. Since the beginning of the new millennium its application area has been extended to other disciplines and even to engineering problems like user modeling, constraint requirements elicitation, software creativity and adaptive system design and development. EPM allows predictive, predicative computation that facilitates anticipatory behavior (Nadin, 2014). As a further example, the KGS can be even interpreted as the complete transformation mapping of the human perception of our outer and inner universe representations, where the encoding process is carried out by human <b>affectors</b> (our biological sensors) and the decoding process is done by human effectors (our biological actuators). In this way, the single observer encoding and decoding of the classic Rosen modeling relationship (Rosen, 1985) can be computationally formalized at operative level (De Giacomo & Fiorini, 2017). The information process describing the dynamics of reality to anticipation means to acknowledge that deterministic and non­deterministic processes are complementary. Therefore, it is possible to conceive a convenient EPM-based schema for Ontological Uncertainty Management (OUM) System as in Fiorini (2015). Following neurophysiological findings by LeDoux (2002), we focus on ontological uncertainty (Lane & Maxfield, 2005) as an emergent phenomenon from a complex system. A dynamic ontological perspective can be thought of as an emergent, natural cross- inter- trans- disciplinary reality level (TRL) (Nicolescu, 1992; 1996) from, at least, a dichotomy of two fundamental, coupled, irreducible, and complementary computational subsystems: (A) reliable unpredictability, and (B) reliable predictability subsystem respectively. From a Top-Down (TD) management perspective, the reliable predictability concept can be referred to the traditional system reactive approach (lag subsystem, closed logic, to learn and prosper) and operative management techniques. The reliable unpredictability concept can be associated with the system proactive approach (lead subsystem, open logic, to survive and grow) and strategic management techniques. In fact, to behave realistically, the system must guarantee both Logical Aperture (to survive and grow) and Logical Closure (to learn and prosper), both fed by environmental "noise" (better… from what human beings call "noise"). EPM coupled to EPM extension as "Evolutive Elementary Pragmatic Model" (E 2 PM) represents a different implementation of the same OUM system concept as presented in Fiorini (2015). Therefore, traditional EPM can be thought as a reliable starting subsystem (closed logic, operative management (B)) to initialize a process of continuous self-organizing and self-logic learning refinement by E 2 PM (open logic, strategic management subsystem (A)). This approach can capture natural logic dynamics behavior, as a function of specific unpredictable perturbance, unknown at system design level. It is an original contribution to current evolutive modeling and simulation, offering an example of new forms of system self-evolutive behavior by cross- inter- and trans-disciplinarity modeling (e. g. forecasting, strategic foresight, anticipation, uncertainty management, embracing the unknown, creativity, etc.) for the children of the Anthropocene Era...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} identifies how English and German speakers {{differ in}} the range of situations they describe as causal and how these difference may influence causal reasoning. In Experiments 1 and 2, English and German speakers described 3 D animations of complex events using CAUSE verbs (cause, get) and ENABLE verbs (let, enable). As predicted, English speakers used CAUSE verbs to describe a wider range of events than German speakers. In Experiment 3, English and German speakers viewed 3 D animations of CAUSE and ENABLE events and then estimated the likelihood of the effect (E) {{in the presence of the}} <b>affector</b> (A), p(E|A), in hypothetical situations similar to the one they just saw. Given the results of Experiments 1 and 2, we predicted that German speakers ’ estimates of p(E|A) would be higher than English speakers ’ estimates of p(E|A) for ENABLE events, but not necessarily for CAUSE events. The results were as predicted. The findings suggest that English and German speakers {{differ in the}} range of situations they describe as causal and that these differences in linguistic coding may lead to differences in causal reasoning...|$|E
40|$|IFN-y {{occupies}} {{a central role}} as a potent modulator of both the <b>affector</b> and the effector limbs of the immune response. While promising as a therapeutic agent for immunodeficiency states, infectious and neoplastic diseases, and autoimmunity (1 - 3), IFN-y has perhaps more often been evoked in the pathogenesis of such disorders (4 - 9). In the latter regard particularly, recent evidence from transgenic mouse models has clearly demonstrated that overexpression of IFN-y can result in autoimmune destruction of tissues by inflammatory mechanisms (10). In the course of studying the cell and molecular basis for IFN-y gene regulation (11), we observed an IFN response consensus sequence in the most proximal 5 ' region of the human IFN-y gene very near a T cell-specific, inducible DNAse I hypersensitive site 250 by from that gene's cap site (12). Given the role of such response elements in upregulating IFN responsive genes (13, 14), we queried whether the product ofthe human IFN-y gene locus might somehow affect its own expression. In this article, definitive evidence is presented using both total human PBMCs and specific subsets ofthose cells, demonstrating a strong IFN-y autosuperinduction response to either IFN-y "priming or costimulation. Materials and Methods For each experiment, human PBMC were isolated from 1 U of heparin-treated, rando...|$|E
40|$|The methylerythritol {{phosphate}} (MEP) pathway {{found in}} many bacteria governs the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are crucial lipid precursors for vital cell components such as ubiquinone. Because mammals synthesize isoprenoids via an alternate pathway, the bacterial MEP pathway is an attractive target for novel antibiotic development, necessitated by emerging antibiotic resistance as well as biodefense concerns. The first committed step in the MEP pathway is the reduction and isomerization of 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate (DXP) to methylerythritol phosphate (MEP), catalyzed by MEP synthase. To facilitate drug development, we cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized MEP synthase from Yersinia pestis. Enzyme assays indicate apparent kinetic constants of KM DXP = 252 mM and KM NADPH = 13 mM, IC 50 values for fosmidomycin and FR 900098 of 710 nM and 231 nM respectively, and Ki values for fosmidomycin and FR 900098 of 251 nM and 101 nM respectively. To ascertain if the Y. pestis MEP synthase was amenable to a high-throughput screening campaign, the Z-factor was determined (0. 9) then the purified enzyme was screened against a pilot scale library containing rationally designed fosmidomycin analogs and natural product extracts. Several hit molecules were obtained, most notably a natural product allosteric <b>affector</b> of MEP synthase and a rationally designed bisubstrate derivative of FR 900098 (able to associat...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{postprandial}} hyperglycemia is {{an important}} <b>affector</b> for atherosclerosis in subjects with glucose intolerance. We analyzed the relationship of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) with fasting and post-challenge plasma glucose levels according to different time points during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Methods: In 663 subjects with fasting hyperglycemia, 75 g OGTT were performed to confirm the glucose tolerant status, and fasting, post-challenge 30 -minute and 120 -minute glucose levels were measured. Anthropometric measurements were done, and fasting lipid profiles were measured. baPWV were measured in all subjects {{and the relationship between}} fasting, 30 - and 120 -minute post-challenge glucose levels and baPWV were analyzed. Results: Among the participants, 62. 9 % were prediabetes and 31. 7 % were diabetes. Mean baPWV value was significantly higher in subjects with diabetes compared with prediabetes group. In bivariate correlation analyses, age, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, 30 -minute and 120 -minute post-challenge glucose levels showed significant positive correlation with baPWV value. In multiple regression analysis, 30 -minute post-challenge glucose level was a weak but significant determinant for mean baPWV value even after adjustment for other confounding variables. Conclusions: Postprandial hyperglycemia, especially 30 -minute glucose levels showed significant correlation with baPWV in subjects with fasting hyperglycemia. These results can imply the deleterious effect of acute hyperglycemic excursion on arteria...|$|E
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is marked by}} deterioration in pancreatic β-cell function. SNARE-proteins are crucial for the fusion of insulin granules with the plasma membrane, a prerequisite for insulin secretion. The aim of this thesis has been to investigate the exocytotic process in β-cells with a specific focus on the function and significance of the two SNARE-proteins SNAP- 25 and syntaxin 1. SNAP- 25 and syntaxin 1 was discovered to be situated in clusters along the plasma membrane. Immunoneutralization of syntaxin 1 and SNAP- 25 resulted in a strongly reduced exocytotic response of primed granules in close association with the voltage-dependent calcium channels. Cholesterol is {{an essential component of}} the plasma membrane. Desorption of cholesterol from the plasma membrane in β-cells were accompanied with an overall reduction in the response of β-cells, from insulin secretion to exocytosis. We believe this is due to disturbance of a basic mechanism. Indeed, we found that SNAP- 25 migrated from the plasma membrane out to the cytosol. The stimulating effect of cAMP on insulin secretion is implemented through different pathways. One pathway is through cAMP-GEFII and its downstream <b>affector</b> RIM 2. We show that SNAP- 25 binds to both cAMP-GEFII and RIM 2, and that this binding mediates the effects of cAMP on exocytosis. The blind-drunk mouse carries a mutation in SNAP- 25 that results in increased binding affinities within the SNARE-complex and the consequence in pancreatic β-cells are impaired vesicle recycling and granule exocytosis. These results together demonstrate the significance of a functional exocytotic machinery for β-cells to respond satisfying to an elevation in blood glucose...|$|E
40|$|The protein {{phosphatase}} inhibitor {{okadaic acid}} (OA) previously {{has been shown}} to induce hyperphosphorylation of p 53 protein both grossly and at specific tryptic peptide sites. However, the consequences of OA induced phosphorylation (and phosphorylation in general) on p 53 function in vivo remain unclear. The focus {{of this study was to}} determine if hyperphosphorylation wrought by OA or expression of human p 53 in protein phosphatase-deficient yeast strains could indeed regulate the interaction between p 53 and a physiological downstream target, the cdk inhibitor, p 21 waf 1. In S. pombe, one strain containing a mutant p 53 (arg->his 175) and a type 1 protein phosphatase gene knockout was unable to grow whereas both parental strains were both able to thrive, indicating a possible gain of function related to p 53 phosphorylation. Rat embryonic fibroblasts harboring a highly expressed mouse p 53 transgene and a p 53 null control cell line were treated with 50 nM doses of OA. This treatment resulted in: (1) the formation and retention of acidic p 53 protein isoforms, and, more specifically, phosphorylation of tryptic peptide sites in the transactivation domain, (2) an increase in p 53 affinity for a p 21 waf 1 promotor oligonucleotide, (3) an increase in cellular steady state levels of p 21 waf 1 message, (4) an increase in p 53 -dependent transcriptional activity from a waf 1 reporter construct, and (5) a G 2 /M cell cycle blockage that is associated with intact p 53. These results demonstrate for the first time that hyperphosphorylation of p 53 induced by OA may regulate a critical downstream <b>affector</b> of cell growth suppression in an intact cellular environment...|$|E
40|$|Background: Health issue {{become a}} serious problem in Indonesia such as Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) {{nowadays}} is more attended because of the effects i. e. goitre. Goitre is the one of several IDD spectrums. Iodine deficiency {{is not the only}} <b>affector</b> of IDD. The others like goitrogenic substances, for the example is thiocyanate can be a competitor with iodine in the tyroid hormone synthesis. The levels of endemicities for certain area is assessed based on the size alteration of tyroid gland (TGR). Urine Excretion Iodine can discribe the iodine intake by person. The most thiocyanate excretion is by the kidney, so that the levels can be checked in urine. It is important to know whether goitre is affected by iodine defficiency or thiocyanate consumption. Therfore this research aims to determine the relationship between UEI, Urine Thiocyanate Excretion and TGR. Methode : This was an analytical observational research with cross sectional design. Samples were 67 respondens. Simple random sampling were done with them. TGRs were secondary data from Dinas Kesehatan of Brebes Regency in 2010 / 2011. EIU was measured with Acid Digestion Methode with persultafe ammonium. Urine Thiocyanate Excretion was measured with spectrophotometri methode. The data were subjected to statistical analysis for correlation at 5 % level of significance and regression, using SPSS 15. 0 for WindowsResults : UEI levels were 192, 00 + 349 (346, 00) μg/L. Urine Thiocyanate Levels were 0, 36 + 4, 64 (1, 69) μg/mL. With the Spearman Test was showed that there was a relationship between UEI and TGR at 5 % level of significance (p= 0, 001). There was no relationship between Urine Thiocyanate Levels and TGR at 5 % level of significance (p= 0, 491). The R 2 value was 0, 022 using Regression Test for EIU and TGR.

40|$|Analysis of {{nucleotide}} sequences in the 5 '-flanking {{region of}} the human elastin gene has revealed several unusual features, suggesting that regulation of elastin gene expression is complex. To identify any cis-acting regulatory promoter elements, a 35 -kb fragment of DNA (CosE) was isolated from a human genomic cosmid library by hybridizations with a human elastin cDNA. Southern blots of EcoRI digests of CosE DNA, utilizing a 5 '-end labeled 21 -mer oligonucleotide corresponding to the signal sequence of elastin, revealed {{the presence of a}} single 7. 8 -kb genomic fragment. Partial dideoxynucleotide sequencing of this EcoRI genomic subclone revealed that it extended approximately 2. 5 kb 3 ' of the translation initiation site (ATG), encompassing exon 1 and a portion of the first intron, while the remaining DNA encompassed the 5 '-flanking region. Exonuclease III digestion (3 ' → 5 ') was performed to remove sequences of the first intron and first exon, including the ATG site. One clone, approximately 5 kb in size, had the 3 ' end located 14 bp upstream of the ATG site. A 462 -hp 3 ' portion of this 5 -kb fragment was subcloned into a Bluescript/CAT chimeric plasmid (pBS 0 CAT) to generate an elastin gene promoter/CAT reporter gene construct (pEP 6 CAT). Transient transfection experiments with pEP 6 CAT using human skin fibroblasts, human HT- 1080, mouse NIH- 3 T 3, or freshly isolated neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cells revealed significant CAT activity in each cell line. These results suggest that the 5 '-flanking {{region of the}} elastin gene contains the cis-acting regulatory elements necessary for transcription. The chimeric plasmid pEP 6 CAT provides a means to study the transcriptional control of elastin gene expression by exogenous <b>affector</b> molecules, as well as in human dermatologic diseases...|$|E
