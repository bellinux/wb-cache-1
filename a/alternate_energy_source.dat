40|$|Presented at the 43 rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Reno, Nevada, Jan. 10 - 13, 2005. Traditionally, most fixed {{wing and}} rotary wing {{aircraft}} have been powered by internal combustion engines that consume hydrocarbon fuels. Only {{in a few}} exceptional designs, such as solar powered air-vehicles, are attempts made to apply <b>alternate</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> In the past decade, however, the aerospace community has shown {{a renewed interest in}} <b>alternate</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> for revolutionary propulsion systems. In particular, fuel cells are increasingly being considered as an alternate power source for their potential outstanding advantages over the traditional power system. Nevertheless, traditional aircraft sizing methods are not immediately applicable for such unconventional-energy consuming air-vehicle designs. This paper proposes a generalized aircraft sizing formulation that is also applicable to revolutionary aircraft concepts powered by unconventional <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and/or have revolutionary propulsion systems. A power based formulation, which allows easy tracking of energy transformation process from the first power generation to the last propulsive power production, is introduced. Lastly, a generalized aircraft weight estimation formulation that is also valid for unconventional-energy consuming propulsion systems is developed...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesA {{significant}} {{evolution has}} occurred in surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) toward <b>alternate</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources,</b> lesion sets, and approaches, {{with the intent of}} simplifying the Cox maze III operation and maintaining similar outcomes. Because no large comparative studies with long-term follow-up exist, we have reviewed our experience. MethodsFrom January 1993 to January 2011, 1540 patients underwent surgical ablation for AF. The operations were performed in conjunction with repair of congenital heart disease in 351 (30 %) and adult-acquired disease in 1189 patients (70 %). In the 1189 patients, preoperative AF was paroxysmal in 598 (50 %) and persistent in 591 (50 %). The <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> included cut and sew in 521 (44 %), cryothermy in 267 (22 %), radiofrequency in 262 (22 %), and a combination in 139 patients (12 %). The lesion sets included biatrial in 810 (68 %), isolated pulmonary vein isolation in 269 (23 %), and isolated left atrial in 110 (9 %). AF ablation was performed during isolated mitral valve surgery in 516 patients (43 %). ResultsThe median follow-up was 33 months (maximum, 20. 3 years), and late rhythm follow-up was available for 80 %. The cut and sew Cox maze III procedure was superior at each follow-up interval (P = . 01, P = . 03, and P  5 years (hazard ratio, 0. 23; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 12 - 0. 42; P  5 years (hazard ratio, 0. 23; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 08 - 0. 66; P = . 007). ConclusionsThe cut and sew Cox maze III procedure appears to offer significantly greater freedom from AF without antiarrhythmic medications compared with <b>alternate</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> and lesion sets. Although <b>alternate</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> offer the advantage of quicker application and the possibility of minimally invasive applications, the Cox maze III operation arguably remains the reference standard for the surgical treatment of AF and should still be considered, especially for patients for whom AF ablation is of critical importance...|$|R

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{the most}} commonly sustained arrhythmia in man. While it affects millions of patients worldwide, its incidence will markedly increase with an aging population. Primary goals of AF therapy are to (1) reduce embolic complications, particularly stroke, (2) alleviate symptoms, and (3) prevent long-term heart remodelling. These have been {{proven to be a}} challenge as there are major limitations in our knowledge of the pathological and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying AF. Although advances continue {{to be made in the}} medical management of this condition, pharmacotherapy is often unsuccessful. Because of the high recurrence rate of AF despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm and the adverse effects of these drugs, there has been growing interest in nonpharmacological strategies. Surgery for treatment of AF has been around for some time. The Cox-Maze procedure is the gold standard for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation and has more than 90 % success in eliminating atrial fibrillation. Although the cut and sew maze is very effective, it has been superseded by newer operations that rely on <b>alternate</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> to create lines of conduction block. In addition, the evolution of improved ablation technology and instrumentation has facilitated the development of minimally invasive approaches. In this paper, the rationale for surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation and the different surgical techniques that were developed will be explored. In addition, it will detail the new approaches to surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation that employ <b>alternate</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R

In the past decades, many efforts were made to explore <b>alternate</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) technology is widely recognized as an alternative <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> because it provides a highly efficient and eco-friendly route to produce renewable energy, and it degrades organic pollutants by the direct use of sunlight [1, 2, 3, 4].
