40|$|Aggregate {{properties}} influence {{different aspects}} of asphalt pavement performance. <b>Aggregate</b> <b>polishing</b> characteristics {{are directly related to}} pavement surface frictional properties and thus to skid resistance. Aggregate resistance to degradation (abrasion and breakage) is another important property that influences pavement performance. Aggregate degradation could take place during production due to plant operations and during compaction, leading to change in aggregate characteristics and mix properties. In addition, aggregate resistance to degradation is important in mixes such as Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) and Open Graded Friction Course (OGFC) that rely on stone-to-stone contacts among coarse aggregates. Some aggregates in these mixes fracture due to the high stresses at contact points. Many test methods exist for measuring <b>aggregate</b> <b>polishing</b> and degradation, but a critical review of these methods reveals that they suffer from being time consuming, are unable to differentiate between aggregates with distinct resistance to polishing, or unable to differentiate between aggregate resistance to abrasion and breakage. New methodologies are needed to give better assessment of aggregate resistance to polishing, abrasion, and breakage. The thesis presents the development of new methods for measuring aggregate resistance to polishing, abrasion, and breakage. These methods rely on measurements using the Aggregate Imaging System (AIMS) and Micro-Deval. The new method for measuring aggregate resistance to polishing monitors change in aggregate texture as a function of polishing time. As such, it provides the initial texture, rate of polishing, and final texture. The new method for measuring aggregate degradation is capable of distinguishing between breakage and abrasion. In this method, abrasion is defined as the reduction in aggregate angularity, while breakage is defined by fracture of particles. The new methods are shown to be rapid and accurate, and they require reasonable training. Since both AIMS and Micro-Deval are used in the new methods, it was necessary to evaluate the repeatability of these two methods. Measurements using two AIMS units and two Micro-Deval machines were used to assess the variability. There was no statistical difference between the measurements of the two AIMS units or between the measurements of the two Micro-Deval units...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} safety requirements of a road is its capability of preventing skidding of vehicles. However, this requirement so called "skid resistance" evolves during the whole pavement life. Phenomena that are identified to be responsible of this evolution are binder removal, <b>aggregate</b> <b>polishing</b> and seasonnal variations. In addition, ageing of bitumen is also identified to play a significant role on skid resistance evolution. One of the main results of previous works about skid resistance evolution was a model that takes into account two of the above listed phenomena such as bitumen scrouring and aggregates polishing. This present work is a continuation of the previous ones. It tries to include the effect of ageing in the above model. An updated model of evolution of skid resistance including this latter effect is proposed. This model is composed by a set of elementery functions in which some of them can be easily identified. The model can predict the evolution of skid resistance by combining effects of ageing, polishing and binder removal...|$|E
40|$|Skid {{resistance}} {{is a condition}} parameter that characterizes the contribution that a road surface makes {{to the level of}} friction available at the contact patch between a road surface and vehicle tire during acceleration, breaking and cornering manoeuvres. The surface texture and the surface course properties affect the roughness (microtexture, macrotexture and megatexture) which is influenced by traffic, weather and the environment. Some statistics data indicate that the number of accidents increases by up to two folds during rainy conditions. The PSV value of the aggregates used is a significant but not the sole influencing factor. The Polished Stone Value is determined under standard laboratory conditions and indicates to which extent an aggregate is resistant to polishing under the action of traffic. Skid resistance changes over time. Typically it increases {{in the first two years}} following construction as the roadway is worn away by traffic and rough aggregate surfaces become exposed, and then decreases over the remaining pavement life as aggregates become more polished. In the present study, skid resistance and <b>aggregate</b> <b>polishing</b> value were conducted under varying bitumen content and using fillers materials like cement, fly ash. Texture depth is also a direct measure of area of contacts between tire and HMA surface so it also has the direct effect on pavement surface skidding...|$|E
40|$|Skid resistance, whilst being complex, {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{controllable}} factors that road engineers can design and modify to reduce the number of wet pavement and loss of control crashes. However, due to the fact that it deteriorates over time due to polishing and/or abrasion, it is desirable to be able to predict the long term skid resistance performance of aggregates before the road surface is constructed. Skid resistance consists of both microtexture and macrotexture. There are a number of methodologies that have been developed to analyse and quantify the macrotexture of road surfaces and the relationship between skid resistance and macrotexture has been established with reasonable confidence. On the other hand, it is a more challenging task to accurately analyse and quantify microtexture changes due to its microscopic scale. This paper discusses the usage of a new device, namely the InfiniteFocus 3 D, which is an optical three-dimensional surface profile measurement system that can be used to generate detailed three-dimensional images of aggregate surfaces at the micro scale. These images can be used to analyse the microtexture of aggregate surfaces by calculating certain surface texture parameters (both manually and, using the associated software, automatically generated by using the associated software). In ongoing research at the University of Auckland, it is intended to assess the predictive power of such parameters in predicting skid resistance deterioration due to <b>aggregate</b> <b>polishing</b> and wear...|$|E
40|$|Skid resistance, {{the road}} surface’s {{contribution}} to friction, {{is a crucial}} property of a road surface course required to maintain a safe and serviceable road network. Measurement of skid resistance is restricted {{by the need to}} measure the forces acting on a rubber wheel or slider while it is dragged across the surface. If the skid resistance of the road could be determined without the need for contact then measurement could be cheaper and more thorough. One route to achieving this goal is by measurement of the texture of the road that generates the friction experienced by a sliding tyre. However, the form and scale of the texture required is not well defined. The work presented in this thesis attempts to establish a robust methodology for measurement of texture on the surfaces of aggregate particles (the main constituent of the road surface course) {{so that it can be}} compared with friction. The stages of development are described in detail and the methodology is employed to examine the changing texture on two types of aggregate.

40|$|Friction is the {{resultant}} {{of the interaction}} between pavement micro texture, pavement macro texture and the speed of a tire that slides over the pavement surface. Pavement friction is directly related to skidding accidents and road safety. Therefore, in most pavement management systems it is considered as one of the parameters that affect pavement performance. A worldwide management practice is to control skid resistance in order to fulfill minimum thresholds. However, this practice is not sufficient to ensure road safety under a skidding point of view. A consistent framework to manage pavement friction must also consider the geometric design of a road, vehicle maneuvers, early behavior of the pavement, <b>aggregates</b> <b>polishing</b> and the seasonal effects over the pavement surface. The objective of the paper is to present a friction management method developed after a three years research by the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile and The Ministry of Public Works of Chile. Under this integrated point of view, the standard ensures that the friction provided by the pavement, or friction supply, is consistent to the friction demanded by its users in terms of the geometrical design of a road. For this, the research team had to develop time-dependent friction supply models and friction demand models. The models were integrated under a reliability concept to estimate design friction factors, friction thresholds for different road geometries and a methodology to measure and assess the pavement friction performance in a road network...|$|R
40|$|In many countries, where studded tyres are prohibited, {{the traffic}} {{polishing}} of the coarse aggregate in the wearing courses {{is a problem}} to a rather great extent. In those countries there are often regulations on the <b>aggregate</b> <b>polishing</b> value. In Sweden, where the use of studded tyres is extensive, the micro texture of the aggregate in {{the surface of the}} wearing courses increases during the winter season. Therefore, there have been few problems with low wet friction levels in Sweden. However, the increased use of wear resistant aggregates and stone mastic asphalt together with lightweight studs has led to a reduced amount of wear. During later years, a problem with low friction levels has been noticed in wear resistant surface courses during late summer and fall, especially at high trafficked roads with a complicated geometry. Measurements have shown that the friction level can be reduced rather quickly on surfaces with aggregates that are disposed for polishing and low wet friction related accidents have been reported. This report is a knowledge survey covering polishing, friction and to some extent surface texture and wear caused by studded tyres. Experiences from friction measurements mainly in Stockholm and Gothenburg have been compiled in this report. A review of testing methods and existing requirements is also presented in the report.

Each profile was described on six attributes (malt type, adjuncts, alternative source of sugars, characterizing ingredients, sensory characteristics, and retail price) varied at different levels {{and were asked to}} state his/her preference for each profile on a 9 -point scale of interest. The results of this study showed that the ideal SB: (1) for the <b>aggregate</b> <b>Polish</b> panel is brewed from malted wheat, raw wheat, honey, and tropical fruits, is alcoholic and is priced below 2. 00 Euros; (2) for the aggregate Italian panel consists of a beer brewed from malted wheat, maize, honey, and vanilla, is blonde and costs a maximum of 2. 00 Euros; (3) for the aggregate Spanish panel is brewed from malted wheat, rye or maize, vanilla, is fruity and is priced below 2. 00 Euros. The heterogeneity of interest in specialty beers observed in the three countries under test requires for the adaptation of a SB specifically to each culture in which it is sold. In this process of customization, brewers must take into account that gender modulates the effect of culture on consumer interest in SB sensory characteristics and ingredient formulation...|$|R

40|$|The skid {{resistance}} of asphalt pavement {{is a major}} characteristic that determines the driving safety on a road, especially under wet surface conditions. Skid resistance is primarily {{a function of the}} microtexture and macrotexture of a pavement surface. Microtexture is influenced by aggregate surface characteristics and is required to disrupt the continuity of surface water film and attain frictional resistance between the tire and the pavement surface. Macrotexture is affected mostly by mixture design or aggregate gradation and contributes to {{skid resistance}} by providing drainage paths of water that can be otherwise trapped between a tire and a pavement surface. The increase in macrotexture contributes to preventing hydroplaning and improving wet frictional resistance, particularly at high speeds. While much research has been conducted in the past to identify material factors that affect skid resistance, there is still a need to develop a model for predicting asphalt pavement skid resistance as a function of mixture characteristics and traffic level. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop such a model based on extensive laboratory experiments and field measurements involving different mixture types and aggregate sources. The model incorporates functions that describe the resistance of <b>aggregates</b> to <b>polishing</b> and <b>aggregate</b> size distribution.

The Wehner–Schulze apparatus was used to determine the evolution of friction with polishing cycles of both aggregates and asphalt specimens. A new aggregate hardness parameter was introduced based on the mineralogical composition and the hardness of the individual minerals. This hardness parameter was then related to friction coefficients measured on aggregate specimens after 180. 000 polishing cycles. Initial results indicated that this new aggregate hardness parameter is a good indicator of the capacity of an aggregate to retain good friction levels.

In this study, a three-step methodology was developed to systematically measure and analyse aggregate profiles and compare the evolution of surface friction and roughness parameters. Criteria used for the three steps (selection of the areas to be measured, filtering of the profiles to keep only the relevant part for analysis, selection of roughness parameters) are presented and justified by considering on the one hand polishing and abrasion mechanisms and, on the other hand, the contact between a viscoelastic solid and a rough surface.

40|$|One {{approach}} to reducing initial construction costs is {{to maximize the}} use of locally available aggregates. The main concern with using locally available carbonate aggregates, however, is {{that they tend to}} polish under traffic and provide inadequate friction. INDOT specifications for asphalt surface mixes, especially for high volume traffic, require high friction aggregates like steel slag, blast furnace slag or sandstone, which are more resistant to <b>polishing.</b> These premium <b>aggregates</b> are not readily available {{in all parts of the}} state, requiring long haul distances from limited sources in Indiana or out of state. The study summarized here was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using greater quantities of local, less <b>polish</b> resistant <b>aggregates,</b> specifically limestones, in asphalt surfaces when blended with high friction aggregates. Samples of blends of various quantities of polish-susceptible aggregates with high friction <b>aggregates</b> were prepared, <b>polished</b> to simulate the action of traffic, and tested in the laboratory for their frictional properties.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. The first part includes analyses of {{the correlation between the}} results of two Aggregate Imaging System (AIMS) units. These analyses have led to refinements of the AIMS analysis methods of angularity and texture, which resulted in reduced variability in the results and better correlation between the two AIMS units. The refined analysis methods were used to establish a database of the shape characteristics of about 100 aggregate samples from the state of Texas and to propose a new method for the classification of aggregates based on their shape characteristics. This new method of classification is for use in the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) wet weather accident reduction program (WWARP). The use of AIMS texture index and variability in texture within an aggregate source is proposed instead of the British Polish Value (BPV) for classifying aggregates used in pavement surfaces. The second part of the thesis investigates the relationship between shape characteristics and asphalt pavement skid resistance. Many states have implemented wet weather accident reduction programs aimed at maintaining acceptable levels of pavement skid resistance. Proper aggregate selection before construction aids in maintaining acceptable levels of skid resistance throughout the life of the pavement. Several predictive models of pavement skid resistance have been developed over the years. Some of these models account for the influence of aggregate characteristics on pavement skid resistance, primarily through incorporating the results of the BPV test in the model. However, the BPV test is known to have high variability and dependence on experimental factors that are not related to the actual <b>aggregate</b> resistance to <b>polishing.</b> AIMS offers a method to measure aggregate shape characteristics directly in {{a relatively short period of}} time. The new method for relating aggregate shape characteristics to pavement skid resistance was verified by relating skid resistance measurements from field test sections to measured aggregate properties from the laboratory. This methodology is expected to be the basis for further study to form a more comprehensive and verified model for the prediction of pavement skid resistance that incorporates measured aggregate properties from the AIMS system...|$|R
40|$|Martin, Ronald E. Wet {{pavement}} friction, or skid resistance, {{is one of}} {{the most}} important engineering considerations in highway design from a safety standpoint. For bituminous pavements, skid-resistance performance is primarily a function of the durability, texture, and composition of coarse aggregate used to construct the wearing course, or the uppermost layer of the road surface. Cambrian age carbonate construction aggregates mined in Pennsylvania, although relatively simple mineralogically, exhibit a wide variety of textures that developed in response to complex paleoenvironmental and diagenetic processes. To reveal what factors influence the petrographic properties of such aggregates and relate these attributes to skid resistance, carbonate construction aggregates currently being mined from the Lower Cambrian Kinzers Formation in the West York 7. 5 -minute quadrangle, Pennsylvania have been sampled and subjected to laboratory testing. Thin section analysis has revealed six individual microfacies types at the mining operation in West York: Microfacies Types I and III include massive debris flow deposits consisting either of coarser crystalline dolomite or limestone; Microfacies Type II is believed to represent a proximal turbidite facies consisting of finer crystalline dolomite; Microfacies Types IV and V are laminated to shaly dolomites and limestones corresponding to middle and distal fan turbidite environments; and Microfacies Type VI consists of hemipelagic, meta-pelitic deposits. Four complete depositional sequences and portions of two others have been identified at the West York quarry using clast composition and the presence of sharp lithofacies contacts believed to represent sequence boundaries. High energy debris flows (LST) are interlayered with more distal turbidites (LST and TST) and altered, hemipelagic shales (HST). Aggregate skid resistance has been assessed through cyclic material polishing in the micro-Deval testing apparatus and incremental microtexture evolution monitoring via two methodologies: the application of wavelet analysis to grayscale images of aggregate particles and the use of laser confocal microscopy to measure aggregate sample surface roughness. Laser confocal microscopy, which results in a direct measurement of surface texture, provides a more precise method for monitoring changes in aggregate roughness as a function of polishing time than wavelet analysis. The latter technique is adequate for assessing bulk samples, but apparently is susceptible to misinterpreting aggregate variegation as surface roughness. Stockpile samples consisting of Microfacies Type I resist polishing much more effectively than those comprised mostly of Microfacies Types IV and V, reflecting the importance of coarser crystal sizes in carbonate aggregate skid-resistance performance. Microfacies Types I and III, both initially characterized by pronounced surface roughness associated with coarser, interlocking carbonate crystals, exhibit marked differences in polish resistance. Microfacies Type I ??? a mostly pure dolomite ??? maintains its initial rough microtexture more efficiently than Microfacies Type III ??? a high-calcium limestone. This observation confirms that it is essential to consider mineralogy when estimating the potential for relatively pure carbonate construction <b>aggregates</b> to resist <b>polishing.</b> Finally, Microfacies Types II and IV, which are both comprised of higher percentages of dolomite than calcite and mostly consist of fine to medium crystals, appear to sustain microtexture more effectively than the coarser textured, high-calcium limestones of Microfacies Type III, indicating that the dolomite component enhances skid resistance even more noticeably than the presence of coarser crystalline material, particularly for aggregates that are not exclusively fine textured in character. Findings are used to develop a process map that may serve as a valuable tool for mining companies targeting relatively pure or argillaceous carbonate deposits for use in bituminous wearing courses and state agencies charged with evaluating construction materials prior to approval for use and to confirm ongoing, consistent performance.
