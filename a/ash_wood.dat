40|$|This {{study focused}} on removal of color, COD, and lignin in {{wastewater}} of pulp and paper mill using white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> and black <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> that generated from boilers unit in the pulp and paper mill. Batch experiments were setup for studying the equilibrium time, pH, quantity of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> and adsorption isotherm. The results from the equilibrium time experiment concluded that the equilibrium time of the white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> is much more rapid than the black <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> indicated as 2 minutes and 25 minutes, respectively. The effect of pH on the removal of such studied parameters was different for the white and black <b>wood</b> <b>ash.</b> Variation in pH of wastewater at the levels of 2 to 10 had no influence in removal of color (89 - 93 %), COD (66 - 70 %) and lignin (78 - 82 %) when white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> was used, whereas the effect of pH on the removal was evident when using black <b>wood</b> <b>ash.</b> The highest removal of color (42. 2 %), lignin (31. 1 %) and COD (29. 7 %) was found when the initial pH was adjusted to 2 and such removal was gradually decreased when pH was raised. The optimum dose of white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> for the highest removal efficiency was 20 g ash /L of wastewater. This amount of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> can remove color 95 %, lignin 80 % and COD 69 %. The reason for high removal efficiency of white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> might occur from the precipitation of lignin by CaO which is the major component of the ash. For the black <b>wood</b> <b>ash,</b> the optimum dose was calculated from the isotherm equation of adsorption, both by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm. These isotherms were applicable to color and lignin, while they were inapplicable to COD. The isotherm for adsorption of color and lignin indicate that the removal mechanism by black <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> {{was likely to be}} physical adsorption. The results indicated that the white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> was better than the black <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> in treating the pulp and paper wastewater...|$|R
40|$|Recirculation of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> from energy {{production}} to forest soil improves {{the sustainability of}} this {{energy production}} form as recycled <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> contains nutrients that otherwise would be lost at harvest. In addition, wood-ash is beneficial to many soils due to its inherent acid-neutralizing capabilities. However, <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> has several ecosystem-perturbing effects like increased soil pH and pore water electrical conductivity both known to strongly impact soil bacterial numbers and community composition. Studies investigating soil bacterial community responses to <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> application remain sparse and the available results are ambiguous and remain at a general taxonomic level. Here we investigate the response of bacterial communities in a spruce forest soil to <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> addition corresponding to 0, 5, 22, and 167 t <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> ha- 1. We used culture-based enumerations of general bacteria, Pseudomonas and sporeforming bacteria combined with 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to valuate soil bacterial responses to <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> application. Results showed that <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> addition strongly increased soil pH and electrical conductivity. Soil pH increased from acidic through neutral at 22 t ha- 1 to alkaline at 167 t ha- 1. Bacterial numbers significantly increased up to a <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> dose of 22 t ha- 1 followed by significant decrease at 167 t ha- 1 <b>wood</b> <b>ash.</b> The soil bacterial community composition changed after <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> application with copiotrophic bacteria responding positively up to a <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> dose of 22 t ha- 1 while the adverse effect was seen for oligotrophic bacteria. Marked changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> dose of 167 t ha- 1 with a single alkaliphilic genus dominating. Additionally, spore-formers became abundant at an ash dose of 167 t ha- 1 whereas {{this was not the}} case at lower ash doses. Lastly, bacterial richness and diversity strongly decreased with increasing amount of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> applied. All of the observed bacterial responses can be directly explained by the <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> induced changes in pH, electrical conductivity and the addition of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> inherent nutrients...|$|R
25|$|Other {{materials}} used, were Tonkin bamboo Calcutta reed, <b>ash</b> <b>wood,</b> hickory, ironwood, maple, lancewood, or malacca cane. These {{products were}} light, tough, and pliable. Rods were generally made in three pieces called a butt, midsection, and tip. The butts were frequently made of maple, with bored bottom; this butt outlasted several tops. Midsections were generally made from ironwood {{because it was}} a thicker, strong wood. Tips were generally made from bamboo for its elasticity which could throw the bait further and more accurately. Handles and grips were generally of cork, wood, or wrapped cane. Many different types of glue held these sections together, most commonly Irish glue and bone glue. This was until hilton glue, or cement glue, was introduced because of its waterproof qualities.

These were found in an excavation of a ditch terminal next {{to the location of}} the main north western gate and Wheeler believed they may have been hanging from the gate structure itself as a trophy or warning to enemies. Wheeler concluded that Stanwick had been the rebel stronghold of Venutius, who had been the husband of the pro-Roman Brigantian queen Cartimandua, after he had split with her when she had taken his charioteer and armour-bearer Vellocatus as a lover and betrayed the rebel leader Caractacus to the Romans. Wheeler argued that Stanwick was the location where Venutius had rallied his anti-Roman tribesmen and allies for his revolt against the Roman invaders.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ash-based polymer {{composites}} are assum-ing increasing importance {{because of}} the pollutant poten-tial, fine particle size, and low price of ash. Fly ash and rice husk ash are two prominent ash materials on which some investigations have already been done for potential use in polymer composites. This article highlights {{the results of a}} study on the use of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> in HDPE. <b>Wood</b> <b>ash</b> is mainly a mixture of various metallic compounds and some silica. Here, the characterization of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> has been done with the help of XRD, ICPAES, light scat-tering based particle size analysis, FTIR, and SEM. The results show that <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> particle size has an average value of 293 nm, much lower than other categories of ash. When blended with HDPE {{in the presence of a}} compati-bilizer, <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> gives rise to vastly improved mechanical properties over that of the base polymer. The results prove that <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> is a valuable reinforcing material for HDPE and the environmental pollution due to <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> can be solved in a most profitable way by this technique...|$|R

500|$|The {{existing}} wooden carriages for 11-inch {{guns were}} {{too long to}} fit in New Ironsidess cramped battery. A new iron carriage was built where the gun rode in a cradle that slid on iron rails. The new carriages pivoted at the gun ports to minimize {{the size of the}} ports. Two compressors, or clamps, were fitted to squeeze the rails and increase friction between the rails and the cradle, but these were not strong enough to handle the recoil force when the gun was fired. Two more compressors were fitted as well as rope [...] to restrain the guns, but neither was entirely satisfactory. The problem was not resolved until December 1862 when strips of <b>ash</b> <b>wood</b> were placed underneath the compressors; the friction of iron on wood was double that of iron on iron and the increased friction solved the problem.|$|E
500|$|Although nothing {{remains of}} either the body or the bed, {{surviving}} artefacts and the 56 pieces of ironwork that held the bed together have enabled the burial to be reconstructed in considerable detail.

Traces of mineralised cloth and either grass or reed were found still attached to some of the nails, indicating the possible nature of the mattress. Two pieces of ironwork showed signs of repair and reuse, suggesting that the bed had been in use some time before the burial and was not specially made for the interment. This raises the possibility that the bed was either that of the deceased woman or a significant bed of some other person. It may have been dismantled elsewhere, brought to the cemetery and reassembled and repaired so that it could be used for the burial.|$|E
