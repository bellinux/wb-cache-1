5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn</b> for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|E
25|$|The Leslie speaker, most {{commonly}} associated with and predominantly used with the famous Hammond organ, {{takes advantage of the}} Doppler effect by using an electric motor to rotate an <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn</b> around a loudspeaker, sending its sound in a circle. This results at the listener's ear in rapidly fluctuating frequencies of a keyboard note.|$|E
25|$|An <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn</b> {{converts}} {{large pressure}} variations {{with a small}} displacement area into a low pressure variation with a large displacement area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the cross sectional area of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high acoustic impedance to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given displacement. Therefore the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low displacement. The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually decompress and increase in displacement until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large displacement.|$|E

2500|$|The megaphone, {{a simple}} cone made of paper or other {{flexible}} material, {{is the oldest}} and simplest <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn,</b> used prior to loudspeakers as a passive acoustic amplifier for mechanical phonographs and for the human voice; it is still used by cheerleaders and lifeguards. Because the conic section shape describes {{a portion of a}} perfect sphere of radiated sound, cones have no phase or amplitude distortion of the wavefront. [...] The small megaphones used in phonographs and as loudhailers were not long enough to reproduce the low frequencies in music; they had a high cutoff frequency which attenuated the bottom two octaves of the sound spectrum, giving the megaphone a characteristic tinny sound.|$|E
2500|$|A horn {{loudspeaker}} is a loudspeaker or loudspeaker element which uses an <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn</b> {{to increase the}} overall efficiency of the driving element(s). A common form (right) consists of a compression driver which produces sound waves with a small metal diaphragm vibrated by an electromagnet, attached to a horn, a flaring duct to conduct the sound waves to the open air. Another type is a woofer driver mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure which is divided by internal partitions to form a zigzag flaring duct which functions as a horn; this type is called a folded horn speaker. The horn serves to improve the coupling efficiency between the speaker driver and the air. The horn {{can be thought of}} as an [...] "acoustic transformer" [...] that provides impedance matching between the relatively dense diaphragm material and the less-dense air. The result is greater acoustic output power from a given driver.|$|E

50|$|In agriculture, and dry {{material}} handling generally, sound horns {{are often used}} to start material flow or to force release of impacted materials. In a grain silo, such a horn may be mounted inside the silo and sounded as the silo is emptied to loosen stuck granules.

50|$|Phase plugs are {{commonly}} found in high-powered horn loudspeakers used in professional audio, in the mid- and high-frequency bandpasses, positioned between the compression driver diaphragm and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn.</b> They may also be present in front of woofer cones in some loudspeaker designs.

5000|$|A {{compression}} {{driver is}} a small specialized diaphragm loudspeaker which generates the sound in a horn loudspeaker. It is attached to an <b>acoustic</b> <b>horn,</b> a widening duct which serves to radiate the sound efficiently into the air. It works in a [...] "compression" [...] mode; {{the area of the}} loudspeaker diaphragm is significantly larger than the throat aperture of the horn so that it provides high sound pressures. Horn-loaded compression drivers can achieve very high efficiencies, around 10 times the efficiency of direct-radiating cone loudspeakers. They are used as midrange and tweeter drivers in high power sound reinforcement loudspeakers, and in reflex or folded-horn loudspeakers in megaphones and public address systems.|$|E
