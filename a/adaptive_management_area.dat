40|$|We {{compared}} {{the density of}} snags, snags with cavities, and cavity-nesting bird use at two sites in northern California: Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest, a site with large trees and large snags because of protection from logging, contrasted with the Goosenest <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area,</b> where a century of logging left this forest with few large trees and snags. Indeed, there was a threefold difference between sites in total snags, and a fifteenfold difference in cavity-nesting bird use. However, we feel finding a “snags per acre ” prescription is inadequate, as tree size, rate of snag generation, and mode of tree death have been disrupted this past century. We argue that understanding the interactions between fire, bark beetles, woodpecker foraging and excavating, sapwood decay organisms, snag “demography, ” and cavity-nesting species ecological requirements apart from simply cavities are required in place of simply counting snags in landscapes...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{emphasis}} on ecosystem and landscape-level forest management across North America has spurred {{an examination of}} alternative management strategies which focus on emulating dynamic natural disturbance processes, particularly those associated with forest fire regimes.

As scientists and managers involved with the BRLS work to unravel the ecological and economic implications of disturbance-based forest management, they must also consider the level of public acceptability for such an approach. Currently there is little information regarding what citizens know about disturbance-based management, their confidence in natural resource agencies to carry out this approach, and their overall level of support for it.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2007 I {{examined}} {{dispersal of}} ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) seeds by the shadow chipmunk (Tamias senex) on thinned and unthinned forest {{units in the}} Goosenest <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> (Goosenest <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area)</b> from 2001 - 2002. I placed 1000 radiolabelled ponderosa pine seeds on three thinned and three unthinned units and tracked {{the movement of the}} seeds using a Geiger counter. Tamias senex was the only small mammal observed gathering ponderosa pine seeds at videotaped feeding stations. Seeds were removed from their original locations in less than 24 hours on all but one unit. Between 0. 1 and 5. 1 % of seeds were found in dispersed caches (1 - 51 seeds), approximately 1 - 3 cm under the soil surface 1 - 7 days after the seeds were deployed. At each cache, I measured the number of seeds (cache size), cache substrate (needle litter or soil), distance moved, and the distance to the nearest trees using the point-centered quarter method. Chipmunks transported seeds farther on thinned than unthinned units (P = 0. 027) but cache size (seeds per cache) did not differ significantly between thinned (13. 79 ?? 1. 25) and unthinned (12. 84 ?? 1. 21) units. On unthinned forest units, chipmunks placed caches in areas farther from trees than expected by chance (P = 0. 048). Regardless of unit treatment, chipmunks placed caches in soil substrate more often than expected based on its availability (c 2 = 173. 76, P < 0. 0001). Chipmunk abundance on each unit was positively correlated with the number of caches found and negatively correlated with the number of seeds per cache (r 2 = 0. 48, r 2 = 0. 86, respectively). Average (?? SE) number of seeds removed was greater on thinned units (11. 4 ?? 2. 9 %/day) than on unthinned units (8. 6 ?? 2. 1 %/day). The cone crop in 2002 was very light for ponderosa pines and nonexistent for white fir (Abies concolor). Tamias senex tended to place caches in locations that favored recruitment and establishment of ponderosa pine seedlings (i. e. in mineral soil and in forest openings) and therefore may contribute to the natural regeneration of ponderosa pine forest...|$|E
40|$|While {{the global}} network of marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{has recently been}} evaluated {{in the light of}} bio-geographic targets, there has been no attempt to evaluate the relative conservation efforts made by the different nations with regards to their level of socio-economic development. Using information mostly gathered from the world database on protected areas (WDPA), this paper gives a comparative assessment of MPA progress in countries from different economic categories, ranging from advanced economies to least developed countries (LDCs). Potentially explanatory socio-economic and environmental factors, such as fishing activity and existence of vulnerable marine ecosystems, for variability between nations in the level of MPA implementation are also explored. Existing MPA databases demonstrate a clear gap between developed and developing nations in MPA establishment, with advanced economies accounting for two thirds of the global MPA network. Patterns of MPA use, however, remain extremely heterogeneous between countries within each development group. International agreements on marine conservation, above and beyond the influence of country socioeconomic and environmental profiles, are identified as a stimulating factor to MPA implementation. The level dependence on marine resource extraction appears to impede MPA implementation, though the relationship is not statistically significant due to large heterogeneity among countries. Leading developed nations increasingly use MPAs to designate integrated and <b>adaptive</b> <b>management</b> <b>areas,</b> and implementation of large "no-take" reserves in relatively-pristine overseas areas continues to accelerate. These analyses highlight certain limitations regarding our ability to assess the true conservation effectiveness of the existing global MPA network and the need for improved indicators of MPA restrictions and management efforts...|$|R

Only data from the collar traps with the specimens identified to high taxonomic levels are reported in this paper. Equal numbers of traps were placed on white fir (Abies concolor) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Three stages of log decomposition, recently dead to soft but structurally intact, were sampled from each tree species. The insects from all traps were sorted to order, except for the Coleoptera, which were sorted to family or species level. The most numerous insects belong to the Order Diptera, followed by Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Staphylinidae were the most numerous coleopterans, excluding the earliest decay stage in both tree species, where the Scolytidae were dominant.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{implementation and}} early {{results of a}} large-scale, interdisciplinary experiment in the Goosenest <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> in northeastern California. The study is designed to investigate development of late-successional forest attributes in secondgrowth ponderosa pine stands. The experiment has four treatments replicated five times and encompasses 1600 hectares, including controls. Complete treatment implementation took five years, including application of prescribed fire. Initial post-treatment measurements were conducted in 2002. Change in quadratic mean diameter averaged 12. 5 cm among thinned stands. Initial estimates of post-treatment growth from remeasured diameters indicate little immediate impact of treatments on individual tree growth. However increment cores from dominant trees showed an increase in diameter growth by 11 to 14 percent in the treated plots {{during the first three}} years after treatment. Quadratic mean diameter in thinned stands was still well below that reported in reference old-growth stands. Among those stands treated with a targeted change in species composition, the mean treatment effect was an increase of 16 percent in proportion of pine basal area, with a range from 6 to 29 percent. The control treatment and thin from below treatment showed no significant change in species composition. The initial application of prescribed fire resulted in little mortality (less than 1 percent for large trees) and had no immediate impact on the diameter distribution. Logging damage observed on residual trees varied between 2 and 6 percent, depending on treatment and tree size...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Disturbances are a {{prevalent}} {{and important}} part of ecosystems. Many landscape patterns that we find today were created, maintained, and changed by natural disturbance regimes. This {{is especially true for}} fire, which has historically been a common, natural disturbance in the western U. S forests and grasslands and many other parts of the globe. I reconstructed fire history and interpreted fire regime in 117 clearcuts distributed throughout a 45, 000 ha study area within the Little River watershed, an <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> in southwestern Oregon. Tree rings were counted on over 3, 000 stumps and provided a 683 -year record of fire. The study area fire regime can be characterized by its variability. The composite median fire return interval for the study area was approximately 123 years. Fire extents were not estimated, but historical fires tended to be relatively small, usually occurring within less than 2. 5 km. Low and moderate severity surface fires appeared to have been more common than stand-replacement fires indicating a moderate severity fire regime with much spatial variability in severity. The fire regime has changed temporally and spatially over the fire history record. Five distinct changes in the rate of fire occurrence were identified (1490 - 1569, 1570 - 1844, 1845 - 1899, 1900 - 1925, and 1926 - 1996) and associated with changes in climate and human fire ignition and fire suppression. Fires were dispersed throughout the study area, probably due to dispersed lightning ignitions and small fire extents. As a result, fire frequency was wealdy correlated with topography. However, during the 1845 - 1899 time period, more fires occurred at low elevations, suggesting an influence of Euro-American settler fire ignitions...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Despite {{the belief}} that fuels management, a form of {{prescribed}} fire that reduces accumulated fuels in commercially thinned forests, is necessary to restore forest 'health' in the Pacific Northwest, its effects on wildlife has received little attention in the scientific literature. Because fuels management is supported, funded, and implemented nationwide under the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, {{it is imperative to}} understand how these management activities affect wildlife. In this field experiment, I used mark-recapture methods to examine community, population, and individual responses of small mammals one year following three fuels-management treatments (lop and scatter, pile, and pile/bum) in three commercially thinned Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest stands within the Applegate <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> of southwest Oregon. Fifteen species were captured during two years of study, and I found that fuels treatments did not appear to affect species richness or evenness, nor did they affect population densities and survival of the two most abundant species, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and western red-backed vole (Clethrionomys californicus). In study plots where fuels provided variable distributions and amounts of cover, only deer mice used piled fuels significantly more than available while randomly using fuels that were lopped and scattered. Deer mouse numbers decreased and their home ranges increased with increasing distance from piled fuels. Thus, it appears that although these three fuels treatments do not affect the population density of deer mice in my study area, piled fuels do affect the distribution and home range size of individuals within these populations, leading to a shift in their local distribution. I hypothesize that environmental conditions created by the open canopy following thinning in this study may have led to poor-quality forest-floor habitat for small mammals, which could have dampened small mammal community- and population-level responses one year following fuels treatments. I recommend that future studies of wildlife responses to fuels management in the Pacific Northwest consider interactions between commercial thinning, fuels management, and regional climate conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the relative abundance of bird species between two ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in northeastern California: {{one with a}} canopy of large old-growth trees present (Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest, BMEF) {{and the other with}} large trees essentially absent (Goosenest <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area,</b> GAMA). We surveyed 24 units at BMEF and 20 at GAMA using point counts and {{compared the}} relative abundance of bird species detected at the two locations using Wilcoxon-rank tests. Overall bird species composition was similar at the two locations. Of the 51 species detected at both locations, 29 were detected at both GAMA and BMEF, 14 were only detected at BMEF and 8 were only detected at GAMA. Most of the species that were detected at only one site were rare at the site where they were observed. Plot diversity (the number of bird species detected on a plot) did not differ between the two locations. Bird species were lumped into four foraging guilds, woodpeckers, bark gleaners, foliage gleaners, and flycatchers, to examine if foraging ecology predicted differences in abundance between the two sites. Woodpeckers, bark gleaners, and flycatchers were more abundant at BMEF while foliage gleaners were more abundant at GAMA. Differences in the abundances of individual species were generally consistent with the overall guild differences. For instance, Williamson’s Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus thyroideus), Hairy and White-headed Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus and P. albolarvatus), and Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) were all significantly more abundant at BMEF than GAMA. The only species whose abundance was not consistent with the difference in guild abundance was the Red-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), a bark gleaner, which was more abundant at GAMA. These results are consistent with other studies suggesting that woodpeckers and bark gleaners are strongly associated with large trees and snags. The dense canopy of small to medium sized trees at GAMA relative to BMEF may account for the higher density of foliage gleaners at GAMA...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Geographic Information Systems (GIS) {{have become}} an {{essential}} tool for evaluation and monitoring the biophysical data of natural landscapes. This study addresses the potential for using GIS in the social assessment of human landscapes {{that are associated with}} geographic regions of interest. Using the communities surrounding Oregon's federally designated Central Cascades <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> (CCAMA) as a case study, this project attempts to incorporate primary and secondary socio-economic data into map layers suitable for assessment and monitoring purposes. The purpose is twofold: to provide the responsible resource management agencies (Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management) with useful information about their constituent communities and to test the value of GIS as an aid in the social assessment process. Initially, population density maps and interviews with community leaders and agency personnel were used to derive maps of aggregate census blocks for spatially defined relevant communities within the study area. These "community maps" became the basis for analyses of the human ecology and provided a method for assessing community well-being. This study replicates protocols established on the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project (SNEP) and two products have resulted. First, a socio-economic scale has been developed drawing on data from the Housing and Population Census. Variables of interest include housing tenure, poverty level, education, employment, and public assistance and have been used to indicate a measure of community well-being. Second, a community capacity scale has been constructed based on quantitative survey data from key informants. This scale includes composite measures of physical infrastructure (e. g. condition of the infrastructure, financial resources, emphasis on quality of business and community), human capital (e. g. support for education, knowledge of the environment, awareness of competitive markets, use of information resources), and social capital or civic responsiveness (e. g. ability to work together, levels of volunteerism, multigenerational family orientation). The two scales combine to provide an assessment of community well-being. The data from the socio-economic and community capacity scales are plotted on the community maps in the GIS. This allows land managers to visualize the relative differences in their constituent communities. It also provides baseline information and a methodology to continue monitoring social time series data...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Two {{research}} questions are posed: (1) How have ecosystem conditions changed through time in southwestern Oregon? (2) How have culture-driven and climate-driven processes contributed to ecosystem change in southwestern Oregon? A brief {{introduction to the}} Little River study area {{is followed by a}} cultural and ecological history of the watershed. Historical, ecological and archaeological data are used to describe shifts in landscape structure, stand structure and fire behavior. Changes in corridor/patch/matrix relationships, increases in stand densities, and changes in stand age and species structure are documented, and changes in fire dynamics from frequent to infrequent, and small to large are corroborated with descriptive statistics from the nearby 2002 Umpqua Fires. Hypotheses are then proposed to test the relative influence of humans vs. climate on landscape change during Aboriginal (< 1820) vs. Euroagrarian (1850 - 1950) cultural phases. While precipitation shows no correlation with fire frequency or tree recruitment before 1820, significant associations are observed from 1850 to 1950. Moreover, a significant correlation exists between fire frequency and subsequent tree recruitment after 1850, but is not observed during aboriginal times. This suggests that indigenous management fires may have obscured precipitation influences that become apparent only after 1850. In order to test spatial hypotheses concerning the associations between indigenous humans and the landscape, archaeological sites were digitized into a GIS, and ergonomic pathways were modeled between them. These maps are then compared to historically fire-maintained upland meadows interpreted from 1946 aerial photos. A significant spatial correlation was found between archaeological sites and historic meadows, and a highly significant spatial correlation was found between modeled travel networks and historic meadows. The close spatial association between cultural features and fire-maintained habitats again suggests active landscape management by local Indians. These associations are corroborated with historical records. After summarizing the shifts in ecological conditions and describing current conditions, I argue that while restoring the landscape to aboriginal conditions is no longer possible, emulating those conditions {{within the framework of the}} Little River <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> Plan can improve the resilience and productivity of the Little River watershed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Few studies {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between ecological knowledge and public preferences for natural resource management options. The Central Cascades <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> (CCAMA) and McKenzie watershed of western Oregon provides an opportunity to examine the relationship. This research project employs a mixed model approach to explore public knowledge of forest practices and preferred methods for information exchange. Semi-structured interviews, a mail survey of the general and attentive public, focus groups and participant observation provide data used to examine {{the relationship between}} public ecological knowledge, preferences for information exchange, and desired levels of public involvement. A random sample of residents taken from telephone directories formed the general public. The attentive public sample was drawn from a pre-existing USFS list of stakeholders who requested to stay abreast of natural resource issues in the watershed. These groups were then divided by zip code to analyze potential differences between urban and rural residents. The survey collected data on the public's familiarity with a variety of terms, organizations and projects in the watershed, knowledge of forest processes and general ecology, preferred forms of information transfer, the characteristics of useful information sources, general preferences for public involvement in natural resource management decisions and opinions about a specific USFS project, the Blue River Landscape Study (BRLS). The mixed model approach integrated qualitative and quantitative research techniques through all stages of research. Key findings include significant differences between the attentive and general publics, however not between the urban and rural residents as expected. The attentive public not only rated their environmental knowledge and familiarity with each project, organization and term higher than the general public, the former scored higher on a quiz of ecological and forest management knowledge. In addition to "attentive," gender (male) and level of education were the only characteristics correlated with increased scientific knowledge. Despite differences in scientific knowledge scores, all population groups (attentive, general, urban, and rural) similarly ranked information sources. Personal experience, relatives, friends and neighbors and the USFS received the highest usefulness rating, which was mirrored by trustworthiness scores. Though the attentive public gave higher scores to university scientists than the general public, both favored interactive methods of information transfer such as field trips, personal conversations and small presentations. This preference for interactive methods of information transfer echoes the finding that all population groups desire more involvement in natural resource decision making...|$|E

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2007 I {{examined}} foraging habitat use, foraging {{site selection}} and diet of Cooper???s Hawks within the Goosenest <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> in northern California, where experimental interior Ponderosa pine forest restoration treatments have been applied. Two different thinning treatments and a thinning and prescribed burning treatment were randomly applied to fifteen 40 -ha units within the management area between 1998 and 2001. I radio-tagged and tracked nesting adults, and collected vegetation measurements at paired foraging and random locations during the 2005 and 2006 breeding seasons to assess foraging habitat selection at the stand-level and microhabitat spatial scales. In addition, I placed video systems on nests and used data collected on small mammal abundance in treatment and untreated control units to assess diet composition and prey abundance in foraging areas. I examined the prediction that Cooper???s Hawks were selectively foraging in more open forest types both because these stands had higher abundances of preferred prey species and because their vegetation structure allowed for easier detection and acquisition of prey. Tagged hawks nested exclusively in dense, untreated stands, but selected more open forest types, including thinned and thinned/burned units and untreated matrix with open structure, for foraging. At the microsite scale, tagged hawks were selecting foraging sites with larger trees, higher tree densities, and lower canopy cover, though small differences between foraging and paired random locations across all vegetation variables collected indicated that selection among tagged hawks was occurring primarily at the stand level. Hawks delivered significantly more mammalian than avian prey to nests in both years, with golden-mantled ground squirrel (Spermophilus lateralis) and chipmunk species (Eutamius senex and E. amoenus) comprising over 98 % of delivered mammalian prey in both years. Spermophilus lateralis and Eutamius amoenus abundance {{was significantly higher}} on thinned and thinned/burned treatment units than on untreated controls in both years. Thus, Cooper???s Hawk preference for foraging in thinned and thinned/burned plots {{may be influenced by}} both vegetation structure and prey abundance. In addition, my results indicate that thinning and thinning/burning treatments aimed at restoring a more natural condition to interior Ponderosa pine forests can enhance foraging habitat for breeding Cooper???s Hawks, but that dense, untreated stands must also be retained to provide suitable nesting habitat...|$|E

Our research explores this potential disconnect between <b>adaptive</b> <b>management</b> theory and practice by interviewing practitioners in the field. We conducted a survey of individuals associated with the Collaborative <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> Network (CAMNet), a nongovernmental organization that promotes <b>adaptive</b> <b>management</b> and facilitates in its implementation. The survey was sent via email to the 144 participants who attended CAMNet Rendezvous during 2007 - 2011 and yielded 48 responses.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Growing {{emphasis}} on ecosystem and landscape-level forest management across North America has spurred {{an examination of}} alternative management strategies which focus on emulating dynamic natural disturbance processes, particularly those associated with forest fire regimes. This topic {{is the cornerstone of}} research in the Blue River Landscape Study (BRLS) taking place in the Central Cascades <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area,</b> located in the McKenzie River watershed of western Oregon. As scientists and managers involved with the BRLS work to unravel the ecological and economic implications of disturbance-based forest management, they must also consider the level of public acceptability for such an approach. Currently there is little information regarding what citizens know about disturbance-based management, their confidence in natural resource agencies to carry out this approach, and their overall level of support for it. This thesis summarizes research on public acceptability of using historical disturbance as a guide for future forest management. Specifically, it examines the perceptions of disturbance-based management held by members of the attentive public in McKenzie River watershed communities and the cities of Eugene and Springfield. The study is based upon responses to a mail questionnaire distributed to this group in the summer and fall of 2005. This questionnaire covered three broad categories: participants’ knowledge of forest management and ecosystem processes, their opinions about citizen-agency interactions, and their judgments about the use of disturbance-based management practices, including perceived risks and uncertainties associated with this approach. This study yielded several important findings. First, members of the attentive public in the McKenzie watershed have high levels of knowledge with respect to basic ecosystem management terms, and lower levels of knowledge about landscape-level disturbance processes. Knowledge of disturbance-based management techniques is also low, and terminology associated with this approach is not intuitive for citizens. Second, public confidence in agencies and the information they provide appears to be problematic, though McKenzie watershed citizens tend to trust local agency personnel more than agencies as institutions (e. g. federal or regional level). Third, respondents display cautious support of disturbance-based management, with several qualifications. These include {{emphasis on}} the need for projects based on sound science, transparent and inclusive decision-making processes, frank disclosure of risks and uncertainties associated with projects, and clear management objectives. Based on these findings, several recommendations can be made. First, acknowledge the important role that attentive citizens in McKenzie communities can play in making decisions about new management strategies, and engage them from the very beginning in decision-making processes. Second, objectives and rationale behind disturbance-based management approaches must be clarified for the public. Agencies can capitalize on the existing high level of basic knowledge of forests and ecosystem processes to cultivate understanding of disturbance-emulating techniques. Third, address issues of risk and uncertainty associated with a disturbance-based management approach. These issues are often primary factors in the public’s willingness to accept forest management practices, particularly those that are new and largely untested. Fourth and finally, focus on improving citizen-agency interactions, not just on a per-project basis, but as a central, long-term goal...|$|E
40|$|Interstate 90 {{over the}} Cascades is a {{significant}} barrier to over 250 species of wildlife, including cougar, elk, deer, mustelids (otters, fishers, badgers, etc.), amphibians, and reptiles. In the vicinity of Snoqualmie Pass, urban development {{to the west and}} agriculture and resort development on the east has shrunk the forest connecting the north and south Cascades to less than 64. 6 kilometers wide. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is proposing to expand a 24. 15 -kilometer stretch of Interstate 90 just east of Snoqualmie Pass through a particularly critical zone for north-south wildlife corridors. Absent effective wildlife-crossing structures, the expansion would worsen the barrier by increasing roadkill and further isolating populations, thus inhibiting genetic exchange. However, the state has made ecological connectivity a project goal, along with increasing capacity, straightening curves, and repaving. The I- 90 Wildlife Bridges Coalition has been working with WSDOT, other public officials, transportation interests, and the public to promote high-quality wildlife-crossing structures. Such structures can also improve safety for motorists by reducing collisions that are sometimes fatal to humans, as well as wildlife. Good data is available to inform where to build crossing structures. WSDOT and the US Forest Service collaborated on a study entitled I- 90 Snoqualmie Pass Wildlife Habitat Linkage Assessment (Singleton and Lehmkuhl 2000) that used tracking and road-kill counts to map existing crossing activity. Additional relevant information comes from analysis leading to the Snoqualmie Pass <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> Plan and I- 90 Land Exchange (US Forest Service, 1997 and 1999) and Washington State Dept. of Fish and Wildlife studies of cougar movements using radio collars. Recent land acquisitions and national forest-management changes have dramatically improved the outlook for habitat quality near the project. In recent years, purchases, donations, and exchanges have brought more than 50, 000 acres of land valued at $ 200 million into public ownership and protection. The Forest Service is committing to additional habitat restoration, such as road removal. Two of the distinguishing features of the I- 90 project are the prevalence of wetlands associated with the Yakima River and the variation in habitat as precipitation and elevation decline from west to east. A variety of structure types—from extended vehicle bridges, to box culverts, to overpasses specifically for wildlife—is required to allow both hydrological connectivity and connections for a diverse array of species. Preferred habitat conditions and existing movement patterns are balanced with site-specific design considerations, including cost, to establish a range of possible solutions to be presented in a draft environmental-impact statement due in spring 2005. Given the intense competition for transportation funds, particularly big-ticket projects near urban areas, the I- 90 Snoqualmie Pass East project will need broad-based support to obtain funding. To overcome the environmental community’s general opposition to expanded freeways, the project will need to provide a high level of wildlife connectivity. Project proponents will also need to navigate anti-tax politics by joining in a diverse coalition of agencies, conservation groups, and shipping interests. The recent partnership to acquire habitat north and south of the project points the way. The coalition has grown out of a history of grassroots activism and collaboration around the Central Cascades region. Citizen involvement has {{played a critical role in}} the management policies of this area. The I- 90 project will be a greater success due to the high level of attention and input received from the public. Public involvement will have peaked in the spring of 2005 with the release of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement followed by five public comment hearings throughout Washington State. This input will be considered throughout the summer of 2005 and (hopefully) brought to a successful completion in the fall/winter of the same year...|$|E

These corridors have been identified through numerous studies, and the state has made ecological connectivity a project goal, along with increasing capacity, straightening curves, and repaving. A preferred alternative design for this project was chosen in summer 2006 that includes numerous high quality crossing structures, and was endorsed by the I- 90 Wildlife Bridges Coalition. The I- 90 Wildlife Bridges Coalition is made up of over 40 local and national conservation organizations and has been working with WSDOT, other public officials, transportation interests, and the public to promote high quality wildlife crossing structures in this project while educating the public in our state about transportation and ecology issues. An additional role beyond advocacy and education that the coalition has engaged in during 2006 is citizen wildlife monitoring at the proposed crossing structure locations. Good data is available to inform where to build crossing structures.

In light of these changes to the landscape and the large investment of the crossing structures, the coalition is acting to contribute to the data collection of current and future wildlife usage of habitat in the project vicinity. The coalition has sponsored digital remote cameras that have been installed at proposed crossing structure locations to gather still photograph and video images of wildlife moving through the area. These cameras are maintained by coalition volunteer teams, and data is shared through the website. This winter the coalition has launched a partnership with the Wilderness Awareness School to begin snow tracking monitoring at selected proposed crossing structure locations to compliment our current remote camera program. Both of these programs have begun this year, and are intended for long term monitoring.

40|$|Within {{the field}} of natural-resources management, the {{application}} of <b>adaptive</b> <b>management</b> is appropriate for complex problems high in uncertainty. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>management</b> is becoming an increasingly popular management-decision tool within the scientific community and has developed into two primary schools of thought: the Resilience-Experimentalist School (with high emphasis on stakeholder involvement, resilience, and highly complex models) and the Decision-Theoretic School (which results in relatively simple models through emphasizing stakeholder involvement for identifying management objectives). Because of these differences, <b>adaptive</b> <b>management</b> plans implemented under each of these schools may yield varying levels of success. We evaluated peer-reviewed literature focused on incorporation of <b>adaptive</b> <b>management</b> to identify components of successful <b>adaptive</b> <b>management</b> plans.
