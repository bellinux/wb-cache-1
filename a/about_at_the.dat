Kramer, and Gerry & the Pacemakers. One third of all U.S. top ten hits in 1964 were by British acts. After the tour's final concert in New York, the Beatles were introduced to Bob Dylan, a meeting brought <b>about</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> instigation of the New York journalist Al Aronowitz, who arranged for Dylan to visit the Beatles at their hotel before they returned to the UK.|$|E

On her own, Kallik decides to go to a gathering place for polar bears that her mom told her <b>about.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> gathering, Kallik asks other polar bears if they have seen her brother, but no one has. Alone, Kallik meets a female bear Nanuk who helps Kallik around the area. However, Nanuk is killed by a helicopter crash shipping her and Kallik back to the wild. Before she dies, Nanuk tells Kallik about a place where the ice never melts. Hearing this, Kallik sets off to this place.|$|E

A second synthesis was brought <b>about</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 20th century by advances in molecular genetics, creating the field of evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo"), which seeks to explain the evolution of form in terms of the genetic regulatory programs which control the development of the embryo at molecular level.

The mental foramen (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E

25|$|A {{key part}} of Severin's thesis is that whilst {{the text of the}} Odyssey {{contains}} many place names to the east and south of Greece, there are very few identifiable references to places to the west. As a result, he questions whether the western Mediterranean was known <b>about</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time the original legends emerged (which he estimated to be some centuries before Homer composed the poem) and so consequently he doubted whether the stories had their origins there. In addition he noted that the Acheron is marked on the map, but traditionally ignored, whilst in the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes the Argonauts' home voyage took them into the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, corresponding to a north west Greek location for many of the later adventures.|$|E

The Illusive Man debriefs and tells Shepard about how the someone has been abducting human colonies and may be working with the Reapers, a sentient machine race dedicated to wiping out all organic life. In order to help Shepard launch an assault on the Reaper base, he provides the Commander with a ship, crew, and dossiers on potential squadmates. Over the course of the game, he sends Shepard to investigate Freedom's Progress, a recently abducted colony where Shepard discovers that the Collectors are behind the attack; Horizon, a colony in the process of being abducted; and a Collector ship, which turns out to be a trap—one that the Illusive Man knew <b>about.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the game, the Illusive Man sends Shepard to the Collector base, where the player decides whether to disable and turn over the base, or to destroy the base and cut all ties with Cerberus.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 Simpson {{developed}} {{a special interest}} in cosmic rays, which very little was known <b>about</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time as the field which was {{still in the process of}} being established, including their origin. Beginning with investigations pertaining to the cosmic ray neutrons in the lower atmosphere, Simpson was there from the beginning developmental phases of the field, and contributed significantly throughout the years to its development with his scientific investigations. Simpson's contributions were unique in that he somehow accomplished his work in a way which boosted the accomplishments and careers of others around him such as graduate students, research associates and other faculty. In 1955 he gave Eugene N. Parker a job as a research associate in the Enrico Fermi Institute of the University of Chicago, and his progress was largely a consequence of Simpson's continued support. His research on cosmic ray neutrons in the lower atmosphere was developed upon its founding by Serge Korff before World War II. Simpson in his research contributed the discovery that the latitude effect seen with neutrons is around 20 times greater than with ionization chambers in 1949. In 1951 he found that the time variations are much greater as well. He had recognized the potential of the neutrons and the lower energy cosmic ray particles for exploring the causes of the time variations. That year he also invented the neutron monitor to fulfill the need for a stable ground-based neutron detector. In doing so, he established neutron monitor stations at various locations including Peru, Huancayo, Mexico, Mexico City, New Mexico, Sacramento Peak, Colorado, Climax, and Chicago Illinois.|$|E

Early sketches revealed that the creators wanted to dress her like a holy woman, and at one point she had a shaved head, with her body covered with tattoos, however, the creators thought that this way of showing her malevolent side was too obvious.

[...] When she experimented with other genres on Aaliyah, such as Latin pop and heavy metal, Entertainment Weeklys Craig Seymour panned the attempt. While Analyzing her eponymous [...] album British publication NME (New Musical Express) felt that Aaliyah's radical third album was intended to consolidate her position as U.S.R's most experimental artist. As her albums progressed, writers felt that Aaliyah matured, calling her progress a [...] "declaration of strength and independence".

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described her eponymous album, Aaliyah, as [...] "a statement of maturity and a stunning artistic leap forward" [...] and called it one of the strongest urban soul records of its time. She portrayed [...] "unfamiliar sounds, styles and emotions", but managed to please critics with the contemporary sound it contained.
