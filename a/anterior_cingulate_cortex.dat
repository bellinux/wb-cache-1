5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulate</b> <b>cortex,</b> angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E

The present study examined {{the effect of a}} session of acute aerobic exercise on working memory task-evoked brain activity as well as task performance. A within-subjects design with a counterbalanced order was employed. Fifteen young female participants (M = 19. 56, SD = 0. 81) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a working memory task, the N-back task, both following an acute exercise session with 20 minutes of moderate intensity and a control rest session.

A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity.

The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants.

40|$|In recent years, {{the deficit}} of {{inhibition}} {{has become an}} important reason for explaining addiction. Response inhibition resembles the compulsive drug seeking behavior {{and it is the}} basement of addiction inhibition deficits. However, there were no enough evidence for the relationship between addiction and response inhibition deficits and the results of the neuro mechanisms studies remains unclear. Few studies has focused on the exploring the heroin users. Among those paradigms for study response inhibition deficits, stop signal is a very suitable model for the representation of compulsive drug seeking, but only a few researches has worked on this paradigm. In this study, we selected about 100 heroin abusers and had behaviour and neuro imaging scannings for investigating the response inhibition deficits. The behaviour researches found: first, the chronic heroin users had longer reaction time than control group and this reaction time were not affected by stop signals in heroin users. Second, heroin users had less waiting time than control group and they were more impulsive but less flexibility. Their erro monitoring and flexibale adjustment ability decreased. Third, the SSRT of heroin users was significantly longer than control group. These results suggested that the inhibition of heroin users were impaired. Further investigation showed that the SSRT of heroin users had positive correlation of four factor scores of ASI and the macro correlation coefficient was factor three of drug use. This correlation suggested that drug use was the main reason of inhibition deficits. fMRI results mainly focused on the ANOVA analysis for group difference. First, there was no intensity difference in M 1 and SMA brain areas between the two groups. Second, heroin users had less activation in right dorsalateral prefrontal cortex, right inferior prefrontal <b>cortex</b> and <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulated</b> <b>cortex,</b> while in bilateral striatum and amygdala, heroin users had more activation than control group. The right prefrontal cortex was indentified as the main inhibition brain area. The <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulated</b> <b>cortex</b> has relationship with erro monitoring and amygdale was an important brain area for impulsivity and emotion control. The network of these brain areas was envovled in impulsivity and inhibition and it was suggested the mainly damaged network for heroin users’ disinhibition. We also investigated the gray matter changes of heroin users and found that chonic heroin use made their gray matter density decreased in prefrontal cortex (including bilateral dorsalateral prefrontal cortex, obital frontal cortex, inferior prefrontal <b>cortex)</b> and <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulated</b> <b>cortex.</b> The gray matter density in these brain regions had negative correlation with drug use duration. In conclusion, we indentified the disinhibition of heroin users and its neuro mechanism. Their compulsivity brain areas had more activation than control group and their inhibition brain areas had less activation than normal control. On the other side, the biological mechanism of this activation changes was the gray matter density decrease in these brain areas. 近年来提出，抑制功能损伤是药物成瘾的一个重要原因，其中反应抑制缺陷是和冲动性的觅药行为紧密相关的，也是造成药物成瘾抑制缺陷的基础，但目前并没有充分的实验证据确定药物成瘾与行为抑制功能缺陷之间的关系，对相关神经基础研究的实验结果很不一致，而针对纯海洛因吸毒者的行为抑制脑成像研究报道极少。 目前用来研究反应抑制缺陷的实验范式中，stop-signal范式是和冲动性的觅药行为最接近的，最能体现这一特征下的反应抑制能力，但是研究的最不清楚。因此我们采用stop-signal实验范式为主，对 100 多名慢性海洛因依赖者进行了较为系统的行为学和/或脑成像测量。 行为学研究显示：(1) 慢性海洛因成瘾者的简单反应时间长于控制组被试，对运动信号的反应时间似乎不受停止信号的影响；(2) 在完成任务的策略上，海洛因依赖者倾向于更少的等待效应、更强的冲动性，同时对错误反应的监控和随时调整能力下降；(3) 海洛因依赖组的停止信号反应时(SSRT) 值显著长于控制组被试。这些结果确认了海洛因依赖者的行为抑制能力受损。进一步相关分析表明，海洛因依赖者的SSRT与其成瘾严重性指数(ASI) 的四个分项指标呈正相关，其中和药物使用情况的相关最强，说明成瘾药物的使用可能是造成海洛因依赖者抑制功能损害的主要原因。 fMRI结果显示：(1) 成瘾组和控制组在M 1 、SMA后部等运动执行区都没有显著差异；(2) 但在要求对行为进行控制时，成瘾组在右侧背外侧前额叶、右侧腹侧前额叶、扣带回前部等脑区的激活强度都显著弱于控制组被试，而在双侧纹状体和杏仁核，成瘾组的激活强于控制组(显著或边缘显著) 。右侧前额叶被认为是执行抑制功能的主要脑区，扣带回和错误监控等能力密切相关，而杏仁核一直被视为是冲动性、情绪控制的关键结构。这些脑区构成冲动与控制的神经环路，海洛因依赖者抑制功能损伤可能与这个环路的活动异常有关。 脑结构测量显示，长期用药导致海洛因依赖患者前额叶广泛区域(包括双侧背外侧前额叶、额叶眶部、腹内侧额叶) 和扣带回灰质密度下降，并且这种灰质密度下降随着患者药物依赖程度的加重而加剧。 总之，本研究结果不但确认了纯海洛因依赖者抑制能力受损，而且证明其神经基础为冲动相关脑区活动增强和参与认知控制脑区活动减弱，而药物导致前额叶结构损伤可能是根本原因...|$|R

Problems like this make it difficult to determine what areas are specifically implicated in TOT states, and which are a byproduct of other cognitive functions. However, some inferences can be made about the roles of these structures based on theories of their functions derived from other studies of these structures, unrelated to TOT. It is hypothesized that the <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulate</b> <b>cortex</b> and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operate as a circuit to detect conflict, and may perform this role in detecting the conflict between the feeling of knowing the target word and the recall failure. The <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulate</b> <b>cortex</b> is also implicated in emotion and may show activation because of the emotional response to the tip of the tongue state. The posterior medial parietal cortex, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and the bilateral superior prefrontal cortex are involved in retrieval and evaluation, and therefore may play a role in the metacognitive processes involved in the tip of the tongue phenomenon such as the evaluation of one's own knowledge and the probability of retrieval.|$|E

In the time-based task, the activation in the blocks where the cue was not expected was higher in the <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulated</b> <b>cortex</b> and superior frontal gyrus, while the caudate nucleus was active during the block requiring the monitoring of time, therefore likely reflected time processing processes. These results suggest that PM cue predictability influences monitoring processes and that neural correlates of strategic monitoring, but not maintaining processes, were task-specific...|$|R
40|$|There {{is general}} {{acknowledgement}} {{that both the}} <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulate</b> and orbitofrontal <b>cortex</b> are implicated in reinforcement-guided decision making, and emotion and social behaviour. Despite the interest that these areas generate in both the cognitive neuroscience laboratory and the psychiatric clinic, ideas about the distinctive contributions made by each have only recently begun to emerge. This reflects an increasing understanding of the component processes that underlie reinforcement-guided decision making, such as the representation of reinforcement expectations, the exploration, updating and representation of action values, and the appreciation that choices are guided not just {{by the prospect of}} reward but also by the costs that action entails. Evidence is emerging to suggest that the <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulate</b> and orbitofrontal <b>cortex</b> make distinct contributions to each of these aspects of decision making...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} abnormalities in {{the brain}} circuitry for affect processing in patients with affective disorders, and effects of antidepressant drugs on this circuitry. The first experimental study examined brain activation {{in response to an}} implicit and explicit facial recognition task by employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a group of 8 manic and 8 depressed patients with bipolar disorder and 8 healthy comparison controls. This comparison showed that depressed and manic patients exhibited over activated responses to fearful faces, as well as to mood-incongruent facial expressions, with the depressed group exhibiting over-activity in fronto-striato-thalamic systems in response to happy faces, and the manic group over-activity in the fusiform gyrus in response to sad faces. For manic patients, task type also affected the neural response to sad faces, with the cortico-limbic regions showing over-activation for implicit processing and under-activation for explicit processing. In the following part of the thesis, the neurophysiology underlying major depression and neural correlates of antidepressant drug effects were studied. Brain activation in response to the implicit sad facial recognition task, and brain structure, were examined in a group of 17 patients with major depression using functional and structural MRI before and after a course of 8 weeks antidepressant treatment. Faster rates of symptom improvement were strongly associated with greater grey matter volume in the <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulated</b> <b>cortex,</b> insula and right temporo-parietal cortex. Patients with greater than median grey matter volume in this system had faster rates of improvement and significantly lower residual symptoms scores after treatment. Faster improvement was also predicted by greater functional activation of the <b>anterior</b> <b>cingulated</b> <b>cortex.</b> Depressive symptom severity was negatively correlated with greater grey matter volume in the dorsal prefrontal and anterior midcingulate regions anatomically distinct from the pregenual and subgenual cingulate regions predicting treatment response. Furthermore, patients with major depression were compared with 19 matched healthy controls to investigate changes in the effective connectivity between the amygdala and all other brain areas in response to facial emotions at baseline and after antidepressant treatment. The results indicate that antidepressant drug effects can be measured in terms of altered connectivity between components of cortico-limbic systems.
