40|$|BackgroundSitting on {{inappropriate}} benches, {{as well as}} {{the poor}} posture (body position) during the years of growth, can lead to spinal disorders, fatigue and discomfort in students. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between features of desks <b>and</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> prevalence of some musculoskeletal disorders in primary school students in Abadan. Materials and MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015 in the city of Abadan- South West of Iran; for which, 383 primary school students were selected and studied through cluster sampling method. Data were collected by the checkered board and researcher-made questionnaire. Features and dimensions of desks <b>and</b> <b>chairs</b> of students were recorded and evaluated based on their condition (being standard or not). Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS, version 22; and then, descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were conducted. ResultsStudy results showed that about 56. 1 % of the desks <b>and</b> <b>chairs</b> in under study schools were non-standard. It found that drooping shoulder (85. 4 %) and scoliosis (81. 7 %) were the more prevalent disorders and back straight (1. 6 %) was the least frequent disorder. There was a significant relationship between the variable of non-standard desks <b>and</b> <b>chairs</b> <b>and</b> prevalence of drooping shoulders (P= 0. 001), scoliosis (P= 0. 04), kyphosis (P= 0. 007) and lordosis (P= 0. 002) disorders in students. ConclusionThe non-standard-sized desks <b>and</b> <b>chairs</b> increase the prevalence of skeletal disorders in schoolchildren. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention to design and build standard classroom desks <b>and</b> <b>chairs,</b> which are best, adjust to students’ physics...|$|R
