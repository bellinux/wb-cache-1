40|$|A rapid {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) {{method for}} the simultaneous {{analysis of the}} antiviral drug azidothymidine (AZT), AZT monophosphate, AZT diphosphate and <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> with ultraviolet detection in the nanomolar range, is described. Determination of these compounds in vitro in the human MT- 4 lymphocyte cell line did not require a prior extraction, and AZT and its phosphorylated derivatives could be accurately analysed in one HPLC run. However, plasma, bile, liver homogenate and urine samples could not be injected directly into the chromatograph. Therefore, a solid-phase extraction procedure was developed. using azidodideoxyinosine as internal standard. The extractions of the compounds of interest from all but urine samples were reproducible, with recoveries between 65 % (<b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate</b> from plasma) and 100 % (AZT from plasma) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2 ', 3 '-dideoxyinosine (ddI), and the (-) enantiomer of 2 ', 3 '-dideoxy- 3 '-thiacytidine (3 TC) on reverse transcription in CD 4 -positive cells by isolating truncated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA fragments. Jurkat cells were treated with AZT (2 microM), ddI (200 microM), or 3 TC (50 microM) prior to infection with HIV. Low-molecular-weight DNA was isolated and amplified by PCR with primer pairs which identify different segments of HIV proviral DNA. We found that the HIV DNA fragments generated from drug-treated, HIV-exposed Jurkat cells were truncated {{at a ratio of}} 15 : 1 [i. e., (-) strong-stop DNA to HIV DNA generated after the first template switch]. Full-length DNA was observed in the case of untreated, HIV-infected cultures. Following nucleoside analog treatment of HIV-exposed Jurkat cells, reverse transcription was terminated only after the synthesis of (-) strong-stop DNA. The nucleoside analogs tested, i. e., AZT, ddI, and 3 TC, preferentially chain terminated viral DNA synthesis immediately following the first template switch. The (-) strong-stop HIV DNA was present in AZT-treated and untreated cultures for at least 6 days. We also carried out cell-free reverse transcription/template-switching reactions involving tRNA(Lys 3) or a deoxyoligonucleotide as a primer, as a means of studying the selective incorporation of <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate</b> into proviral DNA. When reactions were primed with tRNA(Lys 3), we found that <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate</b> was preferentially incorporated after template switching...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV- 1) develops resistance to 3 '-azido- 2 ', 3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine) by acquiring mutations in reverse transcriptase that enhance the ATP-mediated excision of AZT monophosphate from the 3 ' {{end of the}} primer. The excision reaction occurs at the dNTP-binding site, uses ATP as a pyrophosphate donor, unblocks the primer terminus and allows reverse transcriptase to continue viral DNA synthesis. The excision product is AZT adenosine dinucleoside tetraphosphate (AZTppppA). We determined five crystal structures: wild-type reverse transcriptase-double-stranded DNA (RT-dsDNA) -AZTppppA; AZT-resistant (AZTr; M 41 L D 67 N K 70 R T 215 Y K 219 Q) RT-dsDNA-AZTppppA; AZTr RT-dsDNA terminated with AZT at dNTP- and primer-binding sites; and AZTr apo reverse transcriptase. The AMP part of AZTppppA bound differently to wild-type and AZTr reverse transcriptases, whereas the <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate</b> part bound the two enzymes similarly. Thus, the resistance mutations create a high-affinity ATP-binding site. The structure of the site provides an opportunity to design inhibitors of AZT-monophosphate excision. status: publishe...|$|E
25|$|At {{very high}} doses, <b>AZT's</b> <b>triphosphate</b> form may also inhibit DNA {{polymerase}} used by human cells to undergo cell division, {{but regardless of}} dosage AZT has an approximately 100-fold greater affinity for HIV's reverse transcriptase. The selectivity has been proven {{to be due to}} the cell's ability to quickly repair its own DNA chain if it is broken by AZT during its formation, whereas the HIV virus lacks that ability. Thus AZT inhibits HIV replication without affecting the function of uninfected cells. At sufficiently high dosages, AZT begins to inhibit the cellular DNA polymerase used by mitochondria to replicate, accounting for its potentially toxic but reversible effects on cardiac and skeletal muscles, causing myositis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{test whether}} a {{thymidine}} analog zidovudine (=AZT), {{is able to}} modify the radiosensitizing effects of (E) - 2 '-Deoxy-(fluoromethylene) cytidine (FMdC). A human colon cancer cell line Widr was exposed for 48 hours prior to irradiation to FMdC. Zidovudine was added at various concentrations immediately before irradiation. We measured cell survival {{and the effect of}} FMdC, AZT and FMdC + <b>AZT</b> on deoxynucleotide <b>triphosphate</b> pool. FMdC results in a significant increase of radiosensitivity. The enhancement ratios (ER =surviving fraction irradiated cells/surviving fraction drug treated and irradiated cells), obtained by FMdC or AZT alone are significantly increased by the combination of both compounds. Adding FMdC to AZT yields enhancement ratios ranging from 1. 25 to 2. 26. FMdC reduces dATP significantly, with a corresponding increase of TTP, dCTP and dGTP. This increase of TTP, dCTP and dGTP is abolished with the addition of AZT. Adding AZT to FMdC results in a significant increase of the radiosensitizing effect of FMdC. This combination appears to reduce the reactive enhancement of TTP, dCTP and dGTP induced by FMdC while it does not affect the inhibitory effect on dATP. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAzidothymidine (AZT) and AZT monophosphate (AZT-MP) in {{concentrations}} {{as low as}} 10 and 50 μM, respectively, promote oxidation of chemically deacetylated 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCDHF) to 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by rat peritoneal macrophages activated with latex. Cells were incubated with AZT and AZT-MP for 18 h, {{washed out}} from residual AZT or AZT-MP and activated with latex for 30 or 60 min {{in the presence of}} DCDHF. Latex-activated cells oxidize DCDHF extracellularly due to release of hydrogen peroxide and low-molecular iron complexes, which is verified using catalase, desferal and the peroxidase inhibitor sodium azide. AZT and AZT-MP increase DCDHF oxidation due to additional release of hydrogen peroxide as demonstrated by catalase inhibition of DCDHF oxidation and direct H 2 O 2 measurement. Thymidine and thymidine phosphates did not show any effect on macrophage activation. In separate experiments we evaluated the in vitro prooxidant activity of AZT, AZT-MP, <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (AZT-TP), AZT glucuronide (GAZT) and 3 ′-amino- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (AMT) in a cell-free system using the hydrogen peroxide-iron-mediated oxidation of DCDHF. Under these conditions, AZT and AZT phosphates exhibit a prooxidant effect in concentrations as low as 100 μM. Furthermore, GAZT is a less effective prooxidant and AMT acts like an antioxidant.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) {{resistance to the}} nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors emerges very rapidly under selection in culture and in patients. In contrast, zidovudine (3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine [AZT]) -resistant HIV generally emerges in patients only after more-prolonged therapy. Although HIV can be cultured from many patients shortly after the initiation of AZT treatment, characterization of the virus that is cultured generally indicates that it is sensitive to AZT. To initiate {{an evaluation of the}} mechanisms contributing to early HIV breakthrough in the presence of AZT and other nucleoside analogs, we have utilized replication-defective HIV encoding reporter genes. These recombinant HIV allow a quantitative analysis of a single cycle of infection. Results with these defective HIV indicate that early infection in the presence of AZT often results from the infection of a cell which is refractory to the antiretroviral effects of AZT. Characterization of a cell line derived from one such cell has demonstrated decreased accumulation of <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> increased phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine triphosphate, and increased levels of thymidine kinase activity. In addition, AZT inhibition of replication-competent HIV infection is also significantly impaired in this cell line. Attempts to detect and characterize the mechanisms responsible for early viral infection after initiation of AZT therapy may result in the development of new strategies for prolonged suppression of viral infection prior to the emergence of drug-resistant virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{ribonucleoprotein}} telomerase, {{a specialized}} cellular reverse transcriptase, synthesizes one strand of the telomeric DNA of eukaryotes. We analyzed telomere maintenance in two immortalized human cell lines: the B-cell line JY 616 and the T-cell line Jurkat E 6 - 1, and determined whether known inhibitors of retroviral reverse transcriptases could perturb telomere lengths and {{growth rates of}} these cells in culture. Dideoxyguanosine (ddG) caused reproducible, progressive telomere shortening over several weeks of passaging, after which the telomeres stabilized and remained short. However, the prolonged passaging in ddG caused no observable effects on cell population doubling rates or morphology. Azidothymidine (AZT) caused progressive telomere shortening in some but not all T- and B-cell cultures. Telomerase activity was present in both cell lines and was inhibited in vitro by ddGTP and <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate.</b> Prolonged passaging in arabinofuranyl-guanosine, dideoxyinosine (ddI), dideoxyadenosine (ddA), didehydrothymidine (d 4 T), or phosphonoformic acid (foscarnet) did not cause reproducible telomere shortening or decreased cell growth rates or viabilities. Combining AZT, foscarnet, and/or arabinofuranyl-guanosine with ddG did not significantly augment the effects of ddG alone. Strikingly, with or without inhibitors, telomere lengths were often highly unstable in both cell lines and varied between parallel cell cultures. We propose that telomere lengths in these T- and B-cell lines are determined by both telomerase and telomerase-independent mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{intracellular}} metabolism of nucleoside {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTI) in mononuclear cells has been thoroughly studied, {{but that in}} red blood cells (RBC) has been disregarded. However, the phosphorylation of other analogous nucleosides (in particular, ribavirin) has been described previously. In this study, we investigated {{for the first time}} the phosphorylation of NRTI in human RBC. The presence of intracellular zidovudine (AZT) monophosphate, <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> lamivudine (3 TC) triphosphate, and tenofovir (TFV) diphosphate, as well as endogenous dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, in RBC collected from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients was examined. We observed evidence of a selective phosphorylation of 3 TC, TFV, and endogenous purine deoxynucleosides to generate their triphosphate moieties. Conversely, no trace of AZT phosphate metabolites was found, and only faint dTTP signals were visible. A comparison of intracellular TFV diphosphate and 3 TC triphosphate levels in RBC and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) further highlighted the specificity of NRTI metabolism in each cell type. These findings raise the issue of RBC involvement in drug-drug interaction, drug pharmacokinetics, and drug-induced toxicity. Moreover, the typical preparation of PBMC samples by gradient density centrifugation does not prevent their contamination with RBC. We demonstrated that the presence of RBC within PBMC hampers an accurate determination of intracellular TFV diphosphate and dATP levels in clinical PBMC samples. Thus, we recommend removing RBC during PBMC preparation by using an ammonium chloride solution to enhance both the accuracy and the precision of intracellular drug monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Zidovudine (AZT; 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxy{{thymidine}}), a thymidine analog, {{has been}} a staple of highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is phosphorylated in the host to the triphosphate and functions by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase. However, long-term use of AZT is linked to various tissue toxicities, including cardiomyopathy. These toxicities are associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion, which is hypothesized {{to be caused by}} <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate</b> inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. In previous work with isolated heart mitochondria, we demonstrated that AZT phosphorylation beyond the monophosphate was not detected and that AZT itself was a potent inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylation. This suggests an alternative hypothesis in which depletion of the TTP pool may limit mitochondrial DNA replication. The present work extends these studies to the whole cell by investigating the metabolism of thymidine and AZT in the intact isolated perfused rat heart. [3 H]thymidine is converted to [3 H]TTP in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The level of [3 H]TMP is low, suggesting that the reaction catalyzed by thymidine kinase is the rate-limiting step in phosphorylation. [3 H]AZT is converted in a time- and concentration-dependent manner to AZT monophosphate, the only phosphorylated product detected after 3 h of perfusion. Both compounds display negative cooperativity, similar to the observations with cloned and purified mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2. The presence of AZT in the perfusate inhibits the phosphorylation of [3 H]thymidine with a 50 % inhibitory concentration of 24 ± 4 μM. These data support the hypothesis that AZT-induced mitochondrial cardiotoxicity may be caused by a limiting pool of TTP that lowers mitochondrial DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} the phosphorylation rate of 3 '-azidothymidine (AZT) in isolated maternal and fetal {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) {{with that in}} amniocytes obtained during gestation and at term. Maternal PBMCs were isolated from venous blood samples obtained from HIV-seronegative pregnant women during delivery. Immediately after delivery, cord blood specimens were collected, and fetal PBMCs were isolated. In a separate set of experiments, maternal and fetal PBMCs and amniocytes were obtained at 17 - 21 weeks of gestation. The fresh isolated PBMCs and amniocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium until incubation with 10 microM tritiated AZT (10 microCi/mL). Thereafter, methanolic cell extracts were prepared for determination of AZT phosphates by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fetal PBMCs can efficiently convert AZT to its antivirally active metabolite. There were no significant differences after 6 or 12 hours of incubation with AZT between AZT phosphate levels in maternal and fetal PBMCs isolated at term or at 17 - 21 weeks of gestation: AZT monophosphate was found to be the major metabolite (about 95 %). AZT phosphate levels in the amniocytes were up to sevenfold higher than those in the maternal or fetal PBMCs. These results show that during pregnancy and at term, fetal PBMCs-like maternal PBMCs-are able to take up AZT and to efficiently generate the active metabolite <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate.</b> These results are of major significance both in enabling efficient treatment of the fetuses of HIV-infected women and in the prediction and understanding of the efficacy and toxicity of AZT in pregnant women and their fetuses. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Examination of the {{anti-human}} {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) data of some normal and isomeric dideoxynucleosides (ddNs and isoddNs), their three-dimensional (3 -D) electron density patterns, their electrostatic potential surfaces (EPS), and their conformational maps reveals some interesting correlations. For example, the EPS of (S,S) -isoddA shows regions {{of high and}} low electrostatic potential remarkably similar to those of β-d- 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (β-d-AZT), (−) -oxetanocin A, and (−) -carbovir. Such correlations involving EPS data and anti-HIV activity were also found with many other active nucleosides. Conversely, inactive compounds had EPS different from those of compounds in the same series that were active. For example, apio-ddNs, which are inactive against HIV, exhibit clear differences in electrostatic potential and 3 -D electron density shape from isoddNs that are active against HIV. Additionally, the inactivity of (S,S) -isoddC and (S,S) -isoddT can be correlated convincingly with a combination of their EPS data and their conformational energy maps. The electrostatic potential distributions of active nucleoside triphosphates show remarkable correlations. For example, (S,S) -isoddATP, <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (AZTTP), and oxetanocin A TP have similar 3 -D electron density surface patterns and similar high and low regions of electrostatic potential, which may suggest that these compounds proceed through related mechanisms in their interactions with, and inhibition of, HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). Docking of AZTTP, (S,S) -isoddATP, and other active triphosphates into the active site of HIV RT and calculation of the EPS of both the nucleotide and the active site show that there is excellent matching between inhibitor and enzyme binding site EPS data.

40|$|Individual {{variation}} {{in response to}} antiretroviral therapy is well-known, {{but it is not}} clear if demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and ethnicity are responsible for the variation. To optimize anti-HIV therapy and guide antiretroviral drug discovery, determinants that cause variable responses to therapy need to be evaluated. We investigated the determinants of intracellular concentrations of nucleoside analogs using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 40 healthy donors. We observed individual differences in the concentrations of the intracellular nucleoside analogs; the mean concentrations of the triphosphate metabolite of ethynylstavudine (4 ′-Ed 4 T), zidovudine (AZT), and lamivudine (3 TC) were 0. 71 pmol/ 106 cells (minimum and maximum, 0. 10 and 3. 00 pmol/ 106 cells, respectively), 0. 88 pmol/ 106 cells (minimum and maximum, 0. 10 and 15. 18 pmol/ 106 cells, respectively), and 1. 70 pmol/ 106 cells (minimum and maximum, 0. 20 and 7. 73 pmol/ 106 cells, respectively). Gender and ethnicity had no effect on the concentration of 4 ′-Ed 4 T and 3 TC metabolites. There was a trend for moderation of the concentrations of AZT metabolites by gender (P = 0. 17 for gender·metabolite concentration). We observed variability in the activity and expression of cellular kinases. There was no statistically significant correlation between thymidine kinase 1 (TK- 1) activity or expression and thymidine analog metabolite concentrations. The correlation between the activity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and the 3 TC monophosphate metabolite concentration showed a trend toward significance (P = 0. 1). We observed an inverse correlation between the multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP 2) expression index and the concentrations of AZT monophosphate, <b>AZT</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> and total AZT metabolites. Our findings suggest that the observed {{variation in}} clinical response to nucleoside analogs may be due partly to the individual differences in the intracellular concentrations, which in turn may be affected by the cellular kinases involved in the phosphorylation pathway and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport proteins...|$|E
