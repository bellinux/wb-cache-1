This was due to no producer signing on to the project before hearing any material for the album. [...] "I don't think it was offensive," [...] Knowles admitted. [...] "I understand that these <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> want to take on credible passionate projects. So before I would work with them I would schedule a meeting and play them the record. And then they were more convinced and willing to get on board." [...] Cee-Lo Green and Mark Ronson were not consulted until late into the production of the album, both having been persuaded by Knowles at the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony: [...] "I had to party with Cee-Lo too to get him to work on the record [...] but once he did [...] he signed on immediately." ...|$|E
