Height adjustable suspension has been used to implement a wheel-change mode where the vehicle is raised on three wheels so that the remaining wheel is lifted off the ground without the aid of a jack.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{consider}} {{errors of}} the same 5% in the equipment itself, that is, an error of 5% {{in the setting of}} the range angle, or a similar 5% error in the levelling of the aircraft or bombsight. For simplicity, consider that 5% to be a 5 degree angle. Using simple trigonometry, 5 degrees at 20,000 feet is approximately 1,750 feet, an error that would place the bombs far outside their lethal radius. In tests, accuracies of 3 to 4 degrees were considered standard, and angles as high as 15 degrees were not uncommon. Given the seriousness of the problem, systems for <b>automatic</b> <b>levelling</b> of bombsights was a major area of study before World War II, especially in the US.|$|E

The microwave <b>automatic</b> <b>level</b> control amplifier provides a constant output power level of + 10 dBm ?? 1 dB for a large dynamic range of input power of - 20 dBm to + 20 dBm. The <b>automatic</b> <b>level</b> control amplifier, which uses an uncomplicated feedback circuit, has a leveling response time of approximately 60 nanoseconds. The <b>automatic</b> <b>level</b> control amplifier consists of three RF gain stages, a PIN diode attenuator, a detector, a voltage regulator, and an operational amplifier.

To make the device automatically adjust the spacecraft to be levelling, the controller for SALEHD was designed in this paper. Through geometry and mechanics analysis for SALEHD and the spacecraft, the mathematical model of the controller is established. And then, the link of adaptive control and the link of variable structure control were added into the controller to adapt the unknown parameter and eliminate the interference of support vehicle. The stability of the controller was analysed, through constructing Lyapunov energy function. It was proved that the controller system is asymptotically stable, and converged to origin that is equilibrium point. So the controller can be applied in SALEHD availably and safely...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{salt cavern}} worked by {{dissolution}} in north-eastern France (54), was instrumented in 2004 prior its collapse. The multi-parameter high resolution monitoring system {{consisted of a}} microseismic network, coupled to <b>automatic</b> <b>levelling</b> measurement system. This enabled the monitoring of the overburden response {{to changes in the}} cavern, on a daily basis, up until its collapse in February 2009. In particular, all the data highlights the major role of a competent layer, vertically above the cavern at a depth of 120 meters. The analysis of the microseismicity shows that from the spring of 2008, this layer alone provided the stability of the site, while no significant sign of instability was detected by the levelling measurements. Its general failure, nearly a year later, was followed a few hours afterwards by the formation of a crater with abrupt edges, nearly 150 m in diameter. If these preliminary results clearly highlight the exceptional character of this experiment and of the information drawn from it from an operational point of view, they also show the necessity to determine accurately the various failure mechanisms in play. In particular the microseismic 'burst' events mechanism, detected during the main peaks of the microseismic activity, must be identified, in order to understand and analyse the data in their entiret...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{issues related}} to the process of designing a 30 -feet container {{to be used as a}} mobile laboratory for collecting the environmental samples and identification of biological threats. Tactical and technical assumptions for the container, taking into account the requirements of the transport and movement of the army at long distances and in the difficult areas by means of transport characterized by increased traction properties, made the starting point. A possible way of relocation on the land roads using commonly available and military means of transport, possibilities of loading and unloading using the autonomic system and <b>automatic</b> <b>levelling</b> system are described. It describes the process of creating the MES model of the supporting structure and assumptions taken for that purpose. The basic assumption included invariability of shape, geometry and dimensions of a container compared to containers recognized in the world as the standard ones. Some results of numerical calculations carried out at two stages are presented. At the first stage, the issues on the own values were solved. Frequencies of own vibrations and associated forms of vibrations were identified. At the second stage, forced container vibrations were analysed. Resistance calculations were performed for the supporting structure of the container in the aspect of evaluation of the strain condition of the whole structure, as well as its components for assumed load variants. A variability of resistance calculations takes into account such cases as the influence of the under-container trailer riding on the uneven ground...|$|E

40|$|Walking robots {{have long}} been {{proposed}} as {{solutions to the problem}} of mobile machines operating in unstructured and natural environments because they can traverse relatively large obstacles and avoid dangerous or sensitive areas of the ground. Walking machines that can move in any direction and turn through any radius have an 'omnidirectional manoeuvring' capability. Hexapodal (six-legged) walking machines have advantages over bipedal and quadrupedal machines in the areas of stability, payload and simplicity, as well as the ability to operate with damaged or broken legs. Walking robots inspired by insect neurology and biology continue to extend the state of the art, but using this 'biologically inspired' approach to develop behaviours not exhibited by the animals requires further insight into the principles of walking. Part of this thesis develops a possible explanation for the distributed inter-leg influences that control walking in the stick insect: that legs swing forward to take their next step when the proximity of other legs or workspace boundaries restricts their movement. This new concept, called the 'restrictedness' algorithm, has similarities to distributed gait controllers in the literature but with enhanced capabilities and simpler implementation. The restrictedness algorithm is a significant contribution to the field of walking robotics and may also be of relevance to future biological studies. Omnidirectional walking requires the adaptation of leg movements to the locomotion direction and robustness to unusual leg lifting positions. A novel velocity field specified in a 'task coordinate system' for each leg is described, a scheme that allows simple realtime adaptation to different commanded body movement vectors and changing spatial relationships between the legs. Active compliance and <b>automatic</b> <b>levelling</b> improve the robot's interaction with the ground, especially over rough ground. Experiments with the robot Hamlet, designed and built primarily by the author, proved that the new restrictedness and velocity field swing algorithms display the important traits required from a walking robot gait controller. Specifically, the algorithm provided delivers the range of optimal forward walking gaits observed in insects while also supporting omnidirectional walking, including rotating while simultaneously translating. Optimization by simulating a model of the robot improved the controller's forward walking performance...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we bring the {{concepts}} of narrativism and ludology to <b>automatic</b> <b>level</b> generation for platform videogames.

In addition, we propose a set of abstraction layers to describe the content of a quest-based story in the particular context of videogames. Regarding <b>automatic</b> <b>level</b> generation for platform videogames, we observed that the existing approaches are directed to lower abstraction concepts such as avatar movements without a particular context or meaning. This leads us to the challenge of automatically creating more contextualized levels rather than only a set of consistent and playable entertaining tasks.
