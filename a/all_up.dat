While {{on the label}} Cook took his 1999 project, In The Middle of it <b>All,</b> <b>up</b> the charts garnering several #1 singles, a Dove Award nomination and became the number one selling Christian country artists of all time. He incorporated Cook Enterprises to administer his contracts and personal business affairs, which included a children's television show development agreement with his management group, Five Star Music which produced a weekly show called, Crabbottom USA, taped at local television station, WHTV TV-39, a Nashville Tennessee based station.|$|E
5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of the}} 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them <b>all</b> <b>up</b> to original strength).|$|E
5|$|The base {{tuition fee}} per unit in UPLB is ₱1,000 (US$23). As with <b>all</b> <b>UP</b> constituents, UPLB {{implements}} the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP). Under the program, students with annual family incomes between ₱1,000,000 (US$23,000) and ₱500,000 (US$11,500) are charged the base tuition fee, while those with annual family incomes above ₱1,000,000 are charged ₱1,500 (US$35) per unit. Students with annual family incomes between ₱500,000 and ₱135,000 (US$3,110) are charged ₱600 (US$14) per unit; {{those who have}} between ₱135,000 and ₱80,000 (US$1,840) are charged ₱300 (US$7); while those who have below ₱80,000 are not charged any fees. Additional financial assistance may be accessed through the Student Loan Board, which pays up to 80 percent of the tuition. Scholarship and loan programs are also offered by some UPLB units, such as the College of Veterinary Medicine.|$|E

Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater and all the facility employees, but is confined to the lab's lower levels.|$|E

40|$|The jukebox musical <b>All</b> Shook <b>Up</b> {{challenges}} current {{definitions of}} what constitutes an adaptation. Not only have most productions refrained from announcing the musical as an adaptation, {{but the question of}} what <b>All</b> Shook <b>Up</b> is an adaptation of is almost infinitely contestable, given the sheer number of potential combinations of source texts that any one audience member is capable of recognizing. This essay argues that <b>All</b> Shook <b>Up</b> engages with the unstable identities of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night by playing with its own status as an unannounced adaptation: by inviting audiences to recognize <b>All</b> Shook <b>Up’s</b> status as an adaptation—not only of Twelfth Night, but of multiple other works—as the work unfolds itself, the musical reveals the queer potential of adaptation, its potential to destabilize categories of identity. <b>All</b> Shook <b>Up,</b> ostensibly a light-hearted Elvis Presley vehicle, carries out quiet political work, harnessing this queer potential and expanding on Twelfth Night’s unstable identities in order to destabilize various forms of modern identity-markers, including gender, sexuality, race, class, region, and age. <b>All</b> Shook <b>Up</b> thus makes a claim for the adaptation as an art form in itself, with its own particular aesthetic and political strengths and values. 17 page(s...|$|R
25|$|He {{took part}} in the 1896 British Lions tour to South Africa and played in all 21 games. The squad was {{dominated}} by Irish players and Byrne was the only England international. He scored 127 points <b>all</b> <b>up</b> and became the first player to top 100 points in a tour of South Africa. This record wasn't broken until the All-Blacks visited South Africa in 1960, by Don Clarke, who was incidentally also a first-class cricketer.|$|E
25|$|Multinucleated sphere X (MSX) {{is caused}} by the {{protozoan}} Haplosporidium nelsoni, generally seen as a multinucleated Plasmodium. It is infectious and causes heavy mortality in the eastern oyster; survivors, however, develop resistance and can help propagate resistant populations. MSX is associated with high salinity and water temperatures. MSX was first noted in Delaware Bay in 1957, and is now found <b>all</b> <b>up</b> and down the East Coast of the United States. Evidence suggests it was brought to the US when Crassostrea gigas, a Japanese oyster variety, was introduced to Delaware Bay.|$|E

25|$|So, {{with the}} score at 75 for 6, England once again needed a big partnership, {{this time from}} Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones.
