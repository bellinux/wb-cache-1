5|$|As {{he waited}} for the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of Daily Show host Jon Stewart. He has implied a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> comedian, and suggests that his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E
5|$|He {{was made}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1943 by George VI in the Birthday Honours of that year, shortly after resigning his censor post. Approaching the {{conclusion}} of the Second World War, Eggleston made several public appearances in his native United Kingdom on behalf of the Ministry of Information, including at the White Rock Pavilion on 20 April 1945, where he expressed Canadian support for the British war effort, with particular <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Britain.|$|E

5|$|His next {{assignment}} was in Yekaterinburg in the Urals, {{where he was}} appointed second in command of a training school for non-commissioned officers attached to the Anglo-Russian Brigade. He found this post frustrating, having to dismiss {{nearly a third of}} his initial cadre on medical grounds, and struggling to get supplies and support from the White Army authorities. Despite this, he developed a rapport with his men and an <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Russian soldier.|$|E
5|$|Within the sonnet, {{the speaker}} contemplates his {{inability}} to articulate his <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Fair Youth, a fault he attributes to his jealousy of the Fair Youth's appearance in the poems of the speaker's Rival Poet. Sonnet 86 is notable within the Rival Poet subsection of sonnets because it allegedly provides important clues as to the historical identity of this Rival Poet. The sonnet is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, containing 14 lines of iambic pentameter and ending in a rhymed couplet.|$|E
5|$|Born in Caen, Normandy to {{an aristocratic}} family, Michel-Guillaume Hector St. John de Crèvecœur {{received}} a Jesuit {{education at the}} Jesuit Collège Royal de Bourbon. In 1754, having left school, Crèvecœur visited relatives in England where he became engaged; this visit would {{mark the beginning of}} a lifelong <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> culture and politics of the country. Shortly after this, possibly due to the death of his fiancée, he joined a French regiment in Canada engaged in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). After being wounded in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), Crèvecœur resigned his commission and began traveling widely across Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E

5|$|In August 1995, Ranariddh {{expressed}} <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{political and}} economic systems of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. As he saw it, these countries, characterised by hybrid regimes, active economic interventionism and limited press freedom, served as good models to propel Cambodia's socio-economic growth. Ranariddh espoused the view that economic development should take precedence over democratic and human rights. In the initial months of the administration, he actively courted political leaders from various regional countries, including Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, {{with a view to}} encouraging investment in Cambodia. In early 1994, Ranariddh established the Cambodian Development Council (CDC) to encourage foreign investment, and served as its chairperson. The Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, supported Ranariddh's plans, and encouraged Malaysian businessmen to invest and assist in developing the tourism, infrastructural development and telecommunications industries.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to have felt that his <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Starr {{was twice}} afflicted by {{life-threatening}} illnesses during childhood, {{and he fell}} behind in school {{as a result of}} prolonged hospitalisations. In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze, developing a fervent <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> genre. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.|$|E
2500|$|A {{survey of}} {{scholars}} in 1997 by Maclean's magazine ranked King first among all Canada's prime ministers, ahead of Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. As historian Jack Granatstein notes, [...] "the scholars expressed little <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> King <b>the</b> man but offered unbounded <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> his political skills {{and attention to}} Canadian unity." [...] On the other hand, political scientist Ian Stewart in 2007 found that even Liberal activists have but a dim memory of him.|$|R

5|$|The 1896 Olympic Games {{were the}} first held in the Modern era and the most {{important}} international multi-sport event Greece had ever hosted. The rules of the Games generally excluded women from competition. Influenced by both his times—in the Victorian era women were considered to be inferior to men—and his <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ancient Olympic Games, when only men were allowed to participate in the events, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the visionary of the modern Olympic Games, was not in favour of women's participation in the Olympic Games or in sports generally. He believed that a woman's greatest achievement would be to encourage her sons to be distinguished in sports and to applaud a man's effort.|$|E
5|$|Years later, due to Betances' {{experience}} as a logistics facilitator of armed revolts, a fund raiser for the Cuban independence cause, and as a diplomat, José Martí asked Betances to become the leader of Cuban revolutionaries in France. Betances never met Martí personally, but Martí did know Betances' younger sister, Eduviges, who lived in New York City and shared her brother's revolutionary ideals. Martí assisted her financially in her final days, out of <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Betances' family. Betances accepted the assignment out of gratitude towards Martí. Soon after, Martí died in battle in Cuba in 1895, an event that brought Tomás Estrada Palma to {{the leadership of the}} Cuban insurrection movement.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, he photographed sites {{associated}} with the prominent Marxists Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. He also photographed the signs erected by landowners and religious groups, believing that in doing so he was documenting the traces of capitalist society before they would be swept away by socialism. Both in Britain and {{on a visit to}} Germany he photographed pro-fascist and anti-fascist propaganda and graffiti. Like many leftists at the time, he believed that fascism was a temporary, extreme expression of capitalist society that would soon be overcome by socialism. He nevertheless expressed <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government, highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities; he refrained from commenting on the political agenda that the Nazis had in promoting archaeology.|$|E
50|$|This war {{was short}} and uneventful, and the prince then {{traveled}} in England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France, devoting himself impartially to the courts, the camps, the salons and the learned assemblies of philosophers and scientists in each country. He developed a great <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> Frederick <b>the</b> Great, {{even to the point}} of justifying his seizure of Silesia.|$|R
60|$|What Austen really felt, {{when he had}} {{grasped the}} {{significance}} of that fact, was relief--gratitude. A wave of renewed affection for his father swept over him, of affection and pity and <b>admiration,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> instant he forgot Mr. Flint.|$|R

5|$|Life {{under the}} Japanese changed rapidly {{as many of}} the {{traditional}} structures were replaced by a military power. Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages. The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society, but invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including tattooing. By the mid-1930s as Japan's empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines. By the end of World War II, aborigines whose fathers had been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to serve in Special Units and if need be die for the Emperor of Japan. The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on many older aborigines who maintained an <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Japanese long after their departure in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The first {{strand of}} the novel follows Hollis Henry, {{a former member of}} the early 1990s cult band The Curfew and a {{freelance}} journalist. She is hired by advertising mogul Hubertus Bigend to write a story for his nascent magazine Node (described as a European Wired) about the use of locative technology in the art world. Helped by curator Odile Richard she investigates Los Angeles artist Alberto Corrales, who recreates virtually the deaths of celebrities such as River Phoenix. Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' technical requirements. Chombo's background is troubleshooting navigation systems for the United States military. He is reclusive and paranoid, refusing to sleep in the same GPS grid square on consecutive nights, and only consents to talk to Hollis due to his <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Curfew.|$|E
5|$|When the University of Berlin awarded {{an honorary}} degree in 1934 to American legal scholar and Dean of Harvard Law School Roscoe Pound, who had toured Germany earlier {{that year and}} {{made no secret of}} his <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Nazi regime, Conant refused to order Pound not to accept it, and {{attended}} the informal award ceremony at Harvard where Pound was presented with the degree by Hans Luther, the German ambassador to the United States. While Conant declined to participate in the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars, Harvard awarded honorary degrees to two notable displaced scholars, Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein, in 1935. What Conant feared most was disruption to Harvard's tercentennial celebrations in 1936, but there was no trouble, despite the presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and a Harvard graduate of the class of 1904, whom many Harvard graduates regarded as a socialist and a class traitor. It was only with difficulty that Lowell was persuaded to be presiding officer at an event at which Roosevelt spoke.|$|E
5000|$|During {{her final}} tour of 1920, Bates took the {{southern}} states by storm. She was now known as [...] "our girl driver." [...] In Oklahoma, she defied the police and took her truck across a flooded road, hauling meat for a packaging plant. This courageous venture led to the sale of ten trucks for Four Wheel Drive and much <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> Bates. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> next two years, Bates traveled as a demonstrator, both locally and throughout the United States, demonstrating the Model B truck and the newly developed fire trucks.|$|R

50|$|Edward Mitchell Bannister (ca. 1828 - January 9, 1901) was a Black Canadian-American Tonalist painter. Like other Tonalists, {{his style}} and {{predominantly}} pastoral subject matter {{were drawn from}} his <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> Millet and <b>the</b> French Barbizon School.|$|R

25|$|Some Chinese see {{the flag}} as an {{expression}} of Chinese nationalism and pride combined with simultaneous disapproval for the current communist regime. Additionally, the flag may symbolize identification with, and <b>admiration</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> political thoughts of Sun Yat-sen, and his Three Principles of the People.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, Englishman John Ruskin {{published}} the Bible of Amiens, which {{was translated into}} French, extensively annotated and prefaced, in 1904, by Marcel Proust.
