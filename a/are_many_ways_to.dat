25|$|A {{variety of}} minor {{enhancements}} to this basic scheme are possible, and there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> save unnecessary computation. A cell {{that did not}} change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating the inactive zones.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{discriminate}} against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone {{known to have}} a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{install a}} Linux distribution. The most common method of {{installing}} Linux is by booting from an optical disc {{that contains the}} installation program and installable software. Such a disk can be burned from a downloaded ISO image, purchased alone for a low price, provided as a cover disk with a magazine, shipped for free by request, or obtained {{as part of a}} box set that may also include manuals and additional commercial software.|$|E

25|$|The field H {{is defined}} as the long {{wavelength}} Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> take the long wavelength average, depending on the details of how high wavelengths are cut off. The details are not too important, since the goal is to find the statistics of H and not the spins. Once the correlations in H are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in H.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} orders out of given orders. The dual {{order is}} one example. Another important construction is the cartesian product of two partially ordered sets, taken {{together with the}} product order on pairs of elements. The ordering is defined by (a, x) ≤ (b, y) if (and only if) a ≤ b and x ≤ y. (Notice carefully {{that there are three}} distinct meanings for the relation symbol ≤ in this definition.) The disjoint union of two posets is another typical example of order construction, where the order is just the (disjoint) union of the original orders.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> create techno, but the {{majority}} will depend upon the use of loop-based step sequencing as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or producers, rather than employing traditional compositional techniques, may work in an improvisatory fashion, often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units {{that are capable of}} producing many different sounds and effects. Studio production equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware- or computer-based MIDI sequencer, enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to overdub successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable multi-track arrangement has been produced.|$|E

25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform {{to the best of their}} ability to achieve success. There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E
25|$|Information {{security}} threats come {{in many different}} forms. Some {{of the most common}} threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today {{due to the fact that}} most devices today are mobile. Cell phones are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization′s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company′s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware. There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is user carefulness.|$|E

500|$|The {{appeal of}} dinosaurs, as {{suggested}} by author, researcher, and dinosaur enthusiast Donald F. Glut, has multiple factors. Dinosaurs were [...] "monsters," [...] yet are safely extinct, allowing for vicarious thrills. They appeal to the imagination, and there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> approach them intellectually. Finally, they appeal to adults nostalgic for what they enjoyed as children. Children have been particularly drawn to dinosaurs over the years.|$|E
500|$|There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> collect Liberty Head double eagles. [...] Some, wishing {{only a few}} pieces, {{may choose}} one {{each of the three}} major types, or seek pieces from the five mints that struck them. Carson City double eagles are highly popular. [...] As the 1870-CC is almost unobtainable, {{collectors}} may limit themselves to Carson City Type III pieces (1877–1893). [...] Collectors seeking one double eagle per year of mintage will find it expensive to fill the 1886 entry, a year in which double eagles were only struck at Philadelphia, and just 1,000 business strikes and 106 proof pieces were issued. The 2015 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1886 in Very Fine condition (VF-20) at $22,500.|$|E

[...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story."
