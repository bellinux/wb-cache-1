40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{dramatic}} developments in the technology of intense pulsed light sources in the THz frequency range. Since many dipole-active excitations in solids and molecules also lie in this range, {{there is now a}} tremendous potential to use these light sources to study linear and nonlinear <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> such systems. While several experimental investigations of THz-driven <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> solid-state systems have demonstrated a variety of interesting linear and nonlinear phenomena, comparatively few efforts have been made <b>to</b> drive <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> molecular systems. In the present Perspective article, we discuss the similarities and differences between THz-driven <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> solid-state and molecular systems on both conceptual and practical levels. We also discuss the experimental parameters needed for these types of experiments and thereby provide design criteria for a further development of this new research branch. Finally, we present a few recent examples to illustrate the rich physics that may be learned from nonlinear THz excitations of phonons in solids as well as inter-molecular vibrations in liquid and gas-phase systems...|$|R
40|$|Modelling {{the process}} of {{recombination}} leads to a large coupled nonlinear dynamical system. Here, we consider a particular case of recombination in discrete time, allowing only for single crossovers. While the <b>analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>in</b> continuous time admits a closed solution, this no longer works for discrete time. A more general model (i. e. without the restriction to single crossovers) has been studied before and was solved algorithmically by means of Haldane linearisation. Using the special formalism introduced by Baake and Baake (2003), we obtain further insight into the single-crossover dynamics and the particular difficulties that arise in discrete time. We then transform the equations to a solvable system in a two-step procedure: linearisation followed by diagonalisation. Still, the coefficients of the second step must be determined in a recursive manner, but once this is done for a given system, they allow for an explicit solution valid for all times. Comment: J.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is concerned with}} mathematical models for {{the dynamics of the}} genetic composition of populations evolving under recombination. Recombination is the genetic mechanism by which two parent individuals create the mixed type of their offspring during sexual reproduction. The corresponding models are large, nonlinear dynamical systems (for the deterministic treatment that applies in the infinite-population limit), or interacting particle systems (for the stochastic treatment required for finite populations). We review recent progress on these difficult problems. In particular, we present a closed solution of the deterministic continuous-time system, for the important special case of single crossovers; we extract an underlying linearity; we analyse how this carries over to the corresponding stochastic setting; and we provide a solution of the <b>analogous</b> deterministic discrete-time <b>dynamics,</b> <b>in</b> terms of its generalised eigenvalues and a simple recursion for the corresponding coefficients.

40|$|Human {{activity}} {{has resulted in}} the emergence of fire-induced forest-shrubland mosaics in many southern temperate forest landscapes. In New Zealand (NZ), this transformation was caused by the introduction of fire to previously very low fire-frequency ecosystems. High levels of seed and seedling predation by exotic mammals and the reduction of avian pollination and seed dispersal further influence vegetation change and can cause successions to become completely arrested. <b>Analogous</b> <b>dynamics</b> occur <b>in</b> many other Southern Hemisphere forest landscapes where changes in fire regimes and the introduction of mammalian herbivores and predators have resulted in forest-shrubland mosaics. We developed a spatially explicit state-and-transition model to disentangle the effects of altered fire regimes; invasive pyrophyllic shrub species; seed and seedling predation by exotic mammals; and lowered rates of long-distance seed movement on long-term landscape dynamics and state transitions. Our modelling highlights a threshold in fire frequency where forest systems move to a fire-induced early-successional shrubland state. Because early-successional vegetation in NZ and many other southern temperate forests is much more flammable than mature late-successional vegetation, this shrubland state will persist until fire is suppressed. Our modelling suggests also that in the absence of fire there are critical thresholds in seed predation beyond which succession may become completely arrested in a mid-successional state. Even moderate levels of predation slow regeneration and move the tipping point at which forests shift <b>to</b> early-successional shrublands <b>in</b> the direction of less frequent fire. The presence of invasive pyrophyllic shrubs in the landscape also influences the location of thresholds in fire frequency at which state shifts occur. Restoring these landscapes to their formerly forested condition will require the removal of fire as well as mammalian seed/ling predators and the reinstatement of pollination and dispersal services. Removal of seed predators may act as an effective component of fire control by allowing secondary successions to proceed more quickly, thereby reducing landscape-level flammability...|$|R
