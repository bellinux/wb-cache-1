5|$|In 1195 Walter issued <b>an</b> <b>ordinance</b> {{by which}} four knights were {{appointed}} in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians of the peace, a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice of the Peace.

In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.|$|E
