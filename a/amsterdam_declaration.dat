5000|$|The {{rejection}} of the feminist ideologies sometimes {{is due to the}} often misinterpreted ideologies of feminisms. Views from more radical feminists and stereotyped views of feminism, most antifeminists view those who hold feminist ideologies are those who are against men and may group all men into the category of rapists, monsters, and enemies. This view has become so prolific that many women and men now refuse to identify as such due to the negative stigma attached to the word, even if they are feminists or believe in equality across all groups of minorities. Nowadays, 21st century antifeminists can be seen focusing on the {{rejection of}} all feminist ideologies, with some subscribing to the ideology of humanism rather than feminism. According to the 2002 <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Declaration</b> of the World Humanist Congress, humanism, [...] "affirms the worth, dignity, and autonomy of the individual" [...] against religious and political dogmas. However, humanism's foundations were first created in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, A cultural and intellectual movement of the Renaissance that emphasized human potential to attain excellence and promoted direct study of the literature, art, and civilization of classical Greece and Rome. Judith Butler explains that humanism [...] "supposes that there is one single idea of {{what it is to be}} human". Therefore, humanism turns away from difference and diversity and does not create opportunities for all social groups to be considered equal.|$|E

This paper summarizes a wider research and analyses the consecration of the cultural heritage to the invaluable notion of world heritage.

40|$|AIMS: The aims of {{this study}} were to examine trends over time and {{geographical}} variation in the annual incidence of surgical orbital decompression for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) in England. METHODS: Data on hospital admissions for orbital decompression surgery in patients with thyroid disease were analysed using English national Hospital Episode Statistics for admissions from 1991 - 2011. RESULTS: Annual rates of orbital decompression surgery performed for patients with thyroid disease increased from 0. 06 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 04 [...] 0. 09) per 100, 000 population in 1991, to 0. 62 (0. 54 [...] 0. 67) in 2008, and then fell to 0. 56 (0. 48 [...] 0. 60) in 2011. The surgical rate was highest in women aged 45 [...] 64 years. Geographical analysis showed significant variation across strategic health authority areas in surgical rates, from 0. 22 (0. 14 - 0. 35) to 1. 04 (0. 79 - 1. 34) people per 100, 000 population per year in 2007 - 2011. CONCLUSION: The incidence of orbital decompression surgery performed annually in England has increased substantially over the past two decades, but peaked in 2008 and decreased since then. Significant geographical variation exists in surgical rates. Potential reasons for the decline include improved management of thyroid disease itself, but altered threshold in medical versus surgical management of TAO may also have played a role. The <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Declaration</b> and EUGOGO treatment guidelines may also have influenced decisions about whether to operate on these patients...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Declaration</b> on Fungal Nomenclature {{was agreed}} at an {{international}} symposium convened in Amsterdam on 19 – 20 April 2011 {{under the auspices of}} the International Commission on the Taxonomy of Fungi (ICTF). The purpose of the symposium was to address the issue of whether or how the current system of naming pleomorphic fungi should be maintained or changed now that molecular data are routinely available. The issue is urgent as mycologists currently follow different practices, and no consensus was achieved by a Special Committee appointed in 2005 by the International Botanical Congress to advise on the problem. The Declaration recognizes the need for an orderly transition to a single-name nomenclatural system for all fungi, and to provide mechanisms to protect names that otherwise then become endangered. That is, meaning that priority should be given to the first described name, except where there is a younger name in general use when the first author to select a name of a pleomorphic monophyletic genus is to be followed, and suggests controversial cases are referred to a body, such as the ICTF, which will report to the Committee for Fungi. If appropriate, the ICTF could be mandated to promote the implementation of the Declaration.

40|$|Considering {{himself as}} the “main author” of the charter, Raymond M. Lemaire {{has been one of}} the first, {{together}} with Piero Gazzola, to plead for a revision of the document. As early as 1971, the two men, respectively first Secretary General and President of ICOMOS, tended to launch a debate in favour of a better consideration of the social value of heritage, and the development of specific principles for historical cities conservation, to be included in the Venice charter. Lemaire’s recent experience in that field had indeed convinced him that, contrary to the assertion of article 14, “a literal application of principles valid for monuments, considered as such, is not always possible, nor desirable, for the ensembles”. The adoption of the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>declaration</b> didn’t put an end to his efforts. Despite his unsuccessful attempt to get a revised version approved by the ICOMOS General assembly in Moscow (1978), R. M. Lemaire always remained critical towards the charter and the application of its principles in the field, underlining, in the eighties, its shortcomings in terms of cultural diversity and, in one of his last texts, in 1996, the negative effect of article 9, leading to the idea that “the mere essence of a conservation operation is a modernist intervention on the edifice or neighbourhood”. Beyond its interest for conservation history, the awareness of Lemaire’s early critical position towards the Venice Charter should inspire the current debates and help us overcome our reluctance to challenge the sacred principles of what we consider a doctrinal monument.
