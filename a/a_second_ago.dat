40|$|Let {{me start}} this book review with a prediction. As your eyes ran over {{the title of}} this page just <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>a</b> flurry of {{thoughts}} and images raced through your mind: hunger, illness, HIV/AIDS, Boko Haram, migrants, elephants, gazelles, and lions, slavery, Joseph Conrad’s novel about the horrors of the Belgian Congo, Heart of Darkness. These images, I argue, are about as representative of Africa as the moustache and the baguette are of France. While clichés might hold an element of truth, they surely reflect a profound unfamiliarity with France if one thinks only of these caricatures. The state of our ignorance about Africa—a continent of some 30 million square kilometers that houses well over a billion people—is immeasurably worse. N/...|$|R

If the plans for a chronoscope, particularly Foster's new and improved version, ever reached the general public, the resulting plague of voyeurism would effectively eliminate the concept of privacy. Even the government workers now assigned to the chronoscope, Araman says, sometimes transgress regulations and use it to spy for personal purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year, on February 56, in Viña del Mar, Chile, was {{the thirteenth}} {{edition of the}} South American Swimming Championships. At the previous twelve, Brazil defeated Argentina only once, in the same Viña del Mar, in 1941. Manoel dos Santos ranked fifth in {{the final of the}} 100-metre freestyle, and Haroldo Lara took the fourth position. In the 200-metre backstroke, Manoel was fourth and the race was won by his compatriot João Gonçalves. In the 4x100-metre freestyle relay, the competition had a spectacular end. Peru team was the gold medalist, with a time of 3:59.7, a championship record. A tenth of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>ago,</b> silver medalist, arrived Brazil. The Argentines came in third, nine-tenths of a second behind Brazil. The Brazilian relay team had Haroldo Lara, Manuel dos Santos, João Gonçalves and Aristarco de Oliveira. In partial takes, Manoel was the fastest of the four. He stated that, at that moment, he realized that his specialty and future were the 100-metre freestyle, and the backstroke was just a byproduct. This flare, this awareness of where his true talent lay resulted in a short time, a leap of improvement. As for the South American, as expected, porteños took the title again.|$|E
5000|$|From a wide stall {{position}} {{with only two}} horses on his outside, The Tatling started relaxed and was placed by Richard Kingscote {{in the rear of}} the pack where he sat for the first part of the race. At the turn he began making progress but could not obtain a clear passage in the home straight and had to be maneuvered between horses going from the inner right through the pack back on their outside. At the same time, he was producing a strong run that eventually got him near the leaders and with his final strides managed to win in a three-way photo-finish from Novabridge and Grand Stitch. His owner Darren Hudson-Wood, who had acquired the horse in the summer, said [...] "I nearly cried <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>ago.</b> I didn't expect him to be in the first five, to be honest. That was incredible". Bradley was interviewed after the race and said [...] "I know it was only a small race, but what a wonderful story. The horse is still a star in our eyes. He's one of those you drop on by mistake and spend the rest of your life looking for another one half as good. So many people in the country must know about him - it's unbelievable. He wasn't the easiest to train and it took us a while to get to know him. We learnt how he liked to come through horses and use that turn of foot in the last furlong - that's how he won the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot... He's been a marvellous servant for everyone involved with him... We're going to have to be very cautious now how we treat him as he won't want to be left without going out and seeing life." ...|$|E

Do you think I need help? (Laughter.)What do I think about it? Well, there isnt anyone alive who wouldnt prefer unanimity. I mean, you just always would like everyone to stand up and say, Way to go! Thats the right thing to do, United States.Now, we rarely find unanimity in the world. I was ambassador to NATO, and I -- when we would go in and make a proposal, there wouldnt be unanimity. There wouldnt even be understanding. And wed have to be persuasive. Wed have to show reasons. Wed have to -- have to give rationales. Wed have to show facts. And, by golly, I found that Europe on any major issue is given -- if theres leadership and if youre right, and if your facts are persuasive, Europe responds. And they always have.Now, youre thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I dont. I think thats old Europe. If you look at the entire NATO Europe today, the center of gravity is shifting to the east. And there are a lot of new members. And if you just take the list of all the members of NATO and all of those who have been invited in recently -- what is it? Twenty-six, something like that? -- youre right. Germany has been a problem, and France has been a problem.Q: But opinion polls --Rumsfeld: But -- just a minute. Just a minute.

40|$|SummaryPiwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons {{in animal}} germ cells. piRNAs {{are thought to}} derive from long {{transcripts}} spanning transposon-rich genomic loci and to direct an autoamplification loop in which an antisense piRNA, bound to Aubergine or Piwi protein, triggers production of a sense piRNA bound to the PIWI protein Argonaute 3 (Ago 3). In turn, the new piRNA is envisioned to produce a second antisense piRNA. Here, we describe strong loss-of-function mutations in ago 3, allowing a direct genetic test of this model. We find that Ago 3 acts to amplify piRNA pools and to enforce on them an antisense bias, {{increasing the number of}} piRNAs that can act to silence transposons. We also detect <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>Ago</b> 3 -independent piRNA pathway centered on Piwi. Transposons targeted by this second pathway often reside in the flamenco locus, which is expressed in somatic ovarian follicle cells, suggesting a role for piRNAs beyond the germline...|$|E
40|$|In the Drosophila germ line, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) ensure genomic {{stability}} by silencing endogenous selfish genetic {{elements such}} as retrotransposons and repetitive sequences. We examined the genetic requirements for the biogenesis and function of piRNAs in both female and male germ line. We found that piRNAs function through the PIWI, rather than the AGO, family Argonaute proteins, {{and the production of}} piRNAs requires neither microRNA (miRNA) nor small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway machinery. These findings allowed the discovery of the third conserved small RNA silencing pathway, which is distinct from both the miRNA and RNAi pathways in its mechanisms of biogenesis and function. We also found piRNAs in flies are modified. We determined that the chemical structure of the 3 ´-terminal modification is a 2 ´-O-methyl group, and also demonstrated that the same modification occurs on the 3 ´ termini of siRNAs in flies. Furthermore, we identified the RNA methyltransferase Drosophila Hen 1, which catalyzes 2 ´-O-methylation on both siRNAs and piRNAs. Our data suggest that 2 ´-O-methylation by Hen 1 is the final step of biogenesis of both the siRNA pathway and piRNA pathway. Studies from the Hannon Lab and the Siomi Lab suggest a ping-pong amplification loop for piRNA biogenesis and function in the Drosophila germline. In this model, an antisense piRNA, bound to Aubergine or Piwi, triggers production of a sense piRNA bound to the PIWI protein Argonaute 3 (Ago 3). In turn, the new piRNA is envisioned to produce a second antisense piRNA. We isolated the loss-of-function mutations in ago 3, allowing a direct genetic test of this model. We found that Ago 3 acts to amplify piRNA pools and to enforce on them an antisense bias, increasing the number of piRNAs that can act to silence transposons. Moreover, we also discovered <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>Ago</b> 3 -independent piRNA pathway in somatic ovarian follicle cells, suggesting a role for piRNAs beyond the germ line...|$|E

40|$|The {{taste of}} this {{particular}} chunk of fresh pineapple, the one which I am just now eating, is scrumptious. That taste is something the chunk has in common with other such chunks, like the one I had <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>ago</b> and the one I will have in <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> time. The taste of this pineapple chunk is thus a feature, a property, which this and various other chunks of pineapple share. Now, intuitively at least, no purely mathematical entity, like a function, is scrumptious. Hence a property, like the taste of this chunk of pineapple, cannot be any such function. This kind of argument, if sound, would cut a wide swathe through the field of metaphysics. All those theories which attempt to reduce ontologically suspicious types of entities (properties, propositions, persons, medium-sized dry goods) to mathematical entities (like classes or functions) would fall to the blade. This could well help to reduce the impact of contemporary philosophy on the world’s dwindling forests. I save contemporary metaphysics by explaining where the argument goes wrong...|$|R
