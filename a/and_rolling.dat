5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control and signalling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary, such as at interchanges, viaducts, bridges, tunnels and zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur. The system uses variable traffic signs to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users. The A2 motorway mainly runs through the plains <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> hills of Hrvatsko Zagorje region, although the northernmost sections of the route traverse rugged terrain, requiring a number of viaducts and long tunnels along the route.|$|E

5|$|Assuming less load <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates {{a maximum}} pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} needed a {{slightly}} smaller towing crew.

However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable.|$|E
5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Kong {{was officially}} {{licensed}} from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non-US markets. Nevertheless, Crazy Kong machines {{found their way}} into some American arcades, often installed in cabinets marked as Congorilla.

Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under the Crazy Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names. The 1982 Logger arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> logs instead of barrels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Semi-solid Continuous roll-casting process {{applied to}} produce the AZ 91 D {{magnesium}} strips and its microstructure was studied in this paper. In order to examine further process ability and forming property of the roll-casting strips, hot <b>and</b> cold <b>rolling</b> <b>and</b> punching experiments were investigated. It was clarified that it is significant to combine the semi-solid process techniques with roll-casting techniques, through which we can get high quality magnesium alloy strips with non-dendritic structure and improve the overall properties of the products. The largest deformation by cold <b>rolling</b> <b>and</b> hot <b>rolling</b> can reach 18 % and 21 % respectively with one-pass roller. ...|$|R

5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar <b>and</b> <b>rolling</b> varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin.
