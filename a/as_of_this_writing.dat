40|$|Collaborative {{writing is}} {{increasingly}} common in both professional and academic fields. One difficulty that collaborative writers face {{is trying to}} produce a consistent style, as each writer may bring a distinctive style to the collaborative writing task. I investigated the viability of using stylostatistical techniques to discover describable, computationally tractable stylistic tests to help collaborative writers eliminate such differences. Writing samples were collected by having graduate students watch two halves of a television episode, then write a summary of each half. Automatically generated syntactic information was used in statistical analyses to ascertain which halves differed significantly. Examination of the statistically significant results revealed {{a wide variety of}} inconsistencies on various levels. Many of these inconsistencies were not immediately obvious before the stylostatistical test results were known. I therefore conclude that stylostatistical techniques provide a promising approach for creating a computer tool to accelerate and improve people’s detection of stylistic inconsistencies. ii Acknowledgements Although only one name appears <b>as</b> author <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work, <b>writing</b> a thesis is indeed a collaborativ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} tobacco industry’s {{litigation}} strategy {{for addressing the}} addiction issue through trial testimony by its experts, and opening and closing statements by its lawyers. Despite the fact that several companies now claim to accept, in varying degrees, the conclusions of the Surgeon General concerning tobacco addiction, the tobacco industry litigation strategy pertaining to addiction is essentially unchanged since that of the early 1980 s when the issue emerged as crucial. The industry uses its experts {{and the process of}} cross-examination of plaintiff’s experts to imply that the addictiveness of tobacco and nicotine are more comparable to substances such as caffeine, chocolate, and even milk, than to heroin, cocaine and alcohol. Furthermore, the tobacco industry contends that the definition of addiction has now become so broadened as to include carrots and caffeine and hence that any concurrence that smoking is addictive, does not imply that cigarettes are addictive to the standards that drugs such as heroin and cocaine are addictive. Finally, the industry has continuously asserted that tobacco users assumed the risks of tobacco since they understood that quitting could be difficult when they began to use, and moreover, that the main barrier to cessation is lack of desire or motivation to quit and not physical addiction. These positions have been maintained through the 2004 – 2005 US Government litigation that was ongoing <b>as</b> the time <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>writing.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{efficient}} testing tools can {{shorten the}} actual testing time in projects. Ericsson Wireless Research in Dallas is evaluating the use for such tools. One {{of the areas}} where it is of interest is AXE service testing. The idea is to test AXE services via cell phones, connected and controlled from a workstation running the test tools. The cell phone in question is the Ericsson CF- 888, which has a built in modem which can be controlled via a serial port using simple AT commands. Because of a flaw in the current pre-release of the CF- 888 (<b>as</b> <b>of</b> when <b>this</b> is <b>written)</b> full functionality can not be obtained when the phone is controlled with AT-commands directly over a serial link. The solution was to first process the AT-commands with the IrDA protocol stack, and send the IrDA frames as pure data over the serial link. This works because the phone will pass any incoming unknown data to be processed by its internal IrDA protocol stack. The main goal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> thesis was to implement he IrDA protocol stack on a Sun Solaris Workstation {{to be able to}} communicate with the CF- 888 IrDA protocol stack, and by that control the phone. In this way, full functionality can be obtained, even though the phone is controlled over a serial link. A library of abstract tests for the CF- 888 was also created. The purpose of these test steps was to build a basic foundation of test building blocks that future tests can be established from. The idea is simple enough: reuse of code.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new network on chip (NoC) {{designed specifically to}} suit the growing FPGA market. Network on chip is the interconnect <b>of</b> tomorrow, <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>this,</b> traditional computer buses are still the most used type of interconnect technology. At the same time research on NoC has been extensive {{over the last couple}} of years and is today used in some of the newest and most capable CPUs from leading companies like Intel, Texas Instruments and IBM. As more cores need to t cut it anymore, a network for interconnect communication is the solution. FPGAs are today produced at 22 and 28 nm and are capable of holding very complex logic designs with many cores. Low end FPGAs are also falling in price and it opens up the usage of FPGAs in markets where they earlier could not be used because of their high price. LNoC is a network on chip designed to suit the need of both high performance systems and low cost FPGA designs. The key to LNoCs success s reconfigurability and ability to adapt to the demands of each unique FPGA design, while keeping a standard interface for IP blocks enabling effective hardware reusability. The presentation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> thesis work contains two main parts, the content of the thesis and the LNoC specification. The thesis chapters focus on the background and development of LNoC.

For many, a mechanical strobe tuner {{is simply not}} practical for one {{or all of the}} above reasons. To address these issues, in 2001 Peterson Tuners added a line of non-mechanical electronic strobe tuners that have LCD dot-matrix displays mimicking a mechanical strobe disc display, giving a stroboscopic effect. In 2004 Peterson made a model of LCD strobe in a sturdy floor based [...] "stomp box" [...] for live on-stage use. Virtual strobe tuners are as accurate as standard mechanical disc strobe tuners. However, there are limitations to the virtual system compared to the disc strobes. Virtual strobes display fewer bands to read note information, and do not pick up harmonic partials like a disc strobe. Rather, each band on a virtual strobe represents octaves of the fundamental. A disc strobe provides [...] "one band correspondence"—each band displays a particular frequency of the note being played. On the virtual strobe system, each band combines a few close frequencies for easier reading on the LCD. This is still extremely accurate for intoning and tuning most instruments—but, <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>writing,</b> no virtual strobe tuner provides detailed information on partials.|$|E

40|$|The Aquarius L-band radiometer/scatterometer {{system is}} {{designed}} to provide monthly salinity maps at 150 km spatial scale to a 0. 2 psu accuracy. The sensor was launched on June 10, 2011, aboard the Argentine CONAE SAC-D spacecraft. The L-band radiometers and the scatterometer have been taking science data observations since August 25, 2011. The first part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> presentation gives an overview over the Aquarius salinity retrieval algorithm. The instrument calibration converts Aquarius radiometer counts into antenna temperatures (TA). The salinity retrieval algorithm converts those TA into brightness temperatures (TB) at a flat ocean surface. As a first step, contributions arising from the intrusion of solar, lunar and galactic radiation are subtracted. The antenna pattern correction (APC) removes the effects of cross-polarization contamination and spillover. The Aquarius radiometer measures the 3 rd Stokes parameter in addition to vertical (v) and horizontal (h) polarizations, which allows for an easy removal of ionospheric Faraday rotation. The atmospheric absorption at L-band is almost entirely due to O 2, which can be calculated based on auxiliary input fields from numerical weather prediction models and then successively removed from the TB. The final step in the TA to TB conversion is the correction for the roughness of the sea surface due to wind. This is based on the radar backscatter measurements by the scatterometer. The TB of the flat ocean surface can now be matched to a salinity value using a surface emission model that is based on a model for the dielectric constant of sea water and an auxiliary field for the sea surface temperature. In the current processing (<b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>this</b> abstract) only v-pol TB are used for this last process and NCEP winds are used for the roughness correction. Before the salinity algorithm can be operationally implemented and its accuracy assessed by comparing versus in situ measurements, an extensive calibration and validation (cal/val) activity needs to be completed. This is necessary in order to tune the inputs to the algorithm and remove biases that arise due to the instrument calibration, foremost the values of the noise diode injection temperatures and the losses that occur in the feedhorns. This is the subject of the second part of our presentation. The basic tool is to analyze the observed difference between the Aquarius measured TA and an expected TA that is computed from a reference salinity field. It is also necessary to derive a relation between the scatterometer backscatter measurements and the radiometer emissivity that is induced by surface winds. In order to do this we collocate Aquarius radiometer and scatterometer measurements with wind speed retrievals from the WindSat and SSMIS F 17 microwave radiometers. Both of these satellites fly in orbits that have the same equatorial ascending crossing time (6 pm) as the Aquarius/SAC-D observatory. Rain retrievals from WindSat and SSMIS F 17 can be used to remove Aquarius observations that are rain contaminated. A byproduct <b>of</b> <b>this</b> analysis is a prediction for the wind-induced sea surface emissivity at L-band...|$|R
