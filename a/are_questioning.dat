5|$|The initialism, LGBT, is {{intended}} to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It {{may be used to}} refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or <b>are</b> <b>questioning</b> their sexual identity; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996. Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI. Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ or LGBTQI. Others use LGBT+ to encompass a spectrum of gender and sexuality.|$|E

25|$|The Reformed Churches (Liberated) are {{conservative}} in doctrine and practice. They {{do not allow}} women to hold special offices (elders, deacons, pastors), but in the 1990s they did approve women voting in church elections. They reject so-called Higher Criticism of the Bible. Liturgically, they favour {{the use of the}} Genevan Psalter in their worship services, although in the last decade a number of classical hymns has also been approved for use in the worship service. In recent years evangelical influences have become stronger (e.g. a more contemporary style of the worship, including new songs and hymns and the use of a praise band). A minority of the members and ministers <b>are</b> <b>questioning</b> some traditional doctrines, and are asking for a different approach on issues like the ordination of women, homosexual relationships, etc. A large middle group, however, wants to hold on to classical Calvinism.|$|E

The Huffington Post {{described}} the song as a [...] "brassy and soulful tune [...] fits perfectly alongside the work of Shirley Bassey in the oeuvre of James Bond title tracks". RedEye gave the song four out of four stars and declared that it [...] "is a return to form, and if it doesn't get you hyped for the movie, you're not a Bond fan". The Daily Record named [...] "Skyfall" [...] its 'Single of the Week' and gave the song five stars out of five. PopCrush gave the song four-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "wholly satisfying and worth the wait". Idolator wrote that [...] "during the song's final third, Adele does, in fact, make the sky fall, in typical Adele fashion". Consequence of Sound commented that [...] "rousing instrumentation elevates the vocals to soaring heights", while HitFix called the song a [...] "majestic ballad" [...] and a [...] "classic James Bond theme". Newsday was also very positive, writing that [...] "Skyfall" [...] is [...] "unlike anything else she's done in her young career. It's self-assured and grand, drawing inspiration from Dame Shirley Bassey, while adding her own powerful phrasing to make it her own. Adele's style {{so far has been}} to downplay her massive voice with lyrics that <b>are</b> <b>questioning</b> and self-deprecating. On 'Skyfall,' though, it sounds like the diva point of view suits her, too".|$|E

2500|$|Others, however, {{see it as}} a case of Jewish {{radicals}} {{refusing to}} compromise, resorting instead to suicide and the murder of their families, both prohibited by Rabbinic Judaism. Researchers <b>are</b> <b>questioning</b> the findings of Yigael Yadin, the Israeli archaeologist who first excavated Masada. Masada was once a place of celebration for Israelis, but now [...] "Israelis [...] become less comfortable with glorifying mass suicide and identifying with religious fanatics", Other archaeologists have reviewed Yadin's findings and have found some discrepancies. During Yadin's excavations, he found three bodies that he claimed were Jewish Zealots. Anthropologist Joe Zias and forensic expert Azriel Gorski claim that the bodies were actually three Romans taken hostage by the Jewish Zealots. If this is true, [...] "Israel might have mistakenly bestowed the honour [...] on three Romans". There is also some discussion of Masada's defenders, and whether they were [...] "the heroic hard core of the great Jewish revolt against Rome, or a gang of killers who became victims of a last Roman mopping-up operation".|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} sexual identity, {{adolescence}} is when most gay/lesbian and transgender adolescents begin {{to recognize and}} make sense of their feelings. Many adolescents may choose to come out during this period of their life once an identity has been formed; many others may go through a period of questioning or denial, which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences. A study of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one's sexual orientation occurred, on average, around age 10, but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17, respectively. [...] Coming to terms with and creating a positive LGBT identity can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons. Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who <b>are</b> <b>questioning</b> their sexuality or gender identity are surrounded by heteronormative peers and can cause great distress due to a feeling of being different from everyone else. While coming out can also foster better psychological adjustment, the risks associated are real. Indeed, coming out {{in the midst of a}} heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence. [...] Because of this, statistically the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members.|$|E

6000|$|Everywhere, {{and in no}} reverential spirit, men <b>are</b> <b>questioning</b> {{the dear}} old idolatry; not [...] "sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer," [...] but dispassionately {{applying}} to its basic doctrine the methods of scientific criticism. He who within even {{the last twenty years}} has not marked in society, in letters, in art, in everything, a distinct change in man's attitude toward women--a change which, were one a woman, one would not wish to see--may reasonably conclude that much, otherwise observable, is hidden by his nose. In the various movements--none of them consciously iconoclastic--engaged in overthrowing this oddest of modern superstitions there is something to deprecate, and even deplore, but the superstition can be spared. It never had much in it that was either creditable or profitable, and all through its rituals ran a note of insincerity which was partly Nature's protest against the rites, but partly, too, hypocrisy. There is no danger that good men will ever cease to respect and love good women, and if bad men ever cease to adore them for their sex when not beating them for their virtues the gain in consistency will partly offset the loss in religious ecstasy.|$|E
