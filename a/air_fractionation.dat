40|$|Fractions from {{debranning}} of durumwheat (Triticum durum sp.) {{were subjected}} to micronization and <b>air</b> <b>fractionation,</b> obtaining coarse (Cf) and fine (Ff) fractions. These fractions mainly differed for particle size, total dietary fiber, protein and fat. Wheat flour (Triticum aestivum sp.) doughs, containing 5 % of Cf or Ff, {{were subjected to}} fermentation by baker's yeast alone or fermented by Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DE 9 and Lactobacillus plantarum 3 DM. White flour doughs, without addition of bran fractions, were also manufactured. The kinetics of growth and acidification of lactic acid bacteria did not differ between sourdoughs with or without Cf or Ff. Breads were manufactured at pilot plant scale. Compared to wheat flour, the addition of micronized bran fractions increased the concentration of free amino acids, total phenols and dietary fiber {{as well as the}} phytase and antioxidant activities of doughs. Sourdoughfermentation further improved these nutritionalfeatures, and enhanced the textural and sensory properties of breads containing bran fractions. In particular, the combination of sourdoughfermentation and Cf increased the concentration of functional compounds and decreased the value of hydrolysis index (HI) ...|$|E
40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticide}} (OCP) residues {{in agricultural}} soils are of concern {{due to the}} uptake of these compounds by crops, accumulation in the foodchain, and reemission from soils to the atmosphere. Although it has been about three decades since DDT was banned for agricultural uses in Canada, residues persist in soils of some agricultural areas. Emission of DDT compounds to the atmosphere from a historically treated field in southern Ontario was determined in fall 2004 and spring 2005. The DDTs concentration in the high organic matter (71 %) soil was 19 ± 4 g g- 1 dry weight. Concentration gradients in the air were measured at 5, 20, 72, and 200 cm above soil using glass fiber filter-polyurethane foam cartridges. Air concentrations of DDTs averaged 5. 7 ± 5. 1 ng m- 3 at 5 cm and decreased to 1. 3 ± 0. 8 ng m- 3 at 200 cm and were 60 - 300 times higher than levels measured at a background site 30 km away. Soil-air fugacity fractions, fs/(fs + fa), of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT ranged from 0. 42 to 0. 91 using air concentrations measured above the soil and 0. 99 using background air concentrations, indicating that the soil was a net source to the background <b>air.</b> <b>Fractionation</b> of DDT compounds during volatilization was predicted using either liquid-phase vapor pressures (PL) or octanol-air partition coefficients (KOA). Relative emissions of p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT were better described by PL than KOA, whereas either PL or KOA successfully accounted for the fractionation of p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT. Soil-to-air fluxes were calculated from air concentration gradients and turbulent exchange coefficients determined from micrometeorological measurements. Average fluxes of DDTs were 90 ± 24 ng m- 2 h- 1 in fall and 660 ± 370 ng m- 2 h- 1 in spring. Higher soil temperatures in spring accounted for the higher fluxes. A volatilization half-life of ~ 200 y was estimated for DDT in the upper 5 cm of the soil column, assuming the average flux rate for 12 h d- 1 over 8 months of the year. Thus, {{in the absence of}} other dissipation processes, the soil {{will continue to be a}} source of atmospheric contamination for a very long time...|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{gradients}} in {{the upper}} layers of the snow pack are of importance for studying the emissivity properties of the snow surface with respect to microwaves used in remote sensing {{as well as for}} the heat and mass transfer in snow thickness. Gradients drive the initial snow microstructure metamorphisms that probably influence the firn properties in regard to <b>air</b> molecules <b>fractionation</b> and the <b>air</b> bubble enclosure process at close-off depths. As a contribution to investigation of these problems and following J. -M. Barnola initiative, we developed an autonomous recording system to monitor the temperature of the upper layers of the snow pack. The instrument was built to be autonomous and to be continuously operating within environmental conditions of the Antarctic plateau and the polar night. The apparatus which monitors temperature from the first 10 mof snow by 15 sensors of a «temperature grape» was set at Vostok station during 55 th Russian Antarctic Expedition within the frame of the French Russian collaboration (GDRI Vostok). From the available hourly measurements over the first year, we present preliminary results on the thermal diffusive properties of the snow pack as well as some character of the temperature variations on the Antarctic plateau. </p...|$|R
50|$|Because raceway {{aquaculture}} operations discharge {{large volumes}} of water, the concentration of discharged solids is low. This means {{it is not easy}} to treat and implement practical, cost effective treatments. Technologies for the removal of solids include microscreens, dual-drain tanks, swirl separators, plate separators, baffles, media filters, <b>air</b> flotation, foam <b>fractionation,</b> chemical flocculation, and constructed wetlands. But because of the impracticality and / or high costs of these methods, most of them are not applicable for commercial aquaculture. As a consequence, sedimentation (settling) is still the most widely applied and cost effective technology. Since 1999, regulations in South Korea require that all raceway farms provide waste water treatment facilities covering at least 20% of the farmed area to prevent pollution of the freshwater environment. Open race way ponds were used for removal of heavy metal ions like lead using live Spirulina (Arthospira) sp.|$|R
40|$|The global {{distillation}} hypothesis {{states that}} fractionation patterns of persistent semivolatile {{chemicals in the}} environment {{are determined by the}} effect of spatially varying environmental temperature on the temperature-dependent phase partitioning coefficients of chemicals. Here, we use a model experiment and an analysis of monitoring data for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to explore an alternative hypothesis, the differential removal hypothesis, which proposes that fractionation results from different loss rates from the atmosphere, acting along a gradient of remoteness from emission sources Model calculations for a range of PCB congeners demonstrate that fractionation occurs with distance from sources, regardless of the temperature gradient. We have assembled two independent data sets of PCB concentrations in European <b>air</b> that show <b>fractionation,</b> and quantified the remoteness of monitoring sites from PCB sources using the remoteness index, RI Regression analysis of these empirical data against RI and temperature demonstrates that RI determines fractionation patterns Based on this result, we calculate empirical effective residence times in air for a set of PCB congeners from the relationship between measured concentrations and RI. These empirical effective residence times agree well with values calculated by a multimedia mass balance model. Our conclusion from the model experiment and analysis of monitoring data is that temperature is not a driver of the fractionation of PCBs currently observed in European air, but rather that fractionation reflects differential removal from the atmosphere...|$|R

Cell death was detected in the atpdr 8 mutants within 10 h of infection with the virulent bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. As a result, the growth of P. syringae in the leaves of the atpdr 8 mutant was reduced to 1 % of that in the wild type. The defense response genes, PR- 1, PR- 2, PR- 5, VPEγ, AtrbohD and AtrbohF were highly expressed when the mutant plants were grown under non-sterile conditions. The expression of the AtPDR 8 gene was enhanced by infection of virulent and avirulent bacterial pathogens. Our results indicate that AtPDR 8 is a key factor controlling the extent of cell death in the defense response and suggest that AtPDR 8 transports some substance(s) which is closely related to the response of plants to pathogen...|$|R
40|$|The water {{residence}} {{time in the}} atmosphere is approximately nine days, the shortest {{residence time}} in any major reservoir of the whole water cycle on the planet. Nevertheless, water vapor is {{a key factor in}} climate and hydrology due to its dynamic behavior. The isotopic composition of water vapor can highlight several processes of the water cycle that link the water reservoirs to the atmosphere (Galewsky et al., 2016). In the past, the isotopic composition of water vapor was generally inferred from precipitation data, assuming isotopic equilibrium between rain and water vapor. This assumption works well when precipitation is abundant but gives misleading results when precipitation is scarce. A common method to determine the isotopic composition of water vapor is the cryotrapping technique, proposed by Craig et al., (1963). Cryotrapping consists in freezing all the moisture content of the <b>air</b> (to avoid <b>fractionation)</b> and analyze the liquid sample with the regular mass spectrometry technique. This process includes the designing of customized cold traps and usually requires several man-hours due to the long sampling time (2 - 8 hours per sample). With the advent of the laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) technique is now possible to determine the isotopic composition of water vapor with sampling time down to seconds. This novel technique increases our knowledge about the isotopic composition of water vapor and gives a substantial help in our understanding of the water cycle, both on global and local scales. However, the continuous measurement of isotopic composition of water vapor requires a specific method to calibrate the large amount of data resulting as the output of a Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer. This includes the production of vapor with known isotopic composition, determination of the response of the analyzer to different humidity levels and correction of the instrumental drift. In this work, we present a summary of potential calibration techniques for continuous measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapor. The study goes in-depth on the developing of a customized calibration unit for a commercial CRDS analyzer (Picarro L 1102 i). Continuous measurements will be compared to water vapor samples collected with cryotraps and several continuous measurements will be presented highlighting sub-daily processes in the atmospheric boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|Contraceptive {{diaphragms}} offer {{a discreet}} method of pregnancy protection {{that women can}} use when needed with no side effects. Incorporating antiretroviral HIV microbicides into such devices may also provide protection against HIV infection. The paper gives a brief outline of the work being conducted by PATH, CONRAD and QUB {{on the development of}} a microbicide-releasing SILCS diaphragm. The design, engineering and manufacturing challenges that have been encountered will be discussed, as well as the potential impact such a device could have in the developing world. A factor of 2. 5 increase in the global abundance of atmospheric methane (CH 4) since 1750 contributes 0. 5 Wm(- 2) to total direct radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases (2. 77 Wm- 2 in 2009), while its role in atmospheric chemistry adds another approximately 0. 2 Wm(- 2) of indirect forcing. Since CH 4 has a relatively short lifetime and it is very close to a steady state, reductions in its emissions would quickly benefit climate. Sensible emission mitigation strategies require quantitative understanding of CH 4 's budget of emissions and sinks. Atmospheric observations of CH 4 abundance and its rate of increase, combined with an estimate of the CH 4 lifetime, constrain total global CH 4 emissions to between 500 and 600 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1). While total global emissions are constrained reasonably well, estimates of emissions by source sector vary by up to a factor of 2. Current observation networks are suitable to constrain emissions at large scales (e. g. global) but not at the regional to national scales necessary to verify emission reductions under emissions trading schemes. Improved constraints on the global CH 4 budget and its break down of emissions by source sector and country will come from an enhanced observation network for CH 4 abundance and its isotopic composition (delta C- 13, delta D (D = H- 2) and delta C- 14). Isotopic measurements are a valuable tool in distinguishing among various sources that contribute emissions to an <b>air</b> parcel, once <b>fractionation</b> by loss processes is accounted for. Isotopic measurements are especially useful at regional scales where signals are larger. Reducing emissions from many anthropogenic source sectors is cost-effective, but these gains may be cancelled, in part, by increasing emissions related to economic development {{in many parts of the}} world. An observation network that can quantitatively assess these changing emissions, both positive and negative, is required, especially in the context of emissions trading schemes...|$|R
