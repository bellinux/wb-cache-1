The temple has numerous reliefs graphically depicting sexuality and fertility including several stone depictions of a copulating penis and vagina. It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. <b>Among</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> a male statue clutching his penis, with three tortoises with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5ft) representation of lingga with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia. Phallic references were also made in Khmer architecture in Cambodia, and several Khmer temples depict the phallus in reliefs.|$|E
5|$|In 1766, Hyder Ali, {{the ruler}} of Mysore invaded {{northern}} Kerala. His son and successor, Tipu Sultan, launched campaigns against the expanding British East India Company, resulting {{in two of the}} four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Tipu ultimately ceded the Malabar District and South Kanara to the company in the 1790s; both were annexed to the Madras Presidency of British India in 1792. The company forged tributary alliances with Kochi in 1791 and Travancore in 1795. By the end of 18th century, the whole of Kerala fell {{under the control of the}} British, either administered directly or under suzerainty. There were major revolts in Kerala during the independence movement in the 20th century; most notable <b>among</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> the 1921 Malabar Rebellion and the social struggles in Travancore. In the Malabar Rebellion, Mappila Muslims of Malabar rioted against Hindu zamindars and the British Raj. Some social struggles against caste inequalities also erupted in the early decades of 20th century, leading to the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation that opened Hindu temples in Travancore to all castes.|$|E
5|$|In the Early Middle Ages, {{after the}} decline of the Roman Empire, the Adriatic coasts of the region were ruled by Ostrogoths, Lombards, and the Byzantine Empire. The Carolingian Empire arose in {{the last part of the}} period and {{subsequently}} the Frankish Kingdom of Italy took control of the Adriatic Sea's western coast extending to the Kvarner Gulf, while Byzantine control of the opposite coast gradually shrunk following the Avar and Croatian invasions starting in the 7th century. The region was gradually incorporated into the medieval Kingdom of Croatia by the 11th century, when the kingdom reached its territorial peak, and the city of Senj became the most important centre of the region. Items of significance to Croatian historical heritage originated from the region in that period. The most notable <b>among</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> the Baška tablet, one of the oldest surviving inscriptions in the Croatian language.|$|E

Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called The Savior (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the second coming of Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E

Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Livermorium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lv and atomic number 116. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive element that has only been created in the laboratory {{and has not been}} observed in nature. The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of Livermore, California where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. Four isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived <b>among</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 60milliseconds.

5|$|Other architects {{chose the}} era's simpler styles, like Arts and Crafts, as a contrast. The marble-and-brick 1905 YMCA {{building}} on Second Street, and the six-story Caldwell Apartments at State and Second streets {{are two of}} the district's best examples of that style. The latter building, built in 1907, was also the first large-scale apartment building in the city. The Colonial Revival style would also leave its mark in Troy with several buildings. Most notable <b>among</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> the Hendrick Hudson Hotel {{on the east side of}} Monument Square, a six-story structure that was the largest building ever built in the city at the time. Projects of similar scale, and the city's annexation of the village of Lansingburgh to its north, helped swell its population to over 72,000 in 1930, its alltime peak.|$|E

Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E
