In an interview with author Rebecca Rule, Brodsky said the stories her clients have told her [...] "often reveal great courage, inner strength and joy." [...] Brodsky said she has witnessed the human struggle to [...] "overcome personal difficulties that started in childhood." [...] "My books for children have messages in them that come from my social work experience...differences, friendship, loyalty, and social action," [...] Brodsky told journalist Michael Cousineau in a 2008 interview in the New Hampshire Sunday News.

Bush told WAQI-AM, a Spanish-language radio station in Miami, [...] "If Fidel Castro were to move on because of natural causes, we've got a plan in place {{to help the people}} of Cuba understand there's a better way than the system in which they've been living under. No one knows when Fidel Castro will move on. In my judgment, that's the work of the Almighty." [...] On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President Bush told him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, [...] "The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll {{have to wait and see}} what U.S. action is necessary.

2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person you love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she did know that the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will get you on the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E

6000|$|What a cry {{for those}} who had been for three hours dashing on the sands, expecting every moment that the ship would break up! The horrors of their {{situation}} were enhanced by the novelty of their sensations! <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> realise to some extent, from hearsay and from paintings, what is meant by billows bursting high over ships' mast-heads and washing everything off the decks, but who that has not experienced it can imagine what it is to see gigantic yards being whipped to and fro as a light cane might be switched by a strong man, to see top-masts snapping like pipe-stems, to hear stout ropes cracking like pliant whipcord, and great sails flapping with thunder-claps or bursting into shreds? Above all, who can realise the sensation caused by one's abode being lifted violently with every surge and dropped again with the crashing weight of two thousand tons, or being rolled from side to side so that the floor on which one stands alternates between the horizontal and perpendicular, while one's frame each time receives a shock that is only too much in dread harmony with the desperate condition of the mind? ...|$|E

[...] What {{needs to be said}} and written about is this, that war must be [...] put an end to and that nobody else but you and me and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> [...] do it. We have to do that for the love of our sons and our race and [...] all that is human. War is no longer human; the chemist and the [...] metallurgist have changed all that. My boy was shot through the eye; [...] his brain was blown to pieces by some man who never knew what he had [...] done. Think what that means!... It is plain to me, surely it is [...] plain to you and all the world, that war is now a mere putting of [...] the torch to explosives that flare out to universal ruin. There is [...] nothing for one sane man to write to another about in these days but [...] the salvation of mankind from war.|$|E

6000|$|The true {{story of}} the sin of the Sultan he is always trying, by {{listening}} to these stories, to forget. As we have said before in this chapter, he {{would prefer not to}} remember, because he has made up his mind not to repent. It is a curious story, and I shall try to tell it truly in the two chapters that follow. In all ages the tyrant is hard because he is soft. If his car crashes over bleeding and accusing crowds, it is because he has chosen the path of least resistance. It is because {{it is much easier to}} ride down a human race than ride up a moderately steep hill. The fight of the oppressor is always a pillow-fight; commonly a war with cushions--always a war for cushions. Saladin, the great Sultan, if I remember rightly, accounted it the greatest feat of swordsmanship to cut a cushion. And so indeed it is, as <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> attest who have been for years past trying to cut into the swollen and windy corpulence of the modern compromise, that is at once cosy and cruel. For there is really in our world to-day the colour and silence of the cushioned divan; and that sense of palace within palace and garden within garden which makes the rich irresponsibility of the East. Have we not already the wordless dance, the wineless banquet, and all that strange unchristian conception of luxury without laughter? Are we not already in an evil Arabian Nights, and walking the nightmare cities of an invisible despot? Does not our hangman strangle secretly, the bearer of the bow string? Are we not already eugenists--that is, eunuch-makers? Do we not see the bright eyes, the motionless faces, and all that presence of something that is dead and yet sleepless? It is the presence of the sin that is sealed with pride and impenitence; the story of how the Sultan got his throne. But it is not the story he is listening to just now, but another story which has been invented to cover it--the story called [...] "Eugenius: or the Adventures of One Not Born," [...] a most varied and entrancing tale, which never fails to send him to sleep.|$|E
