50|$|Used in {{mechanical}} watches and clocks, a barrel is a cylindrical metal box closed by <b>a</b> <b>cover,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> of gear teeth around it, containing a spiral spring called the mainspring, which provides power {{to run the}} timepiece. The barrel turns on an arbor (axle). The spring is hooked to the barrel at its outer end and to the arbor at its inner end. The barrel teeth engage the first pinion of the wheel train of the watch, usually the center wheel. Barrels rotate slowly: for a watch mainspring barrel, the rate is usually one rotation every 8 hours. This construction allows the mainspring to be wound (by turning the arbour) without interrupting the tension of the spring driving the timepiece.|$|R

It shows that Enochs' conjecture is true for a large variety of interesting rings, and then presents the applications of the results.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{three kinds of}} modules: {{cyclically}} presented modules in relation to factorization of elements in a noncommutative integral domain, automorphism-invariant modules and poor modules. First, we investigate projective covers of cyclically presented modules, characterizing the rings over which every cyclically presented module has <b>a</b> projective <b>cover.</b> Such <b>rings</b> R are Von Neumann regular modulo their Jacobson radical J (R) and their idempotents can be lifted modulo J (R). Then we study the modules M R whose endomorphism ring E := (MR) is Von Neumann regular modulo J (E) and their idempotents lift modulo J (E). Next, the endomorphism rings of automorphism-invariant modules and their injective envelopes are investigated. We consider some cases where automorphism-invariant modules are quasi-injective and a connection between automorphism-invariant modules and boolean rings. Finally, we give some necessary conditions for rings over which every non-zero cyclic module is poor...|$|R

In this paper, we discuss the life cycle of the platform in various industries, such as industrial machinery, aerospace, automotive and product software.

40|$|Visualizing survivable {{telecommunication}} networks {{on the screen}} {{has proven to be}} useful and helpful for the network designers. In fact, they can easily identify rings, perceive the interaction between rings, and then rapidly spot possible problems. Given <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> <b>cover</b> of survivable {{telecommunication networks}}, we provide three techniques for drawing a ring cover: the inside drawing, the outside drawing and the mixed drawing. In chapter 1, we will introduce the problem and present some basic definitions related to our subject. In chapter 2, we will present the inside drawing algorithm which consists of drawing each ring inside another one. In chapter 3, we will deal with the outside drawing algorithm in which rings are drawn outside others. In chapter 4, we will describe the mixed drawing algorithm which consists of drawing rings outside or inside each other. Finally, a conclusion and open problems for future work will be presented in chapter 5. We should mention that all these drawings should respect many criteria in order to preserve the readability of the drawing. These criteria are as follows: Rings must be easily identifiable within the picture, no crossing is acceptable and the resolution rule should be respected. As in most of the graph drawing algorithms, the area used for the drawing is very important.

40|$|The {{design of}} survivable all-optical mesh {{networks}} based on bidirectional line-switched WDM (wavelength division multiplexed) self-healing rings (SHR/WDM) to provide full protection against any single line fault requires {{the solution of}} three sub-problems: determining the <b>ring</b> <b>cover</b> of the mesh topology, determining the routing of the working lightpaths (paths of light) between the node pairs that originate traffic demands, determining the allocation of the spare wavelengths in each ring required to protect every line in the mesh that supports traffic. A working lightpath can span over multiple rings, thus requiring one crossconnect I/O port at each node that connects two adjacent rings along its path. This paper addresses the problem of minimizing {{the total number of}} optical crossconnect I/O ports that are required in the mesh to support a set of traffic demands. The problem is solved under two design scenarios. In the first scenario we derive the minimum number of crossconnect ports necessary in a mesh network with <b>a</b> given <b>ring</b> <b>cover</b> and given routes for the working lightpaths. Once the number of crossconnect ports are minimized, the network total (working and protection) wavelength mileage is minimized by balancing the traffic in each ring. In the second scenario the <b>ring</b> <b>cover,</b> the routing for the working lightpaths and the spare wavelengths in each ring are first computed in such a way to minimize the total wavelength mileage. With this network configuration we then minimize the number of crossconnect ports. The presented solutions provide the designer with two alternative approaches that trade one cost function, i. e., the number of crossconnect ports, for the other, i. e., the total wavelength mileag...|$|R

Güell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarrià, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuyàs de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for the}} Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaudí undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of <b>a</b> stable, <b>covered</b> longeing <b>ring</b> and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real Cátedra Gaudí, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{compressor}} manufacturers {{often have}} to respond instantly to new impeller designs or in an aftermarket situation to modification of an existing impeller. To deal with this, design from scratch {{is out of the}} question and de-signers often rely on their experience to design by scaling or modification. A compressor designer’s wish is to have one single stage unit design with good performance that can <b>cover</b> <b>a</b> wide <b>rang</b> of applications and a wide range of mass flow rates. This means a stage whose impeller and diffuser chocking areas can be varied, which is not impossible but difficult. Currently there are five main ways of dealing with this: 1.

Radial cropping of the impeller vanes 5. Radial cropping of the diffuser vanes This paper discusses item No. 2, impeller exit width trimming. On the basis of experimental data for two impellers, one with a low flow coefficient and the other with a high flow coefficient, the effect of impeller exit width trimming is studied and discussed.
