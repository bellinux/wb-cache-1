5|$|In Muncie, Indiana, Nora Pearce and Curtis Delario {{argue about}} the death of her husband, Ray. Nora {{believes}} Ray died from Gulf War syndrome. After attempting to comfort her, Delario starts to drive home and crashes into a man {{in the middle of the}} road. His car is totaled, but the man is unharmed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> breaks around his body. Curtis, grievously injured, looks up at the man and says, “Ray?” The man’s arm slams through the windshield as Curtis screams.|$|E
5|$|The 1965 Tiger Mark I {{gained some}} {{exposure}} on American television <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{of choice for}} Maxwell Smart in the spoof spy series Get Smart. The Tiger {{was used for the}} first two seasons in the opening credits, in which Smart screeched to a halt outside his headquarters, and was used through the remainder of the series in several episodes. Some of the scenes featured unusual modifications such as a retractable James Bond-style machine gun that could not have fit under the Tiger's bonnet, so rebadged Alpine models were used instead.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Flytoget {{announced}} that they had ordered a fourth car {{for each of the}} units. This increased the capacity of each unit by 40% to 244 seats, and allows the company to manage the annual 10% growth in passengers. The delivery of the fourth cars started in 2008 and were built by Bombardier Transportation, who has bought ADtranz, with the rebuilding scheduled to be completed during 2009. The rebuilding created several challenges for Bombardier, since most of the components used in the class were no longer available. Significant components such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> body and rectifiers had to be built by Bombardier based on abandoned production lines, and many of the original manufacturers for the interior have become defunct.|$|E

5|$|When Nora arrives home, Ray {{shows up}} {{demanding}} {{the name of}} the person responsible. She tells him that the man responsible is Owen Harris. Ray finds Harris, along with his family, and nearly kills him. However, he realizes that Harris was an accountant who accidentally sent the barrel to the salvage yard. Seeing that he was ultimately innocent, Ray spares him and goes off to die. Scully believes that this act represented the last of Ray’s humanity. At {{the very end of the}} episode, a car is dropped into a compactor at a salvage yard and crushed. As the camera fades out, Ray's eye is seen, still alive <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is crushed.|$|E

25|$|Other cues, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> someone buys, {{the house}} they live in, the way they {{decorate}} their living environment. For example, an SUV evokes reactions that confirm a person's positive self-view.|$|E
25|$|Cars may {{drive as}} far <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park {{situated}} {{about a mile}} up the valley. This car park was at one time an open-air swimming pool. A sign indicating water depth still stands in its original position.|$|E
25|$|Corporate pavilions {{included}} IBM, Ford, Fujitsu, Queensland Newspapers, Australia Post, Cadbury Chocolate, Suncorp, and the Queensland Teachers Credit Union.

5000|$|The MP4 was <b>the</b> first <b>car</b> {{to be built}} {{following}} the merger of the McLaren team and Ron Dennis' Project 4 Formula 2 team, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> name (short for [...] "Marlboro Project 4") indicates.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{was just}} being {{finished}} the FIA GT1 regulations were changed so that {{there had to be}} a minimum of 350 road cars produced per year of the model that was to compete, something that Koenigsegg was unable to achieve, prohibiting the CCGT from racing.|$|E
25|$|Cosworth, absent {{since the}} 2006 season, {{returned}} in 2010. New teams Lotus Racing, HRT, and Virgin Racing, {{along with the}} established Williams, used this engine. The season also saw {{the withdrawal of the}} BMW and Toyota engines, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> companies withdrew from Formula One due to the recession.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> example demonstrates, {{the ability}} to make {{multiple}} simultaneous recordings of the same subjectthrough the use of several DAT or multitrack recordershas made sound recording into a sophisticated craft. The sound effect can be shaped by the sound editor or sound designer, not just for realism, but for emotional effect.|$|E
50|$|Note: Benetton Renault and Williams Renault {{were not}} awarded Constructors' Championship points for their {{placings}} in the Brazilian Grand Prix <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were {{deemed to be}} using illegal fuel.|$|R

25|$|In September 1962 the S21 {{series was}} released. It was in {{production}} until November 1963. The front end was redesigned {{in an attempt}} to update the look of the car. The result was rather unsuccessful <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> now looked like a 1950s body with a 1960s front end. The S21 continued to use the 1.9L GB-4 engine.|$|E
25|$|When filming for {{the series}} began, several {{problems}} arose due to the car's age: it overheated, the battery died, and the expensive Mickey Thompson tires repeatedly failed. By mid season, the engine and transmission were replaced with those of a Ford Galaxie. The most frequent visual influence of this car is that later Batmobiles usually have a rear rocket thruster that fires <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> starts up.|$|E
25|$|At Union Station's main entrance, a lane {{is before}} Union Avenue. Taxis line the lane {{waiting to take}} passengers, along with a city bus stop, and room for cars to drive through to {{conveniently}} drop people {{off in front of}} the station without disrupting Union Avenue traffic. Parking is allowed opposite of the taxis as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> only remains there for five to ten minutes.|$|E
60|$|Down {{the slopes}} Sherikov's guards raced, toward <b>the</b> stalled <b>cars.</b> Clouds of heat rose up and boiled across <b>the</b> plain <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> fired {{up at the}} running men. A robot gun dropped like a slug onto the plain and screamed toward <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> firing <b>as</b> it came.|$|R
5000|$|The air {{suspension}} has three settings. The default setting, [...] "Comfort", is ideal under normal driving conditions, stiffening <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> speed increases. [...] "Sport 1" [...] and [...] "Sport 2" [...] settings give <b>the</b> <b>car</b> more agility on winding and bumpy roads. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> {{can also be}} raised three inches (76 mm), if needed.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{that extra}} speed {{has been found}} through corners, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> have got wider and will {{generate}} at least 20% more downforce compared to last year thanks to bigger wings and increased aerodynamics.|$|R
25|$|For the suspension, the B31 {{featured}} double wishbones, {{coil springs}} over dampers with an anti-roll {{bar at the}} front, and single top links, twin lower links, twin trailing arms, coil springs over dampers with an anti-roll bar at the rear. The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had rack-and-pinion steering. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> weighed , it had a power-to-weight ratio of exactly 0.5hp/kg.|$|E
25|$|In Pakistan the four-door {{version was}} {{available}} with the F8B engine (800 cc, 40hp), and was sold as the Suzuki FX 800. The FX was sold from 1983 to 1988 {{when it was}} replaced by the SB-308 body style (also known as the CB72, still in production), called the Suzuki Mehran. The FX features prominently <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> driven by the protagonist in Mohsin Hamid's debut work Moth Smoke.|$|E
25|$|American Motors {{introduced}} the open differential Model 128 transfer {{case for the}} Eagle. The automatic transmission {{no longer had a}} lockup torque converter. Eagle sales would drop beneath the 10,000 annual unit mark for the first time for 1986 (and would slide further for its remaining two seasons on the market), <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was aging due to its seven-season life atop a platform that debuted for 1970.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the race, Pedro de la Rosa's engine failed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> {{were making}} their way from the pit lane to their grid positions, {{and so he did}} not even take the {{formation}} lap.|$|R
6000|$|With McCleary {{he took a}} {{car that}} galloped like a broncho, {{and started for the}} very heart of the mystery. As <b>the</b> crowds thickened, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> they met grew more heavily laden, McCleary said: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} was made based on the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> demonstrated in <b>the</b> Paul Ricard tests, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> exceptional fuel economy, which meant that the carefully learned driving techniques intended to preserve the fuel allowance were no longer {{a critical part of}} the team's strategy.|$|R
