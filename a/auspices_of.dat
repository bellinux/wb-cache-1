50|$|According to {{unanimous}} {{testimony from}} ancient sources the use <b>of</b> <b>auspices</b> {{as a means}} to decipher the will of the gods was more ancient than Rome itself. The use of the word is usually associated with Latins as well as the earliest Roman citizens. Though some modern historians link the act <b>of</b> observing <b>Auspices</b> to the Etruscans, Cicero accounts in his text De Divinatione several differences between the auspicial of the Romans and the Etruscan system of interpreting the will of the gods. Cicero also mentions several other nations which, like the Romans, paid attention to the patterns of flying birds as signs of the gods' will but never once mentions this practice while discussing the Etruscans. Though auspices were prevalent before the Romans, Romans are often linked with <b>auspices</b> because <b>of</b> both their connection to Rome’s foundation and because Romans were the first to take the system and lay out such fixed and fundamental rules for the reading <b>of</b> <b>auspices</b> that it remained an essential part of Roman culture. Stoics, for instance, maintained that if there are gods, they care for men, and that if they care for men they must send them signs of their will.|$|R
