40|$|Given {{the extent}} of global {{ecosystem}} degradation resulting from environmental changes and human activity, restoration efforts have increasingly focused on biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services. Grassland, the largest terrestrial <b>ecosystem</b> globally <b>and</b> in China, has high ecological and economic value. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impacts of grassland restoration on biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services in China. The results showed that grassland restoration improved biodiversity by 32. 44 % <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services by 30. 43 %, although the restored grassland from degraded conditions failed to reach the level of non-degraded reference conditions for biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services. The analysis of biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services in the four ecological domains showed significant differences in restored grassland compared to the degraded and reference grassland. Restoration outcomes of biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services were affected by different restoration approaches, but restoration age was not detected as significantly correlated with biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services recovery. Biodiversity recovery, however, {{was positively correlated with}} ecosystem services recovery so far in our dataset. Despite this, these patterns require further elucidation and synthetic analyses must be conducted to assess and inform future restoration actions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

This study reviewed research on functional traits <b>and</b> framework of <b>ecosystem</b> services, relationship between functional diversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> function <b>and</b> application of functional traits in ecosystem services.

Third, quantitative relationships between functional diversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services should be constructed.

5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species <b>and</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Exotic species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{traits of}} {{individual}} organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations, communities, <b>and</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Several areas of ecology of evolution {{that focus on}} such traits are life history theory, ecophysiology, metabolic theory of ecology, and Ethology. Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction. Other traits {{may be related to}} structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{archaeology}} of Iowa is {{the study}} of the buried remains of human culture within the state of Iowa from the earliest prehistoric through the late historic periods. When the American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500‚Äì2,800 years ago) American Indians adapted to local environments <b>and</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased. More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increase on the reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements. The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. During the Historical period European traders and American Indians in Iowa gave way to American settlers and Iowa was transformed into an agricultural state.|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services are gradually recognized by human as an approach towards sustainability, {{so it is}} important to understand relationships and congruence between them to support conservation planning, especially in the hotspot areas with a prominent role in conservation. However, the management of most conservation hotspots mainly focused on biodiversity, and rarely concerned with ecosystem services. With the aim of proposing criteria for conservation strategies that contribute to the optimization of biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services, in this study, a Geographic Information System (GIS) -based approach was designed to estimate and map the biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services in Chongqing Municipality of China. Furthermore, the distributions of hotspot areas for biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services were mapped based on the relationship between cumulative <b>ecosystem</b> services <b>and</b> areas. Finally the statistical analysis was processed focused on specific conservation objectives. The results showed that hotspot areas can conserve the most biodiversity but with the least ecosystem services under the conservation plans target to biodiversity conservation. In contrast, depending on the ecosystem services of interest, hotspot areas can conserve the largest ecosystem services but with the least biodiversity. By integrating biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services into conservation plan, we found that the conservation and regeneration of these small areas, would contribute to a conservation of 44 % of the biodiversity hotspot and 14 %- 42 % of the ecosystem services hotspot. Moreover, the current nature reserve selection was not maximize the biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services compared to integration strategy, indicating that hotspot areas conservation and selection is vital for optimization protection of biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> services, <b>and</b> has practical significance for natural resources <b>and</b> <b>ecosystem</b> management...|$|R
