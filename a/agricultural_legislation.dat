40|$|We study {{incentives}} for information sharing among agricultural intermediaries in imperfectly competitive markets for farm output. Information sharing always increases expected grower and total surplus, but may reduce expected intermediary profits. Even when expected profits increase with information sharing, intermediary firms face a prisoner's dilemma {{where it is}} privately rational to withhold information, given that other firms report truthfully. This equilibrium can be avoided if firms' information reports are verifiable, and if firms commit to an ex ante contract that enforces participation in information sharing. We show how <b>agricultural</b> bargaining <b>legislation</b> can implement such {{a contract with the}} bargained farm price representing a sufficient statistic of all information held by intermediary firms.

At the same time conservation is the use of resources in a manner that safely maintains a resource that can be used by humans.

Subsequently, in 1895, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture was created. The Department of Agriculture, as the Board of Agriculture's successor, assumed the roles of agricultural education, law enforcement, and disease control.

5000|$|In 1927 Congress passed {{legislation}} affordimg diplomatic status to representatives abroad of the Department of Commerce (until {{then known as}} [...] "trade commissioners"), creating the Foreign Commerce Service. In 1930 Congress passed similar legislation for the Department of Agriculture, creating the Foreign Agricultural Service. Though formally accorded diplomatic status, however, commercial and agricultural attachés were civil servants (not officers of the Foreign Service). In addition, the <b>agricultural</b> <b>legislation</b> stipulated that agricultural attachés would not be construed as public ministers. On July 1, 1939, however, both the commercial and agricultural attachés were transferred to the Department of State under Reorganization Plan No. II. The agricultural attachés remained in the Department of State until 1954, when they were returned by Act of Congress to the Department of Agriculture. Commercial attachés remained with State until 1980, when Reorganization Plan Number 3 of 1979 was implemented under terms of the Foreign Service Act of 1980.|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{is a vital}} {{source of}} {{employment}} and income for many unskilled workers in South Africa. However, due to {{the decline in the}} sector's contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (as a result of the reduction in agricultural production and an increase in the contribution of the manufacturing and services sectors) (Department of Agriculture, 2010), this vital role is diminishing. With changing economic conditions and the implementation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>legislations,</b> such as ESTA, most farm workers' living standards have decreased. Many farm workers earned significantly less than other unskilled workers therefore, to improve their wages, a minimum wage was introduced. However, the minimum wage only increased the wages of farm workers who were still employed as many were retrenched. Since the impact of the minimum wage on employment and wages has been thoroughly studied this paper seeks to determine whether the introduction of the statutory agricultural minimum wage, in 2003, restructured the agricultural labour force. The paper will use the Mincerian wage equation to estimate the returns to skills (education and experience) in order to determine if the productivity of farm workers was affected. The paper finds that educational attainment increased for farm workers and was rewarded by farmers, as the return to education increased. Experience increased for farm workers as well but was not rewarded accordingly, as there was a reduction in the return to experience. Therefore, farm owners prefer a more educated agricultural workforce to a more experienced workforce, as they are willing to offer higher wages to educated farm workers. Evidently, the minimum wage has restructured the workforce to be more productive, but since the same trends were seen for the control group, economic conditions also affected the agricultural workforce. The policy implications of this are that farmers discriminate against younger farm workers, which adds to the increasing youth unemployment problem in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Enactment {{of federal}} farm {{commodity}} legisla-tion {{has been an}} issue which has greatly concerned agricultural economists. This interest concerns both the impact of government policy on the production and distribution of agricultural com-modities and actual and potential changes in program structure and benefit levels which change the policy constraints in the agricultural economy. Structural changes in U. S. political processes-reduction in farm population {{and the emergence of}} two party competition in rural areas-have been extensively related to the ongoing evolution of agricultural policy. However, most of this litera-ture lacks conceptual and, particularly, empirical content. Significant exceptions concern single commodities which abstracts from the notable feature of multi-commodity farm legislation [Field, Rausser and Freebairn]. This paper reports on a preliminary analysis of the factors affecting support for <b>agricultural</b> <b>legislation</b> in Congress. The theory of public choice is ultilized as a conceptual framework for an analysis of the Agriculture Act Amendments in 1975 which were designed to raise target prices and support levels for a number of com-modities.
