5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther <b>away</b> <b>than</b> the moon.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther <b>away</b> <b>than</b> when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator, and 87% forms no farther <b>away</b> <b>than</b> 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator, where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of {{significant amounts of}} dust around the star implies a young age {{of the system and}} led to debate about whether it had joined the main sequence or was still a pre–main sequence star However, when the star's distance was measured by Hipparcos it was revealed that Beta Pictoris was located further <b>away</b> <b>than</b> previously thought and hence was more luminous than originally believed. Once the Hipparcos results were taken into account, it was found that Beta Pictoris was located close to the zero age main sequence and was not a pre–main sequence star after all. Analysis of Beta Pictoris and other stars within the Beta Pictoris moving group suggested that they are around 12 million years old. However more recent studies indicate that the age is roughly double this at 20 to 26 million years old.|$|E
5|$|York {{occupied}} a play-off {{position for the}} majority of the season, briefly rising as high as first place during the first month of the season while never dropping below 14th. For the third time in the space of six seasons, York had a better record <b>away</b> <b>than</b> at home in the league. The team won 12 matches, drew eight and lost three away, compared to winning 11, drawing six and losing six at home. Ingham, McLaughlin and Meredith recorded the highest number of appearances during the season, each appearing in 55 of York's 58 matches. Blair was top scorer in all competitions with 20 goals, followed by Walker, whose 18 goals made him York's leading league scorer. Three other players, Chambers, McLaughlin and Reed, reached double figures.|$|E
5|$|York were {{in lower}} midtable {{for most of}} the season, and rose as high as 11th in the table during September 2014 and dropped to 23rd during October and February 2015. The team had the second lowest number of {{victories}} in the League Two season with 11; only the two relegated teams, Cheltenham and Tranmere, recorded fewer wins with nine each. For the fourth time in nine seasons, York achieved a better record <b>away</b> <b>than</b> at home in the league. The team won six matches, drew nine and lost eight away, compared to winning five, drawing 10 and losing eight at home. Lowe made the highest number of appearances during the season, appearing in 49 of York's 50 matches. Hyde was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with nine league goals and 10 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Fletcher with seven goals.|$|E

25|$|If the Earth's Sun {{could be}} {{observed}} from α Centauri, the closest star to the Solar System, {{it would be}} visible in Cassiopeia as a yellow-white 0.5 magnitude star, far brighter {{than any of the}} other stars of the constellation. The famous W of Cassiopeia would be unchanged because its stars are much further <b>away</b> <b>than</b> α Centauri, but the Sun would appear as an addition at the leftmost end, closest to ε Cas, creating a zig-zag pattern.|$|E

25|$|Looking {{beyond the}} Solar System, there {{are up to}} several hundred billion {{potential}} stars with possible colonization targets. The main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars: roughly a hundred thousand times further <b>away</b> <b>than</b> the planets in the Solar System. This means that some combination of very high speed (some percentage {{of the speed of}} light), or travel times lasting centuries or millennia, would be required. These speeds are far beyond what current spacecraft propulsion systems can provide.|$|E

However, Orion's brightest stars all lie at a large distance from the Earth on an astronomical scale—much farther <b>away</b> <b>than</b> Sirius, for example. Orion will still be recognizable long after most of the other constellations—composed of relatively nearby stars—have distorted into new configurations, {{with the exception of a}} few of its stars eventually exploding as supernovae, for example Betelgeuse, which is predicted to explode sometime in the next million years.|$|E
25|$|NASA has {{described}} JWST as the scientific {{successor to the}} Hubble Space Telescope, but not a replacement, because the capabilities are not identical. JWST will {{have the ability to}} see high-redshift objects, typically both older and farther <b>away</b> <b>than</b> previous instruments could assess. The result was to extend the life of Hubble until JWST, as the next generation telescope, could go online. This led to a radically altered design for JWST to obtain images deeper into the infrared than Hubble, and beyond the capabilities of the Infrared Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope.|$|E
25|$|The {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} invasion was Ferdinand's double-crossing of Napoleon. Wanting to keep things quiet in southern Italy, Napoleon and Ferdinand signed a convention that specified that the French would evacuate Apulia. In return, the Kingdom of Naples would stay neutral in the impending War of the Third Coalition. No sooner had the French occupying force marched <b>away</b> <b>than</b> Ferdinand admitted British and Russian armies into his kingdom. In December 1805, Napoleon's armies crushed the armies of Austria and Russia. When the Russian force in Naples was recalled, the British expedition also withdrew, leaving Ferdinand's kingdom exposed to French retribution.|$|E

25|$|Although Gardermoen {{is located}} further <b>away</b> <b>than</b> Hurum, the large degree of new, {{high-speed}} track {{allowed for a}} travel time of twenty minutes. The longer distance also gives longer driving time for cars, which resulted in estimated higher market share for the train. The Gardermoen alternative also allowed for the Intercity and long-haul trains on the Dovre Line {{to stop at the}} airport. While Hurum would give a larger portion of the population a shorter drive to the airport, the construction of the Gardermoen Line would conversely give a 15-minute-faster travel time than a train to Hurum from downtown Oslo.|$|E
25|$|N gauge {{track and}} {{components}} {{are also used}} with larger scales, in particular H0e and 00-9 scale for modelling narrow gauge railways. N scale models on Z scale track are used to model metre gauge (Nn3). A small amount of 2' industrial narrow gauge modelling in N scale using custom track is done, but suppliers of parts are few. Nn18 layouts use T scale track and mechanisms to represent minimum gauge railways. N scale trains and structures are often used on HO or larger layouts to create forced perspective, or the illusion that an object is further <b>away</b> <b>than</b> it actually is.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, the Battle Creek team {{became the}} Muskegon Lassies, {{and by the}} end of the season, it too, folded. Faut came back for her final year in the AAGPBL. Her team was {{weakened}} considerably by the player losses at the end of the previous season, and Faut was worn down from all the dissension. South Bend would finish the season second from last, compiling a 45–65 record. In spite of everything that had gone wrong, Faut still turned to post a 17–11 record and produced a league-best 1.51 ERA in 29 games, though league offensive levels were increasing. By her final season, only overhand pitching was allowed, the ball was a lively cork-centered ten inches, and the basepaths were seventy-five feet. More importantly from a pitching perspective, the pitching rubber was moved back to fifty-six feet, thirteen feet farther <b>away</b> <b>than</b> in 1946. At the same time, fences were moved in to allow for more home runs.|$|E
