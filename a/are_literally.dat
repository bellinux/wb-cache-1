5000|$|Twenty (...) {{is used as}} a {{base number}} in the French {{language}} names of numbers from 70 to 99, except in the French of Belgium, Switzerland, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the Aosta Valley and the Channel Islands. For example, , the French word for [...] "80", literally means [...] "four-twenties"; soixante-dix, the word for [...] "70", <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "sixty-ten"; [...] ("75") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "sixty-fifteen"; quatre-vingt-sept ("87") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-seven"; quatre-vingt-dix ("90") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-ten"; and quatre-vingt-seize ("96") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-sixteen". However, in the French of Belgium, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the Aosta Valley, and the Channel Islands, the numbers 70 and 90 generally have the names septante and nonante. Therefore, the year 1996 is [...] "mille neuf cent quatre-vingt-seize" [...] in Parisian French, but it is [...] "mille neuf cent nonante-six" [...] in Belgian French. In Switzerland, [...] "80" [...] can be quatre-vingts (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or huitante (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg); in the past octante was also in use.|$|R

25|$|Volver (2006), {{a mixture}} of comedy, family drama and ghost story, is set in part in La Mancha (the director's native region) and follows the story of three generations {{of women in the}} same family who survive wind, fire, and even death. The film is an ode to female resilience, where men <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> disposable. Volver stars Penélope Cruz, Lola Dueñas, Blanca Portillo, Yohana Cobo and Chus Lampreave in {{addition}} to reunited the director with Carmen Maura, who had appeared in several of his early films.|$|E

Such units could, in theory, be replaced by general units of the same dimension, for example the barrel (42 US gallons, 34.97 imperial gallons or 159.0 litres) used {{in the oil industry}} has the dimension of volume and could be replaced by the gallon, cubic metre or litre.|$|E

25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> {{hundreds}} of different divinatory techniques in the world. However, Western occult practice mostly includes {{the use of}} astrology (calculating the influence of heavenly bodies), bibliomancy (reading random passages from a book, such as Liber Legis or the I Ching), tarot (a deck of 78 cards, each with symbolic meaning, usually {{laid out in a}} meaningful pattern), and geomancy (a method of making random marks on paper or in earth that results in a combination of sixteen patterns).|$|E
25|$|Evolution has a {{different}} meaning {{in terms of the}} lizards. Leslie and Sarah <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> evolving. They were creatures that lived in the sea but apparently developed beyond their species. They were compelled to move to the land, though they do not really understand why. Though Leslie and Sarah are somewhat fearful of the change, they do accept the help that Nancy, enthusiastically, and Charlie, reluctantly, give them. At the end of the play, rather than go back into the sea where they might feel safer, they remain on land.|$|E
25|$|Clinicians have a {{wide range}} of {{individual}} interventions to draw from, often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a psychoanalyst might encourage free association, while a psychologist trained in Gestalt techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.|$|E

25|$|After the {{bachelor}} courses, students {{are allowed to}} enter the 'master in medicine' courses, which consist of 4 years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first 2 master years are very theoretical and teach the students in human pathology, diseases, pharmacology. The third year is a year full of internships {{in a wide range}} of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre-specialization' year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> 'basic doctors' (basisartsen) who have yet to decide on a specialty.|$|E
25|$|Although phylogenetic trees {{produced}} {{on the basis}} of sequenced genes or genomic data in different species can provide evolutionary insight, they have important limitations. Most importantly, they do not necessarily accurately represent the evolutionary history of the included taxa. In fact, they <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> scientific hypotheses, subject to falsification by further study (e.g., gathering of additional data, analyzing the existing data with improved methods). The data on which they are based is noisy; the analysis can be confounded by genetic recombination, horizontal gene transfer, hybridisation between species that were not nearest neighbors on the tree before hybridisation takes place, convergent evolution, and conserved sequences.|$|E
25|$|Compact and fast-rotating astronomical objects (white dwarfs, {{neutron stars}} and black holes) have {{extremely}} strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field {{of a newly}} born fast-spinning neutron star is so strong (up to 108 teslas) that it electromagnetically radiates enough energy to quickly (in a matter of few million years) damp down the star rotation by 100 to 1000 times. Matter falling on a neutron star also has to follow the magnetic field lines, resulting in two hot spots on the surface where it can reach and collide with the star's surface. These spots <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> a few feet (about a metre) across but tremendously bright. Their periodic eclipsing during star rotation is hypothesized {{to be the source}} of pulsating radiation (see pulsars).|$|E

25|$|The modal {{concepts}} in Persian folk music are directly linked {{with that of}} the classical music. However, improvisation plays a minor role as folk tunes are characterized by relatively clear-cut melodic and rhythmic properties. The function of each folk melody determines its mood. The varying aesthetic requirements of wedding songs, lullabies, love songs, harvest songs, dance pieces, etc., are met with transparent and appropriate simplicity. The majority of the classical instruments are too elaborate and difficult for the folk musicians. Instead, there <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> dozens of musical instruments of various sorts found among the rural people. In fact, each region of the country can boast instruments peculiar to itself. Three types of instruments, however, are common to all parts of the country. They are, a kind of shawm called Surnay (or Sorna ~ Zorna), the various types of Ney (flute), and the Dohol, a doubleheader drum.|$|E
25|$|Mormonism {{teaches that}} the purpose of life on Earth is to gain {{knowledge}} and experience and to have joy. Mormons believe that humans <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow. The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise, rather the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil. Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world, so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.|$|E
500|$|The episode's musical {{performances}} received generally good marks, {{though some}} more than others. Canning {{described it as}} [...] "an average song selection", and wrote: [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> thousands of holiday songs to choose from and the ones sung in 'A Very Glee Christmas' could have used some more of Santa's magic." [...] Some reviewers commented on the songs themselves rather than the performances, including Wham!'s [...] "Last Christmas", which Canning described as [...] "a terrible song in any season", while Jen Harper of BuddyTV stated that she loved Wham! ...|$|E

[...] Throughout the show, the tribe chants popular protest slogans like [...] "What do we want? Peace! – When do we want it? Now!" [...] and [...] "Do not enter the induction center". [...] The upbeat song, [...] "Let the Sun Shine In", is a call to action, to reject the darkness of war and change {{the world for the}} better.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{time goes}} through a pattern {{throughout}} its entirety of one 4:4 bar, one 2:4 bar and then two 4:4 bars. In writing [...] "Lost and Running", the band was influenced by bands that they have cited as being influences on their music from early on, including David Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Neil Young. In an interview with The Courier Mail, Fanning noted that the song was a very simple one, stating [...] "the actual style of song is quite different as it has very little movement. There <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> only three chords in the song."" [...] He notes that the song's premise is reflective on how the group approached the recording of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, in that they were unsure of {{what they wanted to}} do with the album.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{audio and}} diverse vocal track were widely praised. Critics {{credited}} the voice acting for its different accents and styles, with [...] "cleverly lewd" [...] scripts and [...] "dead-on" [...] movie spoofs. Most reviewers agreed the jokes were clever and funny. According to IGN, [...] "Is {{it over the}} top? Yes. Is it lowbrow? Yes. And yet, it's also very well delivered and smart too -- and it's funny. Really, honestly, funny". Game Revolution noted that the game [...] "has its crosshairs directly aimed at the college audience" [...] and that [...] "it works perfectly for the peeps who've grown up with Mario and are now looking for someone less dorky". The soundtrack was praised for its different arrangements of specific songs that gradually change as players move from one area to the next, and for its rich and creative instrumentation. Reviewers also highlighted the number of sound effects, with GameSpot noting that [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> dozens of sounds just for Conker's footsteps".|$|E
