5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; <b>angelfish</b> and zebras are striped. These {{patterns}} have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling â€” for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E

40|$|The use of biting {{to obtain}} food items {{attached}} to the substratum is an ecologically widespread and important mode of feeding among aquatic vertebrates, which rarely has been studied. We did the first evolutionary analyses of morphology and motion kinematics of the feeding apparatus in Indo-Pacific members of an iconic family of biters, the marine <b>angelfishes</b> (f. Pomacanthidae). We found clear interspecific differences in gut morphology that clearly reflected {{a wide range of}} trophic niches. In contrast, feeding apparatus morphology appeared to be conserved. A few unusual structural innovations enabled <b>angelfishes</b> to protrude their jaws, close them in the protruded state, and tear food items from the substratum at a high velocity. Only one clade, the speciose pygmy <b>angelfishes,</b> showed functional departure from the generalized and cladedefining grab-and-tearing feeding pattern. By comparing the feeding kinematics of <b>angelfishes</b> with wrasses and parrotfishes (f. Labridae) we showed that grab-and-tearing is based on low kinematics disparity. Regardless of its restricted disparity, the grab-and-tearing feeding apparatus has enabled <b>angelfishes</b> to negotiate ecological thresholds: Given their widely different body sizes, <b>angelfishes</b> can access many structurally complex benthic surfaces that other biters likely are unable to exploit. From these surfaces, <b>angelfishes</b> can dislodge sturdy food items from their tough attachments. <b>Angelfishes</b> thus provide an intriguing example of a successful group that appears to have evolved considerable trophic diversity based on an unusual yet conserved feeding apparatus configuration that is characterized by limited functiona...|$|R

25|$|Manson's musical {{career began}} in her teens {{when she was}} {{approached}} to perform backing vocals and keyboards for the band Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie. Quickly she developed into a prominent {{member of the group}} and developed a formidable stage presence. Manson was approached by her band's record label with the idea of launching her as a solo artist, and recorded an album with her band under the <b>Angelfish</b> name. After seeing Manson in an <b>Angelfish</b> video broadcast only once on MTV's 120 Minutes, Garbage invited Manson to audition and record vocals on a couple of unfinished songs; she eventually co-wrote and co-produced an entire album with the band. The resulting self-titled debut, Garbage, was a critically acclaimed, worldwide hit, and was followed by four studio albums, including the multiple Grammy Award-nominated Version 2.0, and a greatest hits album. Garbage toured worldwide and sold 12 million records over ten years.|$|E

25|$|Numerous cichlid {{species have}} been {{selectively}} bred to develop ornamental aquarium strains. The most intensive programs have involved <b>angelfish</b> and discus, and many mutations that affect both coloration and fins are known. Other cichlids have been bred for albino, leucistic, and xanthistic pigment mutations, including oscars, convict cichlid and Pelvicachromis pulcher. Both dominant and recessive pigment mutations have been observed.

25|$|Many cichlids, {{particularly}} tilapia, {{are important}} food fishes, {{while others are}} valued game fish (e.g. Cichla species). The family also includes many familiar aquarium fish, including the <b>angelfish,</b> oscars, and discus. Cichlids have {{the largest number of}} endangered species among vertebrate families, most in the haplochromine group. Cichlids are particularly well known for having evolved rapidly into a large number of closely related but morphologically diverse species within large lakes, particularly Tanganyika, Victoria, Malawi, and Edward. Their diversity in the African Great Lakes is important for the study of speciation in evolution. Many cichlids introduced into waters outside of their natural range have become nuisances.|$|E
25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, <b>angelfish,</b> gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E

500|$|After Marker saw Manson's group <b>Angelfish</b> on 120 Minutes, {{the band}} {{invited her to}} Vig and Marker's Smart Studios to sing {{on a couple of}} songs, but after a [...] "dreadful" [...] first audition, she {{returned}} to <b>Angelfish.</b> Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second time, where she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer", [...] "Vow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl". Working on the lyrics, [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] became an [...] "anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants". Later she added, [...] " [...] really about squandering potential, [...] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive". Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the most of your potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach {{to a lot of people}} we know", both male and female, and that [...] "we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious." ...|$|E

40|$|On coral reefs, biting teleosts form a major {{component}} of reef fish assemblages. Nevertheless, they have been largely overlooked in functional research, while their ramsuction feeding counterparts have received considerable attention over the past few decades. This thesis therefore examines the functional basis of biting in coral reef fishes, with a focus on the marine <b>angelfishes</b> (f. Pomacanthidae), and other deep-bodied squamipinnid fishes. To evaluate the magnitude and role of functional specialisation associated with prey-capture in <b>angelfishes,</b> a basal species, Pomacanthus semicirculatus (Cuvier, 1931) was selected as a model taxon for comprehensive functional analysis. The feeding apparatus of Pomacanthus contains two biomechanical mechanisms of particular interest: an intramandibular joint, and a suspensorial linkage with two novel points of flexion. Preycapture kinematics were quantified using motion analysis of high-speed video, generating performance profiles to illustrate timing of onset, duration and magnitude of movement in the novel mechanisms. Mandible depression and suspensorial rotation coincide during jaw protrusion, and augment mandible protrusion to increase head length typically by 30...|$|R
500|$|The {{angelshark}} {{was originally}} {{described by the}} Swedish natural historian Carl Linnaeus, known as the [...] "father of taxonomy", in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae as Squalus squatina. He did not designate a type specimen. The word squatina is the angelshark's name in Latin, derived from the word for skate; it was made the genus name for all angel sharks by the French zoologist AndrÃ© DumÃ©ril in 1806. Other common names used for this species include angel, angel fiddle fish, angel puffy fish, angel ray, <b>angelfish,</b> escat jueu, fiddle fish, monk, and monkfish. Stelbrink and colleagues (2010) conducted a phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA, {{and found that the}} sister species of the angelshark is the sawback angelshark (S. aculeata).
