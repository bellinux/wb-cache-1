5|$|In Episode One players {{make their}} way through a linear series of levels and {{encounter}} various enemies and allies. The gameplay is broken up between combat-oriented challenges and physics-based puzzles. Episode One integrates tutorial-like tasks into the story to familiarize the player with new gameplay mechanics without breaking immersion. A head-up display appears on the screen to display the character's health, energy, <b>and</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Throughout the course of the game, the player accesses new weapons <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> that are used to defend the character from enemy forces. Unlike in Half-Life 2, where Gordon's initial weapon is the crowbar, Gordon first acquires the Gravity Gun, which plays {{a crucial role in the}} game by allowing the player to use physics to manipulate objects at a distance in both combat and puzzle-solving scenarios.|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must explore a galaxy that is {{composed}} of 15 nonlinear worlds. Each world {{is composed of}} a series of stages with areas interconnected by different types of doors. Most doors open automatically, but some require a special action to be unlocked. For example, some doors require the player to defeat all the enemies in the area, while others may require a specific key. Although the player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies, health-recovery gems <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> crates can be collected throughout the world to increase the player's resources.

5|$|A {{recession}} in the 1930s was halted by increasing international tensions as World War II loomed; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> for the war effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, {{now known as the}} Sheffield Blitz.

In all, Yancey carried almost a quarter of those fleeing the Dominican Republic. She returned to Norfolk soon thereafter, and resumed her role of training and cruising off the eastern seaboard and into the Caribbean basin. On 1 January 1969, Yancey was redesignated as LKA-93.|$|E
5|$|Amarillo {{was hit by}} the Dust Bowl {{and entered}} an {{economic}} depression. U.S. Routes 60, 87, 287, and 66 merged at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and curio shops. World War II led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs <b>and</b> <b>ammunition.</b> After {{the end of the}} war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle {{spanning}} the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E

5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|As a formality, {{a person}} must state a justifiable reason for {{purchasing}} a B category firearm, which include collecting, sporting, hunting or cultural activity, conducting business with firearms <b>and</b> <b>ammunition,</b> providing security, exercise of profession and self-defense.

5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E
