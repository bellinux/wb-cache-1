5|$|After modern Romania {{was formed}} in 1859 through the union of Wallachia and the rump of Moldavia, the {{administrative}} division was modernized using the French <b>administrative</b> <b>system</b> as a model, with județ as the basic administrative unit. Aside from the 1950–1968 period, this system has remained in place until today. Since 1864, for each județ there exists a prefect, a subordinate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and representative of the government inside the county; {{he is also the}} head of local administration for areas not delegated to local authorities. Until 1948, each județ was further divided into several plăși, each administered by a pretor.|$|E
5|$|By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan, the Principality of Wales was {{incorporated}} into England and was given an <b>administrative</b> <b>system</b> like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs. English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes. After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on a full-scale project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside them, and many were protected by extensive walls.|$|E

This was both a practical and a symbolic action, demonstrating Norman power over {{one of the most important}} possessions of the Welsh princes.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the <b>administrative</b> justice <b>system,</b> {{which represents}} one of the key control mechanisms of the public administration in The Czech Republic. The aim of this thesis is to compare the <b>administrative</b> justice <b>system</b> of The Czech Republic with selected European models of the <b>administrative</b> justice <b>system</b> such as the French and German justice systems. The result of this comparison highlights the differences in justice systems and considers the possibility of implementing these models in The Czech legal <b>system.</b> The <b>administrative</b> justice <b>system</b> in The Czech Republic has been developing since 2003, when The Act N. 150 / 2002 came into effect. The operating <b>administrative</b> justice <b>system</b> in The Czech Republic is characterized by the following criteria: statutory framework, power and jurisdiction of the administrative court, organization of the <b>administrative</b> justice <b>system</b> and the course of the judicial administrative proceedings. The following chapters discuss the French and German models of the <b>administrative</b> justice <b>system</b> and analyze the similarities with the Czech system.

40|$|Industrial {{companies}} face {{a situation}} where information systems are increasingly integrated. The old distinction between <b>administrative</b> <b>systems</b> and operation support systems is slowly vanishing. A growing problem is how information and related technology should be governed when systems are merged. This paper uses the principles of IT governance to evaluate the governance maturity of <b>administrative</b> <b>systems</b> and operation support systems at an electric utility. The COBIT maturity model is {{used to assess the}} performance of ten IT processes. Results show that <b>administrative</b> <b>systems</b> are better documented and formalized, while operation support systems’ processes for information security, availability, and change management are generally more mature. Knowledge of these differences in IT governance maturity can serve as valuable support for decision-making regarding the integration of information systems and organizations. ...|$|R

A Subahdar (provincial viceroy or governor), also called a Nizam was in-charge of the Nizamat. There was a chain of subordinate officials under the Nizams on the executive side and under Diwans on the revenue and judicial side.|$|E
5|$|Weber listed several {{preconditions}} for {{the emergence}} of the bureaucracy: The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a monetary economy– these resulted in a need for a more efficient <b>administrative</b> <b>system.</b> Development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.|$|E

5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even {{on the verge of}} collapse. After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient <b>administrative</b> <b>system</b> that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right, without the support of the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E
5|$|Departing {{from the}} main central <b>administrative</b> <b>system</b> {{generally}} known as the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, which was instituted by various dynasties since late Han (202 BCE – 220 CE), the Ming administration had only one Department, the Secretariat, that controlled the Six Ministries. Following {{the execution of the}} Chancellor Hu Weiyong in 1380, the Hongwu Emperor abolished the Secretariat, the Censorate, and the Chief Military Commission and personally took charge of the Six Ministries and the regional Five Military Commissions. Thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers. The Grand Secretariat, at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork, was instituted, but without employing grand counselors, or chancellors.|$|E
5|$|Pharnavaz had {{introduced}} a military-administrative organization {{based on a}} network of regional governors or eristavi. The insignia of the eristavi, received from the king, constituted a sceptre, a special signet ring, belt and armament.

The kingdom had one spaspet who was under the direct control of the royal power based in Inner Kartli. Eristavates mimicked aspects of Achaemenid satrapies and Seleucid strategoi. The major motive of later historian of the chronicles was to convince posterity that the basic political structure of Kartli {{was created by the}} very first Georgian monarch in the wake of Wars of Alexander the Great; was of Achaemenid <b>administrative</b> <b>system</b> and had remained stable throughout Hellenistic, Parthian and Sasanian times.

However, culture and civil service structure and function of national <b>administrative</b> <b>systems</b> and styles vary. Responsiveness {{is not only a}} matter of formal and institutional reform. It is conditioned by a variety of informal and extrainstitutional processes relative to state-society and politics-administration relationship and interaction.

40|$|In {{connection}} {{to the process of}} the public administration reforms which take place in most of the European countries and also in {{connection to}} the "European administrative space", the issues of studying and mutually comparing <b>administrative</b> <b>systems</b> of various European countries, especially EU member countries, become more and more topical. They focus not only on purposeful and effective mutual use of experience in <b>administrative</b> <b>systems</b> improvements, but also on improving orientation in the already mentioned "European administrative space". There is nodue attention devoted so far to the systematic study of <b>administrative</b> <b>systems</b> of (other) European countries. Most of the publications which focus on this issue (mostly study books, study materials, or occassional articles) describe it only on a "descriptive" (mostly simplified) level. The cause of this lies in (apart from time and financial demands) significant complexity of the given issue, in terminological complications and in difficulties of getting adequate (essentially necessary) factography and in practically non-existing adequate methodology. Legal comparative jurisprudence and comparative studies of political systems might inspire onewhen developing the methodology. Even under the current situation, it would be efficient {{to pay more attention to}} the comparative studies of the structure of <b>administrative</b> <b>systems,</b> or to some selected areas of the public administration, for example to personnel systems in the public administration, financing public administration or administration of the public property.

He also negotiated a peace with Galicia–Volhynia, and married his daughter to Svarn, the son of Daniel of Galicia, who would later become Grand Duke of Lithuania. Lithuanian relationships with western Europe and the Holy See were reinforced. In 1255, Mindaugas received permission from Pope Alexander IV to crown his son as King of Lithuania. A noble court, an <b>administrative</b> <b>system,</b> and a diplomatic service were initiated. Silver long coins, an index of statehood, were issued.

5|$|The {{years that}} {{followed}} witnessed cordial relations between Mysore and the British until things began to sour in the 1820s.

Cole, the incumbent Resident of Mysore, the Nagar rebellion (a civil insurrection) which broke out {{towards the end of the}} decade changed things considerably. In 1831, close on the heels of the insurrection and citing mal-administration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Sir Mark Cubbon, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful <b>administrative</b> <b>system</b> which left Mysore a well-developed state.|$|E
5|$|European {{influence}} in Mangalore {{can be traced}} back to 1498, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at St Mary's Islands near Mangalore. In the 16th century, the Portuguese came to acquire substantial commercial interests in Canara. Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529), the then ruler of the Vijaynagara empire maintained friendly relations with the Portuguese. The Portuguese trade was gradually gathering momentum and they were striving to destroy the Arab and Moplah trade along the coast. In 1524, when Vasco da Gama heard that the Muslim merchants of Calicut had agents at Mangalore and Basrur, he ordered the rivers to be blockaded. In 1526, the Portuguese under the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio took possession of Mangalore. The coastal trade passed out of Muslim hands into Portuguese hands. In 1550, the Vijayanagara ruler, Sadashiva Raya, entrusted the work of administering the coastal region of Canara to Sadashiv Nayaka of Keladi. By 1554, he was able to establish political authority over South Canara. The disintegration of the Vijaynagara Empire in 1565 gave the rulers of Keladi greater power in dealing with the coastal Canara region. They continued the Vijayanagara <b>administrative</b> <b>system.</b> The two provinces of Mangalore and Barkur continued to exist. The governor of Mangalore also acted as the governor of the Keladi army in his province. In 1695, the town was torched by Arabs in retaliation to Portuguese restrictions on Arab trade.|$|E
