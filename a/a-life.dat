5000|$|Alan H Goldstein has {{proposed}} that, because nanobiotechnology {{is in the}} process of creating real animal-materials, speculative use of this term should be discouraged and its application become purely phenomenological. Based on the Animat Test (contained in the reference [...] "I, Nanobot.") any nonbiological material or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life form is, de facto, an Animat. Goldsteins basic premise is that in the age of nanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular engineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum level of intelligence such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive phenomena. Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between the fields of nanobiotechnology and <b>A-life</b> based on profound differences in scientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology (jargon) these two fields have produced. Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular engineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are generally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building molecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. neuroelectronic splices. <b>A-Life</b> researchers mainly take a systems-level approach. The enormous transformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create Animats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would not fit into most standard <b>A-Life</b> paradigms. As a result, Goldstein argues, the first Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific community.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the section}} titled [...] "Of Dreams and Beasts", Turkle focuses {{on how the}} {{boundary}} between humans and machines has evolved to become extremely vague. She pays great attention {{to the development of}} artificial intelligence and artificial life, and notes people's constant struggle to make a distinction between humans and machines. When AI first came about, there were two different approaches: emergent and rule-driven. Originally, rule-driven AI was more practical. People at the time never even considered humans to be anything like machines. Later, computers became more widely used and technology allowed emergent AI to come about. People said machines couldn't be like people because humans had feelings and were spontaneous. Emergent AI was similar to being spontaneous so the boundary had to be redrawn. As technology improved machines began to act more and more humanoid. People's opinions of computers had evolved along with the technology. Turkle observed that where once people refused to even think of machines as a very basic human mind, now they referred to their own mind as machine-like at times. She also noticed that people now began to talk to machines freely without much embarrassment. The boundary between humans and machines had been broken down to one point, humans are alive where machines are not. With the development of <b>a-life,</b> that weak boundary is becoming weaker. Turkle questions how we define life and simulated life.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{complement}} {{to the recent}} wealth of literature suggesting a strong philosophical relationship between artificial life (<b>A-Life)</b> and artificial intelligence (AI).

Even those (mostly in the Continental tradition, including some with a following in <b>A-Life)</b> who have insisted on the linkage have stated it rather than justified it. If an evolutionary account of intentionality is acceptable, then perhaps biological life 'makes room' for mind.

Implications of these characteristics for the relevance of A-Life’s virtual ecosystem models to Ecology are discussed. We argue a position that the inclusion of low-level representations of energetics, matter and evolution, in concert with pattern-oriented modelling techniques from Ecology for model validation, will improve the relevance of <b>A-Life</b> models to Ecology. We also suggest two methods that may allows us to meet this goal: artificial evolution can be employed as a mechanism for automating pattern-oriented ecological modelling from the level of individual species up to that of the ecosystem, or it may be employed to explore general principles of ecosystem behaviour over evolutionary time periods...|$|E
