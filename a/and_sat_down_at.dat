2500|$|At lunchtime, the invited {{students}} {{sat together}} at one table. Fryberg then entered the school cafeteria <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a different table. At 10:39a.m., according to eyewitnesses, he stood up, approached {{the table where}} his friends were sitting, and had a verbal altercation with them. He then pulled out a [...]40-caliber Beretta Px4 Storm handgun and fired at least eight shots, shooting several students in a [...] "calm, methodical way". During the shooting, Fryberg was described by a witness as having [...] "a blank stare" [...] and [...] "staring at the victims as he shot them". He also appeared to be targeting only the table where his friends were sitting. At {{the time of the}} shooting, seven students were seated at that table.|$|E
2500|$|The Grotto {{was first}} {{established}} on St. Mary's Mountain in 1805 by the university's founder, Father John DuBois. According to legend, Father DuBois {{was attracted to}} a light on the mountain and found a blessed spot <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the foot of a}} large oak tree beside a stream. He made a cross of twigs and fixed it to the tree to be the symbol of the holy work he was undertaking. This was the original Grotto. Father Simon Bruté was an early steward of the Grotto. He created pathways throughout the grounds and attached crosses to the trees that now line the Stations of the Cross along the entrance. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton attended Sunday Mass at the Grotto chapel. The 1911 book The Story of the Mountain tells how Mother Seton would sit on her favorite rock at the Grotto and [...] "invoke the divine blessing by reciting the Canticle of the Three Children, and none that heard her could ever forget the tones of that voice and the fervor of that heart, which {{in the midst of the}} wild scenery of nature called upon all creatures to bless and magnify their Creator." [...] Her rosary walks around the Grotto were re-enacted in 2005 to celebrate its 200th anniversary.|$|E

60|$|He peered up {{over the}} office blind, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> once. In a moment his cigar was behind the grate, and his {{expression}} completely changed.|$|R
6000|$|Guest's eyes brightened, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once <b>and</b> {{studied it}} with passion. [...] "No sir," [...] he said: [...] "not mad; {{but it is}} an odd hand." ...|$|R

60|$|Archie felt stimulated. Not {{even the}} advent of his father-in-law, who came {{in a few moments}} later <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the other end of the}} room, could depress his spirits.|$|E
60|$|Reaching his rooms, {{he threw}} off his tunic, to whose stiff {{regularity}} {{he still had}} a rooted aversion; and, pulling out a pipe, filled it <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his window.|$|E
60|$|More serious of face, {{and more}} slow of action, {{than he had}} been, the boy {{completed}} his dressing, and came <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the little breakfast-table, with his eyes amazedly directed to her face.|$|E

60|$|The {{first step}} would be to get Jimmy Farquhar and his companions out of the way—to buy them off if possible; if not—A hard look crept into Clay’s eyes, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once <b>and</b> wrote a short note to Jimmy.|$|R
60|$|Her hat {{was in her}} way, and Philip took it off for her. He {{placed her}} head more comfortably in the chair, {{and then he went}} <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table and looked at her.|$|E
60|$|Arnold spoke {{a word or}} two of introduction. Sabatini {{pulled up}} a chair <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once by the girl's side. He had seen the stick and seemed to have taken in the whole {{situation}} in a moment.|$|E
60|$|At half-past ten {{he lit a}} cigarette, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his desk. He wrote quite {{steadily}} for an hour; {{at the end of}} {{that time}} he pinned together the result of his work, and wrote a hasty note.|$|E
60|$|She nodded a sweet {{acceptance}} of my invitation, <b>and</b> together we <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the little {{table of the}} officers' mess.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the first}} time that ever George had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on equal terms at any white man's table; <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>at</b> first, with some {{constraint}} and awkwardness; but they all exhaled and went off like fog, in the genial morning rays of this simple, overflowing kindness.|$|R
