5|$|Although {{an earlier}} {{organization}} included a divisional anti-tank battalion (two companies of 37mm guns and one company of 75 mm guns), in December 1941 these AT battalions {{were removed from}} the divisional structure and reorganized as independent tank destroyer battalions; their towed guns were replaced with self-propelled ones as soon <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> became available.|$|E
5|$|Before {{this the}} church had {{maintained}} {{a distance from the}} Armenian revolutionary groups <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> saw the former as a conservative institution. It was Khrimian who welcomed revolutionary activism, especially by the Dashnaktsutyun, the most influential Armenian party. According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, to a certain degree, the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its vision of the Armenian nation.|$|E
5|$|In 1444, further {{expanding}} his wealth, {{he bought}} the reversion of Sir Thomas Erdington's estates, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> was dying with no heir.

5|$|In 1836, Tucker {{completed}} his manuscript {{of a comprehensive}} biography, The Life of Thomas Jefferson, Third President of the United States.

5|$|In the {{qualification}} {{round at}} the World Championships, held in windy {{conditions on the}} Helsinki Olympic Stadium, only Pitkämäki, Makarov and Thorkildsen managed to beat the automatic qualification mark of 81metres. Rain supplemented the wind the following day, constituting difficult weather conditions for the javelin final. Thorkildsen, in the lead after three rounds with 86.18metres, eventually finished in silver medal position behind Andrus Värnik of Estonia <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> threw 87.17metres in the fourth round.|$|E
5|$|Later {{morphological}} studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 {{analysis of}} cranial measurements {{found that the}} quagga was as different from the plains zebra <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species.|$|E

5|$|Yorks {{design was}} based on the earlier County classes but was {{intended}} to be smaller and cheaper, although better armoured.

In addition, York also had a very tall bridge designed to clear the aircraft catapult originally planned to be carried on the superfiring ('B') gun turret forward.|$|E
5|$|According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin, a {{participant}} in the Fourth Crusade and author of De la Conquête de Constantinople, {{at the time of the}} fall of Constantinople to the forces of the Fourth Crusade, Michael was present in the city, having possibly returned from exile in the period after the deposition of Alexios III and the restoration of Isaac II and his son Alexios IV in 1203–04. Michael then entered into the service of Boniface of Montferrat, who received the Kingdom of Thessalonica and overlordship over Greece in the division of the spoils among the Crusaders, and followed Boniface west <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> went to take up his kingdom in September 1204. Villehardouin reports that Boniface trusted Michael, but the latter soon abandoned Boniface and went to Epirus, where he installed himself as the leader of the local Greeks against the Latin Crusaders.|$|E

5|$|Aldo Rico {{escaped from}} prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant {{regiment}} in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but the military was reluctant to open fire against them. Alfonsín's goal of reconciling the military with the civil population failed, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> rejected the military's complaints, and the military was focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, staged {{the attack on the}} Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.|$|E
5|$|Although {{beginning}} {{during the}} events of , the plot is a retcon to the earliest period in the Mortal Kombat series, {{the events of}} Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3 (as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> title's two updates). The storyline involves the divine protector of Earth, Raiden, attempting to change {{the aftermath of the}} events of Armageddon by contacting his past self as he faces defeat {{at the hands of the}} evil emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn. While having characters and levels rendered in three-dimensions, the gameplay distances itself from the fully 3D graphics one seen in the last four games, bearing closer resemblance to that of the 2D era of the series, using a camera that is perpendicular to the two-dimensional playing field.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fungus}} {{is one of}} the most common in Central Europe, the species was not validly {{described}} until 1968 by German mycologist Frieder Gröger. Before this, L.deterrimus was regarded as a variety of L.deliciosus (L.deliciosus var. piceus, described by Miroslav Smotlacha in 1946). After Roger Heim and A.Leclair described L.semisanguifluus in 1950, this fungus was referred to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter.</b> L.fennoscandicus was separated from L.deterrimus in 1998 by Annemieke T.

In the meantime, the 85th Battalion had completed reorganizing at Inshas Base {{and returned to}} Ismailia, where it was placed under Azmy's command once again. The 129th Sa'iqa Group retreated to Abu Suweir, north of Ismailia, to reorganize, and Heikal was also informed of his group's new area of operations, {{with the objective of}} defending the Upper Bridge, and the crucial Cairo-Ismailia Desert Road that incorporated the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa-style {{learning}} is particularly suited to Talmud study, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> is a text filled with conflicting opinions and seemingly contradictory statements on principles of Jewish law. Besides tracking the back-and-forth debates, {{a student of}} Talmud {{must be able to}} analyze each opinion and present hypotheses to reconcile it in light of the others. The chavrusa relationship gives each student a platform to clarify and explain his position to a partner; then the two go on to question, defend, convince, amend, fine-tune, and even arrive at new conclusions through rigorous intellectual collaboration.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, Holmboe was {{appointed}} a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University. Some {{claimed that he}} owed his appointment to Abel's absence, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> was travelling around in Europe at that time. Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college, from 1826 until his death, and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834. His later publications include Stereometrie (Stereometry) (1833), Plan- og sfærisk Trigonometrie (Plan and Spherical Trigonometry) (1834), and Lærebog i den høiere Mathematik (Textbook of Advanced Mathematics) (1849). Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel, including Ole Jacob Broch (born 1818).|$|E
