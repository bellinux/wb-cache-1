40|$|Most {{studies on}} women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>status</b> focus on {{status as a}} unitary {{construct}} and search for a universal explanation of the low status of women. Recognizing the inadequacies of such research the present study focuses on the multi-dimensionality of the concept and argues that {{the complexity of the}} phenomena makes it necessary to conceptualize status broadly in terms of its economic, social, and political dimensions. The contrasting performance of specific states/districts on each dimension clearly indicates that the dynamic and variable nature of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>status</b> cannot be captured by any one dimension. ^ Further, a structural approach is used to analyze the regional variations in women 2 ̆ 7 s position in India across each dimension because such a framework, stressing economic context and socio-cultural factors, reveals the complex and multilayered nature of the processes that affect women 2 ̆ 7 s position. It is observed that women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>status</b> is affected by kinship structures, development levels, and social stratification, which vary over space and time individually and in interaction with each other. It is this variation that leads to differences in women 2 ̆ 7 s position from one region of India to another. ^ The findings of the study suggest {{that it is important to}} recognize the mutual interdependence of gender relations, development levels, and social stratification without underestimating the full significance of each in Indian society. In some cases kinship patterns interact with economic development to produce major spatial variations in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>status,</b> and in others, it is the development levels and social stratification that has the greatest influence. For instance, kinship structures appear to be the most powerful factor in affecting women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> economic <b>status,</b> while the social dimension of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>status</b> is greatly affected by the varying development levels. And finally, political socialization appears to have the largest impact on women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> political <b>status.</b> This reiterates not only the independence of these dimensions but also the important role of 2 ̆ 7 place 2 ̆ 7 in the constitution of gender differences in India. ...|$|R

Rumen fluid S concentrations are preferred, but difficult to sample under practical conditions. This study aimed to evaluate salivary S concentration as estimator of <b>S</b> <b>status</b> in cattle. Saliva and rumen fluid samples were collected from dairy cows (n = 16) as well as samples of different feedstuffs offered to the animals. The N and S concentrations were determined using the Dumas technique. The average dietary N and S content were calculated as well as N: S ratio of saliva, rumen fluid and diet. Salivary S concentrations could not predict rumen fluid or dietary S concentrations (p > 0. 05). The log transformed salivary N: S ratio (x) could predict the rumen fluid N: S ratio (y) with a linear equation of y = 9. 83 (+/- 4. 59) x + 0. 39 (+/- 4. 56) (r = 0. 497, p = 0. 05), but left too much residual variation to serve as reliable predictor.

Our study analyzes {{the effect of this}} conversion on bank dividend payouts. It also examines the effect S-corporation status has on a community bank's likelihood of sell-off and measures a firm's sensitivity to tax rates based on its choice of organizational form.

40|$|The {{association}} between sexual violence and gender inequality was examined using sexual offense data from two international data sources: the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) and the International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS). Sexual violence was operationalized as reported rapes (Interpol data) and sexual offenses (ICVS data). Gender inequality was operationalized {{using a combination}} of political, economic, educational and health indicators. Predictor variables in addition to gender inequality included normative violence and social disorganization. Control variables included non-sexual violent offenses; these offenses were often strongly associated with sexual offenses. Regression analyses of cross-panel data found a non-significant positive {{association between}} gender inequality and sexual violence for the Interpol data (early and late 1990 s). A significant negative relationship was found in the ICVS data for 1992 and 1996, the two years for which all the data were available.

40|$|The {{subject was}} {{introduced}} by a review of N and S uptake and plant fractions, and concepts for diagnosing nutrient requirements. The relationship between total and alcohol insoluble plant N:S ratios ((N:S) t and (N:S) p) and yield was initially studied in pot and field experiments with oats, and subsequently extended to pot experiments with perennial ryegrass, foggrass, rape and white and subterranean clover, and to pasture trials. In all species severe N and S imbalances substantially affected the respective (N:S) p 's, but {{with the exception of}} rape, (N:S) p's were markedly less affected than corresponding (N:S) t's, and if extreme N and S imbalances are excluded from consideration, then the respective (N:S) p's were either constant, or their variability was such that they were arbitrarily referred to as tending towards constancy. These "constant" values varied between species (about 15 in subterranean and white clover, and about 11 to 13 in oats, foggrass and ryegrass), and with physiological development, the effects of physiological development appearing to be more pronounced in relatively young than in old plants. This sensitivity of (N:S) p was considered to be due to (a) analytical methods of determining Np and Sp, (b) the composition of the protein fraction, (c) the severity of N and S imbalance, and (d) differences in physiological age. In both the gramineous and clover species, severe S stress was always accompanied by (N:S) t 's substantially exceeding the respective constant values to which their (N:S) p 's tended, whilst in corresponding S sufficient plants, (N:S) t's were usually equal to, or less than corresponding "constant" (N:S) p ranges. This latter group frequently included low N-low S treated plants, suggesting that in these plants the internal <b>S</b> <b>status</b> was in balance with the internal N status. A progressive increase in (N:S) t's above their corresponding "constant" (N:S) p 's tended to be associated with increasing S stress, but it was difficult to establish when this increase became physiologically critical. The investigations with gramineous plants were restricted to total foliage analysis. In clovers the <b>S</b> <b>status</b> was best reflected in laminae-only samples, but for diagnostic purposes, a precise separation of laminae from petioles was not necessary. Unlike pot experiments, where the <b>S</b> <b>status</b> of grass-clover swards could be diagnosed by (N:S) t 's in any of the species, in pasture situations, only (N:S) t changes in clover components were sufficiently substantial for meaningful diagnosis. This was demonstrated in a field experiment in which management and S treatments were varied. Results of 19 simple grazing trials emphasise that the diagnosis assesses the <b>S</b> <b>status</b> (in relation to N status) as at the time of sampling, and is not a reliable guide to future requirements, and that the time of year is critical for meaningful sampling...|$|R
