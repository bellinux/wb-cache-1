40|$|In {{the present}} work, the mixing process of {{different}} components of abrasive stones of cubic boron nitride used for rough honing was studied.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{describes}} modelling of fracture wear in vitrified cBN grinding wheels. Design/methodology/approach: The {{approach used}} in the paper is based on using finite elements to model fracture wear processes in vitrified cBN grinding wheels. The approach used models fracture wear processes and ignores abrasive wear of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grains.</b> Findings: The findings show that during grinding the grain is subjected to forces that create fracture initiation zones in the sharp <b>abrasive</b> <b>grains</b> where tensile and compressive stresses dominate {{in certain parts of}} the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grains.</b> Research limitations/implications: The findings show that further research is required that prevents the formation of crack initiation zones and considers the effects of wear flats on the magnitude of stresses in the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grains.</b> Practical implications: The results imply that abrasive fracture wear is the dominant wear mechanism when grinding with sharp vitrified cBN grinding wheels. Originality/value: The originality of this paper is reflected in {{the fact that this is}} the first time that fracture wear has been modelled in sharp vitrified cBN grinding wheels.

40|$|AbstractThe {{productivity}} of technological operation, accuracy, and surface finish {{depend on the}} patterns of tool wear {{and the state of}} its working surface. It was established that the prediction of the wear of tool is only possible based on modeling the regularities of work of single <b>abrasive</b> <b>grains.</b> The wear of <b>abrasive</b> <b>grains</b> tips as well as a tool, occurs in the contact zone arising when approaching the tool and the workpiece and is determined by the relative wear and length of the path of cutting. The length of the cutting path is not equal to the length of the path of movement of grain in a contact zone. The length of the cutting is calculated taking into account the probability of contact of the top of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grains</b> with the material being processed at any point of contact area, which determines the probability that the material at the point is not removed. The analysis of the sequence of contacts of the tool surface with a workpiece surface allowed obtaining a differential equation that links the wear tool with the wear of single <b>abrasive</b> <b>grains.</b> The proposed probabilistic approach provides an opportunity to estimate {{the current state of the}} working surface of the tool, as well as analyze the impact of certain parameters on the processing on the rate of wear...|$|R
