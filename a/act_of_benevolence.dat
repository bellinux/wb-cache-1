60|$|And now {{let us be}} {{indulged in}} a few {{particulars}} about these lodgings in which Goldsmith was guilty of this thoughtless <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>benevolence.</b> They were in a very shabby house, No. 12, Green Arbor Court, between the Old Bailey and Fleet Market. An old woman was still living in 1820 who was a relative of the identical landlady whom Goldsmith relieved by the money received from the pawnbroker. She was a child about seven years of age {{at the time that}} the poet rented his apartment of her relative, and used frequently to be at the house in Green Arbor Court. She was drawn there, in a great measure, by the good-humored kindness of Goldsmith, who was always exceedingly fond of the society of children. He used to assemble those of the family in his room, give them cakes and sweetmeats, and set them dancing to the sound of his flute. He was very friendly to those around him, and cultivated a kind of intimacy with a watchmaker in the court, who possessed much native wit and humor. He passed most of the day, however, in his room, and only went out in the evenings. His days were no doubt devoted to the drudgery of the pen, and it would appear that he occasionally found the booksellers urgent taskmasters. On one occasion a visitor was shown up to his room, and immediately their voices were heard in high altercation, and the key was turned within the lock. The landlady, at first, was disposed to go to the assistance of her lodger; but a calm succeeding, she forbore to interfere.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Winterblossom was {{the person}} whom MacTurk had {{in his own mind}} pitched upon as the fittest person to perform this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>benevolence,</b> and he lost no time in {{communicating}} his wish to that worthy gentleman. But Mr. Winterblossom, though a man of the world, and well enough acquainted with such matters, was by no means so passionately addicted to them as was the man of peace, Captain Hector MacTurk. As a bon vivant, he hated trouble of any kind, and the shrewd selfishness of his disposition enabled him to foresee, that a good deal might accrue to all concerned {{in the course of this}} business. He, therefore, coolly replied, that he knew nothing of Mr. Tyrrel--not even whether he was a gentleman or not; and besides, he had received no regular application in his behalf--he did not, therefore, feel himself at all inclined to go to the field as his second. This refusal drove the poor Captain to despair. He conjured his friend to be more public-spirited, and entreated him to consider the reputation of the Well, which was to them as a common country, and the honour of the company to which they both belonged, and of which Mr. Winterblossom was in a manner the proper representative, as being, with consent of all, the perpetual president. He reminded him how many quarrels had been nightly undertaken and departed from on the ensuing morning, without any suitable consequences--said, [...] "that people began to talk of the place oddly; and that, for his own part, he found his own honour so nearly touched, that he had begun to think he himself would be obliged to bring somebody or other to account, for the general credit of the Well; and now, just when the most beautiful occasion had arisen to put every thing on a handsome footing, it was hard--it was cruel--it was most unjustifiable--in Mr. Winterblossom, to decline so simple a matter as was requested of him." ...|$|E

40|$|My study {{examines}} four African American-authored narratives written between 1793 and 1901 (Richard Allen and Absalom Jones' Narratives of the Proceedings of the Black People, Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Elizabeth Keckley's Behind the Scenes, and Charles Chesnutt's The Marrow of Tradition) that depict <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> by African Americans to white recipients. This work {{focuses on the}} power relations represented by <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>benevolence,</b> social perceptions regarding the roles of benefactor and recipient, and authorial choices in the depiction <b>of</b> these <b>acts.</b> The study highlights how these four narratives complicate representations <b>of</b> <b>benevolence,</b> {{both in terms of}} race and of the historical contexts in which they were written. 	Previous scholars have documented the emergence of what they identify as a genre <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> texts within nineteenth-century American literature and even identified several subgenres among these texts (including poorhouse stories, seamstress novels, panic fiction, settlement house narratives, and maternal literacy management narratives). My work contributes to this critical literature by identifying what I call counternarratives <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> depicting interactions between black benefactors and white recipients, thereby expanding the scholarly discourse surrounding benevolence and challenging the dominant American narrative about it. 	I call the texts under consideration here counternarratives because they challenge the dominant narrative of black inferiority in benevolent encounters. Unlike benevolence texts previously studied, which usually portray white benefactors and white recipients, white benefactors and black recipients, and even occasionally black benefactors and black recipients [...] portrayals that often reinforce social hierarchies [...] the texts I discuss work to disrupt social hierarchies by both uncovering and challenging cultural hegemony. In doing so, they facilitate the expression of black agency and declare African American readiness for full citizenship. 	Drawing on the methods of social history, cultural anthropology, moral and political philosophy and literary studies, my analysis examines issues of agency, performativity, gift theory, and the psychology of gratitude. My study interprets two canonical and two non-canonical texts to show how benevolence is used as a narrative device to question race and power, to demonstrate a connection between narrative and ideology, and ultimately to destabilize ideologies of race and nation. My study also contributes to current debate about benevolence. By recovering the African American intellectual foundations of today's community-based learning movement within higher education, I raise questions about using traditionally understood nineteenth-century benevolence as a means for teaching students to challenge constructs of race and power in social activist movements in the twenty-first century. The writers I discuss offer a new and important model for community-based learning today...|$|R

Hutchesonâs aesthetic theory has not preoccupied critics to the same extent, {{despite the fact that it}} formed an important, indeed intrinsic part of his argument in An Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1725). In a vein that Shaftesbury had infl uentially explored before him, Hutcheson began his account by establishing the model of an internal aesthetic sense which made experience of beauty, harmony, form and order possible. His confi dence that his audience would accept the empirical existence of such a sense facilitated the transition to the argument about a parallel moral sense...|$|R

40|$|This {{draft chapter}} has been {{published}} by Edward Elgar Publishing in Handbook of Migration and Health, edited by Edited by Felicity Thomas, Senior Research Fellow, University of Exeter, UK, published in 2016. [URL] chapter demonstrates the practical and socio-spatial challenges facing many migrants as they seek to access basic resources in their day-to-day lives, and the additional burdens faced when migrants are undocumented or have longer-term healthcare needs. Drawing on work undertaken in France, the chapter examines how the principles of universalism enshrined within state policy and national rhetoric are simultaneously undermined by government policy while being positively renegotiated by committed and compassionate individuals at the frontline of healthcare provision. At the centre {{of this is the}} provision of outreach work to ensure vulnerable migrants are brought into the healthcare system. While the chapter demonstrates the vital role played by dedicated individuals and informal networks, it raises important questions regarding health-related accountability as well as concerns over the sustainability <b>of</b> relying on <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> to deliver healthcare...|$|R
