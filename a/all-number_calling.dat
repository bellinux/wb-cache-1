50|$|<b>All-number</b> <b>calling,</b> the United States equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|<b>All-number</b> <b>calling</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} without much publicity in small communities where it was met with little resistance. In other areas this change sparked an intense outcry among urban users who considered all-digit dialing to be dehumanizing. [...] The AT&T inventor of the all-number system stated {{that he had been}} approached by a woman at a cocktail party, [...] "Are you the John Karlin who is responsible for all-number dialing?" [...] He proudly replied, [...] "Yes, I am." [...] She then asked him, [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} the most hated man in America?" [...] Opponents created a variety of organizations to oppose <b>all-number</b> <b>calling,</b> including the Anti-Digit Dialing League and the Committee of Ten Million to Oppose <b>All-Number</b> <b>Calling</b> to pressure AT&T to drop the plan.|$|E
50|$|<b>All-number</b> <b>calling</b> (ANC) is a {{telephone}} numbering plan that {{was introduced by}} the Bell System in the United States starting around 1958 to replace the previous system of using {{a telephone}} exchange name as {{the first part of}} a telephone number.|$|E
50|$|Telephone {{exchange}} {{names were}} used in many countries, but were phased out for numeric systems by the 1960s. In the United States, the demand for telephone service outpaced the scalability of the alphanumeric system and after introduction of area codes for direct-distance dialing, <b>all-number</b> <b>calling</b> became necessary. Similar developments followed around the world, such as the British all-figure dialling.|$|E
50|$|As {{demand for}} {{telephone}} service {{grew in the}} post-World War II period, it was foreseeable that the demand would exceed the addressing capacity of the existing system of using memorable telephone central office names as prefixes in telephone numbers. Several letter combinations had no pronounceable or memorable names {{and could not be}} used. Several North American numbering plan areas (NPAs) were divided so that more office codes became available to smaller regions. However, as the growth accelerated, the Bell System decided to implement <b>all-number</b> <b>calling</b> (ANC) and to deprecate the use of central office names to provide more central office codes to each NPA. This extended the usable numbering plan and only two area code splits became necessary between 1962 and 1981. <b>All-number</b> <b>calling</b> was phased in starting in 1958 and most areas had adopted it fully by the mid-1960s. In some areas it did not become universal until the 1980s. The Bell System published and distributed area code handbooks yearly which compiled the towns available for calling using an area code.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the {{telephone}} exchange that served Staten Island's eastern North Shore {{was named after}} the neighborhood; {{the name of this}} exchange was changed to [...] "Saint George" [...] in the mid-1920s, and to [...] "Saint George 7" [...] when New York Telephone upgraded telephone service throughout New York City in December 1930. Converted for <b>All-Number</b> <b>Calling,</b> [...] "727" [...] still exists on the island today. It is the sole surviving number of the designations of the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|These letters {{have been}} used for {{multiple}} purposes. Originally, they referred to the leading letters of telephone exchange names. In the mid-20th century United States, before the switch to <b>All-Number</b> <b>Calling,</b> telephone numbers had seven digits including a two-digit prefix which was expressed in letters rather than digits, e.g.; KL5-5445. The UK telephone numbering system used a similar two-letter code after the initial zero to form {{the first part of the}} subscriber trunk dialling code for a region. For example, Aylesbury was assigned 0AY6, which translated into 0296.|$|E
50|$|The Bell System {{proceeded}} to convert existing named exchanges to <b>all-number</b> <b>calling,</b> starting in smaller communities. No significant opposition arose until conversion began in major cities. In some {{cities such as}} San Francisco, opposition was organized; the opposition group in San Francisco was called the Anti Digit Dialing League, of which S. I. Hayakawa was a notable member. The opposition caused AT&T {{to slow down the}} conversion process, and names continued to be used in cities such as New York, which went to ANC only in 1978. Philadelphia had named exchanges in the Bell of Pennsylvania telephone book as late as 1983, long after AT&T had hoped to complete the conversion.|$|E
50|$|During World War II Karlin {{conducted}} research on psychoacoustics for the United States military. He joined Bell Labs afterwards, becoming their first staff psychologist. He successfully {{argued for the}} foundation of its Human Factors Engineering Department in 1947, and was promoted to directorship of the unit in 1951. He undertook numerous empirical research projects, such as the usability of numerical input systems and the human capacity to recall digit sequences. The development of the modern telephone keypad is attributed to research in the 1950s in the department, which was influential in many other applications. Around 1960, his research resulted in {{the transformation of the}} telephone numbering plan in use in North America from the use of telephone exchange names to <b>all-number</b> <b>calling</b> (ANC) to provide essential expansion of the pool of available telephone numbers.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the most}} part of the 20th century the name [...] "Murray Hill" [...] was used by New York Telephone as a {{telephone}} exchange for residents living on the East Side of Manhattan, served from the East 37th Street exchange building. Most neighborhoods at the time would be grouped together by a particular exchange name. Other municipalities in the United States would also use MUrray or MUrray Hill as an exchange name. The first two letters in MUrray (capitalized to indicate {{that they should be}} dialed) would be joined by five number digits to make up a telephone number such as MUrray Hill 5-9975 (the Ricardos' number on I Love Lucy). This was the way most telephone numbers were given until AT&T switched to <b>All-Number</b> <b>Calling</b> by the late 1970s to early 1980s. Nevertheless, the name MUrray Hill is still applicable, as many East Side phone numbers still begin with 68, which corresponds to MU on the telephone keypad.|$|E
5000|$|The {{writers of}} All in the Family {{continued}} throughout the series {{to have the}} Bunkers and other characters use telephone exchange names when giving a telephone number (most other series at the time, such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show, were using the standard fake 555 telephone number) {{at a time when}} AT&T was trying to discontinue them. At different times throughout the series, the telephone exchanges Ravenswood and Bayside were used for the Bunkers' telephone number. Both exchanges were and still are applicable names for phone numbers in the neighborhoods of Astoria and Bayside. This may have {{had to do with the}} fact that at the time many major cities in the United States, such as New York, were resisting the dropping of telephone exchange names in favor of <b>all-number</b> <b>calling,</b> and were still printing their telephone books with exchange names. Actual residents of the Bunkers' age continued using exchange names into the early 1980s. This fact is referred to in the 1979 episode [...] "The Appendectomy", when Edith, while dialing a telephone number, uses the Parkview exchange name only to correct herself by saying that she keeps forgetting that it is all-number dialing now. However, she comes to the conclusion that the number is exactly the same either way.|$|E
