40|$|Two {{ethylene}} {{vinyl acetate}} (EVA) copolymers (12 and 20 wt% of vinyl acetate,VA, content) have been treated with low pressure RF plasmas from non-oxidizing gases (Ar, N 2) and oxidizing gases (air, a mixture of 4 N 2 : 6 O 2 (v/v), O 2 and CO 2). The formation of polar moieties on both EVAs was more noticeable by treatment with plasmas from non-oxidizing gases than from oxidizing ones (the higher the reactivity, the lower the difference with respect to untreated EVA surfaces). The surface etching with the non-oxidizing plasmas, giving rise to a high roughness, depends on the wt% of VA {{in the composition of}} the copolymer because of the different resistances of VA (low) and PE (high) to the non-oxidizingplasma particles bombardment. The adhesion properties obtained using a polyurethane adhesive (PU) showed high T-peel strength values and adhesion failure in EVAs treated with plasmas from oxidizing gases, due to roughness produced causing mechanical interlocking of the adhesive. Lower T-peel strength values were obtained with non-oxidizingplasmas: the values for EVA 12 being, in general, lower than those obtained for EVA 20. The durability of the treated EVAs/PU adhesive joints after <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> <b>humidity</b> and temperature was quite good...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} aging on the flexural stiffness and bending loading capacity of a perforated glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite subjected to combined moisture and elevated temperature. Specimens, in the configuration of one-quarter of a perforated GFRP tube, were <b>aged</b> <b>in</b> 60 % <b>humidity</b> and temperatures of 40, 60, and 80 °C, respectively. Moisture absorptions of the specimens were measured during the aging process, and bending tests were conducted on the specimens after aging. The SEM images were also captured to further {{examine the effects of}} the moisture absorption on the aged specimens. The results indicated that the increase <b>in</b> the <b>aging</b> temperature reduced the diffusion coefficient, thus inducing more moisture absorption by the composite and in turn causing more reduction in composite’s flexural stiffness and bending capacity. Moreover, the ability of Fick’s equation for predicting the moisture absorption rate in such perforated thin-walled composite configuration at various moisture contents and temperatures was also assessed. A semiempirical equation was developed and proposed by which the reduction of the stiffness <b>in</b> the perforated <b>aged</b> GFRP structures could be predicted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Self-setting calcium {{phosphate}} cement (CPC) {{has been used}} in bone repair and substitution due to their excellent biocompatibility, bioactive as well as simplicity of preparation and use. The inherent brittleness and slow degradation are the major disadvantages for the use of {{calcium phosphate}} cements. To improve the degradation for the traditional CPC, the apatite cement formula incorporated with β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) with varying concentration were studied and the effect of the pH value of liquid phase on the properties of this new calcium phosphate cement formula was evaluated. The apatite cements containing β-TCP for 10 and 40 wt. % were mixed into the aqueous solution with different pH values and then <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> absolute <b>humidity</b> at 37 °C for 7 days. The setting time and phase analysis of the biphasic calcium phosphate were determined as compared to the apatite cement. For proper medical application, the compressive strength, the phase analysis and the degradation of the CPC samples at pH 7. 0 and 7. 4 were evaluated after soaking in the simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 °C for 7 days. The results indicated that the properties of the samples such as the setting time, the compressive strength related to the phase analysis of the set cements. The high degradation of the CPC was found in the cement with increasing β-TCP addition due to the phase after setting. Apatite formation with oriented plate-like morphology was also found to be denser {{on the surface of the}} biphasic bone cements after soaking in SBF for 7 days. The obtained results indicated that the cement containing β-TCP mixed with the liquid phase at pH 7. 4 could be considered as a highly biodegradable and bioactive bone cement, as compared to the traditional CPC...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{presence}} of free moisture in power cables {{leading to the}} formation of tree structures - water treeing, which originate in the amorphous phase polyethylene and are a major cause of degradation of the polymer insulation. They represent the damage of the polymer size from several microns to 1 mm, developing technology for insulation defects under the combined action of the electric field and the moisture diffusing from the environment. Water treeing destroys the polymer chain, resulting in the formation of microcavities filled with moisture. The dynamics of water treeing and subtle properties largely depend on the composition, morphology of the polymer insulation, chemical nature of the defect, in which they originate. Due to the force of gravity in the water formed typical only for her region with locally ordered structure - clusters, which cause loss of relaxation. Purpose. Features {{presence of}} relaxation losses in high-frequency range in polyethylene insulation during <b>aging</b> <b>in</b> high <b>humidity</b> conditions of samples power and RF cables. Methodology. Samples of the power cable for the voltage of 35 kV with a cross-linked polyethylene insulation radial water-blocking protection from moisture and radio-frequency coaxial cable with thermoplastic insulation for 1440 hours <b>in</b> a <b>humidity</b> of 100 %. The dielectric loss tangent measured resonance method before and after aging. Originality. Experimentally found evidence of the existence in the polymer cable insulation free water in the form of areas with locally ordered structure - clusters. It is found that the solid polyethylene insulation in the frequency dependence of dielectric loss tangent maximum relaxation shown one at 10 MHz in the initial state, and there are two additional frequency range 500 kHz - 5 MHz after moistening. For cross-linked polyethylene insulation characteristic of large width Δf of the frequency spectrum in which the observed relaxation losses. It is obvious that the width of each of the relaxation maxima is associated with characteristic fractal cluster size. It is important that the hydrated solid and foamed polyethylene insulation to show individuality, typical only for water clusters which are detected by high-frequency dipole relaxation peaks dielectric loss tangent. There is a positive correlation between the bandwidth Δf of relaxation maxima and the rate of decrease of insulation resistance by applying a high DC voltage. Practical value. Establishing a correlation between the bandwidth of relaxation maxima and the rate of decrease in the insulation resistance test objects in the laboratory makes it possible to diagnose the presence of free moisture in the power and RF cables by measuring the insulation resistance in exploitation...|$|R
