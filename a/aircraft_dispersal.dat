2500|$|In World War II, <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> {{and work}} areas with hard standings were built outside the old {{airfield}} area: north of Yewtree Lane by Fairey's area, and southeast of Altrincham Road (Styal) {{by the three}} southeast hangars. These were linked to by [...] "level crossings" [...] across those two roads, which were {{closed to the public}} except to those with a local resident's pass from early 1940 to mid 1945. After the war these hard standings were removed and the land was returned to farming, and the two roads became public again.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950 when as {{a result}} of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the {{airfield}} at Juvincourt was offered to the United States Air Force by the French Air Ministry as part of their NATO commitment to establish a modern Air Force station at the site. Some construction was performed, pouring an 8000' jet runway (05/23) to the south of the World War II airfield, along with <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> areas at each end of the runway. [...] However the construction was never completed due to the high cost of breaking the agricultural leases, and also the high costs of removing the concrete German runways and other facilities. It was cheaper to build an airfield elsewhere and the land was simply sold off to private interests.|$|E
2500|$|At first, the sod {{airfield}} was circular with planes {{taking off}} and landing into the wind, whichever direction {{that happened to}} be. [...] Beginning in 1944, Giebelstadt received a very long (3000m 9,100ft) paved runway aligned 08/26 slightly {{to the east and}} south of the original 1935 airfield. In addition, other upgrades to facilities were included in the plans for Giebelstadt to be used for jet interceptor aircraft operations such as additional <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> sites, an expansion of the fuel dump and other facilities. [...] This in turn made a significant extension of the airfield. [...] With this construction, the expanded air base site was about 250ha in size. [...] Not only was the location of the airbase a closely held secret, the town name itself was banned from all maps of the region and can still be hard to find on some maps today. To hide the airfield from Allied reconnaissance aircraft, workers painted the runway to resemble a grassy field complete with fluffy white sheep.|$|E

25|$|Snitterfield was {{operational}} {{during the}} Second World War, the airfield was a class A airfield and had around 30 <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersals.</b> The airfield was finished around June 1942 and cost around Â£1,147,000 and opened in 1943 then closed in 1946.|$|R
50|$|In 1943, RAF Driffield was {{temporary}} {{closed for}} the construction of three concrete runways, the longest stretching 6,000 ft, linked by a perimeter track, along the length of which were situated the <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersals</b> and bomb dump. The airfield became operational again in June 1944 with the return of No.466 Squadron RAAF, now equipped with the heavy four-engined Handley Page Halifax bomber. This unit began operations supporting the Allied invasion of Europe by bombing targets in the Normandy area.|$|R
50|$|The three runways were {{concrete}} overlaid with asphalt, with 62 <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersals</b> (38 concrete {{pans and}} 12 twin pens with blast walls) situated along its perimeter track. The USAAF added 17 PSP parking squares and a walled 6-plane revetment for additional aircraft parking. Support structures included two T-2 hangars (each 239+1/2 xx 115 xx 29 ft in dimension) and 12 corrugated steel 60 ft wide Over Blister hangars dispersed {{on all sides}} of the perimeter track. The ten living sites located west of the airfield had a capacity for 1,709 personnel.|$|R
50|$|Charters Towers was {{the closest}} inland centre that could provide {{strategic}} support and <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> facilities for the main North Eastern Area air base at Garbutt, Townsville, which was considered vulnerable to Japanese attack.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the southeast, just outside the current facility to the southeast, remains of what was probably a German <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> area remain with large, unconnected concrete areas in agricultural fields, being connected by single-lane concrete farm roads.|$|E
50|$|The aerodrome was {{constructed}} in 1942, during World War II, for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{as part of a}} group of airfields to be used as <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> fields in the event of Imperial Japanese attack on the Townsville area.|$|E
5000|$|Borzya (also {{referred}} to as Borzia, Borzyu, and Borzya Northwest) is an air base in Chita Oblast, Russia located 13 km west of Borzya. It is a simple fighter base with three areas of fighter revetments housing about 30 <b>aircraft.</b> The <b>dispersal</b> field for this airbase was Arabatuk, located 30 km away from Borzya.|$|R
50|$|On June 23, 1941, the {{day after}} Germany {{launched}} Operation Barbarossa, Lelyushenko set about reorganising his command to combat the specific threats of the German invasion. Casualties began to mount as German <b>aircraft</b> raided his <b>dispersal</b> areas.|$|R
50|$|Amchitka Air Force Base {{today is}} largely intact, {{although}} abandoned in most {{part for the}} past sixty years. Runways, taxiways, <b>aircraft</b> parking <b>dispersal</b> revetments remain along with a large support base with deteriorating buildings. Due to its remote location, it rests undisturbed with ice and snow covering the base most of the year, exposed to the elements in the short summers. It is almost constantly under a cloud cover and fog generally obscures the area.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Long Strip", the {{airfield}} {{was constructed in}} late 1943 by No.14 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF. The bitumen surfaced runway was 2400 x 50 ft wide. Fifty three <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> bays with some protected with earth revetments were also constructed.|$|E
50|$|Youks-les-Bains Airfield is an {{abandoned}} military airfield in Algeria, located about 20 km northwest of Tebessa. The airfield today consists of several agricultural fields, with the faint remains {{of its main}} runway, parts of a taxiway and a few <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> hardstands visible in aerial photography.|$|E

2500|$|To the {{southeast}} of the wartime airfield is the 1950s jet <b>aircraft</b> runway and <b>dispersal</b> pads built when Juvincourt was proposed as a NATO airfield. [...] Today it is owned by Robert Bosch GmbH, being used as an automobile testing centre and track.|$|R
50|$|Eschborn Airfield {{was built}} by the Luftwaffe about 1942 to provide air defense of the Frankfurt am Main area from Allied bomber attacks. A 1,600m {{concrete}} runway, aligned 12/30 was laid down, along with taxiways, <b>dispersal</b> <b>aircraft</b> hardstands, a support area and other buildings.|$|R
50|$|Seized by the Germans in June 1940 {{during the}} Battle of France, Athies {{was used as}} a Luftwaffe {{military}} airfield during the occupation. The Germans improved the facility by expanding the support area with numerous maintenance shops, hangars, and laying down two 1600m concrete all-weather runways, aligned 17/35 and 08/26. Numerous taxiways and <b>dispersal</b> <b>aircraft</b> parking areas were also constructed.|$|R
50|$|The aerodrome was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} a group of airfields to be used as <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> fields in the event of Japanese air attack on the Sydney area. Aircraft revetment hideouts were constructed within adjacent vegetation to hide and disperse aircraft. The aerodrome was used as an emergency and training field and satellite field for Schofields, Bankstown and Camden during World War II by the Royal Australian Air Force.|$|E
50|$|A new 8000 ft jet runway {{was laid}} {{down over the}} wartime 11/29 runway and the parking ramp was torn up and relaid with new concrete. Large, modern {{aircraft}} hangars were erected and a new station area built. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> areas were also renewed, later in the 1970s being fitted with NATO Tab-Vee concrete shelters. A second dispersal area {{to the north of}} the main runway was also built to accommodate a second full aircraft squadron. Reconstruction was finally completed in 1956.|$|E
50|$|CLAWR is the {{northern}} {{equivalent to the}} United States Air Force's (USAF) Nellis Air Force Range and provides a different training environment with heavy boreal forest and numerous lakes more closely resembling European terrain. It hosts over 640 actual targets and 100 realistic target complexes, including 7 simulated aerodromes with runways, tarmac, <b>aircraft,</b> <b>dispersal</b> areas and buildings, as well as mechanized military equipment such as tanks, simulated radar and missile launching sites, mock industrial sites, and command and control centres.|$|E
50|$|Although {{used as a}} {{helicopter}} airfield for the past 40 years, Katterbach Kaserne has {{little resemblance to the}} Luftwaffe wartime airfield from which it originated. The airfield retains its circular support area, with numerous hangars and warehouses from its air depot use by the Air Force, however a large concrete ramp was constructed by the Army over the original grass airfield for helicopter parking. The wartime 4000' concrete runway has been removed, with a short 1,212' asphalt runway replacing it, aligned 08/26 for helicopter use. All of the wartime taxiways and <b>aircraft</b> parking <b>dispersals</b> have been removed, and the support area buildings have all been replaced by postwar construction, although built in a traditional German architectural style.|$|R
25|$|A jet-capable 8000' jet {{runway and}} taxiways were laid {{down to the}} {{southwest}} along with additional <b>aircraft</b> ramp space, <b>dispersals</b> with hardened Tab-Vs, hangars and a support area. Initially de Havilland Vampires {{were assigned to the}} base in 1950; later Republic F-84 Thunderjets, and in 1959, North American F-100 Super Sabres. French Air Force units deployed from Reims to Egypt during the 1956 Suez Crisis, and also to Cyprus. In 1973, the Mirage F1 was assigned.|$|R
40|$|Small {{scale models}} of {{agricultural}} airplanes were tested and numerical methods were utilized to study {{interactions between the}} airplane wake and the dispersed spray and granular materials. Methods were developed to measure and predict dispersal transport and wake characteristics and dispersal techniques to obtain interactions more favorable to wide, uniform deposition patterns and reduced drift. In the full scale wind tunnel, full scale agricultural airplanes and dispersal systems for both liquid and solid applications were evaluated to improve <b>aircraft</b> aerodynamics and <b>dispersal</b> systems efficiency. The program status in these two facilities is reported with emphasis on wake interactions and dispersal systems research...|$|R
50|$|Construction {{started on}} the aerodrome in 1942 and was still under {{construction}} in 1944 {{as part of a}} proposal to base a United States Navy Fleet Air Wing in Sydney should the need arise. Initially planned with three runways, No.1 (5000 ft) and No. 3 (6000 ft) runways were serviceable, however construction of No. 2 runway (5000 ft) was abandoned. A total of eight <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> hideouts were constructed and accommodation was a farm house and a former Civil Constructional Corps camp.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was built}} by C Company and HQ Detachment of the 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion between 27 April 1942 and 16 July 1942. The single runway was 6000 x 100 ft. Further development of the airfield was undertaken by No. 1 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF, No 14 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF and New South Wales Department of Main Roads under the Allied Works Council. The runway was enlarged to approximately 7218 x 164 ft, accommodating close to sixty <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> bays, some with earthen revetments.|$|E
5000|$|In 1939, {{with world}} {{tensions}} heightening, the United States Army Air Corps began a massive buildup of troops, bases, and equipment {{in preparation for}} war. As a result, Charleston acquired more land in 1940 for additional airport improvements that included construction of a hangar and administration building and lengthening of the runways to 5,000 feet. Prior to the U.S. entering World War II, in 1941 the War Department allotted another $199,000 to the Charleston Airport for runway extension and other improvements needed for <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> against attack ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1941, the Germans {{improved}} the facility into a permanent Luftwaffe air base by expanding the support area with numerous maintenance shops, hangars, and laying down two 1500m concrete all-weather runways, aligned 03/21 and 09/27 (A possible third runway, aligned 13/31 {{is visible in}} aerial photography, {{only part of the}} 13 (northwest) end still remains). [...] Numerous taxiways and <b>dispersal</b> <b>aircraft</b> parking areas were also constructed. [...] As Vitry is located in the Pas-de-Calais, it was believed by the Germans that when the Americans and British tried to land in France to open a Second Front, the airfield would have {{a key role in the}} defense of France.|$|R
50|$|Evidence of its wartime {{history is}} present around the {{threshold}} of runway 22, northeast of the airport, with about 2000 feet of the runway end being the unused surface of the wartime runway, complete with several bomb craters left by the Ninth Air Force bomber attacks and some single-lane concrete roads, being the remainders of wartime taxiways. In addition, ruins of the support technical site remain to the northeast of the airport, near the commune of Morlaine, with connecting taxiways and the foundations/rubble of {{what appears to be}} buildings or an <b>aircraft</b> hangar. Wartime <b>dispersal</b> revetments in a wooded area, also connected by taxiways, remain.|$|R
50|$|Later in 1941, the Germans {{improved}} the facility into a permanent Luftwaffe air base by expanding the support area with numerous maintenance shops, hangars, and laying down two 1500m concrete all-weather runways, aligned 03/21 and 09/27 (A possible third runway, aligned 13/31 {{is visible in}} aerial photography, {{only part of the}} 13 (northwest) end still remains).
