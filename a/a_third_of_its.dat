5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> mass.|$|E

With consolidated ratings taken into account, the first episode went up to 803,000 viewers on Sky Atlantic, with an extra 90,000 viewing from its catch-up channel, Sky Atlantic +1. However, the second episode dropped <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> overnight audience, leaving it with 236,000 viewers. The finale was seen by 267,000 overnight viewers.|$|E
5|$|Although the 9th Corps Army {{was one of}} China's elite formations, {{composed}} of veterans and former POWs from the Huaihai Campaign, several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. Initially the 9th Army {{was intended to be}} outfitted in Manchuria during November, but Mao suddenly ordered it into Korea before that could happen. As the result, the 9th Corps Army had almost no winter clothing for the harsh Korean winter. Similarly, poor logistics forced the 9th Corps Army to abandon heavy artillery, while working with little food and ammunition. The food shortage forced the 9th Corps Army to initially station <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> strength away from the Chosin Reservoir as reserve, and starvation and exposure broke out among the Chinese units since foraging was not an option at the sparsely populated reservoir. By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.|$|E

5|$|Despite some protests, on 18 September 1773, the Committee {{formally}} {{signed the}} treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories. The Sejm on 30 September 1773 accepted the partition treaty. By the first partition the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211,000km² (30% of its territory, amounting {{at that time to}} about 733,000km²), with a population of over four to five million people (about <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population of 14 million before the partitions). The treaty was a major success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share might have been the smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. Russia received the largest, but economically least-important area, in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century, the {{institutions}} of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came {{to rest in the}} Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. Disaster struck {{in the form of the}} Black Death in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population. London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People's Republic, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR). Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland, and were finalized after World WarII. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population {{and more than half of}} its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.|$|E

The sanctions also prohibit governments around the world from admitting any more North Korean workers, as the regime pockets most of their wages.|$|R
5|$|The 2/1st Infantry Battalion {{began its}} advance on {{schedule}} at 0900, but the lead platoon came under {{heavy machine gun}} fire from Post 54, and Italian artillery knocked out the supporting mortars. The 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery engaged the Italian guns and the platoon withdrew. Colonel Eather then organised a formal attack on Post 54 for 1330, following a bombardment of the post by artillery and mortars. The Italian guns were silenced when an Australian shell detonated a nearby ammunition dump. The Australians then captured the post. About <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> defenders {{had been killed in}} the fighting. The remaining 66 surrendered. This prompted a general collapse of the Italian position in the north. Posts 56 and 61 surrendered without a fight and white flags were raised over Posts 58, 60, 63 and 65, and the gun positions near Post 58. By nightfall, Eather's men had advanced as far as Post 69 and only the fourteen northernmost posts still held out in the Gerfan sector.|$|E
5|$|The Nomad was {{released}} in October 1995 in North America only. The release was five years into the market span of the Genesis, with an existing library of more than 500 Genesis games. According to former Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the Nomad {{was not intended to}} be the Game Gear's replacement and believes that there was little planning from Sega of Japan for the new handheld. Sega was supporting five different consoles: Saturn, Genesis, Game Gear, Pico, and the Master System, as well as the Sega CD and 32X add-ons. In Japan, the Mega Drive had never been successful and the Saturn was more successful than Sony's PlayStation, so Sega Enterprises CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to focus on the Saturn. By 1999, the Nomad was being sold at less than <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> original price.|$|E
5|$|These probes {{intensified}} on 30 March, {{as one of}} the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies {{was strongly}} attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> strength out on patrol {{at the time of the}} attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to link up with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and link up with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.|$|E

5|$|The City of London was {{a county}} {{in its own}} right from the 12th century and was able to exert {{political}} control over Middlesex. Westminster Abbey dominated most of the early financial, judicial and ecclesiastical aspects of the county. As London grew into Middlesex, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to expand the city boundaries into the county, which posed problems for the administration of local government and justice. In the 18th and 19th centuries the population density was especially high in the southeast of the county, including the East End and West End of London. From 1855 the southeast was administered, with sections of Kent and Surrey, as part of the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works. When county councils were introduced in England in 1889 about 20% of the area of Middlesex, along with <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> population, was transferred to the new County of London and the remainder became an administrative county governed by the Middlesex County Council that met regularly at the Middlesex Guildhall in Westminster, in the County of London. The City of London, and Middlesex, became separate counties for other purposes and Middlesex regained the right to appoint its own sheriff, lost in 1199.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{its only}} {{access to the}} Baltic Sea was a major blow to the Lithuanian economy. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda. The region, which {{represented}} only about 5% of Lithuania's territory, contained <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> industry. Lithuania also lost its heavy investments in the port's infrastructure. About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, left the region and sought shelter and support from the Lithuanian government. Lithuanians doubted the fate of their country: in March–April withdrawals of deposits in banks and credit institutions totaled almost 20% of total deposits. After the loss of Klaipėda, Lithuania drifted into the German sphere of influence, {{especially in terms of}} trade. At the end of 1939, Germany accounted for 75% of Lithuanian exports and for 86% of its imports. Germany and the Soviet Union concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence. Not surprisingly, Lithuania was, at first, assigned to Germany. The Nazis {{went so far as to}} suggest a German–Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and promised to return the Vilnius Region, but Lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality.|$|E
