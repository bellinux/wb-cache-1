While a few of the videos are inaccurate due to the developer making dramatic changes to the environment and gameplay, they still maintained the general roots of the game and the storyline.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) <b>and</b> <b>victims</b> being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E

5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, <b>and</b> <b>victims</b> comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|During this session, the Native Hawaiian legislators {{attempted}} to pass new {{laws in the}} interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement <b>and</b> <b>victims</b> of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They promoted the use and study of the Hawaiian language, especially in the government and courts. Ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature, this session was conducted in both Hawaiian and English with the aid of an interpreter. Many of the territorial legislators in this session did not speak English. They also created the first county bill, which would have created five counties named after former Hawaiian aliʻi.|$|E

40|$|The {{object and}} the problem in this {{research}} were how the protection procedure to the witness <b>and</b> <b>victim</b> in household violence crime? How the effectiveness of witness <b>and</b> <b>victim</b> protection in household violence crime? What the problems faced by the protection to witness <b>and</b> <b>victim?</b> What efforts which were done to reveal the problems? The method used were socio-juridical, that was research discussed about Rule No. 13 / 2006 about witness <b>and</b> <b>victim</b> protection <b>and</b> the other related rule. Witness <b>and</b> <b>victim</b> of household violence crime was somebody who felt, saw, and suffer in physical and psychological because of the action which {{was done by the}} other where the action was violence or threaten in household scope. Protection to the witness was important since the victim condition was not good. It could be seen from the moment when the victim report the crime, many of them still shocked and hurt, so that they were difficult to give explanation. Beside, the witness <b>and</b> <b>victim</b> position was important in crime investigation. According to the research which was done in Police Office of Malang, there could be concluded that in application, law protection to the witness <b>and</b> <b>victim</b> was not run well/ineffective. It caused by several inhibition factors. The inhibitions were: lack of fund by Police Office, there was no safety house for witness <b>and</b> <b>victim,</b> un-optimal the Center of Service, un-optimal task management in Police Office, lack of members owed by the Police Office, especially PPA unit. The efforts which was done by the Police Office in revealing the inhibitions were: if the victims poor, the police office paid the cost, the Police office also coordinate with the City Municipal of Malang to give fund for witness <b>and</b> <b>victim</b> protection. The Police Office tried hard to present the safety house by coordinating related elements, the Police Office also coordinating with The Center of Service elements so that the Center of Service could run again. For the unoptimal task management, the unit couldn’t do further since the existed members have been busy with their job so that the protection couldn’t be done. The lack of members made the Unit had requested more members...|$|R
