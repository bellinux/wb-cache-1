50|$|Increasing {{the weight}} of <b>a</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{increases}} disk loading. For a given weight, <b>a</b> <b>helicopter</b> with shorter rotors will have higher disk loading, and will require more engine power to hover. A low disk loading improves autorotation performance in rotorcraft. Typically, an autogyro (or gyroplane) has a lower rotor disc loading than <b>a</b> <b>helicopter,</b> which provides <b>a</b> slower rate of descent in autorotation.|$|R

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{moves from}} hover to forward flight it enters a state called {{translational}} lift which provides extra lift without increasing power.

40|$|At {{the stage}} of {{conceptual}} design of <b>a</b> <b>helicopter,</b> it is <b>a</b> general way using low fidelity analysis methods because {{of a large number}} of design calculations and trade-off studies. Determination of empirical parameters used in analysis codes for more practical design, depends on an user’s design experiences, which effects on the accuracy and the fidelity of conceptual design results. Thus, more precise and logical method should be required to determine the empirical parameters used in the conceptual design of <b>a</b> <b>helicopter.</b> The present method is to be used not only in verifying the empirical parameters generated by design requirements, but also regenerate them if they contain any errors. Empirical parameters produced by present method were used to design <b>a</b> <b>helicopter</b> with <b>a</b> payload objective and performance constraints of <b>an</b> operating <b>helicopter.</b> <b>As</b> a result, weights and geometries of designed helicopter matched the target value within 5 % significance level, proving that the suggested parameter generating method can be useful in the conceptual design of <b>a</b> <b>helicopter...</b>|$|R
