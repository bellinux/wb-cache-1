5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey of {{aggressive}} mimics. The <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, entering their web and plucking its silk threads until the spider approaches. This vibrational aggressive mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which spiders treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants deter many {{potential}} predators {{due to their}} sting. The blindsnake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens consumes the larvae and pupae of Myrmecia, while avoiding the potent sting of the adults, which it is vulnerable to. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) also eats the eggs and larvae. Nymphs of the <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> species Ptilocnemus lemur lure these ants to themselves by {{trying to make the}} ant sting them, by waving its hind legs around to attract a potential prey item. Body remains of Myrmecia have been found in the stomach contents of the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis). The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), the black currawong (Strepera versicolor), and the white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) prey on these ants, but few are successfully taken.|$|E

25|$|Aggressive mimicry {{need not}} involve {{the sense of}} vision. For example, the <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> preys on spiders, {{entering}} their web and plucking its silk threads. This produces vibrations that match the pattern of vibrations made by typical prey caught in the web, causing the spider to approach.|$|E
25|$|Z. annulosus has {{basically}} adapted {{to live and}} hunt around A. decemarticulatus. The <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> species uses this particular plant to raise their nymphs because the trichomes of the plant deter larger ant species that may kill the young developing bugs. Also, the bugs secrete a sticky substance {{that allows them to}} walk on top of these trichomes, thus avoiding the traps of A. decemarticulatus. So in the relationship between Z. annulosus and H. physophora, the bug receives shelter from potential large predator ants, and the plant received a second line of defense against herbivores. The <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> also cohabitates the plant peacefully with the ants. They hunt in similar areas on the plant, but the assassin bugs are suspected to actively avoid any of the ants because they are much quicker than the ants.|$|E
25|$|If the {{multiple}} relationships of A. decemarticulatus were not complex enough, they also commonly interact with an <b>assassin</b> <b>bug,</b> Zelus annulosus, which often resides on H. physophora plants. However, these bugs have adapted physiological and behavioral characteristics {{that allow them}} to avoid the predation of A. decemarticulatus, while also maintaining a mutualistic relationship with the plant.|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{developed}} {{in order to determine}} whether the selected species most commonly kept feeding insects affect fertility in captive bred <b>assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> Platymeris biguttatus. Used feeding insects were Blaptica dubia roaches, Acheta domestica crickets and larvae of Tenebrio molitor bugs. The reason of using <b>assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> Platymeris biguttatus was their popularity among breeders, their easy care needs and their superior fertility. <b>Assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> were kept in an air conditioned room with a constant temperature conditions and light regime. It has been shown that the given diet has no effect on fertility in this kind of bugs, also that breeding in groups has negative impact on fertility of this <b>assassin</b> <b>bugs</b> species. The results of this study could demonstrate the importance of proper feeding in keeping these bugs and help breeders to have better results...|$|R

25|$|By simply {{observing the}} stem of one H. physophora individual, we see the complex {{interactions}} between four different species: an ant, a plant, a fungus, and an <b>assassin</b> <b>bug,</b> {{as well as all}} of the prey that lands on the plant. The plant gives a little of its own resources to the predators, but it gets two forms of defense against herbivores and parasitic plants. To the plant, this defense is worth much more than the loss of some food. The plant has maximized its own fitness by establishing two separate and independent relationships that are not very costly but very rewarding. The insects both benefit as well, given a safe habitat and a steady food supply of other insects that land on the prey. In the perspective of A. decemarticulatus, they do not actively give any of their own resources to the plant or to the <b>assassin</b> <b>bug.</b> They simply live among them, use their resources, and hunt.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} carnivore is {{the genus}} Roridula; {{the plants in}} this genus produce sticky leaves with resin-tipped glands and look extremely similar {{to some of the}} larger sundews. However, they do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, they form a mutualistic symbiosis with species of <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> (genus Pameridea), which eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' faeces. By some definitions this would still constitute botanical carnivory.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the ants, Z. annulosus {{normally}} {{lives on}} younger H. physophora individuals, where the females lay eggs on the stem. As {{they begin to}} develop, the young bugs will live among the trichomes of the stem and hunt on {{the leaves of the}} plant. The relationship between the <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> and the plant acts independently from that between the ants and the plant. One difference between the two relationships, however, is that the assassin bugs do not take any food source from the plant like the ants do.|$|E

500|$|Blindsnakes of {{the family}} Typhlopidae are known to consume Myrmecia broods, {{although}} smaller blindsnakes avoid them since they are vulnerable to their stings. Predatory invertebrates such as assassin bugs and redback spiders prey on jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants, and echidnas, particularly the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) hunt jack jumper ants, eating their larvae and eggs. Nymphs of the <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> species Ptilocnemus lemur lure these ants by {{trying to make the}} ant sting them. The jack jumper ant is a host to the parasite [...] gregarines (Gregarinasina). Ants that host this parasite change colour from their typical black appearance to brown. This was discovered when brown jack jumpers were dissected and found to have gregarinasina spores, while black jack jumpers showed no spores. If it is present in large numbers, the parasite interferes with the normal darkening of the cuticles while the ant is in its pupal stage. The cuticle softens due to the gregarine parasite.|$|E
2500|$|When startled, the <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> Platymeris rhadamanthus (family Reduviidae), [...] {{is capable}} of {{spitting}} venom up to 30cm at potential threats. The saliva of this insect contains at least six proteins including large amounts of protease, hyaluronidase, and phospholipase which are known to cause intense local pain, vasodilation, and edema.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{other species}} of the genus Portia, P. africana prefers to hunt web-based spiders, jumping spiders and other types in that order. When hunting web-based spiders, Portias use trial and error {{to find a way}} to mislead the prey until the Portia is in a {{position}} to bite the victim. While other Portias live and hunt as individuals, P. africana forms large populations both in savanna areas and in the dense [...] "cities" [...] which social jumping spiders build in vegetation near the shoreline of lakes. In the savanna, groups of P. africana, generally consisting of small juveniles, delay the prey until one juvenile bites the victim, and sometimes the juvenile shares the food with other. In vegetation near shorelines, P. africana hunts in the social jumping spiders' cities. There, two species of <b>assassin</b> <b>bug</b> prey on P. africana, and one also preys on the other.|$|E

2500|$|In Central and South America, {{the most}} common {{incidence}} of chronic megacolon is that observed in about 20% of patients affected with Chagas disease. Chagas is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellate protozoan transmitted by the feces of a hematophagous insect, the <b>assassin</b> <b>bug,</b> when it feeds. Chagas can also be acquired congenitally, through blood transfusion or organ transplant, and rarely through contaminated food (for example garapa). There are several theories on how megacolon (and also megaesophagus) develops in Chagas disease. The [...] Austrian-Brazilian physician and pathologist Fritz Köberle {{was the first to}} propose the neurogenic hypothesis based on the documented destruction of the Auerbach's plexus in the walls of the intestinal tracts of Chagas patients.

His research proved that, by extensively quantifying the number of neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the Auerbach's plexus, that: ...|$|E
