5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or <b>anodized</b> and when <b>anodized</b> may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.|$|E

40|$|<b>Anodizing</b> of {{aluminum}} {{is a fascinating}} technical study and a practical finishing system of great commercial importance. This paper will discuss coil <b>anodizing</b> as {{an important part of}} the <b>anodizing</b> industry. Some unpublished information on the range of organic sulfonic acids which could be used for integral color <b>anodizing</b> is covered. A theory regarding the movement of chromium in the barrier layer during the <b>anodizing</b> is proposed. Some ideas on the mechanism of sealing, the resulting anodic coating structure, and the usefullness of incremental dissolution in studying these phenomena are described. Coil <b>anodizing</b> Coil <b>anodizing</b> is a branch of commercial <b>anodizing</b> which has received little notice in the technical literature 1. Electrochemically coil <b>anodizing</b> is identicd to piece part <b>anodizing,</b> but the material handling is quite different. A coil of rolled aluminum is mounted on the payoff chuck and the sheet is pulled over and under rolls through a line of tanks in which the various individual treatments are accomplished. Cleaning, etching or bright dipping, <b>anodizing,</b> coloring, and sealing are completed as the metal winds through the line prior to recoiling at the end of the line...|$|R
40|$|<b>Anodizing</b> {{is always}} {{used as an}} {{effective}} surface modification method to improve the corrosion resistance and wear resistance of titanium alloy. The sodium tartrate <b>anodizing</b> is {{a new kind of}} environmental <b>anodizing</b> method. In this work, the effects of sodium tartrate <b>anodizing</b> on mechanical property were studied. The oxide film was performed on the TA 15 titanium alloy using sodium tartrate as the film former. The effects of this <b>anodizing</b> and the traditional acid <b>anodizing</b> on the fatigue life of TA 15 alloy were compared.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{the effect}} of <b>anodizing</b> voltage on the morphologies, pore {{diameter}} and interpore distance on the porous anodic alumina formed on aluminium manganese alloy was reported.

Well ordered porous anodic alumina was obtained when <b>anodizing</b> voltage were 40 V and 50 V respectively.

Supported by a bronze <b>anodized</b> aluminum lattice, the sunscreens are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas.

5|$|Niobium {{is used as}} a {{precious}} metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin <b>anodized</b> oxide layer. In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian €25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin, and the 2006 Austrian €25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin.|$|E

The influence of the parameter variation on the microstructure of the oxide layers was investigated by SEM.

5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an <b>anodized</b> aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} reflex sight housing.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of <b>anodized</b> aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
