5|$|Castle Park (sometimes {{referred}} to as Castle Green) is a public open space in Bristol, England, managed by Bristol City Council. It is bounded by the Floating Harbour and Castle Street to the south, Lower Castle Street to the east, and Broad Weir, Newgate and Wine Street to the north. Its western boundary is less obviously defined and {{has been the subject}} of controversy, perhaps because the area around High Street and St Mary-le-Port Church, though not part of the park and always intended for development, is often considered at the same time as the park. The park was completed and opened on 30 September 1978, and occupies most of the site which had contained Bristol's main shopping area. Much of this area was heavily damaged in the Blitz during the Second World War, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> remained was subsequently demolished.|$|E

Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E

5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

The verifiability principle claims that meaningful statements must be supported by empirical evidence or logical requirements.|$|E

Muslims are legislated by the Sunnah to remove under arm hair and pubic hair on a weekly basis; not doing after a 40-day period is considered sinful in the Sharia.|$|E

25|$|The {{churches of}} San Zeno Maggiore, Verona, and San Michele, Pavia, present {{two types of}} facade that are typical of Italian Romanesque, that which reveals the {{architectural}} form of the building, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> screens it. At San Zeno, the components of nave and aisles are made clear by the vertical shafts that {{rise to the level}} of the central gable and by the varying roof levels. At San Miniato al Monte the definition of the architectural parts is made even clearer by the polychrome marble, a feature of many Italian Medieval facades, particularly in Tuscany.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} feature of Italian musical {{form in the}} 19th century, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> distinguishes it from musical developments elsewhere, is that it remained primarily operatic. All significant Italian composers of the century wrote opera almost {{to the exclusion of}} other forms, such as the symphony. There are no Italian symphonists in this century, the way one might speak of Brahms in Germany, for example. Many Italian composers, however, did write significant sacred music, such as Rossini a Stabat Mater and his late Petite messe solennelle and Verdi Messa da Requiem and Quattro Pezzi Sacri.|$|E

25|$|According to {{theories}} of postmodernity, economic and technological conditions {{of our age}} {{have given rise to}} a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only simulacra, inter-referential representations and copies of each other with no real, original, stable or objective source of communication and meaning. Globalization, brought on by innovations in communication, manufacturing and transportation, is often cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that inter-subjective, not objective, knowledge will be the dominant form of discourse under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.|$|E
25|$|Jan van der Lans (1933–2002), a {{professor}} of the psychology of religion at the Catholic University of Nijmegen, wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based Catholic Study Center for Mental Health, about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false mysticism. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality, but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, {{the distinction between the}} person who is the guru <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless, uncritical personality cult.|$|E
25|$|Meaning and truth. The most {{important}} and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern propositional logic. The Stoics distinguished between utterance (phone), which may be noise, speech (lexis), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (logos), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory {{is the idea that}} what is expressed by a sentence, called a lekton, is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a proposition. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word Dion, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.|$|E
