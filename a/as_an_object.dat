5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> of beauty engendering a sensual response, {{rather than for}} the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E

5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E
5|$|The Pont du Gard {{has been}} a tourist {{attraction}} for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an obligatory stop for French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), {{many of whom have}} left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> of historical importance and French national pride.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the plaque}} {{suggests}} it would have belonged in a shrine, possibly <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> of worship; it was probably set into a mud-brick wall. Such a shrine {{might have been a}} dedicated space in a large private home or other house, but not the main focus of worship in one of the cities' temples, which would have contained representations of gods sculpted in the round. Mesopotamian temples at the time had a rectangular cella often with niches to both sides. According to Thorkild Jacobsen, that shrine could have been located inside a brothel (see below).|$|E

40|$|This study, {{carried out}} among 1397 Flemish high school pupils, {{examines}} whether adolescents’ experience {{of success and}} failure in the school system is related to their use of the mobile phone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> status <b>object.</b> In line with Bourdieu’s cultural capital theory, a conformity, compensation and resistance hypothesis are formulated. The results confirm the conformity hypothesis: conform to the social image that the school system bestows on them, and independent from their social class background, adolescents in academic tracks were less likely to use the mobile phone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> status <b>object.</b> The compensation hypothesis was partially confirmed: adolescents who lag behind in combination with a drop to a non-academic school track, and adolescents with a negative academic self-concept were more likely to use the mobile phone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> status <b>object,</b> but no direct relationship was found with lagging behind. The resistance hypothesis was fully supported: a negative attitude towards school mediates the relationship between lagging behind, school track, academic self-concept {{and the use of the}} mobile phone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> status <b>object.</b> Finally, self-esteem was found to relate positively to the use of the mobile phone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> status <b>object,</b> which suggests that adolescents who use the mobile phone <b>as</b> <b>a</b> status <b>object</b> have achieved <b>a</b> successful identity in other domains than the academic domain. Gender and age were found to moderate some of the relationships found. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of the minhag ("prevailing local custom") is also a point of dispute between Karo and Isserles: while Karo held fast to original authorities and material reasons, Isserles considered the minhag <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> of great importance, {{and not to be}} omitted in a codex. This point, especially, induced Isserles to write his glosses to the Shulchan Aruch, that the customs (minhagim) of the Ashkenazim might be recognized, and not be set aside through Karo's reputation.|$|E
