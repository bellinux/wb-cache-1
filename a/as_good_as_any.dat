5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, the sergeant is <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced {{to get into a}} fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E

25|$|In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men's College in Blackfriars Road. The moving {{spirit was}} a {{portmanteau}} worker, Wm.

At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> country squire.|$|E
25|$|The Central Arkansas Transit Authority {{provides}} {{bus service}} {{in and through}} the neighborhood. One Downtown to West Little Rock route travels Markham Street to Kavanaugh Boulevard providing residents access to both Downtown and the Rodney Parham Road area. Bus routes along 7th Street and Capitol Avenue provide access to the West Markham Street area and the Otter Creek Neighborhood. The bus system is radial, downtown to the outskirts and back, much like the spokes of a wheel. Therefore, to go east, north or south, the rider must first go downtown and transfer. The Capitol View/Stifft's Station neighborhood has a service level <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> residential area in metropolitan Little Rock.|$|E

500|$|In early 1911, Mertz went to London to {{meet with}} the Australian {{geologist}} and explorer Douglas Mawson. Mawson, who had served as physicist during Ernest Shackleton's 1908–09 Nimrod Expedition, was planning his own Antarctic expedition. In his application letter, Mertz wrote that he hoped Mawson would be using skis, as [...] "they have proved so good for the purpose & knowing that I am <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> one on skys." [...] While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to make an exception, and hire the Swiss as a ski instructor. First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 49Greenland Huskies, aboard the expedition ship SY Aurora, bound for Hobart.|$|E
500|$|As {{the captain}} and {{instigator}} of the 1888–89 Nativesthe first New Zealand team to tour the British IslesWarbrick had a lasting impact {{on the development of}} rugby in his homeland. When the Natives returned from tour they introduced a style of rugby <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> ever seen in the country. According to Ryan, [...] "their brand of sensational running style and combined forward play had never been seen in New Zealand." [...] The speculative nature of the tour, which was outside the control of an official authority, concerned many of the provincial unions and gave further momentum to efforts to form a national body. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was founded which would, among other things, organise any representative tours. Many of the Natives went on to contribute to rugby as representative players, administrators, or referees. Two players, Ellison and Gage, went on to captain New Zealand.|$|E

500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an A rating {{and noted that}} [...] "whatever reservations I may have over a three-episode story arc, this final entry {{does a good job}} of re-investing us in the show's basic ideals, returning us to a rough form of the status quo in a way that's exciting, emotionally powerful, and satisfying despite only incremental forward momentum". In addition, Handlen praised David Duchovny's performance, stating that he [...] "was on fire the whole episode". Tom Kessenich praised {{the second part of the}} episode and wrote [...] "'Redux II' is the standout hour of the two without question. With Scully on her deathbed, Mulder meets his sister only to lose her again and is put in a position where he may deal with the devil. The finale moments [...] are quite simply perfect and <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> the show ever produced." [...] Shearman and Pearson rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted [...] " [...] is a likable enough little romp, but it's too leisurely to be exciting, too predictable to be revealing, and–most crucially, not really funny enough to be comedy. Vitaris gave the second part of the episode a slightly less negative review than the first, but only awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized the ending, noting that [...] "it's all wrapped up neatly yet ambiguously." [...] However, Vitaris did note that [...] "what makes 'Redux II' tolerable is Duchovny, who always hits the right notes of anger, despair, grief, relief, or emotional numbness." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux II" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E

2500|$|The episode {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "dark, realistic, and, because it was shot on videotape and live-on-camera, very stagy.

[...] The Avengers Forever! website technically regards the episode as at least <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> Cathy Gale episode, with some [...] "excellent camera work, including very creative special-effects", but spotted deficiencies in the [...] "repetitive use of certain music cues, and a slightly awkward sequence when Dr Keel's fiancée is shot." [...] They remarked that the episode shows a [...] "high degree of professionalism and skill: good writing, good acting, great direction (no surprise, really, with Don Leaver at the helm), and, in particular, a fine lead. Ian Hendry demonstrates exactly why Sydney Newman was so very anxious to get him in front of television viewers: he is a natural. His acting is easy, smooth and captivating." ...|$|E

The least effective of the stories in this book occupies 32 pages; the most 96; {{and there are two}} of intermediate length and merit. All are of quite a high standard as long-short stories, but none is <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> of Mrs Christie's full-length detective novels.

[...] Which one? Viking isn't telling; but I'll agree that one entry here is at least <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> I can remember among some two dozen novelettes of Nero Wolfe. [...] "Die Like a Dog" [...] (which, just to be confusing, appeared in American as [...] "The Body in the Hall" [...] and in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine as [...] "A Dog in the Daytime") combines one of Stout's most entertaining pictures of life in the menage at 918 West Thirty-fifth, as the hard-headed Nero {{turns out to be a}} dog lover at heart, with one of the best pure puzzles I've read in years: a technical model in the fair play and misdirection of the classic adventure form. The other two novelettes here assembled are only slightly less good; and connoisseurs will note with interest the fact {{that one of the}}m succeeds, incredibly, in keeping Wolfe away from the comforts [...] of Thirty-fifth Street for an entire case.|$|E
2500|$|Downtown Jimmy of Extreme Gamer {{complained that}} the {{controls}} were too simple and criticized the camera for not having a lock on feature. While {{he felt that the}} graphics were not impressive, they still looked good enough to surpass his expectations of what the game looked like. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot found that the visuals captured the look of the anime very well. She stated that the controls were complex but featured little depth. She mentioned that attacks made the battle within the game feel [...] "tremendous", but stated the Ki building process would take attention away from the combat due to being time consuming and leaving the player wide open to an attack. She also had complaints over the multiplayer, claiming that as the screen became split down the middle on offline multiplayer, it would limit the player's view and that online multiplayer was better but would be riddled with opponents that would instantly log off if things don't go their way. Jeremy Jastrzab of PAL Gaming Network pointed out that the game was good by itself, but was not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> of the previous games, stating that [...] "there is no excuse for it being worse than its predecessors." ...|$|E
