They lauded the overworld map as an elegant alternative to a menu to select levels. Allgame's Skyler Miller praised the game's level design, graphics, music, and nonlinearity. Dengeki referred to the game as a popular title and expressed excitement over its re-release on the Game Boy Advance system. The items hidden in the game's levels, such as the warp whistles, were well-received: Rignall regarded them as part of the game's <b>addictiveness,</b> and Sheff stated that finding them provided a sense of satisfaction. Both Screw Attack and GamesRadar ranked it the best NES game made. GamesRadar claimed that while Super Mario Bros. defined its genre, Super Mario Bros. 3 perfected it.|$|E

500|$|Micro Machines {{received}} critical acclaim. The multiplayer mode {{in particular}} was well received, and some reviewers complimented the graphics and <b>addictiveness.</b> Reviewing the Mega Drive version, Computer and Video Gamess Steve Keen lauded the vehicle movement and sound effects, and Paul Rand praised the multiplayer mode. Both described Micro Machines {{as one of the}} better racing games on the Mega Drive. In 1994, Micro Machines was listed as their best Mega Drive driving game. The reviewer from Mega magazine eulogised the playability, but criticised the lack of a save function. Nevertheless, he thought the game was [...] "destined to become a classic".

GamesMasters Jim Douglas lauded the graphics, [...] "brilliant" [...] controls, and the two-player mode, and James Leach described the Mega Drive version as [...] "even better" [...] than the NES version, and eulogised the <b>addictiveness.</b> A reviewer from Mean Machines Sega agreed with GamesMaster by complimenting the <b>addictiveness</b> of two-player mode, but believed the single-player mode is too easy.

The game was described as having an [...] "undeniable charm" [...] by a reviewer from French magazine [...]|$|E
500|$|Theme Park {{received}} critical acclaim. The gameplay, graphics, and <b>addictiveness</b> {{in particular}} were well received. A reviewer of Edge {{commented that the}} game is complex, but praised the detail and <b>addictiveness.</b> PC Gamers Gary Whitta was highly impressed with the game: he eulogised the fun factor and compared it to that of SimCity 2000.

500|$|The Jaguar {{version was}} noted by critics as having {{problems}} such as slowdown and lack of a save option, although some liked the graphics and gameplay. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the game itself is great fun, but that the Jaguar conversion had confusing menus and dithered text which is excessively difficult to read. GamePro echoed these criticisms and further stated that the Jaguar version suffers from frustrating slowdown. They summarised that [...] "Ocean didn't work hard enough to make Theme Park look and sound good on the Jaguar". A reviewer for Next Generation took the reverse position, saying that the Jaguar conversion [...] "is seamless" [...] and the game itself was mediocre. Their elaboration was that [...] "Slow gameplay and confusing layouts keep it from ever achieving the <b>addictiveness</b> of the other 'god' games, and most players will find themselves bored before they've even run {{through all of the}} options". German magazine Atari Insides reviewer complimented the <b>addictiveness,</b> but the lack of save opportunities was criticised, and a reviewer from ST Computer believed the game's complexity and colourful graphics assured it of being long and attractive. Mega Funs main criticism of the Jaguar version was its inability to save in-game.|$|E
500|$|Praise from reviewers {{focused on}} the game's visuals and design, while {{criticism}} {{focused on the}} audio. Three of Zzap!64s reviewers—Julian Rignall, Gary Liddon, and Gary Penn—called the graphics [...] "amazing", well-executed, and [...] "varied"; but they described the audio as sparse. Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its <b>addictiveness</b> outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game. Computer Gamer reviewer Mike Roberts praised Spindizzys gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a period of adjustment, particularly when using a joystick. Crashs reviewer called Spindizzy [...] "one of the most addictive" [...] ZX Spectrum games, noting its innovative use of shape changing, multiple view angles, and speed control. The audio was seen as lacking compared {{to the rest of}} the game, but was still described as good. Phil South of Your Sinclair gave the game high marks for graphics, playability, value for money, and <b>addictiveness.</b> He praised the ability to change viewpoints and the realistic movements of the character sprite.

Recommended".|$|E
500|$|Julian Rignall of Mean Machines {{referred}} to Super Mario Bros. 3 as the [...] "finest video game" [...] {{he had ever}} played, citing its <b>addictiveness,</b> depth, and challenge. A second Mean Machines reviewer, Matt Regan, anticipated the game would be a top-selling title in the United Kingdom, and echoed Rignall's praise, calling it a [...] "truly brilliant game". Regan further stated that the game offered elements which tested the player's [...] "brains and reflexes", and that though the graphics were simple, they were [...] "incredibly varied". In {{a preview of the}} game, Nintendo Power gave it high marks in graphics, audio, challenge, gameplay, and enjoyability.|$|E
500|$|Other {{versions}} {{were also}} well received. Reviewing the NES version, [...] praised the scrolling and controls. GamePro reviewer {{stated that the}} racing scenario variety and the vehicles being based on Galoob's Micro Machines toys made the game original. Mean Machines reviewer liked the presentation and playability, but described the sprites as [...] "inconsistent". In {{a review of the}} SNES version, GamePro lauded the [...] "cartoony" [...] graphics and [...] "cheerful" [...] sound effects, along with the lack of car customisation to keep the gameplay [...] "basic". Coming Soon Magazine's reviewer criticised the PC version's [...] "simple" [...] graphics, but thought highly of its <b>addictiveness</b> and [...] "well-produced" [...] animation.|$|E
500|$|Marvel vs. Capcom Origins {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics upon release, with aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic assigning scores of 72% and 72/100 for the PlayStation 3 version and 80% and 78/100 for the Xbox 360 version, respectively. The game received praise for its {{preservation of the}} original arcade releases' integrity, additions of online multiplayer and challenges, and variety of unlockable content. On the other hand, it received criticism for its unbalanced character rosters and outdated gameplay mechanics. Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded Origins a 9/10, stating the game [...] "does a fine job of staying true to the originals, while the addition of dynamic challenges provide a new layer of <b>addictiveness</b> that helps to overshadow how much these games have aged {{in the past two}} decades." ...|$|E
500|$|Reed criticised the repetitiveness of the game, {{stating that}} whilst 128 levels was good value for money, the {{gameplay}} was [...] "merely a repeat" [...] {{of what the}} player has already accomplished and that the multiplayer mode could prove [...] "annoying very quickly". Stewart also criticised the game's repetitiveness and stated that he felt general gameplay was [...] "shallow", despite admitting it was addictive. Gerstmann similarly found the action repetitive and stated that there was [...] "not enough variety", especially in the multiplayer mode. However, Miller praised the gameplay as [...] "fast, fun and addictive", as he expected a game on the Xbox Live Arcade to be. Will Freeman of Video Gamer noted that {{the large number of}} levels caused the game to feel repetitive, but praised the overall <b>addictiveness</b> and fast pace of the game.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{had similar}} {{opinions}} of other versions. Mean Machines Sega described {{the game as}} [...] "the most complex Megadrive game ever created", and eulogised playability and longevity, but criticised the behaviour of the handymen. CU Amiga praised the <b>addictiveness</b> of the Amiga version, and called the game [...] "colourful". The visuals were likewise commended by Jeuxvideo.com on the PC and Macintosh versions, and the British humour was complimented as well. German magazine Mega Fun compared the SNES version to the Mega Drive version, and said the SNES version had better controls and music, creating atmosphere. Reviewing the PlayStation version, Maximum said that the game [...] "is {{probably one of the}} best sim games around. It manages {{to strike a balance between}} in-depth game play and personality, which you don't get with the more brow-furrowing games of this genre", although the only improvement being a view option was cited as a disappointment.|$|E
500|$|Uniqueness and {{originality}} garnered critical praise. Craig Wessel of GameSpy felt {{the game is}} a unique and enjoyable strategy game. Originality was commended by PC Gamer reviewer, who also eulogised the [...] "eautiful" [...] graphics, [...] "awesome" [...] interface, and its creativity, and Gamezilla's Alex Karls, who also remarked the game [...] "lives up to its hype". Edge reviewer agreed about the originality, and described the game as [...] "a colossal achievement".

Computer Games Magazine complimented the originality and [...] "amazing" [...] creature AI, but complained about the bugs.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} on the Amiga version's graphics and sound: [...] and French magazine [...] reviewers liked them, but CU Amiga criticised the graphics as [...] "poorly detailed" [...] and the sound as [...] "simple". Other comments from critics included The One reviewer's lauding of the two-player mode, described as [...] "the best two-player racing game we've ever seen", Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power praising of the locations and control, although he criticised the [...] "limited" [...] single-player mode and lack of parallax scrolling. Paul Roundell of Amiga Action praised the originality, but criticised the head-to-head mode, saying it [...] "breaks the excitement", and a reviewer from Amiga Computing believed the tracks were [...] "entertaining" [...] and liked that they were made up of [...] "silly things". The vehicles racing in the environments was described by Steve Bradley of Amiga Format as [...] "absolutely bloody brilliant", and he also praised the <b>addictiveness.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{design team}} {{started with a}} very simple playable game. They {{strengthen}} the [...] "fun" [...] aspects and fixed or removed the unenjoyable ones, a process Sid Meier called [...] "surrounding the fun". After the revision, they played it again, repeating the cycle of revision and play. Playing the game repeatedly and in-depth was a rule at Firaxis. In the single-player mode, the team tried extreme strategies to find any sure-fire paths to victory and to see how often a particular computer faction ends up at the bottom. The goal {{was a product of}} unprecedented depth, scope, longevity, and <b>addictiveness,</b> where the player is always challenged by the game to come up with new strategies with no all-powerful factions or unstoppable tactics. According to Reynolds, the process has been around since Sid Meier's early days at Microprose. At Firaxis, as iterations continue, they expand the group giving feedback, bringing in outside gamers with fresh perspectives. Alpha Centauri was the first Firaxis game with public beta testers.|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation version's main problem, {{as noted}} by critics, was the controls. It was cited by reviewers from GameSpot, IGN, Eurogamer, and Edge as a major downside. Its {{reception}} was not entirely negative: James Mielke of GameSpot also commended the <b>addictiveness,</b> and described the port as [...] "almost completely intact". IGN agreed with others about the humour, by praising it as [...] "wonderfully sick". It was further commented that the game's [...] "brilliance" [...] made it a [...] "must-have". The sentiments about the controls and humour were echoed by Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, who reviewed it on the PlayStation Network. Absolute PlayStation's reviewers had a mixed view about the graphics: they criticised the resolution and colour palette, but complimented the sprites. The user interface was criticised as being reminiscent of a 16-bit game. Despite the criticisms, they agreed with others about the humour, and described the game as [...] "a blast to play".|$|E
500|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament {{was well}} received. Critics were {{impressed}} with the J-Cart and the extra tracks and vehicles. Mark Patterson of Computer and Video Games praised the Mega Drive version's J-Cart enabling more than two players without extra hardware, and described the game as [...] "bloody brilliant!". Edge reviewer commented that the extra vehicles, tracks, and game modes increase re-playability of both single-player and multiplayer. The reviewers of GamesMaster lauded its <b>addictiveness</b> and commented that it is amongst the best or highest-rated games they have played. A reviewer from Mean Machines Sega believed the game exceeded their expectations, and echoed other opinions by praising the re-playability provided by the extra levels and vehicles. [...] reviewer eulogised the animation, saying it lacks slowdown, and playability. Reviewers from Sega Magazine were highly positive: Richard Leadbetter and Tom Guise lauded the multiplayer mode, saying it is [...] "untouchable". The playability were also given high praise, and was described as [...] "superb". Leadbetter believed the game is [...] "totally brilliant and well worth the asking price".|$|E
500|$|The Game Boy Advance re-release {{as part of}} the Classic NES series holds {{a rating}} of 66% on Metacritic based on 10 reviews. Most reviews pointed out the game's <b>addictiveness</b> and praise the {{addition}} of wireless multiplayer, but some questioned the relevance of the game's re-release as a standalone title. Eurogamer said the game was [...] "still as playable, addictive and maddening as it was back in 1990" [...] but criticized Nintendo for re-releasing classic games as standalone titles in the Classic NES Series instead of as a compilation, like Atari's Atari Anthology or Midway's Midway Arcade Treasures. Craig Harris, in his review for IGN, sarcastically expressed unease over the game's use of medicine. He enjoyed the addictive gameplay, but criticized the black-and-white manual which made it difficult to understand the color-based gameplay mechanics. While 1UP.com noted that the game's [...] "color-matching action is more engrossing than Mario Bros. turtle-punching platform hopping", the reviewer strongly questioned whether this re-release is worth its sale price by itself when a version of Dr. Mario was included in another Game Boy Advance game, [...]|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from British magazine Edge {{praised the}} artificial intelligence, describing it as [...] "extremely impressive". [...] It and the graphics were again praised by PC Zone reviewer, {{but he was}} also among the reviewers to criticize the game's similarity to the original. Nevertheless, Dungeon Keeper 2 was named as a PC Zone classic. A reviewer from Computer and Video Games was also among those who eulogized the graphics, and he did likewise with the replay value, and the multiplayer, describing it as [...] "one of the best ever on PC". Another reviewer who complimented the improved artificial intelligence was John Houlihan of GameSpot UK, who described the game as a [...] "more than worthy sequel". Jeuxvideo.com's reviewer also lauded the graphics and gameplay, but considered the scenarios repetitive. The British PC Gamers reviewer said Dungeon Keeper 2 is what Dungeon Keeper [...] "should have been in the first place", and cited the entertainment, innovation, and <b>addictiveness</b> as why the game is [...] "pure Bullfrog", but criticized the combat because he believed {{it was a case of}} putting all creatures in and hoping to win.|$|E
500|$|UK {{magazines}} Computer and Video Games and its spin-off Mean Machines – in the latter's premiere issue – {{gave the}} game positive reviews. Computer and Video Games praised the animation {{in particular and}} called it the best game of its type on that platform, using phrases such as [...] "familiar air of polish and ingenuity" [...] and [...] "piles of addiction guaranteed". Mean Machines [...] Matt Regan said it [...] "ranks {{as one of the}} greatest Sega Master System games ever!"; he compared the gameplay to the Mario series of video games and praised the game's depth, saying that [...] "there's always something new to discover, be it a key to a previously locked door or even a secret room!" [...] Julian Rignall praised the game's graphics and the huge world players can explore, which he says contributes to the game's <b>addictiveness.</b> He said that [...] "the combination of adventuring, shooting and platform action results in one of the best games of its type available on any console". Collectively, they praised the game overall presentation and graphics, saying that the sprites complement the background. While they additionally praised its playability for being [...] "accessible from the word go" [...] and longevity, they criticized its sound, saying that it [...] "could have been much better".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot {{praised the}} graphics, noting [...] "As {{good as the}} {{original}} Unreal looked, Unreal Tournament looks even better. The character models and skins look excellent, and {{there are quite a}} few choices to make when designing your character." [...] He also praised the multiplayer gameplay, weapons and level design: [...] "The first-person shooter genre is fiercely competitive. But Unreal Tournament rises above the rest with its solid multiplayer performance, from its good weapon balance to its great level design." [...] The game was similarly reviewed by GameSpy, who concluded: [...] "Unreal Tournament raises the bar for first person teamplay games. The mutators, bots, teams, and sheer number of maps give the game an awesome depth and replayability. This game is stuffed with content and polished until it gleams." [...] British magazine PC Zone was pleased with the [...] "very intelligent" [...] bots, but criticized the [...] "truly terrible" [...] music. Allgame complimented the <b>addictiveness</b> of Assault mode, and the game's replay value, calling it [...] "a glowing, shining beacon in a sea of multi-player games." [...] Computer and Video Games found the game to have an [...] "excellent" [...] single-player mode, adding that with an average AI skill the player will [...] "progress with little serious effort, taking a thrilling ride through spectacularly atmospheric levels and increasing numbers of opponents." [...] Eurogamer echoed that sentiment, and commented that the game is playable on low-end systems.|$|E
500|$|In a 2001 review, PC Zone, like Gamezilla, {{called the}} game [...] "classic", but also criticised its [...] "repetitive" [...] gameplay. Trent Ward of GameSpot remarked [...] "It's a rich {{strategy}} game {{that is both}} intuitive and challenging, both innovative and polished", and felt the game was [...] "among the best games released so far this year". Gamezilla and PC Zones beliefs were echoed by a reviewer of Edge, who described the game as a [...] "masterpiece". Another reviewer who agreed was from Computer and Video Games. He described Dungeon Keeper as [...] "totally awesome!", and praised the flexibility and detail. A reviewer of Jeuxvideo.com commended the replayability and sound effects. Robert Mayer of Computer Games Strategy Plus complimented the humour, sound, and the 3D view, and liked the elements working together, but criticised the artificial intelligence. Next Generation reviewer lauded the sense of humour, describing it as typical of Bullfrog, the [...] "dark and edgy" [...] soundtrack, further saying it mixes mediaeval themes with guitar sounds, and the gameplay's <b>addictiveness.</b> The only criticism was the [...] "occasionally weak" [...] artificial intelligence. Reviewers from the French magazine [...] were highly complimentary: one reviewer commented that Dungeon Keeper is in-between Warcraft and Theme Park due to its creature management and real-time combat, and also believed {{that it is hard}} to leave a level after winning. Another reviewer described Dungeon Keeper as [...] "The game of the year!". The magazine also listed Dungeon Keeper as their top PC CD game of summer 1997.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the first}} Mega Man game had {{relatively}} low sales, Mega Man 2 {{was a huge}} success. Since its 1988 release, Mega Man 2 has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide. The game is the highest selling in the Mega Man series and is Capcom's 30th highest selling title. Mega Man 2 was critically praised by critics. Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers—Steve Harris, Ed Semrad, Donn Nauert, and Jim Allee—rated the game favorably. They stated {{that it was better}} than the first Mega Man, citing the improved audio-visuals, new power-ups, and password system. Nauert and Allee, however, expressed disappointment that the game was less difficult than the first game. Nadia Oxford of 1UP.com complimented its aesthetics and gameplay. She further stated that Mega Man 2 improved the gameplay of its predecessor by removing excessively difficult elements. Mean Machines two reviewers, Julian Rignall and Matt Regan, praised several aspects of the game. Rignall lauded the gameplay, citing its <b>addictiveness</b> and the puzzles. Regan praised the difficulty and called the gameplay balanced. Both reviewers complimented the graphics, calling them detailed and stunning, and described it as a great platform game. Retro Gamer editor Richard Burton described it as a [...] "must-have" [...] title for the system, comments echoed by two of Electronic Gaming Monthlys reviewers. Zach Miller writing for Game Informer attributed the success of the game to the players' option to defeat the stages in the order of their choosing. He praised the simple control scheme and the variety of weapons and items. GamesRadar ranked it the second-best NES game ever made, calling it [...] "the pinnacle" [...] of the 8-bit Mega Man games.|$|E
500|$|The Game Gear and Master System {{versions}} versions {{were noted}} for {{the ability to}} link two units together, and the graphics, respectively. Reviewing the Game Gear version, Mean Machines Sega reviewer believed the method of two players on one console was [...] "revolutionary", but criticised the sprite flicker. Nevertheless, the game was described as [...] "Probably the most playable game around". A reviewer from GamePro described the graphics as colourful, but criticised the difficulty of distinguishing vehicles despite the colour-coding. The sounds were described as [...] "standard for the Game Gear", but the two-player via console sharing was lauded, but also described as [...] "clumsy". Computer and Video Gamess Deniz Ahmet had a similar opinion to GamePro reviewer by describing the graphics as [...] "well designed", and also had an opinion {{similar to that of}} Mean Machines Sega, with regards to the two-players sharing function. The conversion was described as [...] "extremely accurate". Sega Master Forces reviewer liked the originality and <b>addictiveness,</b> and described the Game Gear version as [...] "fantastic". The Master System version was complimented by Mean Machines Sega for its two-player mode, who described it as [...] "timeless", and the playability was felt to be [...] "great fun", but the graphics were criticised for being [...] "flat". Despite this, it was declared an [...] "absolutely essential purchase". French magazine [...] eulogised the Master System version's two-player mode and echoed Mean Machines Segas opinion by describing the game as [...] "A must", and in their Game Gear review, a similar compliment was made, and the game was also described as original and [...] "well done". The Game Gear and Master System versions were reviewed together by a reviewer from German magazine , who complimented their humour. The animation of the Game Gear version was described by [...] as [...] "breathtaking", and that of the Master System version was described as [...] "excellent", but their sprites were criticised: they said the Master System version deletes sprites when there is an excess of vehicles on screen, and the Game Gear version's sprites suffer slowdowns and blinks.|$|E

2500|$|Sociological {{research}} into pornography and LDS individuals has included one BYU study that showed of 192 male BYU students ages 18–27, 100% {{of the sample}} considered viewing pornography [...] "unacceptable". However, 35% reported having used pornography in the past 12 months, with 9.2% of the entire sample reporting viewing pornography {{at least once in}} the last month. No data was collected on female students. A nationwide study of paid porn subscriptions showed that the predominantly LDS state of Utah had the highest subscription rate of any state. The state's LDS governor Gary Herbert officially declared pornography to be a public health crisis in Utah in 2016. In 2017 the church school BYU released a study using data gathered online from nearly 700 unmarried English-speaking adults on the effects of religiosity on perceptions of porn <b>addictiveness</b> and relationship anxiety. The results showed that seeing oneself as addicted to pornography generated far more anxiety- and shame-related negative outcomes individually and in romantic relationships than any negative effects of consuming sexually explicit material.
