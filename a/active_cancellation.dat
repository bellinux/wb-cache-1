40|$|We {{present an}} experiment-based {{characterization}} of passive suppression and active self-interference cancellation mechanisms in full-duplex wireless communication systems. In particular, we consider passive suppression due to antenna separation {{at the same}} node, and <b>active</b> <b>cancellation</b> in analog and/or digital domain. First, we show that the average amount of cancellation increases for <b>active</b> <b>cancellation</b> techniques as the received self-interference power increases. Our characterization of the average cancellation {{as a function of}} the self-interference power allows us to show that for a constant signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver antenna (before any <b>active</b> <b>cancellation</b> is applied), the rate of a full-duplex link increases as the self-interference power increases. Second, we show that applying digital cancellation after analog cancellation can sometimes increase the self-interference, and thus digital cancellation is more effective when applied selectively based on measured suppression values. Third, we complete our study of the impact of self-interference cancellation mechanisms by characterizing the probability distribution of the self-interference channel before and after cancellation.

30|$|The used {{hardware}} has {{the capability}} of canceling maximum ∼ 70 dB for a 20 -MHz LTE signal (LTE 20) with respect to phase noise. The achievable <b>active</b> <b>cancellation</b> {{is limited by the}} power amplifier (PA) non-linearity and the auxiliary transmitter resolution. Under these two limitations, a total <b>active</b> <b>cancellation</b> gain of 63 dB for a LTE 20 signal could be demonstrated, with a joint usage of the analogue cancellation and the time domain digital cancellation stages. There are two approaches to achieve such gain. The first one is the option A depicted in Fig. 1 that uses a nonlinear intermodulation approach via Hammerstein PA model [29] within the digital SIC stage. This option employs the digital transmit signal as input [30]. The second approach, plotted as the option B in Fig. 1, uses the PA signal as direct input to the digital SIC stage with the need of an additional receiver, named the permanent measurement receiver, which contains the transmitter RF impairments and is common in a typical commercial RF design for PA linearization purposes.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{state-dependent}} two-user interference channel, {{where the state}} information is non-causally known at both transmitters but unknown to either of the receivers. We first propose two coding schemes for the discrete memoryless case: simultaneous encoding for the sub-messages in the first one and superposition encoding in the second one, both with rate splitting and Gel'fand-Pinsker coding. The corresponding achievable rate regions are established. Moreover, for the Gaussian case, {{we focus on the}} simultaneous encoding scheme and propose an <b>active</b> interference <b>cancellation</b> mechanism, which is a generalized dirty-paper coding technique, to partially eliminate the state effect at the receivers. The corresponding achievable rate region is then derived. We also propose several heuristic schemes for some special cases: the strong interference case, the mixed interference case, and the weak interference case. For the strong and mixed interference case, numerical results are provided to show that <b>active</b> interference <b>cancellation</b> significantly enlarges the achievable rate region.

The fixed-order robust controller is thus designed to achieve maximum noise attenua-tion with acceptable stability margins. Further, the method is able to accurately constrain noise amplification outside control bandwidth due to waterbed effect of nonminimum phase plants.

40|$|Full-duplex is {{the ability}} of a node to {{transmit}} and receive simultaneously in the same band. Ideal wireless full-duplex communication can double the spectral efficiency compared to the traditional half-duplex communication. In this dissertation, we study the challenges in realizing full-duplex communication. We tackle the challenges from two different perspectives: node and network. Node perspective: Simultaneous transmission and reception results in a large self- interference due to the proximity of transmit and receive antennas at the full-duplex node. To establish the feasibility of wireless full-duplex, we develop a wideband real-time physical layer and evaluate its performance on the WARP testbed. Self-interference reduction in our proposed physical layer is achieved through passive suppression and <b>active</b> <b>cancellation.</b> Based on the constraints of the physical layer, we propose a MAC layer protocol which is designed specifically to discover and enhance opportunities to communicate in the full-duplex mode. Experimental evaluation of our physical layer design, as well as several other full-duplex designs proposed in literature, reveal that <b>active</b> <b>cancellation</b> does not push self-interference all the way upto the thermal noise floor. In this dissertation, we explore the bottlenecks limiting <b>active</b> <b>cancellation</b> in full-duplex systems. We show that the amount of <b>active</b> <b>cancellation</b> is limited by transmitter side noise, particularly by the phase-noise in the local oscillator at the transmitter of the full- duplex node. Thus, unlike conventional half-duplex systems where receiver thermal noise is a limiting factor, full-duplex systems are limited by transmitter side noise. As a key by-product of our analysis, we propose a signal model for a wideband MIMO full-duplex system. We use our proposed signal model to study the performance limits of a system where the start of transmission and the start of reception at a full-duplex node are not synchronized. Interestingly, we discover that the bit-error-rate of the communication mode where the start of transmission precedes the start of reception is better than the mode where start of transmission follows reception of a packet at the full-duplex node. Network perspective: In order to extract gains in capacity from full-duplex operation in a multi-user network, we propose to use full-duplex capable nodes to si- multaneously operate uplink and downlink in a network. Such operation results in a new type of interference in the network – internode interference, i. e., the uplink transmission from each mobile user starts interfering with the downlink receptions at all the other mobile users. We show a physical layer coding strategy that aligns interference over time and extracts gains in degrees-of-freedom of the network. Finally, we recognize that larger gains from full-duplex operation are possible by leveraging the fact that the strength of the internode interference channel is often different from the uplink/downlink channel. By analysing the uplink/downlink capacity of a network composed of one base-station and two mobile users, we show that full-duplex not only out-performs half-duplex, but also recovers some of the degrees-of-freedom lost due to lack/delay of channel state information of the network...|$|E
