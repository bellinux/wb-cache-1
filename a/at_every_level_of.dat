25|$|Henry Kaiser became {{fascinated with}} the {{healthcare}} system created for him by Garfield and began to directly manage Kaiser Permanente and Garfield. This resulted in a financial disaster when Kaiser splurged on the new Walnut Creek hospital; his constant intermeddling led to significant friction <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the organization. The situation was not helped by Kaiser's marriage to Garfield's head administrative nurse (who had helped care for Kaiser's first wife on her deathbed), convincing Garfield to marry the sister of that nurse, and then having Garfield move in next door to him. Clifford Keene (who would eventually serve as president of Kaiser Permanente) later recalled that this arrangement resulted in a rather dysfunctional and combative family in charge of Kaiser Permanente.|$|E
25|$|Angkor Wat, {{the largest}} Angkorian temple (built AD 1116–1150), {{features}} both apsaras and devata, however the devata type {{are the most}} numerous with more than 1,796 in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (30–40cm as seen at left) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately 95–110cm) more prominently <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the temple from the entry pavilion to {{the tops of the}} high towers.

Some devatas appear with arms around each other and seem to be greeting the viewer. “The devatas seem to epitomize all the elements of a refined elegance,” wrote Marchal.|$|E
25|$|This {{timeline}} of {{the evolutionary}} history of life represents the current scientific theory outlining the major events {{during the development}} of life on planet Earth. In biology, evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> biological organization, from kingdoms to species, and individual organisms and molecules, such as DNA and proteins. The similarities between all present day organisms indicate {{the presence of a}} common ancestor from which all known species, living and extinct, have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.|$|E

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jesuits led efforts to redress the elitist, urban-centered biases of postprimary education that perpetuated not only social inequality, but also the historical dominance of Belize City over its primarily rural hinterland.

The ideal vehicle for this type of extensive applications is a distributed underwater system with networked wireless nodes, referred to as underwater wireless networks [1, 2].
