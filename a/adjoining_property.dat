5|$|Hewson and {{her family}} live in Killiney, in south County Dublin, in a mansion and grounds that {{overlook}} the Irish Sea and that have been expanded by purchasing the <b>adjoining</b> <b>property.</b> Bill Clinton and Salman Rushdie are {{among those who have}} stayed at the guest house there. With U2 bandmate The Edge, the couple co-own a 20-room villa in Èze in the Alpes-Maritimes in the south of France, where Bono and Hewson often mix with top celebrities. Hewson in particular has been friendly with several supermodels, which she uses to her advantage when booking charity events.|$|E
5|$|US131 {{runs through}} a {{business}} corridor {{along the west}} side of Three Rivers. M-60 runs concurrently along this part of US131 until the two highways meet {{the south end of the}} business loop through town. The main road curves to the northeast as it leaves town, and M-60 turns east to follow Business US131 (Bus. US131) into downtown. The trunkline runs parallel to a branch of the Grand Elk Railroad. North of the other end of the business loop, US131 follows a four-lane surface highway through rural farmland in northern St. Joseph County. The highway has at-grade junctions with cross roads, but otherwise has limited access from <b>adjoining</b> <b>property.</b> This arrangement ends on the south side of Schoolcraft, where the highway transitions to follow Grand Street through town. North of town US131 returns to an expressway as the highway continues through southern Kalamazoo County farmland.|$|E

The Supreme Court of New South Wales ruled that under the ordinances of the Local Government Act 1919, the council had liability over damage to <b>adjoining</b> <b>properties</b> to any of its developments. The case of Anderson v. Mackellar County Council is now an oft-cited case of precedent in construction law in Australia.|$|R

25|$|Traffic {{lights and}} {{junctions}} are permitted at grade on dual carriageways. For older sections of dual carriageway, this {{has resulted in}} fewer flyover junctions. Newer dual carriageway sections are usually near motorway standard, with grade-separated junctions, but may not be designated as motorways due {{to the need to}} preserve access to <b>adjoining</b> <b>property</b> or to the absence of a non-motorway alternative route. Also, dual carriageways that are not motorway classified {{do not need to be}} equipped with emergency phones.|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} few houses along the road {{and much of the}} <b>adjoining</b> <b>property</b> is undeveloped {{publicly}} owned woodlands (either City of Newark watershed or state forest) and the road itself is a narrow two-lane highway that receives little maintenance, is not part of New Jersey's county route system and was until fairly recently unpaved for some of its length, connecting two areas of minimal population and growth and thus having little traffic even at the busiest times of day.|$|E
25|$|When a {{property}} owner misrepresents {{the existence of}} an easement while selling {{a property}} and does not include in the deed to the buyer an express easement over an <b>adjoining</b> <b>property</b> that the seller owns, a court may step in and create an easement. Easements by estoppel generally look to any promises not made in writing, any money spent by the benefiting party in reliance on the representations of the burdened party, and other factors. If the court finds that the buyer acted reasonably and in good faith and relied on the seller's promises, the court may create an easement by estoppel.|$|E

25|$|Roach {{was able}} to {{continue}} expanding the business through {{the sale of a}} variety of products, including Franklin stoves, firebacks, slats for iron shutters and other items. In 1856 he added a new steam boiler to the ironworks for driving a blower which forced a draft into the melting furnace, thus obtaining a higher temperature and melting the iron faster, which saved valuable man-hours. He also purchased the <b>adjoining</b> <b>property</b> at 104-106 Goerck St., upon which stood a small three-storey building. Roach used the third floor as a pattern shop, while renting out the first and second floors to an iron shutter manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|After Vassar's death, {{the lands}} were divided among several other local families, who {{continued}} to work the landscape. Judge Homer Nelson, New York's Secretary of State, bought the southern half of the property and renamed it Hudson Knolls. He lived elsewhere while a boardinghouse operated on the site. The northern half was purchased by local shoe manufacturer John Whitehouse, who merged it with his own <b>adjoining</b> <b>property</b> {{to the west of}} the site, retaining the Springside name. It passed to his son-in-law Eugene Howell upon his death, who kept up the landscape, at one point using it as a golf course, despite the failure of the shoe factory in 1891.|$|E
25|$|In the 1850s, a local {{lawyer and}} {{railroad}} developer named Edwin Clarke Litchfield (1815–1885) purchased {{large tracts of}} what was then farmland. Through the American Civil War era, he sold off much of his land to residential developers. During the 1860s, the City of Brooklyn purchased his estate and <b>adjoining</b> <b>property</b> to complete the West Drive and the southern portion of the Long Meadow in Prospect Park. However, Park Slope’s bucolic period ended soon after. By the late 1870s, with horse-drawn rail cars running {{to the park and}} the ferry, bringing many rich New Yorkers in the process, urban sprawl dramatically changed the neighborhood into a streetcar suburb. Many of the large Victorian mansions on Prospect Park West, known as the Gold Coast, were built in the 1880s and 1890s {{to take advantage of the}} beautiful park views. Today, many of these buildings are preserved within the 24-block Park Slope Historic District, one of New York's largest landmarked neighborhoods. By 1883, with the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, Park Slope continued to boom and subsequent brick and brownstone structures pushed the neighborhood's borders farther. The 1890 census showed Park Slope to be the richest community in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Vacant and {{abandoned}} houses {{have been a}} problem for urban areas for years and that problem has been exacerbated in the later part of {{the first decade of the}} 2000 s due to shrinking urban populations and troubles in the housing market. Previous research has shown that demolishing vacant {{and abandoned}} houses improves public safety and health in neighborhoods. It also protects the value of other properties nearby and can help to keep a neighborhood from heading into decline. Finally, it can mollify voters living near a vacant and abandoned house that has fallen into disrepair. This exploratory project challenges the wisdom of complaint-driven demolition programs by examining the effects of demolitions on the condition and assessed value of <b>adjoining</b> <b>properties</b> in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Inspections were made of properties on which demolitions had occurred, on properties where water had been shut-off for at least 17 months, and the <b>adjoining</b> <b>properties.</b> Assessed values and other data from property record cards and the Allen County geographic information system were added to the data set. The nature of the effects on <b>adjoining</b> <b>properties</b> was consistent when comparing the demolition properties to the water shut-off properties, but the findings were inconclusive. In some ways the <b>properties</b> <b>adjoining</b> a demolition <b>property</b> fare better than the <b>properties</b> <b>adjoining</b> a shut-off <b>property.</b> In other ways the opposite is true, and in some cases there is no difference...|$|R

500|$|Lachal's {{successor}} as AOC Eastern Area, Air Vice Marshal Frank Bladin, {{was responsible}} for preparing the transfer of its headquarters from Bradfield Park to the former Lapstone Hotel at Glenbrook in the Lower Blue Mountains, a process that was completed in 1949. As well as commanding {{a view of the}} surrounding countryside, the property was within [...] of the City of Penrith and [...] of RAAF Station Richmond, and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered, according to government correspondence, [...] "complete protection from Atom Bomb attack". An <b>adjoining</b> <b>property,</b> [...] "Briarcliffe", was purchased soon afterwards to augment the new headquarters' accommodation facilities. Bladin completed his term as AOC Eastern Area in October 1948. Air Vice Marshal John McCauley was appointed AOC in March the following year. McCauley commanded Eastern Area {{during the early years of}} the Malayan Emergency, and oversaw the deployment of [...] to administer RAAF units stationed there—a Lincoln squadron detached from No.82 Wing and a Dakota squadron from No.86 Wing. Having re-equipped with de Havilland Vampire jets, No.78 Wing departed Williamtown for garrison duties with the RAF on Malta in July 1952. In May 1953, Eastern Area's SASO, Group Captain Frank Headlam, announced that the Air Force was planning to re-equip No.82 Wing with English Electric Canberra jet bombers, and also procure CAC Sabre swept-wing jet fighters.|$|E
500|$|In 1953 a {{religious}} education wing, also designed by Bailey, {{was added to}} the church building, increasing the size of the auditorium and adding classrooms and offices. [...] By the following year the church building had already reached its capacity and the congregation began holding two services on Sundays. [...] The church school, with an enrollment of over 500, also began holding two services on Sundays. [...] The church purchased <b>adjoining</b> <b>property</b> and in 1958 constructed the parsonage, a -story brick Colonial Revival building. [...] By 1959, there were eight Unitarian congregations in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs, with the Arlington church being the largest. [...] The congregation began planning for a new facility and chose Charles M. Goodman, a prominent local architect known for his modernist work, to design the church building. [...] A church committee wrote that it was [...] "confident that Mr. Goodman’s concept of design, his wide experience, and his original and creative genius promise for us a distinctive building which will portray in structural form the spirit and aspiration of this congregation." [...] Church leaders invited the congregation to give suggestions for Goodman's design which included [...] "an architectural style which would express the inspiring tradition of Unitarianism in Virginia" [...] and a [...] "free form and no stained glass, [...] a building to represent our cleavage with the past." [...] The congregation wanted the building to [...] "reflect their liberal, progressive beliefs and that would signify the UUCA's leadership position within the denomination." [...] According to one UUCA minister, [...] "Charles Goodman {{spent a lot of time}} with the congregation and incorporating the values and theology of the congregation into the design of the building." [...] Goodman finished his design in late 1961 and the church began seeking financing shortly thereafter. [...] His design included plans for a main sanctuary and adjoining wing, the latter which was not built at the time due to budget concerns. [...] Construction of the sanctuary was carried out by the Martin Brothers contracting firm. [...] The total cost was approximately $300,000, and the dedication was held on March 22, 1964, with a sermon by Dana McLean Greeley entitled [...] "Building a Faith for the Future." [...] UUCA's sanctuary is one of only three churches designed by Goodman and his only church building in Virginia. [...] His other two church designs are Bethesda United Church of Christ in Bethesda, Maryland, and Christ Church of Washington (now called Embassy Church) in Washington, D.C.|$|E
2500|$|Reece {{said his}} former co-investors, Mountcastle Broadcasting, the then-owners of WATE, {{who had been}} anticipating a WBIR House Mountain tower and its wide {{broadcasting}} coverage area, quickly purchased that property, which {{happened to be the}} only property for sale on the mountaintop that {{could be used as a}} tower base. [...] The WATE owners then convinced the <b>adjoining</b> <b>property</b> owners not to sell their property atop House Mountain, citing aesthetic reasons. [...] Thus, WBIR was forced to spend millions of dollars in 1963 to build a taller tower for its broadcasting antenna in the surrounding valley below. [...] The resulting [...] tower, now owned by South Central Communications and used by its local station, WIMZ-FM 103.5, was and still is the tallest man-made structure in the state of Tennessee. [...] After WBIR was forced to build the tall tower, WATE then sold its newly acquired House Mountain property to a private owner.|$|E

6000|$|The Ferns--or rather little Mrs. Fern--had had taste, and the {{new house}} {{reflected}} it.

James Walsham might have represented his county in Parliament had he chosen, but he was far too happy in his country life, varied by a few months passed every year in town, to care about taking part in the turmoil of politics.

60|$|On Sunday afternoon, left {{temporarily}} {{to my own}} devices, I wandered {{along the}} cliff, crossing into the <b>adjoining</b> <b>property.</b> The wind had fallen; the waves, much subdued, broke rhythmically against the rocks; during the night a new mantle of snow had been spread, and the clouds were still low and menacing. As I strolled I became aware of a motionless figure ahead of me,--one that seemed oddly familiar; {{the set of the}} shabby overcoat on the stooping shoulders, the unconscious pose contributed to a certain sharpness of individuality; in the act of challenging my memory, I halted. The man was gazing at the seascape, and his very absorption gave me a sudden and unfamiliar thrill. The word absorption precisely expresses my meaning, for he seemed indeed to have become a part of his surroundings,--an harmonious part. Presently he swung about and looked at me as though he had expected to find me there--and greeted me by name.|$|E
