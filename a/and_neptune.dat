5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|Because {{observations}} of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for Voyager 1 was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below {{the south pole}} of Saturn {{and out of the}} plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had Voyager 1 failed or been unable to observe Titan, Voyager 2s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the Titan flyby, precluding any visit to Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b> The trajectory Voyager 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> but could have been altered to avoid a Titan flyby and travel from Saturn to Pluto, arriving in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Ice giants, Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> are {{primarily}} composed of low-boiling-point {{materials such as}} water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).|$|E
50|$|Teams {{from the}} British Fleet were being freely {{challenged}} <b>and</b> <b>Neptunes</b> had suddenly become {{the envy of}} all other previously established clubs.|$|R
50|$|Savio's {{music has}} been {{compared}} to productions by Timbaland <b>and</b> <b>Neptunes,</b> echoing early 2000s R&B to a greater degree than his skweee counterparts.|$|R

5|$|Meso{{cyclones}}, tornadoes {{and dust}} devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without {{the presence of}} a surface low, and can pinch off {{from the base of the}} tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b>|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{studies have}} shown that over {{millions}} of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> does not change. There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is {{subdivided}} {{into the inner}} planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b> Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend {{as far as a}} light-year.|$|E
50|$|Here {{started the}} bitter {{sporting}} rivalry between Sliema <b>and</b> <b>Neptunes</b> which exists till this very day. Suddenly {{the club was}} mobbed by youngsters who wanted to form part of the team.|$|R
50|$|Milisavljevic {{specializes in}} {{observational}} work in supernovae and supernova remnants. He {{is also known}} for aiding in the discovery of Uranus's moons Ferdinand, Trinculo, <b>and</b> Francisco; <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's</b> moons Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia and Neso.|$|R
5000|$|The Maze Garden - a maze {{garden with}} main hedges of Western Arborvitae 'Spring Grove', inner hedges of Japanese Barberry 'Crimson Pygmy', and central statue of Achievement, by Henri Crenier, atop a base {{with images of}} Triton <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's</b> face.|$|R
5|$|The Sun {{has eight}} known planets. This {{includes}} four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune).</b> The Solar System also {{has at least}} five dwarf planets, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, {{and a large number}} of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledging the problem, the IAU {{set about}} {{creating}} {{the definition of}} planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune),</b> and {{a new class of}} dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).|$|E
5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, {{based on}} its {{interior}} chemistry, that the comet formed in the Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> Oort cloud region of the Solar System. A comet which forms farther from the Sun {{is expected to have}} greater amounts of ices with low freezing temperatures, such as ethane, which was present in Tempel 1. Astronomers believe that other comets with compositions similar to Tempel 1 are likely to have formed in the same region.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990 Humphreys {{published}} a follow {{up to his}} predictions as Voyager II had now measured Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's</b> magnetic fields. [...] In an article, Humphreys claimed that his model had an easier time explaining their magnetic fields than the dynamo theory.|$|R

Lot18 also creates custom wines and brands, {{including}} Axiom, Mythmaker, Finial, Q8, Amukan, Loophole, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's</b> Trident, among others.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{the outer}} natural {{satellites}} {{of the giants}} planet (irregular satellites) are {{too far away to}} have become locked. For example, Jupiter's Himalia, Saturn's Phoebe, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's</b> Nereid have rotation periods in the range of ten hours, whereas their orbital periods are hundreds of days.|$|R
5|$|At Fontainebleau, Catherine {{arranged}} entertainments {{that lasted}} for several days, including fancy-dress jousting and chivalrous events in allegorical settings. On Mardi Gras, {{the day after the}} banquet in the meadow, knights dressed as Greeks and Trojans fought over scantily clad damsels trapped by a giant and a dwarf in a tower on an enchanted island. The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated {{at the start of the}} 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for PlanetX. Lowell proposed the PlanetX hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, Uranus, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
5000|$|... 944 Hidalgo is a centaur {{because it}} has a semi-major axis between Jupiter's <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's.</b> Despite this, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) does not list it as a centaur. Hidalgo has {{traditionally}} been considered an asteroid because centaurs were not recognized as a distinct class until the discovery of 2060 Chiron in 1977.|$|R

5000|$|In 1977-78, Rand McNally {{released}} two Jabberjaw coloring books (Jabberjaw <b>and</b> the <b>Neptunes</b> <b>and</b> Jabberjaw Does It Again), a story book (Jabberjaw Out West by Jean Lewis, {{illustrated by}} Jim Franzen) and a read & color book (Jabberjaw and the Rustlers).|$|R
5|$|Planets are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b> Six of the planets are orbited {{by one or more}} natural satellites.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may be {{surrounded}} by dense metallic hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet. Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b>|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica learns the identity of the person responsible for the Neptune High bus crash. Meanwhile, Veronica and her classmates graduate from high school, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> reacts to Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin) being acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|Proteus ( [...] Greek: Πρωτεύς), {{also known}} as NeptuneVIII, is the second largest Neptunian moon, <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's</b> largest inner satellite. Discovered by Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} in 1989, it is named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology. Proteus orbits Neptune in a nearly equatorial orbit at the distance of about 4.75 equatorial radii of the planet.|$|R
50|$|Kuiper {{discovered}} two natural satellites {{of planets}} in the Solar System, namely Uranus's satellite Miranda <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's</b> satellite Nereid. In addition, he discovered {{carbon dioxide in}} the atmosphere of Mars and the existence of a methane-laced atmosphere above Saturn's satellite Titan in 1944. Kuiper also pioneered airborne infrared observing using a Convair 990 aircraft in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} shot on {{location}} in Puebla, Mexico. This was Montalbán's first credited role in a Hollywood film, and resulted in him being offered a contract by the studio. It {{was also the first}} of three films pairing Williams and Montalbán, the other two being On an Island with You (1948) <b>and</b> <b>Neptune's</b> Daughter (1949).|$|R
5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} the scattered disc {{to be the}} place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> being the intermediate stage in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud objects are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc. Detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects, and some such as Sedna have sometimes been considered {{to be included in}} this group.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b> The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and {{the largest in the}} Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but {{two and a half times}} that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E
50|$|With {{a minimum}} mass of about 5 Earth masses, the {{innermost}} planet {{falls into the}} regime of Super-Earths. The two outer planets straddle the commonly accepted upper limit between Super-Earths <b>and</b> <b>Neptunes</b> at , {{so they could be}} either predominantly rocky or gaseous. All three planets orbit within 0.5 AU and are likely too hot to maintain liquid water.|$|R
