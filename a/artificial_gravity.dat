5|$|The filmmakers sought {{inspiration}} from novels such as Prime Directive, Spock's World and Best Destiny {{to fill in}} gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents. One idea that was justified through information from the novels was having Enterprise built on Earth, which {{was inspired by a}} piece of fan art of Enterprise being built in a shipyard. Orci had sent the fan art to Abrams to show how realistic the film could be. Orci explained parts of the ship would have to be constructed on Earth because of the <b>artificial</b> <b>gravity</b> employed on the ship and its requirement for sustaining warp speed, and therefore the calibration of the ship's machinery would be best done in the exact gravity well which is to be simulated. They felt free to have the ship built in Iowa because canon is ambiguous as to whether it was built in San Francisco, but this {{is a result of the}} time travel rather than something intended to overlap with the original timeline.

40|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} {{in the use of}} beach dewatering as a technique to combat beach erosion. Although several test and prototype installations have been undertaken worldwide, no guidelines are available to aid the engineering design of such projects. In this paper, we present a numerical model that simulates two- dimensional ground water flow in a coastal aquifer under beach drainage, including water table lowering and seepage face reduction. The boundary element method is applied to solve the Laplace equation for the velocity potential. An internal boundary is used to simulate drainage. We conducted simulations for two different types of drainage systems, i. e., <b>artificial</b> and <b>gravity</b> drainage. The behavior of the water table from the simulations was found to be consistent with field observations. The results also showed that the location and size of the drain affect the efficiency of the drainage system. The system efficiency slightly increases with the size and vertical elevation of the drain. As the drain is shifted landward, the system becomes considerably less efficient. Although they do not represent design criteria, these results indicate considerations which affect the performance of beach dewatering system...|$|R
40|$|The Maryland Centrifugal Experiment (MCX) {{has been}} built to study the {{confinement}} of supersonically-rotating plasmas and velocity shear stabilization of MHD instabilities. Theory predicts improved stability and confinement when a strong radial electric field is introduced into a magnetic-mirror geometry. The resulting radial currents establish a stable highly sheared plasma rotating at supersonic velocities in the azimuthal direction {{under the influence of}} J×B forces. This arrangement leads to increased confinement because the supersonic rotation creates an <b>artificial</b> radial <b>gravity</b> which draws the plasma away from the mirrors, closing the mir-ror loss cone. The large vφ shear stabilizes the plasma and enforces laminar flow. Based on these concepts, we have designed and constructed a machine to produce supersonically rotat-ing highly-ionized plasmas. It typically does this by introducing a radial voltage of 7 kV in a magnetic-mirror geometry, 2 kG at the midplane and 19 kG at each mirror.

40|$|Familiarity {{with the}} visual {{environment}} affects our expectations about the objects in a scene, aiding in recognition and interaction. Here we tested whether the familiarity with the specific trajectory followed by a moving target facilitates {{the interpretation of the}} effects of underlying physical forces. Participants intercepted a target sliding down either an inclined plane or a tautochrone. Gravity accelerated the target by the same amount in both cases, but the inclined plane represented a familiar trajectory whereas the tautochrone was unfamiliar to the participants. In separate sessions, the gravity field was consistent with either natural <b>gravity</b> or <b>artificial</b> reversed <b>gravity.</b> Target motion was occluded from view over the last segment. We found that the responses in the session with unnatural forces were systematically delayed relative to those with natural forces, but only for the inclined plane. The time shift is consistent with a bias for natural gravity, in so far as it reflects an a priori expectation that a target not affected by natural forces will arrive later than one accelerated downwards by gravity. Instead, we did not find any significant time shift with unnatural forces {{in the case of the}} tautochrone. We argue that interception of a moving target relies on the integration of the high-level cue of trajectory familiarity with low-level cues related to target kinematics...|$|R

40|$|Rich {{behavioral}} {{evidence indicates}} that the brain estimates the visual direction and acceleration of gravity quite accurately, and the underlying mechanisms have begun to be unraveled. While the neuroanatomical substrates of gravity direction processing have been studied extensively in brain-damaged patients, to our knowledge no such study exists for the processing of visual gravitational motion. Here we asked 31 stroke patients to intercept a virtual ball moving along the vertical under either natural <b>gravity</b> or <b>artificial</b> reversed <b>gravity.</b> Twenty-seven of them also aligned a luminous bar to the vertical direction (subjective visual vertical, SVV). Using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping as well as lesion subtraction analysis, we found that lesions mainly centered on the posterior insula are associated with greater deviations of SVV, consistent with several previous studies. Instead, lesions mainly centered on the parietal operculum decrease the ability to discriminate natural from unnatural gravitational acceleration with a timed motor response in the interception task. Both the posterior insula and the parietal operculum belong to the vestibular cortex, and presumably receive multisensory information about the gravity vector. We speculate that an internal model estimating the effects of gravity on visual objects is constructed by transforming the vestibular estimates of mechanical gravity, which are computed in the brainstem and cerebellum, into internalized estimates of virtual gravity, which are stored in the cortical vestibular network. The present lesion data suggest a specific role for the parietal operculum in detecting the mismatch between predictive signals from the internal model and the online visual signals...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the pure impact of microgravity on small mammals despite uncontrolled factors {{that exist in}} the International Space Station, it is necessary to construct a 1 g environment in space.

However, the gravitational gradient formed inside the rearing cage is larger when the radius of gyration is shorter; this may have some impact on mice.

Hypergravity induced a significant Fos expression in the central nervous system, a suppression of body mass growth, an acute and transient reduction in food intake, and impaired vestibulomotor coordination. There was no difference in these responses between mice raised in a short-arm centrifuge and those in a long-arm centrifuge.

40|$|Traditionally, {{the global}} gravity field was {{described}} by representations based on the spherical harmonics (SH) expansion of the geopotential. The SH expansion coefficients were determined by fitting the Earth's gravity data as measured by many different methods {{including the use of}} <b>artificial</b> satellites. As <b>gravity</b> data have accumulated with increasingly better accuracies, more of the higher order SH expansion coefficients were determined. The SH representation is useful for describing the gravity field exterior to the Earth but is theoretically invalid on the Earth's surface and in the Earth's interior. A new global Earth model (NEWGEM) (KIM, 1987 and 1988 a) was recently proposed to provide a unified description of the Earth's gravity field inside, on, and outside the Earth's surface using the Earth's mass density profile as deduced from seismic studies, elevation and bathymetric information, and local and global gravity data. Using NEWGEM, it is possible to determine the constraints on the mass distribution of the Earth imposed by gravity, topography, and seismic data. NEWGEM is useful in investigating a variety of geophysical phenomena. It is currently being utilized to develop a geophysical interpretation of Kaula's rule. The zeroth order NEWGEM is being used to numerically integrate spherical harmonic expansion coefficients and simultaneously determine the contribution of each layer in the model to a given coefficient.

40|$|International audienceA {{stability}} {{analysis of}} a circular Couette flow of a dielectric fluid subjected to a temperature gradient and an electric field, reveals the generation of internal waves associated with the thermal stratifications of the density and the electric permittivity (Taylor-Couette flow, Electrohydrodynamics). Convective flows and stratified shear flows in a central gravity field are of primary importance in geo-and astrophysics. Realization of laboratory experiments with an <b>artificial</b> radial <b>gravity</b> {{is regarded as a}} key to advance the understanding of these flows. Some attempts have been made with an electric effective gravity in annular and spherical geometries [1]. This electric gravity g e originates from the thermal variation of the fluid polarizability: The decrease of the fluid electric permittivity with the temperature yields a thermal Archimedean buoyancy force f e = −αρθg e in an electric field E, where g e = ee ref ∇E 2 / 2 αρ (α: the coefficient of thermal expansion, ρ: the density, θ: the temperature deviation from a reference one, e: the coefficient of thermal variation of the permittivity, ref : the permittivity at the reference temperature). We perform a theoretical investigation on the stability of a circular Couette flow in the radial electric gravity field under microgravity conditions. The considered system is an annular capacitor of infinite length with the gap filled by a dielectric fluid (Fig. 1 a). The temperatures of the inner and outer electrodes are maintained constant at T 1 and T 2, respectively. An electric tension is applied between the electrode, producing a centripetal electric gravity (−g E e r with g E > 0) in the fluid. We model this flow system in the Boussinesq approximation, but with taking into account the centrifugal buoyancy f c = −αρθg c arising from the density stratification in the centrifugal acceleration field (g c = v 2 e r /r). Primary control parameters of the flow are the Taylor number Ta = (R 1 Ωd/ν) d/R 1 and the electric Rayleigh number L = α∆θg E d 3 /νκ, where ν and κ are the kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity of the fluid, d = R 2 − R 1 and ∆θ = T 1 − T 2. When the inner cylinder is stationary (Ta = 0), thermal convection develops beyond a critical electric Rayleigh number in outward heating (∆θ > 0) [2]. When the inner cylinder rotates, a classical circular Couette flow is established at small Ta and L. This flow is destabilized at a critical value Ta c of the Taylor number, which depends on L. The linear stability analysis accompanied by detailed examination of critical modes reveals different dynamical regimes (Fig. 1 b). It is found that, in the regimes where the net effect of the two radial thermal forces, f e and f c, is stabilizing, the critical modes are oscillatory. The frequency of these oscillatory modes is scaled by the buoyancy frequency N based on the radial acceleration field g e + g c. This finding suggests the generation of internal waves through a resonant mechanism inside the Couette flow...|$|R

The {{symposium}} was hosted by Florida Atlantic University, Mote Marine Laboratory, University of Central Florida, University of Florida, Florida Atlantic University and the Comité Nacional para la Conservación y Protección de las Totugas Marinas. The 17 th was the largest symposium to date. A total of 720 participants registered, including sea turtle biologists, students, regulatory personnel, managers, and volunteers representing 38 countries. In addition to the United States, participants represented Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Bonaire, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, England, Guatemala, Greece, Honduras, India, Italy, Japan, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, Peru, Philippines, Republic of Seychelles, Scotland, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In addition to the 79 oral, 2 video, and 120 poster presentations, 3 workshops were offered: Selina Heppell (Duke University Marine Laboratory) provided “Population Modeling,” Mike Walsh and Sam Dover (Sea World-Orlando) conducted “Marine Turtle Veterinary Medicine” and “Conservation on Nesting Beaches” was offered by Blair Witherington and David Arnold (Florida Department of Environmental Protection). On the first evening, P. C. H. Pritchard delivered a thoughtful retrospect on Archie Carr that showed many sides of a complex man who studied and wrote about sea turtles. It was a presentation that none of us will forget. The members considered a number of resolutions at the Thursday business meeting and passed six. Five of these resolutions are presented in the Commentaries and Reviews section of Chelonian Conservation and Biology 2 (3) : 442 - 444 (1997). The symposium was fortunate to have many fine presentations competing for the Archie Carr Best Student Presentations awards. The best oral presentation award went to Amanda Southwood (University of British Columbia) for “Heart rates and dive behavior of the leatherback sea turtle during the internesting interval. ” The two runners-up were Richard Reina (Australian National University) for “Regulation of salt gland activity in Chelonia mydas” and Singo Minamikawa (Kyoto University) for “The influence that <b>artificial</b> specific <b>gravity</b> change gives to diving behavior of loggerhead turtles”. The winner of this year’s best poster competition was Mark Roberts (University of South Florida) for his poster entitled “Global population structure of green sea Turtles (Chelonia mydas) using microsatellite analysis of male mediated gene flow. ” The two runners-up were Larisa Avens (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill) for “Equilibrium responses to rotational displacements by hatchling sea turtles: maintaining a migratory heading in a turbulent ocean” and Annette Broderick (University of Glasgow) for “Female size, not length, is a correlate of reproductive output. ” The symposium was very fortunate to receive a matching monetary and subscription gift from Anders J. G. Rhodin of the Chelonian Research Foundation. These enabled us to more adequately reward the fine work of students. The winners of the best paper and best poster awards received 400 plus a subscription to Chelonian Conservation and Biology. Each runner up received 100. The symposium owes a great debt to countless volunteers who helped make the meeting a success. Those volunteers include: Jamie Serino, Alan Bolton, and Karen Bjorndal, along with the UF students provided audio visual help, John Keinath chaired the student awards committee, Mike Salmon chaired the Program Commiteee, Sheryan Epperly and Joanne Braun compiled the Proceedings, Edwin Drane served as treasurer and provided much logistical help, Jane Provancha coordinated volunteers, Thelma Richardson conducted registration, Vicki Wiese coordinated food and beverage services, Jamie Serino and Erik Marin coordinated entertainment, Kenneth Dodd oversaw student travel awards, Traci Guynup, Tina Brown, Jerris Foote, Dan Hamilton, Richie Moretti, and Vicki Wiese served on the time and place committee, Blair Witherington created the trivia quiz, Tom McFarland donated the symposium logo, Deborah Crouse chaired the resolutions committee, Pamela Plotkin chaired the nominations committee, Sally Krebs, Susan Schenk, and Larry Wood conducted the silent auction, and Beverly and Tom McFarland coordinated all 26 vendors.

We are indebted to those donating money to the internationals’ housing fund (Flo Vetter Memorial Fund, Marinelife Center of Juno Beach, Roger Mellgren, and Jane Provancha). We raise much of our money for international travel from the auction; thanks go to auctioneer Bob Shoop, who kept our auction fastpaced and entertaining, and made sure the bidding was high. The Annual Sea Turtle Symposium is unequaled in its emphasis on international participation. Through international participation we all learn a great deal more about the biology of sea turtles and the conservation issues that sea turtles face in distant waters. Additionally, those attending the symposium come away with a tremendous wealth of knowledge, professional contacts, and new friendships. The Annual Sea Turtle Symposium is a meeting in which pretenses are dropped, good science is presented, and friendly, open communication is the rule. The camaraderie that typifies these meetings ultimately translates into understanding and cooperation. These aspects, combined, have gone and {{will go a long way}} toward helping to protect marine turtles and toward aiding their recovery on a global scale. (PDF contains 342 pages...|$|R
2500|$|They first {{go to the}} {{puppeteer}} home world, {{where they}} learn that the expedition's goal is to investigate the Ringworld {{to see if it}} poses any threat. The Ringworld is a gigantic artificial ring about one million miles (1,600,000 km) wide and approximately the diameter of Earth's orbit (which makes it about 600,000,000 miles or 950,000,000 km in circumference), encircling a sunlike star. It rotates to provide <b>artificial</b> <b>gravity</b> 99.2% as strong as Earth's from centrifugal force. The Ringworld has a habitable, flat inner surface (equivalent in area to approximately three million Earths), a breathable atmosphere and a temperature optimum for humans. Night is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin, ultra-strong wire. [...] When the crew completes their mission, they will be given the starship in which they will travel to the Ringworld; it is far faster than any possessed by humans or Kzinti.|$|E
50|$|Several {{science fiction}} novels, films and series have {{featured}} <b>artificial</b> <b>gravity</b> production. In the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, a rotating centrifuge in the Discovery spacecraft provides <b>artificial</b> <b>gravity.</b> In the novel The Martian, the Hermes spacecraft achieves <b>artificial</b> <b>gravity</b> by design; it employs a ringed structure, at whose periphery forces around 40% of Earth's gravity are experienced, similar to Mars's gravity. The movie Interstellar 2014 features a spacecraft called the Endurance that can rotate on its center axis to create <b>artificial</b> <b>gravity,</b> controlled by retro thrusters on the ship.|$|E
