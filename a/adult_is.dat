5|$|During the pupal stage, the {{morphology}} of the <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> {{developed through}} elaboration from larval structures. The general {{aspect of the}} <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> visible before the outer surface hardens â€“ the head, resting on the thorax, the eyes, antennae (brought forward over the head), the wings brought over the thorax and the six legs between the wings and the abdomen. Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye-pieces, antennae, palpi and the maxillae. The pupal thorax displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows and axillary tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} {{by a number of}} mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, common loon eggs are especially vulnerable if the <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> absent.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> light grey. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from August to September.|$|R
50|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing in summer. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> most {{commonly}} encountered in September and October.|$|R
50|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> {{attracted}} to fermenting fruit and males mud-puddle. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing {{most of the}} year.|$|R
5|$|Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) go for {{afternoon}} tea at a tea parlor {{in an attempt}} to feel more like adults. Once they arrive, they see that only mothers and their children are there; they decide to hit the lobby bar instead. They discuss how they do not feel grown up and how being an <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily a good thing.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Appropriate <b>Adult</b> <b>is</b> not {{to provide}} legal advice to the police detainee/suspect/witness. Their role is {{to act as a}} bridge between the Investigation Officer and the police detainee/suspect/witness to enable him/her to {{communicate}} more effectively during the police interview. This means that the police detainee/suspect/witness does not misunderstand the questions asked or that he/she is not misunderstood by the Investigation Officer, ensuring that statements recorded are reliable.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> dark brown-grey with obscure {{transverse}} markings. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from April {{to early}} October.|$|R
50|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> diurnal and {{occur on}} wet tundra. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from late June to mid-July.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} <b>is</b> 2.1-2.3 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> mostly white. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing in January.|$|R
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
5|$|Lodges {{are grouped}} into {{sections}} that are then grouped into regions. The section chief is the elected youth leader, a volunteer <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> appointed as the section adviser, {{and the area}} director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser. In addition to the section chief, the section has two additional elected officers. The vice chief and secretary are elected immediately following {{the election of the}} section chief at the section's annual business meeting. All sections gather annually at a section conclave held in the late spring or early fall. The section officers lead the planning of this weekend {{with the help of the}} lodge chiefs in the section.|$|E
5|$|Terns {{have a wide}} {{repertoire}} of vocalisations. For example, the common tern has a distinctive alarm, kee-yah, also used {{as a warning to}} intruders, and a shorter kyar, given as an individual takes flight in response to a more serious threat; this quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. Other calls include a down-slurred keeur given when an <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> approaching the nest with a fish, and a kip uttered during social contact. Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and siblings also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} <b>is</b> 10-12 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> ochreous-orange in colour. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from May to June.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} <b>is</b> 3.1-3.5 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> almost entirely white. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing in November.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} <b>is</b> 18.5-19.5 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from June to August. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> of a uniform, drab colour.|$|R
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering {{a high school}} corridor and standing inside a classroom of schoolchildren playing various musical instruments with inter-cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing her movements, and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about {{in the classroom and}} corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an <b>adult,</b> <b>is</b> following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 3.3 million views on YouTube as of June 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{scaly-breasted munia}} or spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata), {{known in the}} pet trade as nutmeg mannikin or spice finch, is a sparrow-sized estrildid finch native to {{tropical}} Asia. A species of the genus Lonchura, it was formally described and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Its name {{is based on the}} distinct scale-like feather markings on the breast and belly. The <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> brown above and has a dark conical bill. The species has 11 subspecies across their range and differ slightly in size and colour.|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and {{for a day or}} two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 3 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> almost entirely white. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing in January ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> {{attracted}} to flowers and adult males mud-puddle. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from August to November and from February to May.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 2.1 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> almost entirely white. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from March to April.|$|R
5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
5|$|P. xinjiangensis is {{distinguished}} by a prominent jugal 'horn' that is flattened {{on the front}} end, {{as well as some}} features of the teeth. The ilium, one of the three bones of the pelvis, also bears a characteristically long bony process behind the acetabulum (hip socket). An adult femur has a published length of about 16centimetres (6.3in). P. meileyingensis has the shortest snout and neck frill of any species, making the skull nearly circular in profile. The orbit (eye socket) is roughly triangular, and there is a prominent flange on the lower edge of the dentary, a feature also seen in specimens of P. lujiatunensis, and to a lesser degree in P. mongoliensis, P. sattayaraki, and P. sibiricus. The complete type skull, probably <b>adult,</b> <b>is</b> 13.7centimetres (5.5in) long. The dentary of P. sattayaraki has a flange similar to that found in P. mongoliensis, P. sibiricus, P. lujiatunensis and P. meileyingensis, although it is less pronounced than in those species. The material appears to be roughly the same size as P. sinensis. The frontal bone of P. neimongoliensis is distinctly narrow compared to that of other species, resulting in a narrower skull overall. The ischium bone of the pelvis is also longer than the femur, which differs from other species in which these bones are known. The type specimen has a skull length of 13.2centimetres (5.2in) and a femoral length of 13centimetres (5.1in), but is not fully grown. An adult P. neimongoliensis was probably smaller than P. mongoliensis, with a proportionately longer skull and tail. P. ordosensis can be distinguished by numerous features of the jugals, which have very prominent 'horns'. It is also the smallest known species. One adult skull measures only 9.5centimeters (3.75in) in length.|$|E
25|$|The {{body length}} of the <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> 10-20cm (4-8in).|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} <b>is</b> 13-17 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to}} Telphusa syncratopa. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing {{from the end}} of May to mid-August.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} <b>is</b> 40-48 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from June to July in {{one generation}} per year. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> attracted to flowers.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 21 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> light brownish with an ochreous tinge. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from late June to July.|$|R
25|$|S4 when audible in an <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> {{called a}} presystolic gallop or atrial gallop. This gallop is {{produced}} {{by the sound of}} blood being forced into a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{within the}} ear respond to simple tones, {{and the brain}} serves to process other {{increasingly}} complex sounds. An average <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> typically able to detect sounds ranging between 20 and 20,000Hz. The ability to detect higher pitch sounds decreases in older humans.|$|E
25|$|An {{adult who}} solicits {{with the intent}} to engage in a sexual act with a minor under age fifteen or engages in or causes another to engage in a sexual act when the <b>adult</b> <b>is</b> at least twenty-two years of age and the victim is a minor fifteen years of age or older, is guilty of a class C felony.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17 mm. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> yellow with wiggly brown lines across the wings. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from June to July.|$|R
50|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> {{probably}} on wing year-round {{in part of}} the range. In southern Texas, <b>adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing in October and in Bolivia in April.|$|R
50|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> smoky ochreous brown. Females {{are larger}} and lighter in colour. <b>Adults</b> <b>are</b> on wing from August to September in one {{generation}} per year.|$|R
