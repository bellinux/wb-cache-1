25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked at himself in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E

500|$|According to William Ruhlmann, [...] "a big {{difference}} {{is provided by}} keyboardist Clifford Meyer, who provides texture, filling up the overall sound and also adding ethereal touches that sometimes make Isis reminiscent of Pink Floyd." [...] This view is shared by Roque Strew, who argues that [...] "equally vital to the record's dense, hypnotic shape is Clifford Meyer's command of the keyboard [...] His blissful, knotty phrases, played on a dusty Hammond B3 or Rhodes, often recreate moments from the psychedelic and prog-rock past." [...] However, Chris Norton of Tiny Mix Tapes contends that [...] "the prominent keyboard tones sound pretty hokey on this album." [...] Praise was spared for drummer Aaron Harris also; on this release, [...] "everyone is playing off Harris and following his lead dynamically. His sense of moment is perfect; knowing exactly when and where to jump in or cut back, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much." ...|$|E

Tony Prophet, Microsoft Vice President of Windows Marketing, said at a San Francisco conference in October 2014 that Windows 9 [...] "came and went", and that Windows 10 is not [...] "an incremental step from Windows 8.1," [...] but [...] "a material step. We're trying to create one platform, one eco-system that unites as many of the devices from the small embedded Internet of Things, through tablets, through phones, through PCs and, ultimately, into the Xbox." ...|$|E

Chang of Redbull.com ranked it at number 3 on his Top 5 Best Tove Lo songs list and wrote that [...] "'Out Of Mind' provides the blueprint for Tove Lo's hits: soft and spare verse, followed by an explosive chorus — all fitting in nicely at just over three minutes". Under the Gun Review's Tarynn Law called it a [...] "powerful shadow pop track" [...] that [...] "shows off [...] outstanding vocals <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much promise she has". Mark Savage of BBC wrote that the pre-chorus of the song was [...] "a moment on [...] that will take your breath away".

2500|$|One {{persistent}} account about Camille {{states that}} 23 people held a [...] "hurricane party" [...] {{on the third}} floor of the Richelieu Manor Apartments in Pass Christian, Mississippi, in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall. The high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building, killing all but one person. Who the survivor is, how many party guests there were, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling. An ABC made-for-TV movie called Hurricane, starring Frank Sutton of Gomer Pyle USMC, Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Will Geer, Martin Milner, and Michael Learned, was loosely based on the supposed hurricane party. However, the site and names were changed to fictitious ones for the movie, as was the name of the hurricane. The television show Quantum Leap carried an episode regarding the parties of Hurricane Camille and the actual hurricane itself. Twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the Richelieu Apartments during the hurricane, eight of whom died. The tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor Mary Ann Gerlach. Survivor Ben Duckworth has expressed irritation at the story. There was no hurricane party. Duckworth reiterated in 2001. We were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars. We were too tired to party. I can’t tell you why that story persists, or why people didn't put two and two together. I guess the hurricane party makes a good story.|$|E

[...] J. Hurtado of Twitch Film noted that many [...] "reviews of Battle Royale focus on the violence, which is extreme to be sure, {{and not so much}} on the humanity of the film." [...] He stated that [...] "cranking up that already elevated hormonal level of emotional hysteria by throwing these students into a real life-or-death situation is incredibly effective" [...] and that [...] "the story of Battle Royale is the story of those teenage years <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> wrong we all were about the extent of our emotional turmoil." [...] DVD Talk gave the original theatrical cut of the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and 4 out of 5 for the Director's Cut, concluding that it gives [...] "a glimpse into what might very well happen should the rules of society, such as they are, ever do crumble to the point where it's everyone for themselves. There's enough black humor here and enough tense action that the film never quite feels bleak or depressing (though it does come close) – but most importantly it makes you think." [...] Devon Ashby of CraveOnline gave the film a score of 8.5 out of 10, referring to it as [...] "Japanese legend Kinji Fukasaku’s adolescent shooting spree opus" [...] and [...] "a compassionate and technically accomplished masterpiece."
