5|$|Hansen {{played his}} first full season with the Canucks in 2008–09, making the roster out {{training}} camp and establishing himself as a third-line forward. He became known as a player for his speed and work ethic, lending to his effectiveness in puck-pursuit and forechecking. Also responsible defensively, he began to be used consistently on the penalty kill. Hansen has recalled {{the transition to the}} NHL requiring a change in his style of play to incorporate more physicality and <b>abrasiveness.</b> Prior to making the NHL, he relied more on skill and finesse, having been a go-to offensive player for teams up to that point.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his <b>abrasiveness,</b> over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would not {{be taken to the}} Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.|$|E

25|$|The {{three girls}} in the final {{boardroom}} got into a heated argument, which caused Lord Sugar to reprimand them on their unprofessional behaviour.

25|$|Abbey's <b>abrasiveness,</b> {{opposition}} to anthropocentrism, and outspoken writings {{made him the}} object of much controversy. Agrarian author Wendell Berry claimed that Abbey was regularly criticized by mainstream environmental groups because Abbey often advocated controversial positions that were very different from those which environmentalists were commonly expected to hold.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, the team's {{contract}} expired with MGM, and the Stooges parted professional {{company with}} Healy. According to Moe Howard's autobiography, the split was precipitated by Healy's alcoholism and <b>abrasiveness.</b> Their final film with Healy was MGM's Hollywood Party (1934). Both Healy and the Stooges {{went on to}} separate successes, with Healy dying under mysterious circumstances in 1937.|$|E
25|$|Water {{sensitive}} {{objects are}} masked {{in plastic wrap}} to avoid getting wet. A slurry of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) calcium carbonate and deionized water is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for <b>abrasiveness.</b> If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.|$|E
25|$|Hazlitt {{continued}} to produce articles on miscellaneous topics for The Examiner and other periodicals, including political diatribes against any who he felt ignored or minimised {{the needs and}} rights of the common man. Defection from the cause of liberty had become easier {{in light of the}} oppressive political atmosphere in England at that time, in reaction to the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. The Hunts were his primary allies in opposing this tendency. Lamb, who tried to remain uninvolved politically, tolerated his <b>abrasiveness,</b> and that friendship managed to survive, if only just barely in the face of Hazlitt's growing bitterness, short temper, and propensity for hurling invective at friends and foes alike.|$|E
25|$|Healy {{tried to}} save his act by hiring {{replacement}} stooges, but they were inexperienced and not as well-received as their predecessors. Healy reached a new agreement with his former Stooges in 1932, with Moe now acting as business manager, and they were booked in a production of Jacob J. Shubert's The Passing Show of 1932. During rehearsals, Healy received a more lucrative offer and found a loophole in his contract allowing {{him to leave the}} production. Shemp, fed up with Healy's <b>abrasiveness,</b> decided to quit the act and toured in his own comedy revue for several months, and then landed at Vitaphone Studios in May 1933, appearing in movie comedies produced in Brooklyn, New York, for the next four years.|$|E
25|$|Candidate Reviews: Despite {{her having}} the weakest {{track record of}} the final four and her unwillingness to admit ever being wrong about anything, the interviewers {{unanimously}} considered Saira {{to be the most}} impressive of the candidates, giving her much praise for her prior accomplishments and salesmanship, and even feeling that her <b>abrasiveness</b> could be a strength in the right circumstances. The interviewers noted that while James was, on paper, the strongest of the four candidates, they found him unconvincing in the interviews and questioned whether his heart was in the process. Meanwhile, Tim was commended for his passion, determination and business knowledge, but the interviewers considered him to be naive and were concerned that stepping up to run one of Sir Alan's businesses would be a step too far, while Paul was deemed the weakest of the candidates, mostly due to his short temper and background in businesses that had very little relation to anything Sir Alan did.|$|E
25|$|VSI crushers use a {{different}} approach involving a high speed rotor with wear resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than surface force allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both {{across the surface of}} the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher <b>abrasiveness</b> to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.|$|E
500|$|The {{composer}} {{admitted that}} Connotations possessed [...] "a rather severe and somewhat intellectual tone." [...] However, {{while he did}} not {{expect it to be}} an immediate success, he had still hoped that the music's intensity and drama might lend it some appeal. While Copland maintained that [...] "It bothers me not at all to realize that my range as a composer includes both accessible and problematic works," [...] composer and musicologist Peter Dickinson notes [...] "a tone of defensiveness" [...] in this remark. Nevertheless, Connotations <b>abrasiveness</b> to many listeners might not have been the only factor in its initial failure.|$|E
500|$|Journalist James Poniewozik of Time {{magazine}} commented of {{the episode}} [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "It {{was the kind of}} twist Glee can sell, partly {{because of the way the}} characters are established (in retrospect, you can see how a really strong woman who rejects him is a turn-on for Puck) and because of how well its cast (Ashley Fink has been killing it as Lauren, and sells her confidence and <b>abrasiveness</b> in a way that makes her a person, not an engineered positive-body-image model). And while Glee sometimes stretches to pick on-the-nose song choices, [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] was just a perfect choice and performance—not just on topic but actually in Puck's musical wheelhouse." ...|$|E
500|$|The musical {{composition}} of [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] follows {{the status quo}} of Pretty on the Inside, which is most often noted for its extreme <b>abrasiveness,</b> though it is also noted for its sophisticated use of melodic structure which is buried under arrangements. Spin addressed this, saying: [...] "at first [...] comes across like a ranting noisy rage, but underneath is a surprisingly lush melody." [...] The song's main verse riff follows an E-G-F chord progression, with the bridge composed of a layering of diminished fifths and muted strings, evoking a [...] "sonic uncleanliness." [...] As {{with the majority of}} the band's songs, the lyrics to [...] "Teenage Whore" [...] were written by Love, and deal with a negative self image and real or imagined perception of oneself as a [...] "whore", which is reinforced by the narrator's mother.|$|E
500|$|To {{better control}} the sparsely {{populated}} border region, in 1824 the Mexican federal government passed the General Colonization Law to allow legal immigration into Texas. [...] Under the law, each state would set its own requirements for immigration. [...] After some debate, on March 24, 1825, Coahuila y Tejas authorized a system granting land to empresarios, who would each recruit settlers for their particular colony. In addition, for every 100 families an empresario settled in Texas, they would receive 23,000 {{acres of land}} to cultivate and settle on. During the state government's deliberations, many would-be empresarios congregated in Mexico to lobby for land grants. [...] Among these was Haden Edwards, an American land speculator known for his quick temper and aggressiveness. [...] Despite his <b>abrasiveness,</b> Edwards was granted a colonization contract on April 14 allowing him to settle 800 families in East Texas. [...] The contract contained standard language requiring Edwards to recognize all pre-existing Spanish and Mexican land titles in his grant area, to raise a militia to protect the settlers in the area, and to allow the state land commissioner to certify all deeds awarded.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the <b>abrasiveness</b> of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
500|$|Matangi {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 37 reviews. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the album {{one of her}} strongest efforts. Jim Carroll from The Irish Times hailed M.I.A. as [...] "a musical super-sharpshooter with an incredible ear for hard-bodied pop tracks (Bad Girls, Come Walk With Me, Exodus) that boil and steam the most mutant genres into submission." [...] Gavin Haynes of the NME wrote, [...] "MIA takes the basic template of right-now chart music and subverts it by forcing it to work triple time". He continued, [...] "Beats are constantly morphing, and every track chucks handfuls of sonic debris at you", Likewise, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "Like the woman who made it, Matangi is hugely inventive and a bit exhausting: if it's hard to take in anything other than small doses, you can't help but be glad it exists". However, Petridis also acknowledged the <b>abrasiveness</b> of the album's sonic scope: [...] "More characteristic is , an unyielding, punishing rhythmic assault on which the only semblance of a tune comes from a distorted electronic horn section". He {{then goes on to}} admit that [...] "in a way, that's the highest compliment you can pay her: a decade into her career, MIA still doesn't sound like anyone else." ...|$|E
500|$|Azerrad {{asserted}} in his 1993 biography [...] {{that the}} music of In Utero showcased divergent sensibilities of <b>abrasiveness</b> and accessibility that reflected the upheavals Cobain experienced prior to the album's completion. [...] He wrote, [...] "The Beatlesque 'Dumb' happily coexists beside the all-out frenzied punk graffiti of 'Milk It,' while 'All Apologies' is worlds away from the apoplectic 'Scentless Apprentice.' [...] It's as if [...] has {{given up trying to}} meld his punk and pop instincts into one harmonious whole. [...] Forget it. [...] This is war." [...] Cobain believed, however, that In Utero was not [...] "any harsher or any more emotional" [...] than any of Nirvana's previous records. [...] Novoselic concurred with Azerrad's comments that the album's music leaned more towards the band's [...] "arty, aggressive side"; the bassist said, [...] "There's always been [...] songs like 'About a Girl' and there's always been songs like 'Paper Cuts'... Nevermind came out kind of 'About a Girl'-y and this [...] came out more 'Paper Cuts'". [...] Cobain cited the track [...] "Milk It" [...] {{as an example of the}} more experimental and aggressive direction in which the band's music had been moving in the months prior to the sessions at Pachyderm Studio. [...] Novoselic viewed the album's singles [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] and [...] "All Apologies" [...] as [...] "gateways" [...] to the more abrasive sound of the rest of the album, telling journalist Jim DeRogatis that once listeners played the record, they would discover [...] "this aggressive wild sound, a true alternative record".|$|E
500|$|Axe to Fall was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from critics. Metacritic, an aggregate review website, scored the album with 77 out of 100 or [...] "generally favorable" [...] based on ten reviews. Citing {{a wider range of}} music styles on Axe to Fall, many reviewers found the album to be Converge's most accessible album to date. The album features songs like the [...] "doomy [...] noisy" [...] track [...] "Worms Will Feed/Rats Will Feast," [...] the [...] "synth-drenched shoegazing" [...] track [...] "Wretched World" [...] and [...] "Kerry King-admiring solos" [...] on [...] "Reap What You Sow" [...] in addition to hardcore tracks like [...] "Effigy" [...] and [...] "Cutter." [...] Andrew Parks of Decibel commented on the album's wide range of sounds, stating [...] "it strikes the perfect balance between dry-heaved hardcore—blunt trauma tracks that bleed into one another and hover around the 1:40 mark—and post-metal opuses that embrace Converge's experimental impulses." [...] Juan Diniz of Mammoth Press noted that the album flowed really well, stating that [...] "every track compliments and balances out the one prior and after. To skip tracks would be foolish as it's a compendium of aggression, frustration, beauty, and brutality," [...] and that the album [...] "demands to be taken in as a whole." [...] Cosmo Lee of Pitchfork Media referred to Converge as [...] "this generation's Black Flag", and compared Axe to Fall to Black Flag's 1984 second studio album My War. Lee noted that Converge combined <b>abrasiveness</b> with [...] "slower, abstract sludge", much like how Black Flag mixed [...] "equal parts lightning and Black Sabbath" [...] on My War. Several reviewers compared the Axe to Fall to Converge's highly praised 2001 album, Jane Doe.|$|E
2500|$|Luster: Some {{grades of}} medium are {{designed}} to promote luster {{on the surface of}} metal parts. [...] These products are generally non-abrasive or have a very low degree of <b>abrasiveness.</b> [...] They deburr by peening, rather than actually removing the burr. [...] Media selection, therefore, will control the degree of surface luster, making the part bright and shiny or developing a very matte, dull surface characterized by a completely random scratch pattern, or anything in between.|$|E
2500|$|Shemp, however, disliked Healy's <b>abrasiveness,</b> bad temper, {{and heavy}} drinking. In 1932, {{he was offered}} a {{contract}} at the Vitaphone Studios in Brooklyn. (Contrary to stories told by Moe, the role of [...] "Knobby Walsh" [...] in the Joe Palooka series did not come along until late 1935, after Shemp had been at Vitaphone {{for three years and}} had already appeared in almost thirty short subjects.) Shemp was thrilled to be away from Healy but, as was his nature, worried incessantly about brother Moe and partner Larry. Moe, however, told Shemp to pursue this opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|Alienated by Katie's {{persistent}} <b>abrasiveness,</b> {{and even}} though she is pregnant, Hubbell has a liaison with Carol Ann, his college girlfriend and the divorcee of J.J., his best friend. [...] After the birth, however, Katie and Hubbell decide to part, as she finally understands he is not the man she idealized when falling in love with, and he will always choose the easiest way out, whether it is cheating in his marriage or writing predictable stories for sitcoms. Hubbell, on the other hand, is exhausted, unable to live on the pedestal Katie erected for him and face her disappointment in his decision to compromise his potential.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Jack Sheldon {{wrote that}} during August the 4th Army inflicted [...] "morale-sapping" [...] defeats on the British and {{that after the}} attack on 22 August, British prisoners complained about their commanders and said that Germany could not be {{defeated}} without the Americans. Despite the undoubted success of the defence, the victories in August had been costly and had been the cause only of grim satisfaction. Doubts among the divisional staffs about the competence of Gough and the Fifth Army staff increased and relations were further strained by {{what was perceived as}} the <b>abrasiveness</b> of the chief of staff, Major-General Neill Malcolm but these complaints may have been influenced by personal considerations.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991 {{a number}} of party venues closed, {{including}} Ufo, and the Berlin Techno scene centered itself around three locations close to {{the foundations of the}} Berlin Wall: Planet (later renamed E-Werk by Paul van Dyk), Der Bunker, and the relatively long-lived Tresor. It was in Tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established (amongst the techno fraternity) by a DJ called Tanith; possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music, or perhaps influenced by UR's paramilitary posturing. In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and <b>abrasiveness</b> of the sound, as an acid infused techno began transmuting into hardcore. DJ Tanith commented at the time that [...] "Berlin was always hardcore, hardcore hippie, hardcore punk, and now we have a very hardcore house sound." [...] This emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by Dutch gabber and Belgian hardcore; styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to Underground Resistance and Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 Records. Other influences on the development of this style were European Electronic Body Music (EBM) groups of the mid-1980s such as DAF, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb.|$|E
2500|$|With Shemp gone, Moe {{suggested}} that Curly fill {{the role of}} the third Stooge. But Healy felt that Curly, with his thick, chestnut [...] hair and elegant waxed mustache, did not [...] "look funny" [...] and was [...] "too handsome". Curly left the room and returned minutes later with his head shaven (the mustache remained very briefly). Healy quipped, [...] "Boy, don't you look girlie?" [...] Moe misheard the joke as [...] "curly," [...] and all who witnessed the exchange realized that the nickname [...] "Curly" [...] would be a perfect fit. In one of the few interviews Curly gave in his lifetime, he complained about the loss of his hair: [...] "I had to shave it off right down to the skin." [...] In 1934, MGM was building Healy up as a solo comedian in feature films and Healy dissolved the act to pursue his own career. Like Shemp, the team of Howard, Fine, and Howard was tired of Healy's alcoholism and <b>abrasiveness</b> and renamed their act the [...] "Three Stooges." [...] That same year, they signed on to appear in two-reel comedy short subjects for Columbia Pictures. The Stooges soon became the most popular short-subject attraction, with Curly playing an integral part in the trio's work.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Capaldi has {{received}} critical acclaim for {{his portrayal of}} the Doctor. Following the broadcast of [...] "Deep Breath", Euan Ferguson of The Guardian called his performance [...] "wise and thoughtful", while Richard Beech of The Mirror agreed that Capaldi displayed [...] "all the hallmarks of a great Doctor". Michael Hogan of The Telegraph felt that Capaldi's portrayal [...] "crackled with fierce intelligence and nervous energy". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Listen" [...] was praised with Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club stating [...] "Capaldi turns in a suitably fearless performance, reaching his obsessive crescendo {{as he prepares to}} meet whatever is waiting for him {{at the end of the}} universe". His acting in [...] "The Caretaker" [...] was praised with Ceri Radford of The Telegraph noting [...] "Capaldi's ability to mould the character of the Doctor into his own unique intergalactic curmudgeon", alongside Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy noting [...] "Capaldi's is the most complex and variable take on the Time Lord we've seen since Eccleston". Tom Baker praised his character [...] "instantly one felt: this fellow comes from far far away, he's strange. An instant frisson. And what's the word? Yes, got it! Alien, he's an alien. I salute him". Professor Brian Cox noted [...] "he's complex, menacing and vulnerable. Exactly what the Doctor should be". Musician Marc Almond stated [...] "Peter Capaldi brings back a touch of darkness and ageless mystery to the Doctor that I feel had been missing, as well as a dash of menace and mischief. He has some of the <b>abrasiveness</b> of William Hartnell, the stylishness of Jon Pertwee and the eccentricity of Tom Baker – all my favourite Doctors". Alison Graham of Radio Times stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is the Victor Meldrew Doctor Who; he's abrasive, acerbic and has no truck with modern life". Upon interviewing Capaldi just weeks before his first episode, he quoted he was [...] "a more grown-up Doctor" [...] albeit one who is still [...] "mirthful. He's serious when he needs to be, but he's still quite comic". Patrick Mulkern added [...] "Peter Capaldi simply is the Doctor; the most persuasive since Tom Baker" [...] and described him as [...] "the Scotch-on-the-rocks Doctor – distilled, chilly, stinging on the palate but warming on the way down".|$|E
