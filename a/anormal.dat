40|$|Emotions {{are very}} {{important}} in creating a sense of reality. But what are emotions? In this thesis I will argue that emotions (and feelings) are a form of perception based on somatic experiences. The arguments are based around some cases of alternative states of consciousness: Depersonalization and Cotards delusion. These states of consciousness are analyzed neurologically to see where in the neural network there is alternative activity. People that suffer from these <b>anormal</b> states of mind have decresead activity in brain areas {{that are important in}} creating a body image (which explains why they feel as if they don’t have a body and as if they don’t exist etc.). This form of delusions are not irrational, but the only logical deduction from their neuroanatomical activation. The conslusions in this thesis is that (1) to feel an emotion (or feeling) a person must be able to feel the body in some way. If this ability disappears one has lost the ability to feel any form of feelings. All emotions are somatic in nature. (2) Delusions are not a form of faulty rationalization, but rather rationalization based on <b>anormal</b> experience, which is caused by on alternative neuronal activity that alters the sense of reality...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The nerve {{conduction}} {{findings in}} interdigital neuropathy {{of the foot}} (IDN; Morton's neuroma) have rarely been reported. We analyzed the nerve conduction data in 23 patients with suspected IDN studied between 1982 and 2002. METHOD: Diagnosis of IDN was {{made on the basis}} of clinical features. All patients underwent routine nerve conduction studies and a near-nerve needle sensory nerve conduction study of the interdigital nerves by Oh's method in the symptomatic foot. RESULTS:Of the 23 patients, the diagnosis of definite IDN was made in 13 cases and of possible NDN in the others cases. Nineteen were females. Twenty two patients had only one nerve affected. One patient had two nerves affected. The III-IV interdigital nerve was affected in 17 cases and the II-III interdigital nerve in 7 cases. The near-nerve needle nerve conduction showed abnormality in the affected interdigital nerves in all definite IDN cases and confirmed the diagnosis of IDN in 10 cases by the abnormal dip phenomenon (a selective decrease of 50 % or more in the sensory CNAP amplitude of the affected nerve compared with that of the preceding interdigital nerve). In 11 possible IDN cases, IDN was identified by the abnormal dip phenomenon. CONCLUSION: The near-nerve needle sensory nerve conduction of the interdigital nerves is a highly sensitive diagnostic test, and abnormal dip phenomenon is the most characteristic electrophysiological marker for the diagnosis of IDN. OBJETIVO: Os achados da condução nervosa na neuropatia interdigital do pé (NIP) têm sido raramente descritos. Nós analisamos os dados da condução nervosa de 23 pacientes com suspeita de NIP entre 1982 e 2002. MÉTODO: O diagnóstico de NIP foi clínico. Todos os pacientes foram submetidos a estudos de condução nervosa de rotina e ao estudo de condução sensitiva dos nervos interdigitais com agulha justa-neural pelo método de Oh. RESULTADOS: Dos 23 pacientes, o diagnóstico de NIP foi definitivo em 13 casos é possível nos demais. Dezenove pacientes eram mulheres e 22 tinham somente um nervo afetado. Apenas um paciente teve dois nervos comprometidos. O nervo interdigital III-IV foi afetado em 17 casos e o nervo interdigital II-III em 7 casos. A condução nervosa justa-neural foi <b>anormal</b> nos nervos interdigitais acometidos em todos os casos definitivos e confirmou o diagnóstico de neuropatia interdigital em 10 casos pelo fenômeno da diminuição de amplitude <b>anormal</b> (uma diminuição seletiva de 50 % ou mais da amplitude do PANS do nervo afetado quando comparado com o nervo anterior.
