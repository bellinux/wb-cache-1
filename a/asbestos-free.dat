5000|$|The {{incidence}} of mesothelioma {{has been found}} to be higher in populations living near naturally occurring asbestos. People can be exposed to naturally occurring asbestos in areas where mining or road construction is occurring, or when the asbestos-containing rock is naturally weathered. Another common route of exposure is through asbestos-containing soil, which is used to whitewash, plaster, and roof houses in Greece. In central Cappadocia, Turkey, mesothelioma was causing 50% of all deaths in three small villages—Tuzköy, Karain, and Sarıhıdır. Initially, this was attributed to erionite. Environmental exposure to asbestos has caused mesothelioma in places other than Turkey, including Corsica, Greece, Cyprus, China, and California.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} concern over asbestos, more companies are considering {{the possibility of}} changing to <b>asbestos-free,</b> non-metallic gaskets. However, caution should be exercised when adopting alternative materials because their applicational requirements are sig@-cantly different. Specifically, when compared with premium quality compressed asbestos jibre grades, the calendered <b>asbestos-free</b> grades generally have: lower temperature and pressure ratings, temperature and pressure ratings which do not co-exist (that is as the temperature increases, the maximum internal pressure sealable decreases), higher minimum surface stress requirements, lower maximum surface stress values, lower creep resistance, diflerent chemical resistance, poorer performance in steam and less tolerance to the deleterious effects of jointing compounds. This paper attempts to demonstrate why this new group of materials {{should not be considered}} as a direct replacement for compressed asbestos fibre but rather as a limited substitute. It also offers some hope for the future with the prediction of the development of a calendered <b>asbestos-free</b> grade with similar properties to the best traditional asbestos-based grades but without the large cost penalty involved in selecting exfoliated graphite. ...|$|E

The results showed that the presence of fiber-cement extended by 5 – 10 % the dormant period of the binder hydration, when compared to that of Portland cement, depending on the substitution rate considered. Furthermore, at 28 days, the replacement of cement with 5 and 20 % of fibercement caused a reduction of 14 – 35 % in compressive strength, when compared to the reference mortar performances.

Therefore, we re-created 1960 s-era chrysotile-containing joint compound (JCC) and compared its characteristics to a current-day <b>asbestos-free</b> joint compound (JCN).

The result obtained showed that the brake pad produced with the corn husk passing the finer 100 μm screen gave better compressive strength, higher hardness, lower porosity and lower rate of wear, consequent on the finer distribution of the corn husks particles in the matrix.
