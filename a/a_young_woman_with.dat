5|$|As with Seasons, the Triforce {{calls out}} to Link. Link is transported to a forest {{in the land of}} Labrynna, where he hears screaming. In a clearing, Link finds a woman encircled by monsters. When the monsters see Link, they scatter in all directions. The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> blue hair singing on a tree stump, {{surrounded}} by forest creatures. A shadow emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows. Veran soars into Nayru's body and possesses her. Nayru was the Oracle of Ages; her abduction causes a disruption in the time flow of Labrynna.|$|E

5|$|The cult members, squeamish about {{committing}} acts of violence, {{decide that}} Jacqueline, who is suicidal, should kill herself. When she refuses, they let her leave, but send an assassin to follow her. The assassin chases {{her through the}} darkened streets with a switchblade, but she eludes him and returns to her apartment above Dante's. She briefly encounters her neighbor, Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> a terminal illness. Mimi confesses to Jacqueline that she's afraid to die, and plans to have one last night out on the town. Jacqueline enters her own apartment and hangs herself.

5|$|In 1975, it was {{reported}} that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in Kings Worthy, England, fetal remains appeared to lie within the birth canal of the skeleton of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>with</b> the fetal cranium external to the pelvic outlet and between the two femora (thigh bones) and the fetal leg bones clearly within the pelvic cavity. Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show History Cold Case, featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{includes}} a historical {{reference to the}} medical profession starting to acknowledge and identify female homosexuality in the 19th century when a friend of Diana's named Dickie reads aloud during a party from a medical text describing the histories of several acknowledged lesbians, including Dickie's own. One story discussed among the wealthy women at the party is about <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> a large clitoris, which they consider congenital in lower-class women. They attempt to prove their point with Diana's maid Zena, but Nan prevents this humiliation, which precipitates her final rift with Diana. Using Dickie's book to strike Nan across the face, Diana gives her a black eye and bloody cheek before throwing her {{out into the street}} with Zena. Nan goes to Florence's house, which is filled with socialist literature. Although Diana is a supporter of women's suffrage, she discourages Nan from reading such literature, confiscating any political material Nan picks up. In contrast, Nan feels hopelessly uninformed when Florence and her friends engage in heated political debates. She asks questions, but feels stupid about not knowing the answers. Florence introduces her to the writings of Walt Whitman, Eleanor Marx, and Edward Carpenter, which they sexualise by using as an introduction to intimacy.|$|E

Hugh Jackman reprises {{his role as}} Logan / Wolverine in an uncredited cameo in a bar, dismissing an approach by Xavier and Lehnsherr to join them. Jackman said he accepted the offer to appear because [...] "it sounded perfect to me", particularly for Wolverine being the only character with a swear word.

500|$|An {{article that}} {{appeared}} in the New York Times on December 26, 2011, [...] "Navigating Love and Autism" [...] by Amy Harmon, described how <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> Asperger syndrome used My Little Pony characters to relieve stress.

The story misidentified Twilight Sparkle as Fluttershy on initial publication and the paper issued a correction, which some journalists have jokingly considered as [...] "the best New York Times correction ever", though others saw it {{as a sign of the}} journalistic integrity of the Times. Harmon was contacted by fans about the mistake, and said, [...] "I hate to get anything wrong, but I confess to some enjoyment in finding the right way to phrase this one." [...] In 2015, the New York Times reported that Dylann Roof, the suspect in the Charleston church shooting, was a fan of My Little Pony, but later corrected itself after recognizing it had been duped in a experiment run by a blogger, who had faked the claim but made it as credible as possible as to test how much fact checking major news sources were doing on a high-interest topic.|$|E

500|$|Winslet had {{roles in}} two period dramas of 1996Jude and Hamlet. As with her Heavenly Creatures part, her roles in these films {{were those of}} women with a [...] "mad edge". In Michael Winterbottom's Jude, {{based on the novel}} Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy, she played Sue Bridehead, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> suffragette leanings who falls in love with her cousin, Jude (played by Christopher Eccleston). Roger Ebert {{believed}} that the part allowed Winslet to display her acting range, and praised her for [...] "making Sue into a sassy, defiant woman who would rather be right than happy". After unsuccessfully auditioning for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 film Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Winslet was cast for the part of Ophelia, the doomed lover of the title character, in Branagh's adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. Winslet, at 20 years old, was intimidated by the experience of performing Shakespeare with established actors such as Branagh and Julie Christie, saying that the job required her to [...] "hit a certain level of intellect that I don't believe I have". Even so, Mike Jeffries of Empire believed that she had played the part [...] "well beyond her years". Despite the acclaim, Jude and Hamlet earned little at the box office.|$|E
500|$|Koechlin {{starred in}} Shonali Bose's drama Margarita with a Straw, playing Laila, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> {{cerebral}} palsy who leaves {{her home in}} India to study in New York City, unexpectedly falls in love, and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Her character was inspired by Malini Chib, Bose's cousin. Bose first approached Koechlin, who she said was her [...] "first and only choice", for the role when the latter was shooting for Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewaani. Due to the clashing schedule Bose went on to audition other actresses to substitute Koechlin, but felt that [...] "something was missing" [...] in each one, and she eventually decided to push the filming for three months to accommodate her. In {{an interview with the}} Times of India, Koechlin acknowledged that the role was the most challenging of her film career, and she took six months off her filming schedule to prepare for it. She underwent a six-week training workshop with actor Adil Hussain. The workshop aimed at making her [...] "body language seem natural", while also focusing on the speech pattern of patients with cerebral palsy. Koechlin spent considerable time with Chib and her physiotherapist and speech therapist. She also attended a month-long workshop in Delhi, where she worked on the movement of the body parts. Although the film covers aspects of physical disability, Koechlin dubbed it [...] "a romcom with some hurdles".|$|E
500|$|He ventures to Kazran's {{past and}} meets {{him as a}} kind-hearted young boy, {{interested}} in the unique properties of the planet's atmosphere that allow fish to swim in it. The Doctor experiments with Kazran, leading to a shark entering the room and swallowing the Doctor's sonic screwdriver. Though the Doctor is able to recover part of the screwdriver, the shark is wounded in the effort, unable to swim back into the atmosphere. Kazran offers a solution by taking him to a cryogenic storeroom where his father has kept people in storage as [...] "security" [...] for loans, including Abigail (Katherine Jenkins), <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> whom Kazran has been enamored. Abigail, once released, sings to soothe the shark while the Doctor uses Abigail's cryo-unit to transport the shark back to the atmosphere. As the Doctor and Kazran return Abigail to storage, Kazran promises her they will see her every Christmas Eve. The Doctor keeps this promise, using the TARDIS to jump forward each year, helping to reunite Kazran and Abigail and watching their relationship blossom with the two falling in love and eventually kissing. However, after one such visit, Abigail tells the now young adult Kazran a secret, and Kazran requests the Doctor end the practice, keeping Abigail in storage indefinitely. Though old Kazran in the present becomes pleased with his new memories, he remains bitter at Abigail's fate and refuses to help save the ship.
