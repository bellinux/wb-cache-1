First, {{the problem of}} blending <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brakes,</b> foundation brakes and gear for high mean speed in down hill cruising situations is investigated. An optimization problem with constraints such as vehicle speed and disc temperature is formulated and solved, resulting in a well performing controller even compared to experienced drivers. It is shown that the mean speed can be improved by controlling the whole brake system. Second, the issue of distributing a required force between auxiliary and foundation brakes {{in order to minimize}} wear cost of pad, disc, and tyres is investigated. The neural network controllers obtained from the optimization procedure significantly outperform the traditional strategy of using non-wear <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brakes</b> in order to minimize pad and disc wear cost...|$|E
40|$|A {{self-excited}} {{induction generator}} (SEIG) {{can be a}} candidate for isolated applications because it does not require any external exciting power but can independently generate electricity. It is also a good candidate for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brakes</b> in heavy vehicles for several reasons. First, the power efficiency in a brake system is not important as compared with motors or generators. Second, an SEIG can be controlled by a simple electrical circuit. Third, it can be used for regenerative braking. Finally, it is very robust. In this paper, an auxiliary brake for heavy vehicles is proposed by adapting an SEIG and its analog control circuit. The brake structure is the same as that in conventional eddy current brakes but operates as an SEIG. The suggested control circuit does not adopt an electric controller unit but only consists of simple electric devices. A miniature model was designed and manufactured, and the experimental results using the prototype verify that the proposed brake system, including the controller, is very useful.

40|$|In this thesis, {{downhill}} driving {{strategies that}} co–ordinate the different brake actuators in heavy duty vehicles have been developed. As a starting point, the vehicle features {{affected by the}} retardation system are investigated. The main conclusions are that the retardation power demand will increase {{in the future and}} that, therefore, optimization of the brake systems will come to play a major role. In particular, strategies for the integration of foundation brakes, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brakes,</b> and gear box have to be developed. Furthermore, these strategies must take component wear cost into consideration. Additionally, a thorough description of the current situation in terms of driver behaviour and existing systems for driver assistance is given. Optimal control and nonlinear programming have been used for the generation of open–loop optimal driving strategies. Two different methods have been employed for the generation of implementable, closed–loop, driving strategies. First, a method that utilizes neural networks and genetic algorithms is presented. Second, in order to further enhance the controller transparency, and the possibility for robust implementation, the control problem is divided into two differentmodes of operation. Linear quadratic control using gain scheduling is then utilized for the controller design and generation of actuator reference values. Comparison with the open–loop optimal strategies is also made. It is shown that transport efficiency (i. e. mean speed) and retardation economy (i. e. component wear cost) can be improved significantly, even compared to what skilled drivers can achieve, by integrating the whole retardation system. It is furthermore shown that there is a trade–off between component wear cost and transport efficiency that must be balanced in order to achieve good brake performance. The main parameters that affect the longitudinal control of the vehicle are the level of vehicle utilization (mass) and road slope. Algorithms for estimation of vehicle mass and road slope are therefore developed and presented. Additionally, a downhill driving strategy is implemented and verified in a real truck...|$|E

40|$|Advanced driver {{assistance}} systems in {{cars and trucks}} are getting ever more sophisticated {{with an emphasis on}} improving fuel efficiency, safety, and driver convenience. In a few years advanced navigation systems that can provide detailed real-time information about the road ahead are expected to become available. For this reason, it is important to investigate how assistance systems can be improved when this type of information becomes available. In this thesis, the assignment is to improve an existing cruise control algorithm using foundation brakes by integrating information about the road ahead. The goal is that the behavior should resemble that of an experienced truck driver. By doing this, the algorithm assimilates potential energy available in downhill slopes. At the same time, speed conditions must be fulfilled and the brakes should be used in an effective way. An algorithm has been developed that achieves the desired behavior. Before entering a descent, the speed is allowed to drop down to a defined minimum speed. When in the slope, the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brakes</b> are used continuously while the foundation brakes are used for short periods of time when the speed reaches a defined maximum value. The brakes are controlled so that the vehicle leaves the slope at the maximum allowed speed. In order to avoid brake disc wear and, in worst case, a sudden reduction of the brake capacity, the brake disc temperature is monitored. If necessary, the speed is reduced to reduce the utilization rate of the foundation brakes. The results show that the behavior of an experienced driver can be approximated when introducing preview information in to the cruise controller algorithm. It has further been shown that the algorithm has the potential to reduce the foundation brake use with up to 10 % in specific scenarios, compared to an existing cruise controller. The same comparison shows that the developed algorithm assimilates more available energy due to the speed reduction before a slope starts. This is achieved with only small effects on the average speed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the cost of rear-end collisions in Denmark, and to define the potential financial benefits of a high, center-mounted <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brake</b> light for automobiles. The study was limited to passenger cars struck from behind. The annual cost of two different preventive programs involving <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brake</b> lights was compared to the annual cost of the accidents expected to be prevented in each program. The finding was that rear-end collisions cost on average over 13, 700 1980 Danish kroner (approx. US$ 2300), 70 % of which was property damage. There are so many rear-end collisions that even if the new brake-light configuration were only one-third as effective in Denmark as it has been in U. S. field trials the mounting of required auxiliary lights would be a sound investment. Substantial savings would be anticipated whether the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brake</b> lights were required on all passenger cars as of a particular date, or only on newly registered passenger cars, although the former preventive program is preferable by usual cost benefit criteria.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{describes}} {{an evaluation of}} truck drivers’ attitudes towards electrical and spring returning steering wheel stalks, and the following development of design concepts for electrical and spring returning steering wheel stalks in future Volvo Trucks. Electrical and spring returning steering wheel stalks are today used in cars for the interaction with steering wheel stalk functions such as direction indicator, windscreen wiper and cruise control. An introduction of electrical and spring returning stalks in Volvo Trucks would bring advantages of adaptability and facilitate the stalk placement, {{but it would also}} mean a loss of feedback and require a change in the truck driver’s interaction with the steering wheel stalks. An evaluation was performed with truck drivers driving cars equipped with electrical and spring returning steering wheel stalks. The evaluation focused on the direction indicator, windscreen wiper and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brake</b> and included driving a test route while performing user tasks and answering a verbal questionnaire. The purpose of the evaluation was to explore the truck drivers’ acceptance of using spring returning stalks, how the stalks are experienced in ordinary driving situations and investigate possible interaction difficulties and importance of different feedback. The results of the evaluation indicate that the truck drivers are positive of having spring returning in their truck. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brake</b> stalk should be further evaluated since the cars were not equipped with spring returning stalks for this function and could only be evaluated in a theoretical way. Furthermore, the evaluation results show that the feeling of resistance in the stalks is very important for an efficient stalk interaction and that quick activation and cancellation of modes should be possible. Based on the results from the evaluation, a requirement specification was compiled and a number of sub problems were identified for the following concept development. Concepts for spring returning stalks for the direction indicator, windscreen wiper and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brake</b> were generated, evaluated and further developed. The final concepts for instance include directions of moving the stalks, sequences of modes, control of rain sensor and interval functionality, and light control functionality exclusive for the North American market. The design of the stalks is of principles and is visualized in rendered pictures of 3 D surface models and a simulation was developed to demonstrate the interaction with the stalks.

The eddy current brake is a brake that generates a braking torque in a rotational direction opposite to the direction of the rotor by using a time-varying magnetic flux. The eddy current brake has the advantage of being able to take high current densities because this is used {{for a short period of}} time. Also, the eddy current brake is influenced by multiple factor such as number of slots, teeth width, coating thickness, air-gap length and so on. Therefore the eddy current brake was designed for use in railway application in consideration of the operation region and critical parameters. ? ??? ????????? ????? ??? ???? ???????...|$|R

There he went 326 km/h (202.5 mph) in his Lamborghini Aventador. This led to nearly avoiding a crash as his car spun out of control. At this point Dickson realized he needed a more efficient braking system than the hydraulic brakes that came standard in most super-cars. Being a engineer by trade he started to examine the braking systems of other fast moving vehicles such as trucks and trains. These vehicles relied on an air brake system that was more efficient for it did not require fluid to be retained and allowed the storage of potential energy. He utilized the design as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brake</b> to be applied when speeds greater than 100 km/h are reached.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} field study investigating {{the impact of}} single wheel hub motor failures on the dynamic behavior of a vehicle and the corresponding driver reaction is presented in this work. The experiment is performed at urban speeds on a closed off test track. The single wheel hub motor failure is emulated with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>brake</b> system in a modified electric vehicle. Driver reaction times are derived from the measured data and discussed in their experimental context. The failure is rated and evaluated objectively based on the dynamic behavior of the vehicle.

The controllability evaluation of the vehicle behavior shows that no critical traffic situation occurs for the tested failure conditions. However, even small deviations of the vehicle can impair traffic safety, specifically for other traffic participants like bicyclist and pedestrians. QC 20150520 </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} computer-assisted troubleshooting {{of heavy}} vehicles such as trucks and buses. In this setting, {{the person that}} is troubleshooting a vehicle problem is assisted by a computer {{that is capable of}} listing possible faults that can explain the problem and gives recommendations of which actions to take in order to solve the problem such that the expected cost of restoring the vehicle is low. To achieve this, such a system must be capable of solving two problems: the diagnosis problem of finding which the possible faults are and the decision problem of deciding which action should be taken. The diagnosis problem has been approached using Bayesian network models. Frameworks have been developed for the case when the vehicle is in the workshop only and for remote diagnosis when the vehicle is monitored during longer periods of time. The decision problem has been solved by creating planners that select actions such that the expected cost of repairing the vehicle is minimized. New methods, algorithms, and models have been developed for improving the performance of the planner. The theory developed has been evaluated on models of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>braking</b> system, a fuel injection system, and an engine temperature control and monitoring system...|$|R

It was found that if passengers stood {{in some areas of}} the upper tiers of the Golden Chariots, there was not enough of a safety clearance in the tunnel on that line. Therefore the Company only used the Golden Chariots on the spectacular mountain right-of-way for occasional charter trips. The Mount Royal streetcar private right-of-way would later become the Camillien Houde Parkway for automobiles. Service was normally provided by the regular cars of the 11-Mountain route from the east, and the 93-Remembrance route from the west. Both routes met at Summit Loop near today's Beaver Lake (Lac des Castors) Pavilion where Remembrance Road and the Camillien Houde Parkway meet. The 93-Remembrance route was one of the shortest in the city, being only about three-quarters of a mile long from its western terminus at Remembrance and Cote des Neiges Roads. While the 93-Remembrance route was a relatively straight line to Summit Loop, the 11-Mountain route was far more challenging.

When the stock brake is applied, fluid passes freely through the stunt master cylinder inlet port and compensating port and out the exhaust port to the rear wheels. When the stunt brake is applied, the piston in the master cylinder blocks off the compensating port to the exhaust port and pressurizes the rear brake system, cutting off the original brake master cylinder besides the compensating port in the stunt brake. BF Goodrich TA's were added for enhanced stick, as were Tilton brake calipers. The improved traction required installation of a hydraulic in-line brake power booster lifted from a Volvo P-1800. It operates on engine vacuum to aid in breaking loose the pavement-hugging TA's. To further enhance the growl of the vehicle, Robert's team installed a NOS port-injected nitrous system, which was later replaced with a plate-type configuration.
