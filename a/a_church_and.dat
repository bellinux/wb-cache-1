5|$|A {{site for}} a church had been set aside on the estate from the outset, and in 1884 Plumbe {{submitted}} designs for <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> mission hall. The mission hall opened in March 1885 with room for 350, and soon began to suffer from overcrowding. The people of Noel Park started a fund {{to pay for the}} church, which was consecrated on 1 November 1889 as St Mark's.|$|E
5|$|As the Telephone Building {{was being}} {{completed}} in 1925, {{a group of}} Methodist Episcopalians came to Pflueger, asking him to design a new skyscraper containing both <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> a hotel for them at 100 McAllister Street. After a dispute, Miller and Pflueger were fired from the project {{to be replaced by}} Lewis P. Hobart. Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design was not significantly changed from Pflueger's original. Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in court, equivalent to $ today.|$|E

5|$|R.H. Brandling of Middleton Lodge gave land on Town Street {{on which}} to build <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> parsonage in 1845. St Mary's Church was built in 1846 to designs by R. D. Chantrell, who also {{designed}} Leeds Parish Church. The church and its lych gate are designated Grade II listed buildings. The church originally had a tall spire which was taken down because of mining subsidence in 1939. There is a tradition that local miners gave either a week's wages or a week's work towards the cost of its construction.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival at Sigeberht's court, Felix {{established}} a church at Dommoc, his episcopal see, which is widely taken to mean Dunwich, on the Suffolk coast. Dunwich has since been almost totally destroyed by the effects of coastal erosion. Other historians have suggested as an alternative site for Felix's see the coastal Walton, Suffolk near Felixstowe, where {{there was once a}} Roman fort. <b>A</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> priory were dedicated to him there by Roger Bigod in 1105.|$|E

Primitive Baptist minister John Monroe (1750–1824) is credited for establishing a place of worship at this site; he is interred in the church's cemetery. The land on which Capon Chapel was built originally belonged to William C. Nixon (1789–1869), a member of the Virginia House of Delegates; later, it was transferred to the Pugh family. The first documented mention of a church at the Capon Chapel site was in March 1852, when Joseph Pugh allocated the land to three trustees for the construction of <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Cerezeda left Trujillo {{temporarily}} and, with Vasco de Herrera also gone, Méndez de Hinostrosa {{attempted to}} seize sole power. Vasco de Herrera at length returned, but had left {{many of his}} soldiers fighting native resistance in the Valley of Olancho, led by his brother Diego Díaz de Herrera. Vasco de Herrera ordered that Méndez de Hinostrosa be executed, but he sought sanctuary in <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> his supporters soon rallied to him, outnumbering Vasco de Herrera's men in Trujillo. Cerezeda returned to Trujillo and attempted to mediate between the opposing factions, but Vasco de Herrera was assassinated and Méndez de Hinostrosa seized control of the town. Cerezeda refused to recognise him, and both parties sent urgent messages to Diego Díaz de Herrera in Olancho, requesting his support; many of his men expressed their support for Méndez de Hinostrosa. Cerezeda acted quickly and fierce fighting erupted in Trujillo. Cerezeda captured Méndez de Hinostrosa and beheaded him. Finally, {{after a year of}} Spanish infighting, Cerezeda emerged as sole governor of Honduras.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Funeral (2004), which had been {{recorded}} in an attic studio known as Hotel2Tango, Arcade Fire decided a permanent recording location was necessary. Following their tour in support of Funeral, the band bought the Petite Église in Farnham, Quebec. Being used as a café {{at the time of}} purchase, the Petite Église had once been <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> a Masonic Temple. Once renovation of the church was complete, the band spent the latter half of 2006 recording a majority of the album there. Michael Pärt produced additional recordings in Budapest, recording the Budapest Film Orchestra and a military men's choir. Other sessions included one in New York, where the band recorded along the Hudson River to be near water.|$|E
5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E

5|$|Mauna Loa {{continued}} its activity, {{and of the}} eruptions that occurred in 1887, 1892, 1896, 1899, 1903 (twice), 1907, 1914, 1916, 1919, and 1926, three (in 1887, 1919, and 1926) were partially subaerial. The 1926 eruption in particular is noteworthy for having inundated of a village near Hoopuloa, destroying 12 houses, <b>a</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> a small harbor. After an event in 1933, Mauna Loa's 1935 eruption caused a public crisis when its flows started to head towards Hilo. A bombing operation was decided upon to try and divert the flows, planned out by then-lieutenant colonel George S. Patton. The bombing, conducted on December 27, was declared a success by Thomas A. Jaggar, director of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, and lava stopped flowing by January 2, 1936. However, the role the bombing played in ending the eruption has since been heavily disputed by volcanologists. A longer but summit-bound event in 1940 was comparatively less interesting.|$|E
5|$|New Sleaford had <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> priest by {{the time}} of the Domesday Book (1086) and the vicarage was founded in 1274. During the Commonwealth (1649–60), the vicar was {{expelled}} and replaced by Puritan ministers, the last of whom was removed following the Restoration in 1660 and replaced with an Anglican clergyman. In 1616, the vicarage was valued at £8 and in 1872 at £180. As of 2015, the ecclesiastical parish of St Denys, Sleaford, encloses the town of Sleaford and hamlet of Holdingham north of the railway line and does not include Quarrington. It falls within the Lafford Deanery, the Lincoln Archdeaconry and the Diocese of Lincoln. The patron is the Bishop of Lincoln and the incumbent vicar is the Rev. Philip Anthony Johnson, who was instituted in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Prominent Catholic {{families}} in the Leigh parish did not abandon the Catholic faith after the English Reformation despite penalties levied on papists. Secret Roman Catholic masses were held in private homes, including Morleys Hall, home of the Tyldesleys. On Easter Sunday 1641, the Catholic priest, Ambrose Barlow was arrested during a service at Morleys Hall at the instigation of the vicar of Leigh. He was taken to Lancaster Castle, tried as a traitor and executed on 10 September 1641. He was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church {{as one of the}} Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. <b>A</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> school bear his name. The St Ambrose Barlow parish was formed in 1965 and the church was built in 1981. St Ambrose Barlow parish is in the Leigh Pastoral Area in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Protestants had {{received}} services from itinerant ministers {{in the late}} 1790s, but the Spanish required them to move to American territory until after the Louisiana Purchase. After the purchase, the Baptist missionary John Mason Peck built the first Protestant church in St. Louis in 1818. Methodist ministers reached the town {{during the early years}} after the purchase, but only formed a congregation in 1821. The Presbyterian Church in St. Louis began as a Bible reading society in 1811, and in December 1817 members organized <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> built a chapel late the next year. A fourth Protestant group to take root was the Episcopal Church, founded in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Since Duke Mislav of the Duchy of Croatia made Klis Fortress {{the seat}} of his throne {{in the middle of the}} 9th century, the {{fortress}} served as {{the seat of}} many Croatia's rulers. The reign of his successor, Duke Trpimir I, the founder of the Croatian royal House of Trpimirović, is significant for spreading Christianity in the Duchy of Croatia. He largely expanded the Klis Fortress, and in Rižinice, in the valley under the fortress, he built <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> the first Benedictine monastery in Croatia. During the reign of the first Croatian king, Tomislav, Klis and Biograd na Moru were his chief residences.|$|E
5|$|St Denys' Church, Sleaford, is {{a medieval}} parish church in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. While <b>a</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> a priest {{are likely to}} have been present in the {{settlement}} since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and spire. The tower and spire can be dated to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the Church of England.|$|E
