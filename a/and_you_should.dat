500|$|The {{issue of}} torture on {{the series was}} {{discussed}} by President Bill Clinton who stated {{that he does not}} feel there is a place in U.S. policy for torture, but [...] "If you're the Jack Bauer person, you'll do whatever you do <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be prepared to take the consequences." [...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E
500|$|The long-held view is {{that the}} Empress {{accepted}} the circumscribed role in which she found herself, and that her life, duty and purpose were tied to her position as the Emperor's wife. However, her personal letters reveal that she could be strongheaded, sometimes at odds with her husband, and had a life of her own—albeit somewhat restricted. In a letter written on 2 May 1845 she stated: [...] "I wait for the moment when we will meet, good Pedro, and seek forgiveness for all that I did to you during these days." [...] In another letter of 24 January 1851, she acknowledged her difficult temperament: [...] "I am not irritated at you [...] <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> forgive me because this is my character." ...|$|E

One pseudonymous writer citing unnamed sources said Lively was among five leading contenders that included Eva Green, Keri Russell, Diane Kruger and Jennifer Garner. About her stunt work in which she rehearsed with stunt coordinator Gary Powell (Casino Royale, The Bourne Ultimatum, Quantum of Solace), gymnastic acrobats from Cirque du Soleil and used aerial stunt rigs created for The Matrix, Lively explained, [...] "Our director likes it real—the fights close and dirty... I'm 40 feet in the air, spiraling around. That's the best workout you can ever do because it's all core... You do that for ten minutes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> see your body the next day!

I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being a World Cup {{winner in}} the {{previous}} summer, Banks was dropped {{towards the end of}} the 1966–67 season in favour of highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton. Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks [...] "we [...] think your best days are behind you, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> move on". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at £50,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for £65,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not want to go back on his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side.|$|E

500|$|The former British {{video game}} {{publication}} Super Play, which had three editors review the game, also enjoyed it. The magazine's Zy Nicholson {{noted that the}} game was better than his favorite game, Mega Man X, describing Super Metroid as [...] "more of an experience than a game". Comparing the game to the 1986 film Aliens, Nicholson felt that the game was best experienced when played in the dark with the volume turned up. He found the game so compulsive that he was tempted to play [...] "without eating or sleeping". The publication's Tony Mott named the game's atmosphere its best aspect, calling the game a mix of Turrican (1990), Aliens, Exile (1989), and Nodes of Yesod (1985). Appreciating the game's controls, Mott applauded Nintendo's ability to create a refined gameplay. He concluded his review by calling Super Metroid [...] "undoubtedly the best game I've played this year so far", predicting that anyone who plays the game would be [...] "playing a game destined for classic status". The third reviewer, James Leach, agreed with Nicholson and Mott that Super Metroid was what Mega Man X should have been. Concluding his review, Leach wrote that Super Metroid contained everything he looked for in a video game: [...] "playability, hidden tricks, powerful weapons and steamingly evil baddies". After summarizing the reviews, the magazine's verdict was, [...] "We all love this game. Super Metroid is absolutely marvelous <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> own it." ...|$|E
500|$|Biden became {{interested}} in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. [...] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden {{was among the first to}} call for the [...] "lift and strike" [...] policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes. [...] Both the George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement. [...] In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. [...] Biden related that he told Milošević, [...] "I think you're a damn war criminal <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be tried as one." [...] Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnians, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance preferred by the Clinton administration, before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman. The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort. [...] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his [...] "proudest moment in public life" [...] that related to foreign policy. [...] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia and Montenegro, and co-sponsored with his friend John McCain the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on President Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milosevic over Serbian actions in Kosovo. [...] In 1998, Congressional Quarterly named Biden one of [...] "Twelve Who Made a Difference" [...] for playing a lead role in several foreign policy matters, including NATO enlargement and the successful passage of bills to streamline foreign affairs agencies and punish religious persecution overseas.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Howling Bells was {{met with}} overall {{positive}} reviews from music critics. It was recognised for its effective combination of elements of pop, country, blues and rock. Niall O'Keeffe of Yahoo! Music noted its depth and range and compared it {{to the music of}} Hope Sandoval. He went on to say, [...] "A debut album couldn't be more sophisticated if it wore a beret and smoked filterless French cigarettes while reading Rimbaud by candlelight." [...] Chris Waugh of ILikeMusic admired Joel's guitar playing, calling it [...] "brilliantly inventive." [...] He also praised the band's ability to write what he called [...] "brooding and killer" [...] verses and choruses. He ended by saying the album was [...] "a truly special debut by a truly special band, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> let it start seeping into your consciousness now." [...] Richard Hughes of CD Times drew comparisons to My Bloody Valentine, PJ Harvey and a David Lynch movie soundtrack. He warned, [...] "You'll find yourself following their path down the dark side of rock 'n roll." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then Vishnu, the omniscient {{director}} of the cosmic game, staged a small comedy. He transformed Nandi (the bull of Shiva) into a dancing bull and conducted {{him in front of}} Gajasura, assuming, at the same time, the appearance of a flutist. The enchanting performance of the bull sent the demon into ecstasies, and he asked the flutist to tell him what he desired. The musical Vishnu responded: [...] "Can you give me that which I ask?" [...] Gajasura replied: [...] "Who do you take me for? I can immediately give you whatever you ask." [...] The flutist then said: [...] "If that's so, liberate Shiva from your stomach." [...] Gajasura understood then that this must have been no other than Vishnu himself, {{the only one who could}} have known that secret and he threw himself at his feet. Having agreed to liberate Shiva, Gajasura asks him for two last gifts: [...] "I have been blessed by you with many gifts; my last requests are that everyone should remember me adoring my head <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> wear my skin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviewers {{commonly}} {{cited the}} online multiplayer aspect {{as one of}} the strongest points of the game, with it being described as greatly extending its replay value. Computer Games Magazines Cindy Yans said that [...] "weapons, armor and items are so numerous that you're always acquiring something new to try... not to mention the game's multiplayer universe"; she {{went on to say that}} [...] "for anyone who enjoys a good multiplayer dungeon crawl, Diablo can't be beat". The most common complaint about the game was the length of its single-player aspect, which many felt was too short. Cindy Yans finished her review, [...] "Despite the rather pale storyline, [...] watered-down quests and a fair amount of necessary repetition, Diablo is a must for anyone interested in 'just plain fun.'" [...] On GameSpot's main page for Diablo, the subtext used to describe the game when it came out simply states: [...] "Diablo is the best game to come out in the past year, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> own a copy.

2500|$|Scott Miller {{chose to}} name his new band [...] "Game Theory" [...] as {{an allusion to}} the {{mathematical}} field of game theory, which he described as [...] "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary, ... someone who was thinking against you, {{and you had to}} organize what his moves could be, and what your moves should be, to give yourself the minimum amount of failure." [...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea of a set of rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just have {{to have some sort of}} set of rules, but who knows what the set of rules should be." [...] That theme, according to Miller, was what many Game Theory songs were about: [...] "Always be wary of the superstructure of whatever situation you're in. It may just be that the whole game that you're into is something very bogus <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> get out." ...|$|E
