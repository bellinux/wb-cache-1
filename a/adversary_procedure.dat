40|$|As late as {{the eighteenth}} century, {{ordinary}} jury trial at common law was a judge-dominated, lawyer-free procedure conducted so rapidly that plea bargaining was unnecessary. Thereafter, the rise of <b>adversary</b> <b>procedure</b> and the law of evidence injected vast complexity into jury trial and made it unworkable as a routine dispositive procedure. A variety of factors, some quite fortuitous, inclined nineteenthcentury common law procedure to channel the mounting caseload into nontrial plea bargaining procedure rather than to refine its trial procedure as contemporary Continental legal systems were doing...|$|E
40|$|The article {{begins with}} a {{definition}} of a “fair trial” and some other notions involved. Then the author presents {{a discussion of the}} civil rights and duties and complaints in penal cases, moving on to the requirements set for a court as an institution, i. e. easy access to a court of law, independence of a court, impartiality and statutory guarantees of its establishment, as well as the openness of proceedings and term of case trial. Toward the end the author analyses the “soundness” of trial course, the problem of equality of parties, the issue of personal participation in an oral trial, <b>adversary</b> <b>procedure</b> and the duty to provide grounds for the verdict, in addition to presumption of the accused innocence, the requirement to inform about accusation, the right for defense preparation and free defense counsel and interpreter...|$|E
40|$|The Supreme Court {{and many}} state courts {{have assumed that}} jurors are capable, {{with the aid of}} <b>adversary</b> <b>procedures</b> (i. e., {{cross-examination}} and competing experts), of differentiating less accurate clinical opinion expert testimony (testimony based solely on a clinician's years of experience within the field) from expert testimony based on more sound scientific footing, and appropriately weighing these two types of testimony in their decisions. Psychological literature on both persuasion and jury decision-making suggests, however, that this assumption is dubious. Using a simulated capital sentencing hearing based on Texas law, this experiment investigated whether mock jurors are more influenced in their decision-making by clinical opinion expert testimony or actuarial expert testimony (testimony based on standardized risk assessment instrument). The effectiveness of different types of <b>adversary</b> <b>procedures</b> in eliminating the influence of expert testimony was also investigated. Results suggest that jurors are more influenced by clinical opinion expert testimony than they are by actuarial expert testimony, and this preference for clinical opinion expert testimony remains even after the presentation of <b>adversary</b> <b>procedures.</b> Limited empirical support was found for the notion that various types of <b>adversary</b> <b>procedures</b> will have differential impact on the influence of expert testimony on juror decisions. The legal and policy implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Mental health {{professionals}} (N= 198) read a vignette describing malpractice case {{and were asked}} to imagine themselves in the role of defendant. Using a between-subjects design, each subject was offered two possible trial procedures for resolving the case, the standard <b>adversary</b> <b>procedure</b> (ADVERS) and one of five possible hybrid procedures. Using scales that juxtaposed these two procedures, subjects provided judgments on 12 procedural justice dimensions. A series of regression analyses examined the most important determinants of PREFERENCE judgments, FAIRNESS ratings, and ratings of imagined COMPLIANCE with trial outcomes. PREFERENCE raings were significantly influenced by perceived FAIRNESS of the procedures and by OUTCOME CONTROL. Perceived ACCURACY of the available trial procedures contributed most of the unique variance explained for dependent measures of FAIRNESS AND COMPLIANCE. Results are discussed in terms of the procedural justice attributes of alternatives to the standard adversary process for resolving medical malpractice cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{common law}} {{criminal}} trial {{is dominated by}} the lawyers for prosecution and defense. In the prototypical case of serious crime (felony), counsel take the active role in shaping the litigation and proving the facts for a passive trier. Continental observers, accustomed to a nonadversarial trial in which the court itself has an active role in adducing evidence to inform its own judgment, regard our lawyerized criminal trial as a striking Anglo-American peculiarity. We seldom appreciate that this lawyerized criminal trial looks as striking from the perspective of our own legal history as from that of comparative law. It developed relatively late in a context otherwise ancient. Whereas much of our trial procedure has medieval antecedents, prosecution and defense counsel cannot be called regular until {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century. In our historical literature the relative newness of our <b>adversary</b> <b>procedure</b> has not been much emphasized, largely because it could be so little glimpsed from the conventional sources. In the present article, I shall be working mainly from novel sources in order to sketch some key features of the ordinary criminal trial in the period just before the lawyers captured it. I shall suggest that these sources require us to revise some of the received wisdom about the history of the trial, especially about the functions and the relationship of judge and jury...|$|E
40|$|Na temelju poglavito sudske građe iz 13 - 15. stoljeća rekonstruirano je nekoliko tipova kaznenog postupka u srednjovjekovnom Dubrovniku i ispitana njihova učestalost u praksi. Interpretiran je trend širenja inkvizicijskog djelovanja i visoki udio akuzacijskih postupaka. Razmotreni su izvansudski mehanizmi reakcije na zločin: osveta i pomirenje, odnosno nagodba. On {{the basis}} of about 2, 400 {{judicial}} records from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, the author has reconstructed several models of criminal procedure which were to develop in medieval Dubrovnik: the accusation (<b>adversary)</b> <b>procedure</b> with the symmetrical position of the plaintiff and the defendant, which fell into disuse {{in the second half}} of the thirteenth century; the asymmetrical accusation procedure, distinguished by the defendant’s passive position; the inquisition procedure in the Criminal court, and the inquisition procedure conducted before political institutions. The author has also examined some other means of settling disputes: revenge and out-ofcourt settlement. The quantitative analysis of the court records indicates a significant increase in proceedings initiated by private accusation since the latter half of the fourteenth century. The association of the procedural regulations with the statistical data pertaining to the stage up to which the proceedings were pursued, shows that a very large portion of the cases ended just before the witnesses were heard. This can be explained by the disposition of the plaintiff to abandon the case, most probably due to an agreement reached with the offender. The author argues that the plaintiff tended to employ the criminal procedure as a pressure tactic aimed at reaching an extra-judicial settlement. In pursuit of social harmony and order, the state welcomed the practice of outof- court settlements, encouraging the plaintiffs to favour them over court procedure...|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} of the privilege against self-incrimination - the guaranty that no person 2 ̆ 2 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself 2 ̆ 2 - was a landmark event {{in the history of}} Anglo-American criminal procedure. Prior historical scholarship has located the origins of the common law privilege {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century, as part of the aftermath of the constitutional struggles that resulted in the abolition of the courts of Star Chamber and High Commission. This essay explains that the true origins of the common law privilege are to be found not in the high politics of the English revolutions, but in the rise of <b>adversary</b> criminal <b>procedure</b> at the end of the eighteenth century. The privilege against self-incrimination at common law was the work of defense counsel...|$|R
40|$|The {{judiciary}} 2 ̆ 7 s role {{in divorce}} related child custody disputes {{has been transformed}} {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century in response to the changing characteristics of American families, changing perceptions of the needs of children, and an overwhelming case load increase. The transformation occurred in two distinct phases, and a third is currently in process. In Phase I, from the late 1960 s (the beginning of widespread 2 ̆ 2 no fault 2 ̆ 2 divorce) to 1980, the child custody court was a fault finder functioning through <b>adversary</b> <b>procedure.</b> The court 2 ̆ 7 s job was to identify a single custodial parent and assign that parent primary legal rights to the child after a trial about which parent was a better custodian for the child. Phase I courts conceived of a custody dispute much like a will contest. The parents 2 ̆ 7 marriage, like the decedent, was dead. Parents, like the heirs, were in dispute about the distribution of one of the assets of the estate [...] their children. The Phase I court 2 ̆ 7 s role was, after trial, to determine which heir/parent was more morally or psychologically worthy to control the children. The goal of the proceeding was a one time determination of custody 2 ̆ 2 rights 2 ̆ 2 which created 2 ̆ 2 stability 2 ̆ 2 for the future management of the asset. The winner was, however, largely predetermined by gender biased substantive standards that eliminated the seeming indeterminancy of the 2 ̆ 2 best interests 2 ̆ 2 test. Once the court distributed custody rights, its role in facilitating the ongoing process of reorganizing the child 2 ̆ 7 s relationships with both parents was over, except for the enforcement or modification of its initial award, tasks also accomplished through adversary process...|$|E
40|$|This Article calls {{attention}} to the breakdown of <b>adversary</b> <b>procedure</b> in a largely unexplored area of the civil justice system: the ordinary, two-party case. The twenty-first century judge confronts an entirely new state of affairs in presiding over the average civil matter. In place of the adversarial party contest, engineered and staged by attorneys, judges now face the rise of an unrepresented majority unable to propel claims, facts, and evidence into the courtroom. The adversary ideal favors a passive judge, but the unrealistic demands of such a paradigm in today’s “small case” civil justice system have sparked role confusion among judges, who {{find it difficult to}} both maintain stony silence and also reach merits-based decisions in the twelve million cases involving unrepresented parties. This Article contends that the adversary ideal is untenable in the lower civil courts. Appellate courts and ethics bodies have virtually ignored this problem, with the result that judges are left to improvise a solution. Indeed it is now routine for judges to flout tradition and doctrine by concocting ad hoc and unregulated procedures that assist the unrepresented with fact development and issue creation. This Article argues that such efforts should be formalized and regularized through an affirmative duty on judges to develop the factual record in cases that arise in the lower civil courts. In complex federal litigation, adversary norms have evolved and the judicial role has been greatly enhanced to manage the unique pre- and post-trial needs of cases with numerous parties and high public impact. This Article argues for a parallel framework to enlarge the role of the judge in small, two-party civil cases. An affirmative duty may chafe against orthodox notions of the judge as “passive arbiter,” but it would harmonize the disparate procedural practices already in use in the lower courts and go a long way towards resurrecting the procedural values of accuracy, impartiality, party voice, and transparency in civil adjudication...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, state jury reform commissions, many {{individual}} {{federal and state}} judges, and jury scholars have advocated {{the adoption of a}} variety of innovative trial procedures to assist jurors in trials. Many jury trial reforms reflect growing awareness of best practices in education and communication as well as research documenting that jurors take an active rather than a passive approach to their decision-making task. Traditional <b>adversary</b> jury trial <b>procedures</b> often appear to assume that jurors are blank slates, who will passively wait {{until the end of the}} trial and the start of jury deliberations to form opinions about the evidence. However, we now know that jurors quite actively engage in evidence evaluation, developing their opinions as the trial progresses. It makes sense to revise trial procedures so they take advantage of jurors’ decision-making tendencies and strengths. Although reform groups have endorsed many of these innovations, until recently there was only modest evidence about their impact in the courtroom. Now, substantial research on the effects of most of the reforms on juror comprehension and juror satisfaction with the trial has been completed and reported. Data are now available to judges and others seeking reliable empirical support for the changes to the traditional jury trial. This article will describe the methods used to study juries and jury trials and present recent data now available for each of the major proposed innovations. We also draw on new findings from our own recent research testing the comparative advantages of jury innovations for understanding complex scientific evidence...|$|R
