5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are smooth, elliptical, and typically measure 20–25 by 12–16µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 225–325 by 15–22.5µm. Paraphyses are septate, and cylindrical with tips that are rounded to club-shaped, and measure 150–275 by 7–15µm. Hyphal cells on sterile ridges are septate, measuring 100–175 by 10–25µm. They are tightly packed {{in an even}} layer. The terminal hyphae are club-shaped to somewhat rectangular with a flattened to broadly rounded tip.|$|E
5|$|Oxenfree was {{developed}} primarily using the Unity game engine, Adobe Photoshop, and Autodesk Maya. The game's artwork {{was made by}} Heather Gross. The game's camera distance from the player characters and 2D look {{were the result of}} functional necessity, as the team needed to show multiple characters, dialogue bubbles, and places to explore in the environment on the screen simultaneously. Working with these requirements, Gross created parallaxing, painterly backgrounds. The dark, organic elements of the setting were put in opposition to the supernatural elements, which <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> and geometric.|$|E
50|$|Altogether three {{regions of}} HRD are present here: low mass {{end of the}} main sequence, {{complete}} red giant branch and horizontal branch. In infrared red stars <b>are</b> <b>brighter,</b> that's why red stars <b>are</b> <b>brighter</b> in this diagram making the lower main sequence shallower than usual. On the other hand, the horizontal branch becomes steeper in this diagram due to IR effects (on the HB the blue end is fainter and the red end <b>is</b> <b>brighter).</b>|$|R

5|$|Pioneer 11 {{made the}} first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet {{and a few of}} its moons, {{although}} their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> when viewed at high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, Pioneer 11 measured the temperature of Titan.|$|E
5|$|All four Galilean moons <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> {{enough that}} they could be sighted from Earth without a telescope, if they were farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily visible with even low-powered binoculars.) They have {{apparent}} magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 1986U2R/ζ and λ rings, there are other extremely faint dust bands in the Uranian ring system. They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth, though they <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> in forward-scattered light. Voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, and between the α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered light, but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the Voyager observations. The normal optical depth of the dust bands is about 10−5 or less. The dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index p=2.5±0.5.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which <b>are</b> <b>bright,</b> narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} domes featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. The ornate finishes of these domes <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> in color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and stripes, and many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion domes first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion domes were strictly utilitarian, as they prevented snow from piling on the roof.|$|E

5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and CGRO (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the {{revolution}} {{in the study of}} gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, HETE-2, launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, Swift, was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational. Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically slewed to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the Fermi mission was launched carrying the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's Large Area Telescope. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{positioned}} well {{back on the}} body, closer to the pelvic than the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are large, about half to three-quarters {{as high as the}} first dorsal fin. The broad, triangular pectoral fins originate at or slightly before the level of the fifth gill slit. There is no ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is half the length of the upper, which has a strong notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, usually with 7 horizontal ridges, giving the skin a smooth feel. The coloration is grayish to brownish above and white below, with a pattern of scattered small, dark spots unique to each individual. The tips of the first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe, and sometimes also the second dorsal fin and lower caudal fin lobe, <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> white.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} rather similar to Dinoptera collaris, but G. virginea <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> blue with strong {{metallic}} reflections while D. collaris <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> black without metallic reflections. Moreover the first species shows an obtuse tooth {{on the sides}} of the prothorax, while in the second the sides of the prothorax are rounded.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E
