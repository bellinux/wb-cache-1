50|$|The {{common blue}} {{damselfly}} can be easily mistaken for the <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Coenagrion puella), but {{on the back and}} the thorax, the {{common blue damselfly}} has more blue than black; for the <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly</b> it is the other way around. The second segment of the thorax has a distinctive spot with a line below connecting to the third segment.|$|E
50|$|This {{wood was}} a {{traditional}} coppice, {{but many of}} the trees were cut down in the 1950s. Birds include blackcaps, fieldfares and green woodpeckers and there are invertebrates such as orange-tip butterflies and <b>azure</b> <b>damselflies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adult female <b>azure</b> <b>damselflies</b> have a {{head and}} thorax pattern {{similar to that}} of the male, but with glittering, glossy green {{replacing}} the blue coloring. The abdominal segments are largely black in coloring, with narrow pale markings at the junction between each segment.|$|R
50|$|Diphlebia coerulescens, {{known as}} the {{sapphire}} rockmaster is an Australian species of broad winged damselfly.It {{is one of a}} group {{known as the}} <b>azure</b> <b>damselflies.</b> It is found in Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales in eastern Australia, where it is found in fast-flowing streams and rivers.|$|R
50|$|Recorded {{are common}} blue, small copper and marbled white butterflies. Dragonflies include <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly</b> and {{southern}} aeshna.|$|E
50|$|Redshank and lapwing breed on the site. Several {{species of}} {{damselfly}} flourish along the draining ditches include the <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the reen grow water horsetail, reedmace, marsh {{marigold}} and <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly.</b> Osier, crack willow and sallow are typical {{species in the}} wet woodland of Magor Marsh.|$|E
50|$|Diphlebia euphoeoides, {{sometimes}} spelled Diphlebia euphaeoides, {{known as}} the tropical rockmaster is an Australian species of broad winged damselfly.It {{is one of a}} group {{known as the}} <b>azure</b> <b>damselflies.</b> It is found in Queensland (Australia) and Papua New Guinea. It typically occurs near lakes, waterfalls or streams at relatively low altitudes, and is occasionally seen near dry pools.|$|R
5000|$|Adult male <b>azure</b> <b>damselflies</b> have a {{head and}} thorax {{patterned}} with blue and black. They have an azure blue abdomen patterned with black markings. The marking {{on the second}} segment of the abdomen is U-shaped, separated from the segment's narrow terminal black band. (This distinguishes it from the variable damselfly where the U-shape is joined to the terminal band with a black line.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Diphlebiidae is {{no longer}} {{recognised}} as a biological family.It was the name given to a small family of <b>damselflies,</b> the <b>azure</b> <b>damselflies,</b> with species in two genera: Diphlebia and Philoganga. [...] Diphlebia is found in Australia and Philoganga is found in Southeast Asia. They are large and thick-bodied damselflies. They rest with their wings spread out. The Diphlebiidae were also known as Philogangidae.|$|R
50|$|An {{inventory}} of dragonflies in the north-eastern {{end of the}} lake documented a presence of red-eyed damselfly, northern damselfly, <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly,</b> brown hawker, club-tailed dragonfly, downy emerald, and four-spotted chaser.|$|E
50|$|The <b>azure</b> <b>{{damselfly}}</b> (Coenagrion puella) is {{a species}} of damselfly found in most of Europe. It is notable for its distinctive black and blue colouring.They are commonly found around ponds and lakesides during the summer.|$|E
50|$|This {{damselfly}} {{requires a}} close look for a beginner to distinguish them from an <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly.</b> Typically, they fly low through the reeds and often fly well out over the water, unlike azure damselflies. They are also a brighter blue.|$|E
50|$|Diphlebia is a genus of damselflies in {{the family}} Lestoideidae.They are {{commonly}} known as rockmasters. These damselflies are very large and thick. The species in this genus are found in Eastern Australia, except for one species that can be found in New Guinea. The males are vividly patterned. They are blue or bluish green and black in colour. Their blue colour also gives them the name <b>azure</b> <b>damselflies.</b> They rest with their wings spread out. Their wings are usually blackish brown or have white markings. These damselflies have several present antenodal crossveins. The two basal extend across coastal and subcoastal spaces. The larvae are wide and flat. They have long saccoid gills too breathe underwater. The inner tooth of labial palps is elongated. The specific characters of the larva are mid-ventral, distal width, basal width, and length of median lobe.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} similar to the <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly</b> (C. puella), the {{variable}} damselfly (C. pulchellum) and the common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) with which it coexists. However, both the female and male are darker and shorter-bodied in comparison with other blue damselflies.|$|E
5000|$|The male {{variable}} damselfly has {{a distinctive}} [...] "wine glass" [...] marking {{on the second}} segment of the abdomen. This is a black U-shaped mark with a black line joining the segment's narrow terminal black band. (This distinguishes it from the <b>Azure</b> <b>Damselfly</b> which has the U-shape but no line connecting it to the terminal band.)Male formsFemale forms ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly,</b> common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The Woorgreens {{reserve is}} {{considered}} to be the Forest of Dean's best dragonfly site, and over seventeen species have been recorded. Some of the species are scarce and breeding colonies in this area are important. They are supported by the network of other ponds and ditches in the area, such as Kensley pond. Breeding populations recorded include blue-tailed damselfly, large red damselfly, <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly,</b> southern hawker, ruddy sympetrum, broad-bodied chaser and the emperor dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|The shores are {{dominated}} by various species of Oligochaeta, Gastropoda, and Odonata. Superficial sediments {{are dominated}} by Oligochaeta and non-biting midges while deeper layers contain the freshwater crustacean Asellus aquaticus and larvae of mayflies and Odonatas. Gyraulus crista and Hippeutis complanatus are unusual freshwater snails present in the lake. The most common dragonfly is the emerald damselfly, but <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly,</b> variable damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, common blue damselfly, downy emerald, and red-eyed damselfly are also present. In Stockholm, Aeshna osiliensis is unique to Norra Djurgården, while the large white-faced darter is protected by the EU.|$|E
50|$|Bowen's Field is an {{informal}} recreation area, {{adjacent to the}} Great Stour. It is thought that this site {{was one of the}} last areas to be farmed in Ashford, it belonged to a local livestock trader called Mr Sidney Herbert Bowen,died 1971 and he is commemorated on a plaque at the entrance to the site from Victoria Park. This area was also adjacent to the town’s lido (outdoor swimming pool) which was built in 1867 and was at the time the largest in Britain. The site is now a flood storage area consisting of damp grassland, with a large pond where banded demoiselle, blue-tailed damselfly, <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly,</b> smooth newt, and common frog have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|The sparse fauna {{before the}} {{dredging}} of the lake, after 1995 {{evolved into a}} pretty considerable variety of species typical for shallow lakes rich in nutrients. Two species of freshwater snails, Bithynia leachii and Gyraulus crista, were earlier considered as endangered. Noteworthy is also the population of several freshwater mussels, duck mussel and swan mussel, and Hippeutis complanatus, the latter two declining. A species of Oligochaeta new in Sweden {{has been reported in}} the lake just like did the rare hairy dragonfly. An inventory of dragonfly larvae in 2000 unveiled several other species (mostly red-eyed damselfly but also common blue damselfly, <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly,</b> variable damselfly, and northern damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum). Fish population reflects the shortage of oxygen with an absence of carp bream and silver bream and an abundance of perch, roach, and crucian carp dating back to before the dredging. The outlet forms a threshold for migrating species.|$|E
50|$|Mammals:The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} mammals of the Ammiq wetlands {{have all been}} recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but {{have not yet been}} positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp {{in order to maintain the}} health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). The area was probably also the home of some extinct mammals from Lebanon such as the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus).Birds:Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk.The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).Amphibians and reptiles: The amphibians and reptiles listed below have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported. Species include: European green toad (Bufo viridis), Levantine frog (Rana bedriagae), Levant green lizard (Lacerta media), European worm snake (Typhlops vermicularis), Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina).Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies:As with many other groups, the moths of the Aammiq region are poorly known. The list below represents an incomplete and provisional list of species so far recorded, though the Aammiq region is rich in butterflies. A Rocha personnel recorded several new records of species since 1998 such as: Oriental marbled skipper (Carcharodus boeticus), swallowtail (Papilio machaon), scarce swallowtail (Iphiclides podalirius), false Apollo (Archon apollinus), large white (Pieris brassicae), plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), long-tailed blue (Lampides boeticus). Also the Aammiq region has a surprising diversity of dragonflies which can be divided into two groups, the Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (the insects commonly referred to as dragonflies), species include: <b>azure</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Coenagrion puella), blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans), emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator), southern darter (Sympetrum meridionale), scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea).|$|E
40|$|The flight {{activity}} was compared for the Blue-tailed Damselfly Ischnura elegans, the <b>Azure</b> <b>Damselfly</b> and the Emerald Damselfly Lestes sponsa Coenagrion puella at an exposed pond and a sheltered pond at Rimac, Saltfleetby National Nature reserve, Lincolnshire in July and August 1998. Meteorological conditions (air temperature, light intensity, cloud cover, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction) were investigated concurrently {{in relation to}} flight activity of the three species. Flight activity of all three increased with rising air temperature, light intensity and declining cloud cover. These factors {{appear to be the}} main ones that exert control on day to day variation in flight activity of these three species. Their relative importance varies from species to species, which is most likely to be {{due to the nature of}} the exoskeletons (which influences the rate of solar radiation absorption), size (which influences rate of warming and power requirements) and behaviour. Only Coenagrion puella showed any relationship between mating activity (tandem wheel flight) and meteorological conditions...|$|E
