5|$|In 1949, the {{southern}} terminus of US 213 was {{cut back to}} US 50 in Wye Mills, with the former route between Wye Mills <b>and</b> <b>Ocean</b> City becoming an extension of US 50 from Annapolis over the newly completed Chesapeake Bay Bridge.

On December 3, 1971, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved {{the elimination of the}} US 213 designation. US 213 along with MD 280 were replaced by MD 213, which ran from MD 662 in Wye Mills north to the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill. In 1994, the at-grade intersection with US 301 was replaced with an interchange.|$|E

5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds <b>and</b> <b>ocean</b> currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{importance}} to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru <b>and</b> <b>Ocean</b> islands had been allocated a low priority for the limited military assets which were available to protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940.
