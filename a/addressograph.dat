2500|$|The Charga-Plate, {{developed}} in 1928, {{was an early}} predecessor of the credit card and {{was used in the}} U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a 2½" [...] × 1¼" [...] rectangle of sheet metal related to <b>Addressograph</b> and military dog tag systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper [...] "charge slip" [...] positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an inked ribbon against the charge slip. Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co. Charga-Plates were issued by large-scale merchants to their regular customers, much like department store credit cards of today. In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.|$|E

50|$|In reality, {{the notch}} was {{used with the}} Model 70 <b>Addressograph</b> Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type {{imprinter}} used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II). American dogtags of the 1930s through 1970s were produced using a Graphotype machine, in which characters are debossed into metal plates. Some tags are still debossed, using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.|$|E

In 1921, it merged with the Voirin company of Montataire, founded by Henri Voirin (1827-1887), a press-builder for the firm of Rousselet-Normand. In 1963, the company was acquired by Harris Graphics, an American firm known for its development of high-speed press feeders. In 1986, Harris became a subsidiary of AM International (known for the <b>Addressograph),</b> and they are now both part of GOSS International, of Durham, New Hampshire.|$|E
50|$|The {{machines}} used {{in making}} <b>Addressograph</b> plates would deboss (pressed into the plate) the letters into the plate {{resulting in a}} well defined printing surface resembling the typewriter fonts of the day on the reverse side {{that would be used}} to transfer the details (usually customer addresses) onto envelopes or form letters. The same style was used in the early 40's to 80's for the US military identification tags and the tag details could be transferred onto medical charts using a hand held imprinter in field hospital conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1896, {{the first}} U.S. patent for an {{addressing}} machine, the <b>Addressograph</b> was issued to Joseph Smith Duncan of Sioux City, Iowa. It was a {{development of the}} invention he had made in 1892. His earlier model consisted of a hexagonal wood block onto which he glued rubber type which had been torn from rubber stamps. While revolving, the block simultaneously inked the next name and address {{ready for the next}} impression. The [...] "Baby O" [...] model was put into production on the July 26, 1893, in a small back room of the old Caxton Building in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|An <b>Addressograph</b> {{system of}} the 1960s was {{essentially}} a Graphotype debossing machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving inked ribbon, a platten for hand-feeding the mail piece, and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which {{had a series of}} slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot pedal the plate assemblies were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece.|$|E
50|$|After many {{meetings}} and discussions between the Shires and the Library Board, the inaugural {{meeting of the}} Wimmera Regional Library Service was held in June 1966 and the WRLS formed. From October 1966 it included the Shires of Arapiles, Birchip, Donald, Dunmunkle, Kaniva, Karkarooc, Lowan, Wimmera & Warracknabeal and Horsham City Council.

Branches were at Horsham, Kaniva, Minyip, Murtoa, Nhill & Rupanyup. The Bookmobile opened in June 1967 operating in Birchip, Donald & Karkarooc Shires, and sites were at Birchip town & schools, Watchupga, Donald town & schools, Watchem, Hopetoun town & schools, Beulah town & schools, Lascelles, Patchewollock, Speed, Tempy & Woomelang. At this time the <b>Addressograph</b> Libromatic Scheme replaced the Browne System, this involved new book & borrower cards and complete borrower re-registration.|$|E
