5|$|After World War II, Skopje greatly {{benefited from}} Socialist Yugoslav {{policies}} which encouraged {{industry and the}} development of Macedonian cultural institutions. Consequently, Skopje became home to a national library, a national philharmonic orchestra, a university and the Macedonian Academy. However, its post-war development was <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> the 1963 earthquake which occurred 26 July. Although relatively weak in magnitude, it caused enormous damage in the city and can be compared to the 1960 Agadir earthquake. The disaster killed 1,070 people, injuring 3,300 others. 16,000 people were buried alive in ruins and 70% of the population lost their home. Many educational facilities, factories and historical buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E

Although slightly <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> manufacturer Lotto (the 1998 jersey was a white jersey with the chequers on the right side, like a flying flag) and Nike since its original release, the chequered motif was adopted {{as a symbol of}} national identity and similar designs are used by all Croatian national sports teams.|$|E
5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E

It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|From the outset, the cyclone's {{motion was}} <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep {{convection}} fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, moving very slowly towards the coast.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. She thought that it might be the site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in Webster County, Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> cultivation, they found little evidence of habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> a variety of modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Irwell's lower reaches were {{a trading}} route that {{became part of}} the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. In the 19th century, the river's course {{downstream}} of Manchester was permanently <b>altered</b> <b>by</b> the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal which opened in 1896. The canal turned Manchester and Salford into a major inland seaport and {{led to the development of}} Trafford Park which became the largest industrial estate in Europe. Further changes were made in the 20th and 21st centuries to prevent flooding in Manchester and Salford, such as the Anaconda Cut in 1970 and the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of cocaine}} during {{pregnancy}} can negatively affect both {{the mother and}} the fetus, but the ways in which it affects the fetus are poorly understood. There are three main mechanisms by which cocaine exposure harms a fetus: <b>by</b> <b>altering</b> brain chemistry, <b>by</b> <b>altering</b> the expression of certain genes, and by the constriction of blood vessels. The neurotransmitters affected by cocaine are involved {{in the development of the}} fetus's brain, so the drug may affect fetal development directly <b>by</b> <b>altering</b> the development of the brain's monoaminergic system. The most important way cocaine affects fetal development is by binding to dopamine receptors.|$|R
