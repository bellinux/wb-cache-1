40|$|The Zhang-Markusen (ZM) theory hypothesizes {{an inverse}} U-shaped {{relationship}} between human capital and {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI). Therefore, low wage countries with low human capital cannot attract FDI. To test this hypothesis, we regress FDI on educational levels across countries while grouping them in different income cohorts. Our findings partly support ZM. Rich countries with high human capital and poor countries with low human capital demonstrate an inverse correlation between FDI and human capital proxies. However, for <b>middle-income</b> <b>and</b> upper <b>middle-income</b> countries, human capital (especially tertiary education) has a positive relationship with FDI...|$|R

25|$|The {{historic}} {{character of}} {{the city has been}} challenged in recent decades by skyrocketing property values and the proliferation of second homes, increasingly shutting low- <b>and</b> <b>middle-income</b> workers out of the city and creating a large pool of commuters from nearby bedroom communities such as Snowmass, Basalt, Carbondale, and Glenwood Springs. At the same time, in stark contrast to its historic character, the city has emerged into international fame as a glitzy playground of the wealthy and famous. Aspen has become a second and third home to many international jet setters.|$|E
25|$|The top funder for kinetoplastid {{infection}} {{research and}} development are public sources. About 62% of the funding comes from high-income countries while 9% comes from low- <b>and</b> <b>middle-income</b> countries. High-income countries public funding is largest contributors to the neglected disease research effort. However, in recent years, funding from high-income countries has been steadily decreasing; in 2007, high-income countries provided 67.5% of the total funding whereas, in 2012, high-income countries public funds only provided 60% of the total funding for kinetoplastid infections. This downwards trend leaves a gap for other funders, such as philanthropic foundations and private pharmaceutical companies to fill.|$|E

The Bronx, particularly the South Bronx, saw a sharp decline in population, livable housing, and {{the quality of life in}} the late 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in a wave of arson. Since then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the late 1980s before picking up pace from the 1990s until today.|$|E
25|$|Health {{security}} – Health Security aims {{to guarantee}} a minimum protection from diseases and unhealthy lifestyles. In developing countries, the major causes of death traditionally were infectious and parasitic diseases, whereas in industrialized countries, the major killers were diseases of the circulatory system. Today, lifestyle-related chronic diseases are leading killers worldwide, with 80 percent of deaths from chronic diseases occurring in low- <b>and</b> <b>middle-income</b> countries. According to the United Nations, in both developing and industrial countries, threats to health security are usually greater for poor people in rural areas, particularly children. This is due to malnutrition and insufficient access to health services, clean water and other basic necessities.|$|E

25|$|Citizens of low- <b>and</b> <b>middle-income</b> {{countries}} (LMICs) {{often have}} higher mortality rates from injury. These countries accounted for 89% of all deaths from injury worldwide. Many {{of these countries}} {{do not have access}} to sufficient surgical care and many do not have a trauma system in place. In addition, most LMICs do not have a pre-hospital care system that treats injured persons initially and transports them to hospital quickly, resulting in most casualty paients being transported by private vehicles. Also, their hospitals lack the appropriate equipment, organizational resources, or trained staff. By 2020, the amount of trauma-related deaths is expected to decline in high-income countries, while in low- to middle-income countries it is expected to increase.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{there were}} about 1.7 million cases of {{drowning}}. Unintentional drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury resulting in death worldwide. In 2013, it was estimated to have resulted in 368,000 deaths, down from 545,000 deaths in 1990. Of these deaths, 82,000 occurred in children {{less than five years}} old. It accounts for 7% of all injury related deaths (excluding those due to natural disasters), with 91% of these deaths occurring in low-income <b>and</b> <b>middle-income</b> countries. Drowning occurs more frequently in males and the young. The rate of drowning in populations around the world varies widely according to their access to water, the climate and the national swimming culture.|$|E
25|$|Inequalities {{in health}} are also {{determined}} by these socioeconomic and cultural factors. Health care is inequitably distributed globally, with pronounced inequality {{for the poor}} in low- <b>and</b> <b>middle-income</b> countries. One study demonstrated that doctors treat poor populations differently, showing that disadvantaged patients {{are less likely to}} receive the recommended diabetic treatments {{and are more likely to}} undergo hospitalization due to the complications of diabetes (Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, 2003). According to the WHO, healthcare systems can most improve health equality when institutions are organized to provide universal coverage, where everyone receives the same quality healthcare regardless of ability to pay, as well as a Primary Healthcare system rather than emergency center assistance.|$|E

25|$|International {{organizations}} such as WHO and the World Bank, institutions in several developed countries such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) will continue {{to play an important}} role in strengthening both international and national surveillance and response systems for infectious diseases. Development of an integrated global surveillance and response system probably is at least a decade or more away. This owes to the magnitude of the challenge; inadequate coordination at the international level; and lack of funds, capacity, and, in some cases, cooperation and commitment at the national level. Some countries hide or understate their infectious disease problems for reasons of prestige and fear of economic losses. Total international health-related aid to low- <b>and</b> <b>middle-income</b> countries—some $2–3 billion annually—remains a fraction of the $250 billion health bill of these countries.|$|E
25|$|Jamaica was {{not always}} as diverse as it is today.

In the 1950s, however, what was later called white flight began <b>and</b> <b>middle-income</b> African Americans started taking their place. After the 1970s, as housing prices began to tumble, many Hispanic such as Salvadorans, Colombians, Dominicans, and West Indian immigrants moved in. These ethnic groups tended to stay more towards the Jamaica Avenue and South Jamaica areas. Immigration from other countries did not become widespread until the late 1990s and early 2000s. Gentrification and decrease in crime attracted many families to Jamaica's safe havens; Hillside Avenue reflects this trend. Along 150th to 161st streets, much of the stores and restaurants typify South American and Caribbean cultures.|$|E
40|$|Objectives andnbsp;Low-income <b>and</b> lower <b>middle-income</b> {{countries}} (LLMICs) bear {{a disproportionate}} burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). WHO has repeatedly {{called for more}} research on poverty and NCDs in these settings, but the current situation remains unquantified. We aimed to assess research output on poverty and NCD risk factors from these countries in relation to upper <b>middle-income</b> <b>and</b> high-income countries. Design andnbsp;Bibliometric analysis of primary research published between 1 January 1990 and 4 May 2017. We searched 13 databases, combining terms for poverty and NCD behavioural risk factors (tobacco, alcohol, diet and physical activity). Independent dual review was used to screen titles, abstracts and full papers. Two-tailed t-testing and multiple linear regression analyses were used to compare differences in means. Outcomes andnbsp;(1) Proportion of lead authors affiliated with institutions based in high <b>and</b> upper <b>middle-income</b> countries vs LLMICs. (2) Mean number of citations for publications from each region. (3) Mean journal impact factor for studies from each region. Results andnbsp;Ninety-one (67 %) of the 136 included studies were led by scientists affiliated with LLMIC-based institutions. These authors represented 17 / 83 LLMICs (20 %), and their studies garnered 4. 8 fewer citations per paper than studies led by high-income and upper middle-income-affiliated authors; however, this finding was non-significant (P= 0. 67). Papers led by authors based in high-income <b>and</b> upper <b>middle-income</b> countries were published in journals with a mean impact factor 3. 1 points higher than those from LLMICs (4. 9 vs 1. 7) adjusting for year of publication and number of citations (Pandlt; 0. 001). Conclusions andnbsp;Most poverty and NCD risk factor research is led by authors from {{a small number of}} LLMICs. These studies are being published in relatively low-impact journals, {{and the vast majority of}} LLMICs are not producing any research in this area that is vital to their social and economic development.
