5|$|Mazatec shamans have a {{long and}} {{continuous}} tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum, using it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions.

5|$|The {{transition}} to a more radical form of poetry {{seems to have taken}} place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{has stated}} that the film's camera angles and several shots <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> the video game's camera angles, such as the fight between Alice and the {{security}} guard. These include a scene near the beginning {{where there is a}} close up of Alice's eye. This is a direct reference to the title screen of the first game. In another scene, Alice awakes and hears a creepy sound, which is a reference to the plot of the first game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{have had}} a strong {{presence}} in many cultures, especially in areas where they form {{the most common type}} of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.|$|E
5|$|The Roundels Argent {{charged with}} a Cross Gules (white circles with a red cross) <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> the badge of office of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on his writing paper. When he was {{promoted}} to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on his writing paper with a collar of Esses. While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.|$|E
5|$|When Captain Scarlet was {{repeated}} by Central Television {{in the latter}} half of the decade, changes were made to the episode's opening sequence to remove dialogue in which the Mysterons <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> surveillance equipment that is being rotated to facilitate inspection of the Martian Exploration Vehicle. Since the imaging device resembles a missile battery (as the Zero X astronauts mistake it for), this re-edited version inadvertently gives an impression of stronger hostility on the part of the Mysterons.|$|E
5000|$|Barton {{explained}} that the motto <b>alluded</b> <b>to</b> the Eye of Providence: [...] "Deo favente which <b>alludes</b> <b>to</b> the Eye in the Arms, meant for the Eye of Providence."

5|$|According to the English {{officers}} of arms John Martin Robinson and Thomas Woodcock, crests {{have played a}} relatively insignificant role in Scottish heraldry when compared to English heraldry. In consequence many Scottish armigers, including clan chiefs, have comparatively similar crests to one another. Because of this, crest badges can sometimes show an obvious association with another clan. For example, clans associated with the Chattan Confederation share very similar crest badges bearing wild cats. Clans associated with Clan MacTavish Clan Campbell of Breadalbane, Clan MacIver and Clan Campbell use a crest badges which contain similar crests and mottoes that <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> that of the chief of Clan MacTavish.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E

5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.|$|E
5|$|The helmet {{appears to}} have been {{deliberately}} folded up and deposited in an artificial stone structure. It is thought to have been used for ceremonial occasions rather than for combat, and may already have been an antique {{by the time it was}} buried. It is of the same type as the Newstead Helmet (found in 1905) and its design also has similarities with the Ribchester Helmet (found in 1796) and the Hallaton Helmet (found in 2000), though its facial features are more akin to those of helmets found in southern Europe. Its design may <b>allude</b> <b>to</b> the Trojans, whose exploits the Romans re-enacted in cavalry tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Thiruvilaiyadal {{has been}} parodied and {{referenced}} in various media such as cinema, television and theatre.

In {{his review of}} Oru Kanniyum Moonu Kalavaanikalum (2014), Baradwaj Rangan likened the way Shiva plays his divine games by intervening in human affairs in Thiruvilaiyadal {{to the use of}} touchscreen human face icons on mobile apps.|$|E
