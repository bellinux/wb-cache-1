5|$|Monsanto {{argued that}} the Federal Circuit's {{decision}} was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent. They further argued {{that this was not}} an appropriate case to hear, as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale. The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position. The United States <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>to</b> deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Madrid mailed {{her poem}} to six {{publishers}} in October 1999, notably Chronicle Books, before {{turning it into}} a local stage musical in August 2001. After seeing the trailer for Monsters, Inc., Madrid concluded that Chronicle Books had passed her work to Pixar and that the film was based on her work. In October 2001, she filed the suit against Chronicle Books, Pixar, and Disney in a federal court in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her lawyer <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> issue a preliminary injunction, that would forbid Pixar and Disney from releasing the film while the suit was pending.|$|E

Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials of American Indian Movement (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents. The motion (argued March 2)—which also <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged COINTELPRO involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.|$|E
5|$|South Ledge {{falls within}} the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>to</b> decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated to delimit {{the extent of the}} territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hearing before}} the High Criminal Court of Appeal, due to take place on 8 May, was {{postponed}} to 22 May. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, on the ninetieth day of his hunger strike, was brought to court in a wheelchair. All the defendants pleaded not guilty. Al-Khawaja and Abdulwahab Hussain told of being subjected to torture during the initial weeks of their detention, the former stating {{that he had been}} sexually assaulted and the latter that he had been forced to sign a written statement. On 19 June, defence lawyers <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> disregard confessions that the BICI report had suggested were obtained by torture but the public prosecutor insisted on their inclusion in the evidence. According to Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, these confessions were the sole evidence submitted to the court.|$|E

5|$|Weeks later, Jernigan filed a counter-suit against Wilkinson in Fayette County circuit court. He <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> award him $50 {{million in}} punitive damages and to {{determine}} the profits made by his and Wilkinson's veneer company, of which he would receive half. A judge ordered the case moved to Louisville because the alleged crime was committed in Glasgow, in the state's western district. State charges against Jernigan, which included kidnapping and carrying a concealed deadly weapon, were dropped so that the federal extortion charges could take precedence. Over the objection of his legal counsel, the court ordered Jernigan to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was insane or mentally incompetent for his own defense. The court-appointed psychiatrist found Jernigan competent to stand trial, and he was released in late May on a $25,000 bond.|$|E
5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E
25|$|On July 12, 2012, the Competitive Enterprise Institute {{joined the}} State National Bank of Big Spring, Texas, and the 60 Plus Association as plaintiffs {{in a lawsuit}} filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, {{challenging}} the constitutionality of provisions of Dodd–Frank. The complaint <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> invalidate the law, arguing that it gives the federal government unprecedented, unchecked power. The lawsuit was amended on September 20, 2012, to include the states of Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Michigan as plaintiffs. The states <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> review {{the constitutionality of the}} Orderly Liquidation Authority established under Title II of Dodd–Frank.|$|E

50|$|A motion <b>to</b> compel <b>asks</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> order either <b>the</b> {{opposing}} party or {{a third party}} to take some action.

25|$|Although the Court {{expressly}} {{acknowledged the}} logical infirmity in Dewsnups reasoning, it declined to overrule Dewsnup; noting that Caulkett had not <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>to</b> do so.

25|$|The {{case was}} {{assigned}} to U.S. District Judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb, who scheduled a hearing for March 27. The two county clerks named as defendants supported the plaintiffs' position. District attorneys in Milwaukee and Eau Claire counties agreed not to prosecute the plaintiffs under the marriage evasion law. Prompted by Judge Crabb, who noted that several rulings against state bans of same-sex marriage in other jurisdictions had been stayed, on March 12 the plaintiffs withdrew their request for injunctions against the state's enforcement of both its ban on same-sex marriage and the marriage evasion law, and <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> set an expedited schedule.|$|E
25|$|In September, Proposition 8 proponents filed {{a motion}} for summary judgment.

After a two-hour hearing on October 13, Walker denied the motion. He noted that the Supreme Court doctrine on sexual orientation and gender discrimination had changed since 1972. Resolving the amendment's validity, Walker noted, required hearing testimony at trial.|$|E
