5|$|During the Cold War, {{camouflage}} {{was partially}} abandoned; for example, glossy <b>anti-flash</b> white was used on aircraft as protection from nuclear flash, including high-flying Royal Air Force nuclear weapon-carrying V-bombers. When SAMs made high level attack too dangerous, {{the plans for}} RAF bombers changed to low level attack and camouflaged top surfaces returned.|$|E
5|$|While {{assigned}} to the nuclear delivery role, the Victor was finished in an all-over <b>anti-flash</b> white colour scheme, {{designed to protect the}} aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation. The white colour scheme was intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft; paler variations of RAF's roundels were also applied for this same reason. When the V-bombers were {{assigned to}} the low-level approach profile in the 1960s, the Victors were soon repainted in green/grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The <b>anti-flash</b> precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
25|$|In February 1917, Vengeance {{returned}} to the United Kingdom and paid off. She was laid up until February 1918, when she recommissioned for use in experiments with <b>anti-flash</b> equipment for the fleet's guns. She completed these in April 1918, and then was partially disarmed, with four 6-inch (152-mm) main-deck casemate guns removed and four 6-inch (152-mm) guns being installed in open shields on the battery deck. She became an ammunition store ship in May 1918.|$|E
25|$|When thermal {{radiation}} strikes an object, part will be reflected, part transmitted, {{and the rest}} absorbed. The fraction that is absorbed depends on the nature and color of the material. A thin material may transmit a lot. A light colored object may reflect much of the incident radiation and thus escape damage, like <b>anti-flash</b> white paint. The absorbed {{thermal radiation}} raises {{the temperature of the}} surface and results in scorching, charring, and burning of wood, paper, fabrics, etc. If the material is a poor thermal conductor, the heat is confined {{to the surface of the}} material.|$|E
500|$|The two {{prototype}} Vulcans {{were finished}} in gloss white. Early Vulcan B.1s left the factory {{in a natural}} metal finish; the front half of the nose radome was painted black, the rear half painted silver. Front-line Vulcan B.1s had a finish of <b>anti-flash</b> white and RAF [...] "type D" [...] roundels. Front-line Vulcan B.1As and B.2s were similar but with 'type D pale' roundels.|$|E
500|$|The {{waterline}} belt of the Queen Elizabeth class {{consisted of}} Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was [...] thick over the ships' vitals. The gun turrets were protected by [...] of KC armour and {{were supported by}} barbettes [...] thick. The ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from [...] in thickness. The main conning tower was protected by 13 inches of armour. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel {{was added to the}} main deck over the magazines and additional <b>anti-flash</b> equipment was added in the magazines.|$|E
500|$|... {{was laid}} down on 31 May 1916, {{the same day}} as the Battle of Jutland. The loss of three British battlecruisers during that battle caused the work on all three ships to be {{suspended}} pending an investigation into possible design flaws. Admiral Jellicoe's investigation blamed the loss of the ships on faulty cordite handling procedures that allowed fires in the turrets or hoists to reach the ships' magazines. It recommended <b>anti-flash</b> equipment be installed in magazines and handling rooms and the improvement of deck armour over the magazines to prevent plunging shells or fragments from reaching the magazines. The DNC and the Third Sea Lord opposed the latter, believing that there was no direct evidence that the magazines had been directly penetrated.|$|E
500|$|The first 15 B.1s were {{powered by}} the Olympus 101 with [...] thrust. Many of these early {{examples}} in a metallic finish remained {{the property of the}} Ministry of Supply being retained for trials and development purposes. Those entering RAF service were delivered to No 230 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), the first in July 1956. Later aircraft, painted in <b>anti-flash</b> white and {{powered by the}} Olympus 102 with [...] thrust, began to enter squadron service in July 1957. The Olympus 102s were quickly modified to the Olympus 104 standard, ultimately rated at [...] thrust. As far back as 1952, Bristol Aero Engines had begun development of the BOl.6 (Olympus 6) rated at [...] thrust but if fitted to the B.1, this would have re-introduced the buffet requiring further redesign of the wing.|$|E
500|$|The gun turrets were {{protected}} by [...] of KC armour, {{except for the}} turret roofs which were [...] thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from [...] above the upper deck, but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The Revenge-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from [...] in thickness. The main conning tower had 13 inches of armour on the sides with a [...] roof. The torpedo control tower in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel {{was added to the}} main deck over the magazines and additional <b>anti-flash</b> equipment was added in the magazines. In 1918 the gun shields for the upper deck 6-inch guns were replaced by armoured casemates.|$|E
500|$|The ship's {{waterline}} belt {{consisted of}} Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was [...] thick between 'A' and 'Y' barbettes and thinned to 4 to 6 inches (102 to 152mm) towards the ship's ends, {{but did not}} reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a strake of armour 6inches thick that extended between 'A' and 'X' barbettes. Transverse bulkheads 4 to 6 inches thick ran at an angle from {{the ends of the}} thickest part of the waterline belt to 'A' and 'Y' barbettes. The gun turrets were protected by [...] of KC armour, except for the turret roofs which were [...] thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from [...] above the upper deck, but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The Revenge-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from [...] in thickness. The main conning tower had 13 inches of armour on the sides with a 3-inch roof. The torpedo director in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional <b>anti-flash</b> equipment was added in the magazines.|$|E
2500|$|The Buccaneer entered {{service with}} the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) on 17 July 1962, when 801 NAS was {{commissioned}} at RNAS Lossiemouth in Scotland. [...] The Buccaneer quickly replaced the FAA's Supermarine Scimitar, which {{had previously been}} performing the naval attack flight duties. [...] In addition to conventional ordnance, the Buccaneer was type-approved for nuclear weapons delivery in 1965; weapons deployed included Red Beard and WE.177 drop-bombs, which were carried internally in a rotating bomb-bay. [...] Two Fleet Air Arm operational squadrons, and a training unit were equipped with the Buccaneer S.1. [...] The aircraft was well liked by Navy aircrew for its strength and flying qualities, and the BLC system gave them slower landing speeds than they were accustomed to. [...] The Buccaneers were painted dark sea grey on top, and <b>anti-flash</b> white on the undersides.|$|E
2500|$|The main gun turrets were {{relatively}} lightly protected {{in comparison to}} contemporary battleships. Maximum turret and barbette armour was reduced to 12.75inches in this class from the 16inches of the Nelson class. The turret faces had 12.75 in (324mm) of armour at the front; [...] sides (at the gun chamber); 6.86inches (284–174mm) on the sides and rear; the roof plate was 5.88 in (149mm) thick. The main armament barbettes were of varying thickness: 12.75in (324mm) thick on the sides, 11.76in (298mm) forward and 10.82in (275mm) aft of the turret. To some extent the higher quality of the armour minimized the loss of protection and the turret's flat face improved ballistic resistance at long ranges, while the low profile of the turret minimized target area at closer ranges. The reduction in turret and barbette armour was a compromise in favour of the thickest possible protection for the magazines. The extensive <b>anti-flash</b> protection in the turrets and barbettes was designed {{to ensure that the}} magazines would remain safe even if the turrets and/or barbettes were penetrated. The secondary gun mounts, casements and handling rooms received only light plating of 0.98in (25mm) to protect against splinters.|$|E
