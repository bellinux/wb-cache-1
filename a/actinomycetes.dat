25|$|Multicellularity {{has evolved}} {{independently}} at least 25 times, including in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, <b>actinomycetes,</b> Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and plants. It evolved repeatedly for plants (Chloroplastida), {{once or twice}} for animals, once for brown algae, and perhaps several times for fungi, slime molds, and red algae. Multicellularity may have evolved from colonies of interdependent organisms, from cellularization, or from organisms in symbiotic relationships.|$|E
25|$|Geosmin is a {{compound}} {{with a very}} distinct earthy, musty, beetroot, even turnip flavour and aroma and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous <b>actinomycetes</b> such as Streptomyces, and moulds such as Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum, on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to terroir. The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and {{has been found in}} recent vintages of red wines from Beaujolais, Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Loire in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in cork taint.|$|E
25|$|Penicillin {{had been}} {{discovered}} in 1928, and {{in the years that}} followed, antibiotics were increasingly used to fight bacterial illness. However, one side effect was that these antibiotics allowed for a rapid growth of fungus, which could lead to sore mouths or upset stomachs. Other fungal diseases without cures including infections attacking the central nervous system, athlete’s foot, and ring worms were also a major problem during this time. However, fungal diseases were not well understood at this time, and there were no antifungal medications safe for human use. At this time, people knew of microorganisms called <b>actinomycetes</b> that lived in soil and were known to produce antibiotics, some of which killed fungus. However, these antibiotics also proved fatal in tests involving lab mice and thus could not be put into production.|$|E

500|$|Glutathione is a {{cysteine-containing peptide}} {{found in most}} forms of aerobic life. It is not {{required}} in the diet and is instead synthesized in cells from its constituent amino acids. Glutathione has antioxidant properties since the thiol group in its cysteine [...] is a reducing agent and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. In cells, glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by the enzyme glutathione reductase and in turn reduces other metabolites and enzyme systems, such as ascorbate in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, glutathione peroxidases and glutaredoxins, as well as reacting directly with oxidants. Due to its high concentration and its central role in maintaining the cell's redox state, glutathione {{is one of the}} most important cellular antioxidants. In some organisms glutathione is replaced by other thiols, such as by mycothiol in the <b>Actinomycetes,</b> bacillithiol in some Gram-positive bacteria, or by trypanothione in the Kinetoplastids.|$|E
2500|$|Microbial cytochromes P450 {{are often}} soluble enzymes and are {{involved}} in diverse metabolic processes. In bacteria the distribution of P450s is very variable with many bacteria having no identified P450s (e.g. E.coli). Some bacteria, predominantly <b>actinomycetes,</b> have numerous P450s (e.g.,). Those so far identified are generally involved in either biotransformation of xenobiotic compounds (e.g. CYP105A1 from Streptomyces griseolus metabolizes sulfonylurea herbicides to less toxic derivatives,) or are part of specialised metabolite biosynthetic pathways (e.g. CYP170B1 catalyses production of the sesquiterpenoid albaflavenone in Streptomyces albus,). Although no P450 has yet {{been shown to be}} essential in a microbe, the CYP105 family is highly conserved with a representative in every streptomycete genome sequenced so far (...) [...] [...] Due to the solubility of bacterial P450 enzymes, they are generally regarded as easier to work with than the predominantly membrane bound eukaryotic P450s. This, combined with the remarkable chemistry they catalyse, has led to many studies using the heterologously expressed proteins in vitro. Few studies have investigated what P450s do in vivo, what the natural substrate(s) are and how P450s contribute to survival of the bacteria in the natural environment.Three examples that have contributed significantly to structural and mechanistic studies are listed here, but many different families exist.|$|E

A hundred and fifty patients with some kinds of blood cells dyscrasia who underwent the bone marrow aspiration were recruited. In addition to the diagnostic work up, samples were examined {{for the presence of}} <b>actinomycete</b> infections. Twenty one samples were positive for <b>actinomycete</b> infections.
