5|$|In the South West Pacific, a {{conventional}} strategic bombing campaign {{was out of}} the question, as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes <b>and</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation (UPFC) was {{established}} in the year 1954 under the SFCs Act of 1951 mainly to develop small- and medium-scale industries in the state. UPFC provides financial assistance to new and existing units undergoing diversification, modernisation, expansion, or acquisition of fixed assets such as land, buildings, and machinery. The UPFC also provides working capital to existing units with a sound track record and to new units under a single window scheme. As of July 2012, due to financial constraints <b>and</b> <b>directions</b> from the state government, lending activities have been suspended except for State Government Schemes.

5|$|After {{the threat}} from {{invasion}} muted in 1941, the Command's attention turned to the Battle of the Atlantic. During this time, the Command used the Martin Maryland, which excelled in PR work. On 13 July 1941, the first PR Mosquito arrived, though it was some time before the aircraft was operational. By September 1941, the operational strength of the PRU's first flight was 37 Spitfires, two Marylands and two Mosquitoes. The long-range Spitfires and Mosquitoes could reach deep into German airspace, and photograph the Baltic Sea ports and monitor German surface ships. Flights of eight hours were not uncommon. One Spitfire reached Gdynia, searching for the German battleship Tirpitz. Tactics needed to vary to avoid Spitfires being intercepted by German patrols at heights of 30,000ft. Constant trips alerted the Germans to the British operations, but the Admiralty insisted in the volume of flights so they could keep tabs on German capital ships. With surprise lost, the only solution was to change the height <b>and</b> <b>directions</b> of approach.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to study natural {{ventilation}} in a dairy house {{by means of a}} parametric analysis relating wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> to the air flows through the ridge vent of the building. This analysis was carried out by means of an artificial neural network (ANN) which capability in modelling and simulating some climatic parameters inside a dairy house has been validated using the data collected in a trial carried out during summer 2005. The results show that modelling a Generalized feed-forward Multi-Layer Perceptron ANN allowed to obtain satisfactory results in the simulation of air speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> air temperature and humidity inside a dairy house, using as input the values of wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> outdoor air temperature and humidity. The adequate accuracy in the simulation of the air motion across the ridge vent allowed to perform a parametric analysis of the ventilation, which provided the values of air speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> in function of a fixed range of values of wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction...</b>|$|R

40|$|Results from {{a recent}} field {{campaign}} are {{used to assess the}} accuracy of wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precision estimates produced by a Doppler lidar wind retrieval algorithm. The algorithm, which is based on the traditional velocity-azimuth-display (VAD) technique, estimates the wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> measurement precision using standard error propagation techniques, assuming the input data (i. e., radial velocities) to be contaminated by random, zero-mean, errors. For this study, the lidar was configured to execute an 8 -beam plan-position-indicator (PPI) scan once every 12  min during the 6 -week deployment period. Several wind retrieval trials were conducted using different schemes for estimating the precision in the radial velocity measurements. The resulting wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precision estimates were compared to differences in wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> between the VAD algorithm and sonic anemometer measurements taken on a nearby 300  m tower. All trials produced qualitatively similar wind fields with negligible bias but substantially different wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precision fields. The most accurate wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precisions were obtained when the radial velocity precision was determined by direct calculation of radial velocity standard deviation along each pointing <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> range gate of the PPI scan. By contrast, when the instrumental measurement precision is assumed to be the only contribution to the radial velocity precision, the retrievals resulted in wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precisions that were biased far too low and were poor indicators of data quality...|$|R
5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes <b>and</b> <b>directions.</b> This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E
5|$|The plan went awry {{when the}} 2nd Platoon got lost and missed a {{rendezvous}} with the 1st and 3rd Platoon, which {{were waiting for}} them near Mravince. The 2nd Platoon was therefore disbanded {{while the rest of}} the detachment continued via Mosor to Dicmo where they were to meet up with their guides. They arrived on the night of 12 August, and upon realizing their guides were not there, decided to continue alone towards Kamešnica, but got lost and ran out of supplies during the night. At dawn on 13 August the detachment camped near the village of Krušvar.
