5|$|According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder {{reflects}} {{a long tradition}} in Mesopotamia where, from {{as early as the}} third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms. Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E

5|$|Rural {{and urban}} cantons {{had the same}} {{standing}} in the federation. Each canton was sovereign within its territory, pursuing its own foreign policy and also minting its own money. The diet and central council of the federation, the Tagsatzung, held no real power and served more <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> coordination. The reformation in the early 16th century had led to a confessional division amongst the cantons: the central Swiss cantons including Lucerne had remained Catholic, while Zürich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and also the city of St. Gallen had become Protestant. The Tagsatzung was often paralysed by disagreements between the equally strong factions of the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E
5|$|As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Japan, MacArthur and {{his staff}} helped Japan rebuild itself, {{eradicate}} militarism and ultra-nationalism, promote political civil liberties, institute democratic government, and chart a new course that ultimately made Japan one of the world's leading industrial powers. The U.S. was firmly in control of Japan to oversee its reconstruction, and MacArthur was effectively the interim leader of Japan from 1945 until 1948. In 1946, MacArthur's staff drafted a new constitution that renounced war and stripped the Emperor of his military authority. The constitution—which became effective on 3 May 1947—instituted a parliamentary system of government, under which the Emperor acted only {{on the advice of}} his ministers. It included the famous Article 9, which outlawed belligerency <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, outlawed racial discrimination, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.|$|E
5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological work should not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed {{to take into account}} the existence of class struggle <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> social change, something which was a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and that most of his contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of health, the {{increasing}} gap between technical possibilities and financial resources has led us to search for new <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> control {{in the evolution of}} the hospital system. These new criteria, which have an economic basis, raise many problems and are far from being solved. In this paper, we will study the dual quality of cost indicator, i. e. its quality <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scientific <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> measure and its quality <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> capable <b>of</b> influencing the hospital actors' behaviour. The main variants of cost concept are then correlated with management problems in a study carried out inside a biochemical laboratory. ...|$|R

25|$|John Locke {{stated that}} {{whenever}} labour {{is mixed with}} natural resources, such {{as is the case}} with improved land, private property is justified under the proviso that there must be enough other natural resources of the same quality available to others. Geoists state that the Lockean proviso is violated wherever land value is greater than zero. Therefore, under the assumed principle of equal rights of all people to natural resources, the occupier of any such land must compensate the rest of society to the amount of that value. For this reason, geoists generally believe that such payment cannot be regarded as a true 'tax', but rather a compensation or fee. This means that while Geoists also regard taxation <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> social justice, contrary to social democrats and social liberals they do not regard it <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> redistribution but rather a 'predistribution' or simply a correct distribution of the commons.|$|E
