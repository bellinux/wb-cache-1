500|$|By 4:00 in {{the morning}} the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or {{gathered}} nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be [...] "electricity in the air". One commented: [...] "There was a certain beauty {{in the aftermath of the}} riot... It was obvious, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street." [...] Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.|$|E

But I am encouraged by the unwavering support I have received from ordinary Americans, civic groups and particularly from scholars, academic organizations, and the ACLU. I am heartened by the emerging debate in the U.S. about what has been happening to our countries and ideals {{in the past six}} years. And I am hopeful that eventually I will be allowed to enter the country so that I may contribute to the debate and be enriched by dialogue." ...|$|E

6000|$|Travel is of two kinds; {{and this}} voyage of mine {{across the ocean}} {{combined}} both. [...] "Out of my country and myself I go," [...] sings the old poet: and I was not only travelling out of my country in latitude and longitude, but out of myself in diet, associates, and consideration. Part of the interest {{and a great deal}} of the amusement flowed, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> from this novel situation in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} {{considering}} the way you've flirted with me," [...] she declared, [...] "you ought <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> have given <b>me</b> {{the opportunity of}} refusing you." ...|$|R

"There's {{no reason}} I should make myself {{look like a}} fright because I don't care for him," [...] she says; [...] "besides, after all that he has said, he ought to say more,--he ought <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> a chance <b>to</b> say no,--he shall, too," [...] said the gypsy, winking at the bright, elfish face in the glass.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} no doubt, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but that with his fall from Heaven, as he lost the Rectitude and Glory of his Angelic Nature, I mean his Innocence, so he lost the Power too that he had before; and that when he first commenc'd Devil, he {{received}} the Chains of Restraint too, as the Badge of his Apostacy, viz. a general Prohibition, to do any thing to the Prejudice of this Creation, or to act any thing by Force or Violence without special Permission.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ems," [...] {{returned}} his Excellency, with great rapidity of utterance, [...] "Ems is a charming place, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I have, within these few years, quite recurred to {{the feelings of}} my boyhood; nothing to me is more disgustingly wearisome than the gay bustle of a city. My present diplomatic appointment at Frankfort ensures a constant life among the most charming scenes of nature. Naples, which was offered to me, I refused. Eight years ago, I should have thought an appointment at Naples a Paradise on earth." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "His income," [...] Jeanne said, [...] "scarcely matters, does it? If {{my money}} is ever to do {{anything}} for me, it should <b>at</b> <b>least</b> enable <b>me</b> <b>to</b> choose a husband for myself." ...|$|R
60|$|But my father, &c., is now poor, and I am rich, {{and it will}} be a disparagement, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a hinderance <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> {{show that}} respect to him as {{otherwise}} I might.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "it {{is going to}} be very hard. Still, I cannot turn against him; he has, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> been kind <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I have never had a wish he has not gratified." ...|$|R
6000|$|We [...] "hove" [...] our deep-sea-line by night, and the {{operation}} was very interesting, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> In the first place, the vessel's heading was stopt; then, coiled away in a tub, like a whale-rope, the line was placed toward the after part of the quarter-deck; {{and one of the}} sailors carried the lead outside of the ship, away along {{to the end of the}} jib-boom, and at the word of command, far ahead and overboard it went, with a plunge; scraping by the side, till it came to the stern, when the line ran out of the tub like light.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can you ask? The {{shipwreck}} was a gleam, {{the first}} ray {{that came to}} cheer me in those penance hours, when I was cut off from all; and now, oh, Amy! I cannot enter into it. Such richness and fullness of blessing showered on me, more than I ever dared to wish for or dream of, both {{in the present and}} future hopes. It seems more than can belong to man, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> so unlike what I have deserved, that I can hardly believe it. It must be sent as a great trial.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twas in {{this answer}} that they showed, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> their design of embroiling the king with his English subjects; they discoursed very freely with me, {{and did not}} order me to {{withdraw}} when they debated their private opinions. They drew up several answers but did not like them; at last they gave me one which I did not receive, I thought it was too insolent to be borne with. As near as I can remember it was thus: The commissioners of Scotland attending the service in the army, do refuse any treaty {{in the city of}} York.|$|E
6000|$|... "Work!" [...] I {{said with}} an effort at the heroic, and turned about with a sigh, and I was glad that the way I had <b>to</b> go would <b>at</b> <b>least</b> take <b>me</b> <b>to</b> my mother. [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{it would}}. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> it would <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Scientific {{men have been}} against {{a whole lot of}} things in the past {{that turned out to be}} true. Natural selection, for instance, and X-rays and the {{wireless}} telephone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] he said, [...] "go to Brussels and {{get this}} information. If you will not try to conquer this absurd moral sensitiveness--which comes too late--you will <b>at</b> <b>least</b> enable <b>me</b> <b>to</b> place you in a {{healthier}} atmosphere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, your Majesty," [...] he said; [...] "I fear I {{was more}} than equally to blame with the Lord Provost of North Kensington. We were debating {{somewhat}} eagerly, and we both rose to our feet. I did so first, I am ashamed to say. The Provost of North Kensington is, therefore, comparatively innocent. I beseech your Majesty to address your rebuke chiefly, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Mr. Buck is not innocent, for he did no doubt, {{in the heat of}} the moment, speak disrespectfully. But the rest of the discussion he seems to me to have conducted with great good temper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... {313} Novalis, I think, {{says that}} one's own thought gains quite {{infinitely}} in value {{as soon as}} one finds it shared by even one other human being. The saying has proved true, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The morning after this paper was read, I received a book, [...] "The Genesis of Species, by St. George Mivart, F.R.S." [...] The name of the author demanded all attention and respect; and as I read on, I found him, to my exceeding pleasure, advocating views which I had long held, with a learning and ability to which I have no pretensions. The book will, doubtless, excite much useful criticism and discussion in the scientific world. I hope that it may do the same in the clerical world; and I earnestly beg those clergymen who heard me with so much patience and courtesy at Sion College, to ponder well Mr. Mivart's last chapter, on [...] "Theology and Evolution." ...|$|E
6000|$|Doge. [...] It {{was ever}} thus [...] With me; {{the hour of}} {{agitation}} came [...] In the first glimmerings of a purpose, when [...] Passion had too much room to sway; but in [...] The hour of action I have stood as calm [...] As were the dead who lay around me: this [...] They knew who made me what I am, and trusted [...] To the subduing power which I preserved [...] 100 [...] Over my mood, when its first burst was spent. [...] But they were not aware {{that there are things}} [...] Which make revenge a virtue by reflection, [...] And not an impulse of mere anger; though [...] The laws sleep, Justice wakes, and injured souls [...] Oft do a public right with private wrong, [...] And justify their deeds unto themselves.-- [...] Methinks the day breaks--is it not so? look, [...] Thine eyes are clear with youth;--the air puts on [...] A morning freshness, and, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] 110 [...] The sea looks greyer through the lattice.|$|E
6000|$|... "The prime {{minister}} might have called on <b>me,</b> or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> written <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a letter. I want {{none of their}} honours; I have scores of letters every day, suggesting that some high distinction should be conferred on me. I believe the nation expects <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be made a baronet. By the by, I heard the other day you had got into parliament. I know nothing of these matters; they do not interest me. Is it the fact?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then for {{the sake}} of the family, if you have no feeling for <b>me,</b> you ought <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> allow <b>me</b> {{overtime}} on that word extemporaneousness." [...] Again he coldly refused. I seldom say a harsh word to any one, but I was not master of myself then, and I spoke right out and called him an anisodactylous plesiosaurian conchyliaceous Ornithorhyncus, and rotten to the heart with holoaophotal subterranean extemporaneousness. God forgive me for that wanton crime; he lived only two hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will inquire further," [...] {{replied the}} swain. [...] "For myself I accept the position, that is until you learn <b>to</b> love <b>me,</b> if such should be my fortune. Meanwhile I beg of you <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> look upon <b>me</b> as a friend, a true friend who would lay down {{his life to}} serve you." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{lived in}} the same city, but for old men rather far apart, he at Tenth Street and I at Seventieth, and with our colds and other disabilities we did not see each other often. He {{expected}} me to come to him, and I would not without some return of my visits, but we never ceased to be friends, and good friends, so far as I know. I joked him once as to how I was going to come out in his autobiography, and he gave me some sort of joking reassurance. There was one incident, however, that brought us very frequently and actively together. He came one Sunday afternoon to have me call with him on Maxim Gorky, who was staying at a hotel a few streets above mine. We were both interested in Gorky, Clemens rather more as a revolutionist and I as a realist, though I too wished the Russian Tsar ill, and the novelist well in his mission to the Russian sympathizers in this republic. But I had lived through the episode of Kossuth's visit to us and his vain endeavor to raise funds for the Hungarian cause in 1851, when we were a younger and nobler nation than now, with hearts if not hands, opener to the [...] "oppressed of Europe"; the oppressed of America, the four or five millions of slaves, we did not count. I did not believe that Gorky could get the money for the cause of freedom in Russia which he had come to get; as I told a valued friend of his and mine, I did not believe he could get twenty-five hundred dollars, and I think now I set the figure too high. I had already refused to sign the sort of general appeal his friends were making to our principles and pockets because I felt it so wholly idle, and when the paper was produced in Gorky's presence and Clemens put his name to it I still refused. The next day Gorky was expelled from his hotel with the woman who was not his wife, but who, I am bound to say, did not look as if she were not, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> who am, however, not versed in those aspects of human nature.|$|E
6000|$|Let me hurry, however, {{to catch}} again that thread I left {{dangling}} from my glance at our small vague spasms of school--my personal sense {{of them being}} as vague and small, I mean, {{in contrast with the}} fuller and stronger cup meted out all round to the Albany cousins, much more privileged, I felt, in every stroke of fortune; or at least much more interesting, though it might be wicked to call them more happy, through those numberless bereavements that had so enriched their existence. I mentioned above in particular the enviable consciousness of our little red-headed kinsman Gus Barker, who, as by a sharp prevision, snatched what gaiety he might from a life to be cut short, in a cavalry dash, by one of the Confederate bullets of 1863: he blew out at us, on New York Sundays, as I have said, sharp puffs of the atmosphere of the Institution Charlier--strong to us, that is, the atmosphere of whose institutions was weak; but it was above all during a gregarious visit paid him in a livelier field still that I knew myself merely mother'd and brother'd. It had been his fate to be but scantly the latter and never at all the former--our aunt Janet had not survived his birth; but on this day of our collective pilgrimage to Sing-Sing, where he was at a [...] "military" [...] school and clad in a fashion that represented to me the very panoply of war, he shone with a rare radiance of privation. Ingenuous and responsive, of a social disposition, a candour of gaiety, that matched his physical activity--the most beautifully made athletic little person, and in the highest degree appealing and engaging--he not only did us the honours of his dazzling academy (dazzling <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me)</b> but had all the air of showing us over the great State prison which even then flourished near at hand and to which he accompanied us; a party of a composition that comes back to me as wonderful, the New York and Albany cousinships appearing to have converged and met, for the happy occasion, with the generations and sexes melting together and moving in a loose harmonious band. The party must have been less numerous than by the romantic tradition or confused notation of my youth, and what I mainly remember of it beyond my sense of our being at once an attendant train to my aged and gentle and in general most unadventurous grandmother, and a chorus of curiosity and amusement roundabout the vivid Gussy, is our collective impression that State prisons were on the whole delightful places, vast, bright and breezy, with a gay, free circulation in corridors and on stairs, a pleasant prevalence of hot soup and fresh crusty rolls, in tins, of which visitors admiringly partook, and for the latter, in chance corners and on sunny landings, much interesting light brush of gentlemen remarkable but for gentlemanly crimes--that is defalcations and malversations to striking and impressive amounts.|$|E
6000|$|The Kingdom of Fife (that royal province) may be {{observed}} by the curious on the map, occupying a tongue of land between the firths of Forth and Tay. It may be continually seen from {{many parts of}} Edinburgh (among the rest, from the windows of my father's house) dying away into the distance and the easterly HAAR with one smoky seaside town beyond another, or in winter printing on the gray heaven some glittering hill-tops. It has no beauty to recommend it, being a low, sea-salted, wind-vexed promontory; trees very rare, except (as common on the east coast) along the dens of rivers; the fields well cultivated, I understand, but not lovely to the eye. It is of the coast I speak: the interior may be the garden of Eden. History broods over {{that part of the world}} like the easterly HAAR. Even on the map, its long row of Gaelic place- names bear testimony to an old and settled race. Of these little towns, posted along the shore as close as sedges, each with its bit of harbour, its old weather-beaten church or public building, its flavour of decayed prosperity and decaying fish, not one but has its legend, quaint or tragic: Dunfermline, in whose royal towers the king may be still observed (in the ballad) drinking the blood- red wine; somnolent Inverkeithing, once the quarantine of Leith; Aberdour, hard by the monastic islet of Inchcolm, hard by Donibristle where the [...] "bonny face was spoiled"; Burntisland where, when Paul Jones was off the coast, the Reverend Mr. Shirra had a table carried between tidemarks, and publicly prayed against the rover at the pitch of his voice and his broad lowland dialect; Kinghorn, where Alexander [...] "brak's neckbane" [...] and left Scotland to the English wars; Kirkcaldy, where the witches once prevailed extremely and sank tall ships and honest mariners in the North Sea; Dysart, famous - well famous <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for the Dutch ships that lay in its harbour, painted like toys and with pots of flowers and cages of song-birds in the cabin windows, and for one particular Dutch skipper who would sit all day in slippers on the break of the poop, smoking a long German pipe; Wemyss (pronounce Weems) with its bat-haunted caves, where the Chevalier Johnstone, on his flight from Culloden, passed a night of superstitious terrors; Leven, a bald, quite modern place, sacred to summer visitors, whence there has gone but yesterday the tall figure and the white locks of the last Englishman in Delhi, my uncle Dr. Balfour, who was still walking his hospital rounds, while the troopers from Meerut clattered and cried [...] "Deen Deen" [...] along the streets of the imperial city, and Willoughby mustered his handful of heroes at the magazine, and the nameless brave one in the telegraph office was perhaps already fingering his last despatch; and just a little beyond Leven, Largo Law and the smoke of Largo town mounting about its feet, the town of Alexander Selkirk, better known under the name of Robinson Crusoe. So on, the list might be pursued (only for private reasons, which the reader will shortly have an opportunity to guess) by St. Monance, and Pittenweem, and the two Anstruthers, and Cellardyke, and Crail, where Primate Sharpe was once a humble and innocent country minister: on to the heel of the land, to Fife Ness, overlooked by a sea-wood of matted elders and the quaint old mansion of Balcomie, itself overlooking but the breach or the quiescence of the deep - the Carr Rock beacon rising close in front, and as night draws in, the star of the Inchcape reef springing up on the one hand, and the star of the May Island on the other, and farther off yet a third and a greater on the craggy foreland of St. Abb's. And but a little way round the corner of the land, imminent itself above the sea, stands the gem of the province and the light of mediaeval Scotland, St. Andrews, where the great Cardinal Beaton held garrison against the world, and the second of the name and title perished (as you may read in Knox's jeering narrative) under the knives of true-blue Protestants, and to this day (after so many centuries) the current voice of the professor is not hushed.|$|E
