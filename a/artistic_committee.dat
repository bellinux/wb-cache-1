5|$|The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex {{was well}} {{received}} by the Serbian public, and {{is said to have}} exceeded the expectations of all the government ministers. It was also well received in France, where Jovanović was named an Officer of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The painting was met with critical acclaim at the world's fair, and the fair's <b>artistic</b> <b>committee</b> awarded Jovanović a gold medal for his work. By way of this decision, the art historian Jelena Milojković-Djurić asserts, the Paris committee recognized that the painting was on par with those of the world's best visual artists.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} was {{finished}} {{in time for}} the world's fair, where it received widespread critical acclaim and was awarded a gold medal by the fair's <b>artistic</b> <b>committee.</b> In the opinion of one art historian, the artistic committee's decision affirmed that the painting was on par with the works of the world's greatest visual artists. A number of historians and critics consider The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex to be one of Jovanović's finest works, and Jovanović himself felt the painting was his [...] "most beautiful composition".|$|E
500|$|Milutin K. Dragutinović {{was one of}} Bojić's {{greatest}} influences {{during his}} teenage years. Dragutinović was one of Bojić's former secondary school teachers, {{as well as a}} literary critic and member of the National Theatre's <b>artistic</b> <b>committee.</b> He advised Bojić to continue writing poetry and dramatic verse. In 1911, Bojić shared the first draft of a stage play titled [...] "Chains" [...] (Lanci) with Dragutinović, who encouraged him to submit it to a competition held by the Literary Committee of the National Theatre in Belgrade. Bojić's play was one of forty-two works that were submitted. A number of prominent writers took part in the competition, including Ivo Vojnović, Branislav Nušić, Aleksa Šantić, and Svetozar Ćorović. [...] "Chains" [...] was rejected as being too [...] "naïve" [...] and [...] "full of youthful exaggerations", and the prize went to another contestant. In May, Bojić's father died suddenly of a heart attack, aged 56.|$|E

500|$|Though {{intended}} to be displayed alongside Migration of the Serbs, the triptych ended up being the only painting Jovanović sent to Budapest. The Patriarch of Karlovci, Georgije I, was dissatisfied with Migration of the Serbs at first viewing and demanded that the artist make changes so the painting would conform with the Church's view of the migration. Jovanović duly took the painting back to his studio and began altering it to the Patriarch's liking. Though the changes were made relatively quickly, {{they could not be}} rendered in time for the Exhibition. Hence, only the Vršac triptych was sent for display. It was exhibited at the art pavilion and received praise from critics. The <b>artistic</b> <b>committee</b> judged it to be the Exhibition's best work and Jovanović was awarded a gold medal for his efforts. In particular, the judges noted Jovanović's mastery of pleinairism. [...] "Among his friends", one reviewer wrote, [...] "Jovanović is a real master of precise painting. This time, he used plein air and showed so much skill that his paintings could rightfully be set as an example for younger generations." ...|$|E

50|$|According to {{an urban}} myth given {{credence}} {{by a number}} of obituaries of Billy Wilder notably in the Independent and New York Times, Lang was a hardline fascist and led, in 1938, a violent attack on the sole Jew living in Oberammergau at the time. He was not allowed to appear in post-war Passion Plays by an <b>artistic</b> censorship <b>committee,</b> because of his record. The Wilder comment and the artistic censorship comment may refer to Alois Lang the Christus of 1930 and 1934, who was subject of a denazification court in 1947.|$|R
