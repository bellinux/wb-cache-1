The French Government, finding such a {{disposition}} to compliance in the agents that were placed near it, by America, has quite reasonably inferred that the mass at home acted on the same temporizing and selfish policy, and has treated a solemn compact, that contains a tardy and very insufficient reparation, {{for some of the}} greatest outrages that were ever committed by one civilized nation on the rights of another, as a matter quite within its own control. This consequence was foreseen by the writer, and foretold, in a letter that was written in 1832, and published {{as far back as the}} year 1833. It was only necessary to be on the spot, and to witness the contempt and indifference engendered by this miserable policy, to predict the events which have since occurred.

6000|$|Nassau {{has been}} much {{agitated}} of late with liberal opinions, though the government is already what it is the fashion to term representative, {{on this side of}} the Atlantic. It is the old theory, that small states can better support a popular form of government than a large state. This is a theory in which I have no faith, and one, in my opinion, that has been fabricated to suit the <b>accidental</b> <b>situation</b> of Europe. The danger of popular governments are popular excesses, such as those truculent errors that men fall into by a misconception of truth, misstatements, ignorance of their interests, and the sort of village-like gossip which causes every man to think he is a judge of character, when he is not even a judge of facts. The abuses of absolutism are straightforward, dogged tyranny, in which the rights of the mass are sacrificed to the interests and policy of a prince and his favourites. Now, in a large country, popular excesses in one part are checked and repressed by the power and interests of the other parts. It is not an easy matter to make a popular error, that leads to popular excesses, extend simultaneously over a very extended surface; and they who are tranquil, control, and finally influence, those who are excited. In a small state, absolutism is held under the checks of neighbourhood and familiarity. Men disregard accidents and crime in a capital, while they reason on them and act on them in the country. Just so will the sovereign of a small state feel and submit to the authority of an active public opinion. If I must have liberty, let it come in large draughts like learning, and form an atmosphere of its own; and if I must be the subject of despotic power, Heaven send that my sovereign be a small prince. The latter is on the supposition that I am an honest man, for he who would rise by servility and a sacrifice of his principles, had better at once choose the greatest monarch he can find for a master. Small states are usually an evil in themselves, but I think they are least so when the authority is absolute. The people of Nassau had better be moderate in their progress, while they of France should press on to their purpose; and yet the people of Nassau will probably be the most urgent, simply because the power with which they have to contend is so feeble, for men rarely take the [...] "just medium," [...] though they are always talking about it.|$|E

In <b>accidental</b> <b>situations</b> large deformations will occur and the interaction between the different elements becomes important to provide alternate load paths. For large deformations specialized material models are required. Using these large deformation models the geometrical non-linear behaviour of slabs and beams can be studied. In former years limiting cracks and deformations in concrete elements were one of the major design criteria. Therefore only limited experimental research is available to validate models describing large deformations. In the current standards detailing rules are given. These reinforcements provide extra strength, ductility and continuity in constructions and should be taken into account during <b>accidental</b> <b>situations.</b> It is advised to implement the following aspects when designing constructions : load carrying capacity due to geometrical nonlinear behaviour, strength of connections between elements and the configuration of elements to provide alternate load paths.

Styrene is a substance of interest in risk assessment and risk management for humans for which one need reference values.

In the case of chronic exposure to styrene, the National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks (INERIS) has made a choice among the existing toxicological reference values determined by international agencies. In the context of land use planning, acute toxicity threshold values were established by INERIS. For each of these scenarios, a methodology was developed by INERIS.

40|$|AbstractRedundancy {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a desirable property in ensuring the safety of structural systems. Nevertheless, it should be remarked that there is, as yet, neither a uniform theory of structural redundancy nor any widely agreed definitions. With the aim of incorporating redundancy into safety decision-making, the present article concentrates on the essentials of redundancy {{as well as its}} significance within the wider context of structural safety. First, it explains three terms associated with redundancy, including static indeterminacy, alternative load paths and, meanwhile, clarifies their interdependence. Secondly, different levels of structural safety (i. e. reliability and robustness) are investigated from a broader perspective, in which reliability refers to the pristine or intact state of a structure, whereas robustness corresponds to local damage states. Based on the two distinct levels, it is argued herein that the existence of redundancy assists in: (1) enhancing the safety margin/reliability of a structure in its intact state; and (2) mitigating the sensitivity/vulnerability of the structure to localised damage under an <b>accidental</b> <b>situation.</b> Thirdly, it classifies major aspects of ensuring redundant structures, taking into account various stages they are involved in. Further, essential means of designing for redundancy are discussed which can readily be integrated into safety decision-making. A hypothetical structural system is employed for illustrative purpose, indicating that the aforementioned means can be treated within the reliability and robustness frame. Based on this study, some recommendations are presented and areas of further research indicated...|$|E
40|$|The Chernobyl nuclear {{accident}} {{and more recently}} the Fukushima accident highlighted that the largest source of error on consequences assessment is the source term including the time evolution of the release rate and its distribution between radioisotopes. Inverse modeling methods, which combine environmental measurements and atmospheric dispersion models, have proven efficient in assessing source term due to an <b>accidental</b> <b>situation</b> (Gudiksen, 1989; Krysta and Bocquet, 2007; Stohl et al., 2012 a; Winiarek et al., 2012). Most existing approaches are designed to use air sampling measurements (Winiarek et al., 2012) {{and some of them}} also use deposition measurements (Stohl et al., 2012 a; Winiarek et al., 2013) but none of them uses dose rate measurements. However, it is the most widespread measurement system, and {{in the event of a}} {{nuclear accident}}, these data constitute the main source of measurements of the plume and radioactive fallout during releases. This paper proposes a method to use dose rate measurements as part of an inverse modeling approach to assess source terms. The method is proven efficient and reliable when applied to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (FD-NPP). The emissions for the eight main isotopes 133 Xe, 134 Cs, 136 Cs, 137 Cs, 137 m Ba, 131 I, 132 I and 132 Te have been assessed. Accordingly, 103 PBq of 131 I, 35. 5 PBq of 132 I, 15. 5 PBq of 137 Cs and 12 100 PBq of noble gases were released. The events at FD-NPP (such as venting, explosions, etc.) known to have caused atmospheric releases are well identified in the retrieved source term. The estimated source term is validated by comparing simulations of atmospheric dispersion and deposition with environmental observations. The result is that the model-measurement agreement for all of the monitoring locations is correct for 80 % of simulated dose rates that are within a factor of 2 of the observed values. Changes in dose rates over time have been overall properly reconstructed, especially in the most contaminated areas to the northwest and south of the FD-NPP. A comparison with observed atmospheric activity concentration and surface deposition shows that the emissions of caesiums and 131 I are realistic but that 132 I and 132 Te are probably underestimated and noble gases are likely overestimated. Finally, an important outcome of this study is that the method proved to be perfectly suited to emergency management and could contribute to improve emergency response in the event of a nuclear accident...|$|E

Non-supersymmetric pairs of eigenstates do not contribute to the Witten index, which equals the difference in the numbers of the supersymmetric states of even and odd degrees, For compact , each de Rham cohomology class provides one supersymmetric eigenstate and the Witten index equals the Euler characteristic of the phase space.|$|R
