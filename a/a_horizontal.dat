5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), {{the philosopher}} Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{was the first}} in China to {{describe}} the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by <b>a</b> <b>horizontal</b> waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and <b>a</b> <b>horizontal</b> axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.|$|E

5|$|Today, many flags used in Poland {{are based}} on the design of the {{national}} flag. This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services, such as the naval ensign – a swallow-tailed horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe. Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag. Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship – <b>a</b> <b>horizontal</b> bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of the voivodeship – or the flag of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship – <b>a</b> <b>horizontal</b> tricolor of white, yellow and red with the yellow stripe half as wide as any of the other two.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of <b>a</b> <b>horizontal</b> bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
5|$|A focal {{mechanism}} {{solution of}} the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north-south and dipping approximately 45degrees {{to the east and}} to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion, and to <b>a</b> <b>horizontal</b> east-west axis of confining stress. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with <b>a</b> <b>horizontal</b> subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
