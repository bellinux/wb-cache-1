40|$|Eye–hand {{coordination}} {{was investigated}} {{with the global}} effect paradigm. In this paradigm, saccades typically land in between the target and a nearby presented distractor, the configuration’s center of gravity. This so-called global effect, or spatial averaging, is attributed to incomplete target selection. Four experiments demonstrated a similar effect for hand movements; thus, eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> are coupled during target selection. However, under some conditions the global effect was different for eye <b>and</b> <b>hand,</b> suggesting that their coupling is not achieved through a shared target representation. Instead, eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> seem to use 2 separate target representations that exchange information. The convergent amplitudes of eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> with simultaneous execution support this interpretation. Latencies showed a similar converging pattern. A great number of daily activities require the coordinated action of eye <b>and</b> <b>hand.</b> Whether reaching for a coffee cup or playing tennis, {{it is necessary to}} couple motor information with visual information for these actions to be successful. Because the hand motor system relies on visual information, {{it seems likely that the}} motor systems of eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> are closely coupled. Coupling can be studied with respect to the time of movement initiation and the representation of target position of both eye <b>and</b> <b>hand.</b> It is generally assumed that the information used for movement initiation differs for eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements (e. g., Gielen, van den Heuvel, & van Gisbergen, 1984), at least in the case of reactive movements (Sailer, Eggert, Ditterich, & Straube, 2000). This as-sumption is supported by the rather weak correlations found be-tween eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movement latencies toward visual target...|$|R
40|$|Reaching {{with the}} arm and {{grasping}} with the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> fingers is a complex behavior that appears in utero, is elaborated over {{the first few years}} of life, and serves useful everyday functions throughout the course of human life. Several neurological condi-tions can impair the ability to produce arm <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements <b>and</b> so greatly impact on the quality of life and well-being of the affected individuals. Given the fundamental role that arm <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements play in everyday life, deficits related to arm <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> function are one of the most debilitating motor conditions. Neurological conditions that can affect arm <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements include autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and stroke-related motor cortex damage as well as spinal cord injury at cervical levels. While arm <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movement has received consider-able attention from both clinicians and researchers from divers...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} the reliability of tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength <b>and</b> endurance measurements in old adults using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI). Method: Thirty aged-care residents (6 males and 24 females) aged 79 – 97 years were tested on four occasions two weeks apart to determine test–retest reliability. The primary outcome measures were isometric anterior and posterior tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength (best of three trials) and isometric tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> endurance time at 50 % of maximal strength. Results: Changes in the mean between sessions for tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength indicated acceptable (<[*] 10 %) reliability particularly with familiarisation. The within-subject variation (mean-typical error expressed as a coefficient of variation, CV) indicated higher than acceptable variation for anterior and posterior tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength. Intra-class correlations (ICC) indicated moderate to strong reliability for anterior (ICC 0. 58 – 0. 77) and posterior (ICC 0. 77 – 0. 84) tongue strength <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength (ICC 0. 79 – 0. 96). No tongue or hand endurance measures were regarded as reliable. Conclusion: These findings indicate that overall tongue <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> strength values demonstrate acceptable reliability in the elderly, especially where familiarisation with the IOPI is provided. Further investigation to reduce sources of variability in tongue endurance measurements is warranted...|$|R

5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up trees or other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E

40|$|Deficient eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> {{movements}} {{are present in}} patients with multiple sclerosis. In the present study, eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements were simultaneously measured during visually guided wrist step-tracking tasks in 16 patients with intention tremor and 15 healthy controls. The coupling between eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements was analyzed during simultaneous eye-hand tracking, and interactions were studied by comparing the coordinated eye-hand condition with isolated eye- or hand-tracking conditions. Despite movement abnormalities, the onset of eye <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements was highly correlated and an invariant coupling between the saccadic completion time <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> peak velocity was found, suggesting that the temporal coupling was very much preserved. The differences between the experimental tracking conditions suggest that, in MS patients with intention tremor, the ocular system influenced the hand movements. Intention tremor amplitude was reduced {{when there was no}} preceding saccadic eye movement, whereas conversely, eye movements were not affected by different hand tremor severity. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms <b>and</b> <b>hands.</b> The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes).

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{is defined}} as a symmetrical disease yet there is evidence that hand joint damage sustained in RA is related to use, <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> dominance could affect the degree of structural impairment evident in the wrist <b>and</b> <b>hand.</b> This exploratory research aimed to examine the relationship of dominant and non-dominant wrist <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> joint impairment <b>and</b> function in an early rheumatoid population. A multi-centre cohort study was conducted, recruiting consenting patients with early rheumatoid arthritis from eight outpatient occupational therapy departments. Wrist <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> joint impairment <b>and</b> function were assessed by measuring joint pain and swelling, range of motion and joint deviation, handgrip <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> dexterity. The results demonstrated that the non-dominant hand showed less pathological structural and functional involvement than the dominant hand in all but one outcome measure. These differences reached statistical significance between dominant <b>and</b> non-dominant <b>hands</b> on active range of motion in the wrist and some digits. Dominant <b>hand</b> structural impairment <b>and</b> dysfunction in this early RA sample was consistently greater than the non-dominant <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> bilateral handgrip ratio did not reflect healthy values for norms. Individuals with early RA showed a greater level of impairment in their dominant hands...|$|R

5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet <b>and</b> <b>hands.</b> This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
