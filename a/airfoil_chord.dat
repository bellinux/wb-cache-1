40|$|A better {{comprehension}} of the aerodynamic behavior of rotating airfoils in Darrieus Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) is crucial both for the further development of these machines and for improvement of conventional design tools based on zero or one-dimensional models (e. g. BEM models). When smaller rotors are designed with high chord-toradius (c/R) ratios {{so as not to}} limit the blade Reynolds number, the performance of turbine blades has been suggested to be heavily impacted by a virtual camber effect imparted on the blades by the curvilinear flow they experience. To assess the impact of this virtual camber effect on blade and turbine performance, a standard NACA 0018 airfoil and a NACA 0018 conformally transformed such that the <b>airfoil's</b> <b>chord</b> line follows the arc of a circle, where the ratio of the <b>airfoil's</b> <b>chord</b> to the circle's radius is 0. 25 were considered. For both airfoils, wind tunnel tests were carried out to assess their aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients for Reynolds numbers of interest for Darrieus VAWTs. Unsteady CFD calculations have been then carried out to obtain curvilinear flow performance data for the same airfoils mounted on a Darrieus rotor with a c/R of 0. 25. The blade incidence and lift and drag forces were extracted from the CFD output using a novel incidence angle deduction technique. According to virtual camber theory, the transformed airfoil in this curvilinear flow should be equivalent to the NACA 0018 in rectilinear flow, while the NACA 0018 should be equivalent to the inverted transformed airfoil in rectilinear flow. Comparisons were made between these airfoil pairings using the CFD output and the rectilinear performance data obtained from the wind tunnel tests and XFoil output in the form of pressure distributions and lift and drag polars. Blade torque coefficients and turbine power coefficient are also presented for the CFD VAWT using both blade profiles...|$|R
5000|$|Thin airfoil theory {{does not}} account for the stall of the airfoil, which usually occurs at an angle of attack between 10° and 15° for typical airfoils. In the mid-late 2000's, however, a theory {{predicting}} the onset of leading edge stall was proposed by Wallace J. Morris II in his doctoral thesis. [...] Morris's subsequent refinements contain the details on the current state of theoretical knowledge on the leading edge stall phenomenon. Morris's theory predicts the critical angle of attack for leading-edge stall onset as the condition at which a global separation zone is predicted in the solution for the inner flow. Morris's theory demonstrates that a subsonic flow about a thin airfoil can be described in terms of an outer region, around most of the <b>airfoil</b> <b>chord,</b> and an inner region, around the nose, that asymptotically match each other. As the flow in the outer region is dominated by classical thin airfoil theory, Morris's equations exhibit many components of thin airfoil theory.|$|E

50|$|The {{reference}} area A is typically {{defined as the}} area of the orthographic projection of the object on a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion.

Airfoils use the square of the chord length as the {{reference area}}; since <b>airfoil</b> <b>chords</b> are usually defined with a length of 1, the reference area is also 1. Aircraft use the wing area (or rotor-blade area) as the reference area, which makes for an easy comparison to lift.

The numerical solutions show that the Gurney flap increases airfoil lift coefficient with only a slight increase in drag coefficient. Use of a 1. 5 percent chord Gurney flap increases the maximum lift coefficient by approximately 0. 3 and decreases the angle of attack for a given lift coefficient by more than 3 deg.

40|$|The unsteady, {{incompressible}} flow around a translating two-dimensional wind turbine blade section (NREL S 809) in the stream-wise direction has been simulated using unsteady RANS with the transition SST turbulence model. The Reynolds number is Re = 106 {{referred to a}} chord length of 1 m. A prescribed sinu-soidal stream-wise motion has been applied at a fixed amplitude of 0. 25 m {{for a range of}} high angles of attack [30 ◦ < α < 150 ◦]. At these incidences, the airfoil will behave more like a bluff body and may experience periodic vortex shedding. It is well known that oscillations can lead to a synchronization (lock-in) of the vortex shedding frequency, fv, with the body’s motion frequency, fs, in bluff body flows. In order to investigate the susceptibility of the wind turbine blade section to lock-in, a parametric study has been conducted varying the frequency ratio r, (r = fs / fv 0), in a range around r = 1 and r = 0. 5. The lock-in region boundaries have been proposed and an analysis of the effect of the oscil-lation amplitude has been conducted. The synchronization map obtained suggests that, for the vibration amplitude considered, the risk of vortex-induced vibration is more significant in the re-gions of α = 35 ◦ and α = 145 ◦. Furthermore, it has been found that for some stream-wise amplitudes, increasing the oscillation amplitude, lock-in appears to be unexpectedly suppressed in the vicinity of r = 1.
