5|$|The {{starship}} USS Enterprise {{arrives at}} planet M-113 to provide medical exams for Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder) {{and his wife}} Nancy (Jeanne Bal), who operate a research station there. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), and Crewman Darnell (Michael Zaslow) transport to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy Crater ten years earlier. They arrive in the research station, {{and each of the}} three men see Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting for her age, and Darnell as <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different,</b> attractive younger woman. Kirk sends the dazed Darnell outside; when Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.|$|E
5|$|VR {{has given}} mixed {{statements}} about the fault-sensitivity of the train. Pentti Kuokkanen, project coordinator of VR Engineering downplayed the problems when questioned about the reliability of another Fiat Ferroviaria multiple unit, the Sm4, in 1999. According to him, the Pendolino had been VR's most reliable passenger train during winter 1998–1999. In 2006, VR's CEO Henri Kuitunen affirmed that the Pendolino was causing serious image problems to VR Group. In 2010, the company's head of traffic control Mauno Haapala stated that the Sm3 was not more fault-sensitive than their other trains. However during winter 2011, VR Group's head of service and production department Pertti Saarela gave <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> answer, saying that Pendolinos {{are more prone to}} failures especially during winter. It is impossible to know if the train has more problems than VR's other rolling stock, as the company does not give out punctuality statistics for specific train types.|$|E
5|$|The quartet never competed {{as a unit}} {{after the}} Moscow Olympics. Tonelli retired {{immediately}} after the Games, while Kerry took an extended break. The backstroker attempted a comeback in the leadup to the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, but his abbreviated preparation before the selection trials was not enough and he was defeated by other swimmers. This left Evans and Brooks as the only members of the 1980 team to participate in Australia's medley relay victory at the Commonwealth Games. In 1984, Kerry secured a recall to the team as Australia's preferred backstroker, while Brooks was surpassed by Mark Stockwell as the leading freestyler. Australia came third in the 1984 Summer Olympics in the medley relay as the Americans returned to the Olympic fold; Evans and Kerry swam in the final, while Brooks did the freestyle leg in the heats. Evans and Kerry retired after the Olympics, and Brooks was not the first-choice swimmer in 1986, meaning that <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> quartet competed in the medley relay at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Brooks was suspended for drunken behaviour on the flight back to Australia, and then retired, and all {{four members of the}} Quietly Confident Quartet had departed the Australian swimming scene.|$|E

25|$|He also {{considered}} the axolotl, a mole salamander, which can breed whilst {{still in its}} gilled larval form without maturing into a terrestrial adult.

25|$|Wyler {{encouraged}} Davis to see Bankhead in {{the original}} play, which she did despite major misgivings. She later regretted doing so because after watching Bankhead's performance and reading Hellman's screenplay she felt compelled to create <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> interpretation of the role, one she didn't feel suited the character. Bankhead had portrayed Regina as a victim forced to fight for her survival due to the contempt with which her brothers treated her, but Davis played her as a cold, conniving, calculating woman wearing a death mask of white powder she insisted makeup artist Perc Westmore create for her.|$|E

25|$|The {{next section}} lists {{some of the}} {{alternative}} proposals to {{an explanation of the}} Penn effect, but there are significant econometric problems with testing the BS-hypothesis, and the lack of strong evidence for it between modern economies may not refute it, or imply that it produces a small effect. For instance, other effects of exchange rate movements might mask the long-term BS-hypothesis mechanism (making it harder to detect if it exists). Exchange rate movements are believed by some to affect productivity; if this is true then regressing RER movements on differential productivity growth will be 'polluted' by <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> relationship between the variables1.|$|E

In the north, some people (especially the elite in the past) also decorate their house with a plum blossoms (also called hoa mai in Vietnamese, but referring to <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> species from mickey-mouse blossoms). In the north or central, the kumquat tree is a popular decoration for the living room during Tết. Its many fruits symbolize the fertility and fruitfulness for which the family hopes in the coming year.|$|E
25|$|A Canadian Rugby Football Union was {{established}} in 1884, although this organisation {{went on to become}} the Canadian Football League, as rugby football in Canada evolved into Canadian football. In 1902–1903 the first Canadian team toured Britain. In 1909, Earl Grey, then Governor General of Canada, donated a trophy to the CRU to be awarded for the Rugby Football Championship of Canada. This trophy became known as the Grey Cup. However the rules used in Canada were vastly different from the rules used in countries that were part of the IRB. In the years that followed, the CRU would legalise forward passing and make other changes that would make Canadian football <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> sport, similar to American football.|$|E
50|$|The Family Court (FC) was {{established}} in 2004, motivated {{by the need to}} differentiate between family litigations and other disputes.

50|$|Bentley {{wrote the}} Epistola ad Johannem Millium, {{which is about}} 100 pages {{included}} {{at the end of}} the Oxford Malalas (1691).

The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his emendation and command over the relevant material, are in <b>a</b> style <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> from the careful and laborious learning of Hody, Mill or Edmund Chilmead. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.|$|R

25|$|Swapping of {{the wing}} men: Sometimes, a team with two {{flexible}} (position wise) wide men {{will allow them to}} interchange as the game progresses. The aim of this is to confuse the defenders who are assigned to mark them, thus maybe leading to opportunities as the defender tries to find their man in set pieces (corners, free kicks etc., where the man may be in <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> position and thus evade his grasp). Also, if the wingers are different types of player (one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example), then it might be to exploit a weakness in the opposing defender.|$|E
25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or wire) into the holder (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|E
25|$|After {{the intense}} touring {{that had been}} taking place through the first two albums, working almost 24 hours a day, basically, we managed to stop and have a proper break, {{a couple of months}} as opposed to a couple of weeks. We decided to go off and rent a cottage to provide a {{contrast}} to motel rooms. Obviously, it had quite an effect on the material that was written... It was the tranquility of the place that set the tone of the album. Obviously, we weren't crashing away at 100 watt Marshall stacks. Having played acoustic and being interested in classical guitar, anyway, being in a cottage without electricity, it was acoustic guitar time... After all the heavy, intense vibe of touring which is reflected in the raw energy of the second album, it was just <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>different</b> feeling.|$|E
