5|$|Feral {{cats are}} {{domestic}} cats that {{were born in}} or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60million. Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.|$|E

Aside {{from other}} national teams, the Philippine nationals also faced selection teams and club sides from other nations <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tournaments. The team made a podium finish, placing not below third place, at the Japanese Empire-sanctioned East Asian Games in 1940, the Long Teng Cup (2010, 2011) held in Taiwan, {{and all three}} editions of the Philippine Peace Cup (2012, 2013 and 2014) hosted by the home country.|$|E

25|$|In Connecticut, Elimia virginica is at {{the edge}} of its range, and is most likely limited to hard water {{habitats}} only. During collections made in the Connecticut River, the snail was found to inhabit regions with water temperatures up to 27.5°C, dissolved oxygen between 7 and 14 ppm, CaCO3 concentration from 42-160 ppm, pH from 7.6-9.0 and CO2 concentration from 0-10 ppm. However, <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sites, population abundance was very low and/or decreasing, especially in conditions of high water temperature and alkalinity.|$|E
25|$|For a {{while the}} band {{consisted}} of just Peter Knight and Tim Harries, plus various guest musicians, as they fulfilled live commitments. Rick Kemp resumed playing with the band <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> gigs, with Harries switching to lead guitar. This was an uncertain time {{for the future of}} the band, and when Harries announced he was not keen to continue his role, even the willingness of Kemp to return to the line-up full-time was not enough to prevent what was effectively a break-up.|$|E
25|$|After his return, in January 2005 Habib {{filed suit}} against the Australian {{government}} for its cooperation with the United States, alleging that he was beaten and humiliated in Pakistan after his arrest. He also alleged that an Australian official was present <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> interrogations, but the Australian Government denied this. Habib claims to have been suspended to a ceiling by his arms, standing atop a barrel drum, and that when he gave an answer his Pakistani interrogators didn't believe, they would jolt him with electricity until he fainted.|$|E

25|$|Habib {{told his}} account {{numerous}} times to media: {{he said that}} he had been interrogated about supposed terrorist activities while under torture in Pakistan, taken to Egypt and interrogated under torture there, transferred to United States military custody in Afghanistan, and transported to Guantanamo Bay detention camp, where he suffered extended solitary confinement, more interrogation and torture. He said that Australian officers had been present <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> occasions. After the Australian government was notified of his detention in Guantanamo, he was interrogated there by an ASIO agent, who he says threatened him and his family. The torture and Australian witness were denied by the respective governments, and Egypt denied he had been held in the country.|$|E
25|$|One way {{in which}} caves retain low {{temperatures}} is through a constant input of cold air from outside the cave circulating in. Typically, the caves supporting the largest Indiana bat populations have multiple entrances that allow cool air from outside the cave to come in, creating a circulation of fresh cooled air. Gates that are meant to keep vandals out of caves have altered the temperature and airflow of hibernacula, resulting in population declines of Indiana bats at many major hibernacula throughout their range. Removing or modifying gates <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> have given these populations a chance to rebound. Also, the bats seem to prefer a relative humidity of 74% to 100%, although it is uncommon for the air to be saturated. Relative humidities of only 50.4% have also been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Demonstrations {{against the}} {{cartoons}} {{took place in}} several predominantly or partially Muslim countries, {{not just in the}} Middle East but also in the Philippines and Indonesia. A prominent feature of many of these demonstrations is the burning of the flags of Denmark, France, and Norway. The Swiss flag was also burned at some protests, possibly due to its similarity to the Danish flag. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> protests, many American, British, and Israeli flags were also burned. In addition to burning, some demonstrators walked on Danish flags or tore them up. Since the Danish flag incorporates a cross, desecrating a Danish flag can be seen as both anti-Danish and anti-Christian. An interview in the Russian media asserts that a US newspaper made the cartoons, and the Jyllands-Posten only distributed it. This assertion is widely accepted in the Muslim world.|$|E

25|$|Every {{school and}} {{department}} at the university was involved in some type of military research or training during World War II. During a project on radar receivers, Purdue physicists discovered properties of germanium {{that led to the}} making of the first transistor. The Army and the Navy conducted training programs at Purdue and more than 17,500 students, staff, and alumni served in the armed forces. Purdue set up about a hundred centers throughout Indiana to train skilled workers for defense industries. As veterans returned to the university under the G.I. Bill, first-year classes were taught <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sites to alleviate the demand for campus space. Four of these sites are now degree-granting regional campuses of the Purdue University system. Purdue’s on-campus housing became racially desegregated in 1947, following pressure from Purdue President Frederick L. Hovde and Indiana Governor Ralph F. Gates.|$|E

Of the concert dates whose set lists the website has published, Springsteen performed [...] "I'm Goin' Down" [...] 13 times out of 85 concerts on his Working on a Dream Tour in 2009, 14 times out of 138 concerts on his Wrecking Ball World Tour in 2012–2013, and three times out of 34 concerts on his High Hopes Tour in 2014—for a total of 30 times out of 257 concerts. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> 30 shows, Springsteen played the entire Born in the U.S.A. album.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the orchestral concerts, Bache gave an annual series of solo recitals on Liszt's birthday, 22 October, between 1872 and 1887. In October 1879, Bache gave his first all-Liszt recital. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> recitals, the two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works were given. The two-piano version of Mazeppa was presented in October 1876, {{two months before the}} orchestral version was played at the Crystal Palace and four months before Bache presented it at his own orchestral concert. The Monthly Musical Record felt [...] "There was ... good reason in introducing [...] as a duet, with a view to familiarizing hearers with it beforehand", and the Musical Standard found that presenting the two-piano arrangement was [...] "an immense help to those who wished to form a correct judgment on it at its first orchestral performance ... as it is impossible, with even the best intentions, to estimate correctly the larger works of Liszt after only one hearing." ...|$|E

Once a year, Jehovah's Witnesses gather at larger assemblies called [...] "Regional Conventions" [...] {{which are usually}} three days long (Friday to Sunday). These conventions consist primarily of Bible-based sermons, including demonstrations and experiences of their preaching work. They also often feature video presentations and live, full-costume dramatic plays re-enacting biblical accounts—such as Moses and the Plagues of Egypt, and Lot in Sodom and Gomorrah—or contemporary settings based on biblical principles.
