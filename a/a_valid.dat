5|$|The {{following}} sequence demonstrates mapping a band configuration to a counting symmetry equivalence class. Begin with <b>a</b> <b>valid</b> band configuration (1). Build column triplets {{by ordering}} the column values within each column. This is not <b>a</b> <b>valid</b> Sudoku band, but does place the same {{constraints on the}} lower bands as the example (2). Construct an equivalence class ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use column and box swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID. The last figure shows the column and box ordering for the ID: 124 369 578 138 267 459. All Band1 permutations with this counting symmetry ID {{will have the same}} number of grid completions as the original example. An extension of this process can be used to build the largest possible band counting symmetry equivalence classes (3).|$|E

5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to shoot animals {{when it was}} necessary for the purpose of examining them scientifically, he no longer regarded adding to a collection as <b>a</b> <b>valid</b> reason to take a life. In 1906 Beebe presented his own collection, which had grown to 990 specimens during his earlier years as a collector, as a gift to the zoo for educational and research purposes. For this gift he was made a life member of the New York Zoological Society. The same year, he was also elected a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|An {{impression}} of the Great Seal of a state (or its coat of arms) has long been required on official documents ranging from deeds to legislative acts.

5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents <b>a</b> <b>valid</b> distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become <b>a</b> <b>valid</b> alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E

In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
