50|$|In January 1949, Eighth Air Force {{planned a}} large airshow at Carswell AFB. All of its {{assigned}} units were {{to participate in}} a coordinated flyover. Kearney AFB was socked-in with a blizzard {{on the day of the}} show. Nevertheless, paths were cut though the snow for the aircraft to taxi and somehow the F-82s got airborne, joining up with SAC bombers over Oklahoma on schedule. The flyover by the Twin Mustangs was a tremendous success, with SAC leadership being amazed that the F-82 was truly an <b>all</b> <b>weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> and the unit able to carry out their mission despite the weather.|$|E

Research is being done for both fixed and rotary wing applications. The NASA program emphasizes technology development in two key areas: advanced ice protection concepts and icing simulation (analytical and experimental).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the NASA aircraft icing research program is to develop and make available icing technology to support the needs and requirements of industry for <b>all</b> <b>weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> designs. While {{a majority of the}} technology being developed is viewed to be generic (i. e., appropriate to all vehicle classes), vehicle specific emphasis is being placed on the helicopter due to its unique icing problems. In particular, some of the considerations for rotorcraft icing are indicated. The NASA icing research program emphasizes technology development in two key areas: ice protection concepts and icing simulation (analytical and experimental). The NASA research efforts related to rotorcraft icing in these two technology areas will be reviewed...|$|E
50|$|After a few quiet years {{involving}} exercises {{all round}} {{the globe and}} the inclusion of Lieutenant The Prince Of Wales in Red Dragon flight, the Ministry of Defence announced that a permanent presence was to be established in Northern Ireland, {{which resulted in a}} six weeks rolling roulement for all commando aircrew. 845 NAS established a hard earned reputation for trying its utmost to help the troops in <b>all</b> <b>weathers.</b> Its <b>aircraft</b> were some of the first to render help to the mortar devastated Forkhill Special Forces base.

5000|$|The HAL Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) is an Indian {{programme}} of a fifth-generation fighter aircraft. It {{is being}} developed by an aerospace industry team which consists of the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) as the design firm with manufacturing carried out by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) as the primary contractor and main assembly firm. It is a single-seat, twin-engine, stealth supermaneuverable <b>all</b> <b>weather</b> multirole fighter <b>aircraft.</b> Unofficial design work on the AMCA started in 2008 with official work started in 2011 and completed in 2014. [...] In 2008, the Indian Navy joined the programme seeking a naval variant optimized for operation from aircraft carriers. The first flight is scheduled to occur in 2025.|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{effects on}} {{aviation}} are described by Mahapatra (1999) as including (1) atmospheric phenomena involving air motion - wind shear and turbulence; (2) hydrometeorological phenomena - rain, snow and hail; (3) aircraft icing; (4) low visibility; and (5) atmospheric electrical phenomena. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Weather</b> Mitigation includes <b>aircraft</b> systems (e. g. airframe, propulsion, avionics, controls) {{that can be}} enacted (by a pilot, automation or hybrid systems) to suppress and/or prepare {{for the effects of}} encountered or unavoidable weather or to facilitate a crew operational decision-making process relative to <b>weather.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> <b>weather</b> mitigation {{can be thought of as}} a continuum (Figure 1) with the need to avoid <b>all</b> adverse <b>weather</b> at one extreme and the ability to safely operate in <b>all</b> <b>weather</b> conditions at the other extreme. Realistic aircraft capabilities fall somewhere between these two extremes. The capabilities of small general aviation aircraft would be expected to fall closer to the "Avoid All Adverse Weather" point, and the capabilities of large commercial jet transports would fall closer to the "Operate in <b>All</b> <b>Weather</b> Conditions" point. The ability to safely operate in adverse weather conditions is dependent upon the pilot s capabilities (training, total experience and recent experience), the airspace in which the operation is taking place (terrain, navigational aids, traffic separation), the capabilities of the airport (approach guidance, runway and taxiway lighting, availability of air traffic control), as well as the capabilities of the airplane. The level of mitigation may vary depending upon the type of adverse weather. For example, a small general aviation airplane may be equipped to operate "in the clouds" without outside visual references, but not be equipped to prevent airframe ice that could be accreted in those clouds...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{information}} on runways which may become slippery due to various forms and types of contaminants. Experience has shown that since the beginning of <b>all</b> <b>weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> operations, there have been landing and aborted takeoff incidents and/or accidents each year where aircraft have either run off the end or veered off the shoulder of low friction runways. NASA Langley's Landing and Impact Dynamics Branch is involved in several research programs directed towards obtaining {{a better understanding of how}} different tire properties interact with varying pavement surface characteristics to produce acceptable performance for aircraft ground handling requirements. One such effort, which was jointly supported by not only NASA and the FAA but by several aviation industry groups including the Flight Safety Foundation, is described...|$|E
50|$|For the {{planning}} and conduct of military operations, the ability to produce accurate weather forecasts can be a decisive factor. However, international weather data required for this purpose were not readily available to the German military {{at the time of}} the Second World War. The Wehrmacht therefore created a global network of weather stations, weather ships and <b>weather</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The <b>weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> were organised into special squadrons and were usually directly subordinate to the Luftwaffe or Luftwaffenf√ºhrungskommando. Overall, there were eleven Wekustas, each of which had between three and twelve two-engined aircraft. Many meteorologists were conscripted into the squadrons to collect the weather data and more than 200 of them were killed.|$|R

40|$|The {{forward looking}} radar imaging task is a {{practical}} and challenging problem for adverse <b>weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> landing industry. Deconvolution method can realize the forward looking imaging but it often leads to the noise amplification in the radar image. In this paper, a forward looking radar imaging based on deconvolution method is presented for adverse <b>weather</b> <b>aircraft</b> landing. We first present the theoretical background of forward looking radar imaging task and its application for aircraft landing. Then, we convert the forward looking radar imaging task into a corresponding deconvolution problem, which is solved {{in the framework of}} algebraic theory using truncated singular decomposition method. The key issue regarding the selecting of the truncated parameter is addressed using generalized cross validation approach. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in achieving angular resolution enhancement with suppressing the noise amplification in forward looking radar imaging...|$|R
