5|$|In {{its early}} years the league {{was little more than}} a formal {{agreement}} between teams to play each other and to declare a champion at season's end. Teams were still permitted to play non-league members. The 1920 season saw several teams drop out <b>and</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> play through their schedule. Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|Insecure {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or {{may go to}} the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to him/her, <b>and</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> return to their previous play. These {{children are more likely}} to have later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E
5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR {{in such a way}} that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress <b>and</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E

5|$|Spender {{goes to the}} Syndicate's headquarters, only to find Krycek, {{who tells}} him that the group's members—with the {{exception}} of The Smoking Man, who has gone to retrieve Cassandra—are preparing to present the alien fetus to the aliens. Fowley returns to her apartment, where she finds Mulder. Fowley heads to the hangar at El Rico Air Force Base, whereas Scully contacts Mulder and the two try <b>and</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> stop the train car transporting Cassandra to El Rico. Spender arrives at Fort Marlene, where he runs into Covarrubias; she tells {{him to go to}} El Rico Air Force Base to find his mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{reaction to}} this latest turn of events was varied and greatly colored by national interests. The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate <b>and</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of {{one aspect of the}} treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained.|$|E

In addition, Favre completed an 81-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Antonio Freeman {{in the second quarter}} (then a Super Bowl record for longest touchdown catch). Favre rushed for 12yards and another touchdown, as the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI over the New England Patriots, 35–21. In their 19 games of the season, the Packers had a turnover ratio of plus 24, and outscored their opponents 100–48 in the playoffs. Favre became the first and only quarterback to score three touchdowns in the Super Bowl <b>and</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> win MVP honors.|$|E
5|$|Karas {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The show {{initially}} showcased larger areas of Tokyo, but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times. Art designer, Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused with a mixture of East Asian cultures. Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and Hangul characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become indifferent to the yōkais presence, <b>and</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> see them as they go about their lives.|$|E
