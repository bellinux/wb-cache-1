This study sought to identify whether the National Organ Donation Collaborative in Australia had any additional influence on improving the experiences of staff and family members in the organ donation process. Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews with 17 family members from 13 families who had agreed to the organ donation of a deceased relative and 25 nurses and intensive care specialists at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria were carried out. Results: The key factor in family members 2 ̆ 7 decision to donate was prior knowledge of the deceased 2 ̆ 7 s donation wish. Although most family members did not regret their decision to donate, many were deeply dissatistified and, at times, confused by the technical and administrative nature of the donation process. Most staff members commented that the key community message about donation should be to encourage people to discuss donation rather than urging people to sign donor registers. Conclusion: This study identified valuable insights into the processes by which family members and intensive care unit staff deal with the actual processes of donation. Findings suggest that the process for families is far more complex than a simple agreement or refusal to donate. This study suggests that we should not assume that 2 ̆ 7 rates 2 ̆ 7 of donation in Australia would increase merely through <b>administrative</b> <b>programmes</b> or marketing campaigns. 2009 Royal Australasian College of Physicians...|$|R

This research study aimed to determine how programme management coordination amongst the provincial office of the NCDoH, district office and the hospital that did undergo revitalisation through the Hospital Revitalisation Programme (HRP) could be improved. In order to explore the research problem the concepts of construction management and operations management were studied from which factors that impact positively and negatively on programme management coordination were extracted. A rationalist philosophical approach and subjectivist epistemology were utilised. The empirical enquiry was conducted through the case study method to obtain in-depth context of the case. The empirical evidence was obtained through a research interview guide utilising the purposive sampling strategy. The research initiated the sampling procedure by targeting the most relevant managers to the research study in the three units of analysis. A snowball approach evolved for the identification of other managers deemed relevant for purposes of this research. The thesis obtained opinions on the subject matter from managers who participated or were supposed to participate in the implementation of the delivery objectives of the <b>administrative</b> <b>programmes</b> in the NCDoH together with the objectives of the HRP. The research revealed that poor programme management coordination in the NCDoH as a result of internal competition and silo functions which prevent synergy from programme management plan development up to implementation. Furthermore, the complete building infrastructure only attains the objectives of construction management but the building infrastructure are not a complete justification for benefit realisation without the integration of operations management. The NCDoH cannot declare a successful programme management practices if it fails to realise the benefits that require integration of infrastructure and services. It is recommended that in order to attain effective programme management and realise the benefits of strategic objectives there should be a cross-functional approach from executive management which should trickle-down to the lowest level of administration. This research has developed a framework that can be useful in the integration of construction and operations management whereby infrastructure and operational services have to be delivered simultaneously in the field of programme management...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} five years, {{political}} scientists have begun to devote attention and research to the contribution of commercials external consultants {{to change in the}} contemporary public sector. Opinion and findings have differed over two questions: how much influence consultants have had over broad policy and which consultants have been most influential in policy and management. Some researchers (Denis Saint-Martin in particular) have pointed to the international accountancy firms as especially important, following their diversification into management and other fields of consulting, including policy consulting, in recent decades. This paper seeks to contribute to this debate by assessing the breadth and 'policy significance' of consultancies carried out by the 'Big Six' accounting firms for all Commonwealth departments in the period 1987 - 93. Data used was the summary details of consultancies required to be published in departmental Annual Reports from 1987 on. A mixed picture emerges but one that overall points to the importance of the firms. The share of firms in the departmental consulting market was less than might be supposed from estimates overseas. But the firms had 'breadth' in the type of consultancies undertaken and the range of departments serviced. Within this ambit, consultancies oriented to reviews of administration appeared the most prevalent. Also, consultancies oriented to financial analysis, either of <b>administrative</b> or <b>programme</b> issues, appeared a forte of the firms. But the firms clearly had broadened beyond this foundation strength and in the direction of broader policy significance. A notable amount of consulting was oriented to 'programme review' as distinct from 'administration review' and to non-financial aspects as well. Moreover, the accumulation of consultancy activity in technical areas such as training and information systems gave the firms the potential to exercise indirect, as well as direct, influence over programmes in the longer run...|$|R
40|$|The Americas, home {{to perhaps}} the most concerted {{domestic}} court effort to prosecute past atrocity crimes in recent times, also has a two-tier regional human rights system that {{came of age in}} the era of mass violations in 1970 s and 1980 s Latin America. Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR) jurisprudence since the late 1990 s can be understood as creating a strong presumption of a present duty to prosecute such crimes, and to actively guarantee corresponding rights to truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-repetition – transitional justice rights – to affected individuals or groups. The recent, 2013, IACtHR verdict in the case Garcia Lucero et al vs. Chile is somewhat unusual in that it deals with the specific reparations needs of a Chilean survivor of dictatorship-era torture now resident in the UK. In doing so, the case challenges conceptions of sufficiency in reparations policy and the geographical reach of state duties in this regard. Perhaps even more strikingly, the verdict also suggests that the Chilean state to have initiated justice proceedings – including a criminal investigation – as soon as one of its <b>administrative</b> reparations <b>programmes</b> received official notification of the allegations of torture made by Mr. García Lucero. The implications of such a verdict are substantial not only for Chile – where at least 100, 000 individuals have made similar applications, and 40, 000 have had their survivor status recognised by a truth commission – but also in raising questions about the judicial status of truth commission proceedings, and the necessarily inter-related nature of truth, justice and reparations dimensions of public policy about past atrocity. The paper considers how these challenges have and may in future play out in Chile’s current treatment of survivors of past torture, and considers the conditions under which resort to regional human rights instances such as the IACtHR may have impact in producing change at state or substate level, whether in the ‘host’ country or elsewhere in the region...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study are the recent <b>administrative</b> reform <b>programmes</b> of the European Commission that were started in 1995 with the taking office of the Santer Commission. The main efforts were {{gathered}} under three programmes: SEM- 2000 (Sound and Efficient Management) 1995. MAP- 2000 (Modernisation of Administration and Personnel Policy) 1997 and DECODE (Dessiner la Commission de demain - Designing Tomorrow's Commission) 1997 The study aims at analysing to what extent do the reforms of the Commission resemble the reforms that have taken place in the EU member states' administrations. As a point of comparison is used the shift that has taken place in the Western European public administrations from a Weberian bureaucracy towards more 'hybrid' models of organisation along the lines of new public management -type of reforms that have sought to introduce private sector practices to the public sector. These two strands of administrative thinking - Weber's bureaucracy theory and new public management philosophy - are outlined. The central arguments of the study are that firstly, despite the dual role of the Commission as an administration and a motor for European integration it can usefully be compared to the national administrations. Secondly, it is established that though reforms in the Commission have been modest, they bear clear connections to the new public management -type of reforms. Besides literature, the main materials used are EU documents and a small number of interviews conducted for the study. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|This is an {{empirical}} {{investigation of the}} processes whereby the boundaries and meaning of citizenship are re-constituted through state-driven practices of regulating migrants and migrants’ responses to such practices. The focal point {{of this study is}} an instance of constitutional and legislative citizenship reform which occurred in the Republic of Ireland in 2004, resulting in the alteration of jus soli citizenship. This thesis explicates the forms of power-knowledge, the discursive and enumerative practices, through which migrant mothers were constituted as risky, irresponsible subjects. The politics of the referendum produced judicial decisions, deportations, legislative change, and the suspension and re-establishment of an <b>administrative</b> residency <b>programme</b> pertaining to immigrant parents. I conceptualise this series of legislative and administrative developments in terms of ‘technologies of citizenship’ and ‘anti-citizenship technologies’ which have cumulatively expanded the capacity of the State to biopolitically and ethopolitically regulate the non-EEA resident immigrant population. I argue that the technical and programmatic aspects of immigration governance through which migrants are channelled into various governmental categories, are constitutive of subject-positions and structuring of immigrants’ agency. Practices such as detention and deportation, direct provision and expedited asylum determination procedures operate as anti-citizenship technologies intended to discipline and deter immigrants. Conditional and temporary residency statuses act as technologies of citizenship, provisionally including immigrants on the basis that they adhere to prescribed criteria. I investigate the subject-effects these technologies on migrant mothers through the prism of eighteen participants’ experiential narratives. The analysis examines how citizenship/immigration technologies act upon migrants’ bodies and mobilities, presuppose particular raced and gendered forms of subjectivity, and endeavour to cultivate forms of subjectivity compatible with the needs of neoliberal governance. However, participants’ narrations of their negotiations of governmental processes and procedures reveal their capacity for political agency, albeit constrained. Moreover, in narrating their local, everyday practices of forming families, participating in communities, engaging in education and employment, the migrant mothers who participated in this study expound alternative articulations of legitimacy and belonging. This thesis theorises the constitutive relationship between the state and migrant subjects in re-shaping the boundaries and meaning of citizenship in the context of transnational migration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVaccination {{coverage}} {{is a widely}} used indicator of programme performance, measured by registries, routine administrative reports or household surveys. Because the population denominator and the reported number of vaccinations used in administrative estimates are often inaccurate, survey data are often considered to be more reliable. Many countries obtain survey data on vaccination coverage every 3 – 5 years from large-scale multi-purpose survey programs. Additional surveys {{may be needed to}} evaluate coverage in Supplemental Immunization Activities such as measles or polio campaigns, or after major changes have occurred in the vaccination programme or its context. When a coverage survey is undertaken, rigorous statistical principles and field protocols should be followed to avoid selection bias and information bias. This requires substantial time, expertise and resources hence the role of vaccination coverage surveys in programme monitoring needs to be carefully defined. At times, programmatic monitoring may be more appropriate and provides data to guide program improvement. Practical field methods such as health facility-based assessments can evaluate multiple aspects of service provision, costs, coverage (among clinic attendees) and data quality. Similarly, purposeful sampling or censuses of specific populations can help local health workers evaluate their own performance and understand community attitudes, without trying to claim that the results are representative of the entire population. <b>Administrative</b> reports enable <b>programme</b> managers to do real-time monitoring, investigate potential problems and take timely remedial action, thus improvement of administrative estimates is of high priority. Most importantly, investment in collecting data needs to be complemented by investment in acting on results to improve performance...|$|R

Chapter Four presents the findings of the study which highlight the role of the principal in managing the aspects of the school while he delegates the various areas of management to the members of staff. The findings further reveal the principal’s involvement in all the processes from inception to end. Chapter Five concludes the study summatively. The chapter includes a brief account of what the study covered, assumptions made in the theoretical framework, and draws important conclusions and makes relevant recommendations about the management duties of the school principal.

40|$|Aim: Latent {{tuberculosis}} infections (LTBI) {{contain a}} significant reservoir for future epidemics. Screening {{of health care}} workers (HCWs) in a high-risk tuberculosis (TB) environment is an important strategy in TB control. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of LTBI among high risk Egyptian HCWs and to assess infection associated risk factors. Methods: Fifty-two HCWs who work at intensive care unit (ICU), bronchoscopy unit, and chest diseases department were tested for LTBI using both tuberculin skin test (TST) and Quantiferon TB Gold in-tube test (QFT). Risk factors for infection, knowledge of HCWs towards different aspects of TB infection and agreement between TST and QFT were also evaluated. Results: Prevalence of LTBI {{in this study was}} 13. 5 % by QFT and TST. It was 13. 6 % by TST alone and 10. 3 % by QFT alone. There was good concordance between both tests (Kappa= 0. 713). There was a statistically significant association between prevalence of LTBI and age of staff ≥ 30 yr (p= 0. 002), period of working experience (p= 0. 006) and working at the Bronchoscopy Unit (p= 0. 001). The total knowledge of HCWs towards different aspects of TB infection was generally good. Conclusion: Although the participants in the current study were among high risk HCWs, the prevalence of LTBI was low. Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, young age, short employment duration, good knowledge and a good infection control were the predictors of low risk of contracting TB at our hospitals. The risk of TB infection in resource-limited countries can be reduced with simple continuous educational and <b>administrative</b> infection control <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

The fund was {{established}} by the Government of Tanzania and Sida in 1998, and aims to promote individual and organizational achievements in the cultural field. Since its inception, the fund has supported 220 cultural projects within six constituencies: Performing Arts, Cultural Heritage, Cultural Industry, Fine Arts & Crafts, Language and Literature and Film, Audio Visuals and Multi- Media. In addition, special awards {{have been given to}} 48 artists who have made an outstanding contribution to Tanzanian cultural life. Due to limited government and private sector funding of culture and arts, the fund has played an important role for the cultural sector. However, the review found that the fund could have been more cost effective and that financial and <b>administrative</b> reports from <b>programme</b> activities need to be improved and more closely related to programme documents. An assessment of the financial reports reveals irregularities {{in the early years of}} the fund. The main objectives of the fund are in line with Norwegian priorities for development cooperation with Tanzania; reduction of income poverty, good governance, improved competence, and institutional capacity building. However, the degree to which the outputs and outcomes of the activities fulfil the objectives of the fund varies. The review recommends that a clearer policy is developed to strike a balance between the fund’s role in poverty reduction and its goal to support exceptionally talented artists. Strategies should be worked out to help artists develop new attractive designs and improve marketing. The report also recommends that some of the cultural awards are earmarked artists who address and stimulate public debate on corruption and good governance...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} effects of the 1989 - 92 Public Service Renewal and 1995 - 1997 Reform of the State <b>administrative</b> reform <b>programme</b> on the ministerial field services. These reforms, through the processes of deconcentration and responsibilisation, delegated increased autonomy to the firld services in their operational management to enable them to improve their delivery of policy objectives. The primary research question was whether operational and institutional factors at field service level impeded or facilitated moves towards a more managerial logic of appropriateness as envisaged by the reform programmes. Through an institutional analysis of the French administrative reform process, a number of institutional and operational factors were identified that would determine the capacity of the field services to engage in the reform process. These factors included the concessions made by the reforms to the field services in budgetary and human resource management, the incentives for field service officials to participate {{and the extent to which}} both the field services and their central Ministries were able to adjust to the requirements of the reform. In addition, there were the conservative influences of the trade unions, {{the effects of}} budgetary cutbacks and the contextual backgrounds of the respective Ministries that were influences on the receptivity of the field service to change. Burgelman's 'Model of the Interaction of Strategic Behavior, Corporate Context and the Concept of Strategy' was used as the theeoretical framework through which the findings from the fieldwork investigations conducted in the Education, Agriculture and Infrastructure Ministries were interpreted. The theoretical framework was found to be applicable to the French administrative context through its articulation of those over their operations and to show greater initiative. Burgelman's criteria for autonomous strategic behaviour were, therefore, adapted to the French administrative reform context and utilised as a structural framework through which the research findings were presented. The establishment of whether the respective criterial had been met provided a means to identify those institutional and operational variables which influenced the capacity of the field services to exercise greater autonomy in their operational management. The explanatory insights of Burgelman's model show how the resilience of traditional institutional features and the effects of budgetary cutbacks minimised the impact of the Public Service Renewal and the Reform of the State programmes in those field services of the Education, Agriculture and Infrastructure Ministries where fieldwork was carried out. The conditions within the French administration were found to be more constraining on the organisational behaviour of officials than Burgelman's model, based on a large scale private sector organisation envisages. Burgelman's model was able to identify the organisational dynamics that constrain reform, but was not able to trace the source of these constraints into a wider social context. It was found that insights from sociological and rational choise institutionalist perspectives clarified the missing social elements of Burgelman's model. The final chapter examines how the organisational dynamics identified in the study could be used as the basis for a generalised framework.
