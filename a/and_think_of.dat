5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt at a}} school field trip, Edna Krabappel calls an {{emergency}} strike {{on behalf of the}} Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly spending on the school. The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the strike is over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the two sides are forced into talking <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E

25|$|The trio are {{eventually}} captured by Snatchers, and Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse for information. This sends Ron into a panic, and he continually screams and fights {{with all his}} effort to save her, despite Harry's instruction that he calm down <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a better plan. The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape.

500|$|When {{the prime}} {{minister}} asked Manekshaw to go to Dhaka and accept the surrender of Pakistani forces, he declined, saying that the honour {{should go to the}} Indian Army Commander in the East, Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. Concerned about maintaining discipline {{in the aftermath of the}} conflict, Manekshaw issued strict instructions forbidding looting and rape. He stressed the need to respect and stay away from women wherever he went. As a result, according to Singh, cases of looting and rape were negligible. In addressing his troops on the matter, Manekshaw was quoted as saying: [...] "When you see a Begum (Muslim woman), keep your hands in your pockets, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Sam." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] {{was written}} by David X. Cohen, and {{directed}} by Neil Affleck. Cohen was inspired to write the episode after a trip to Manhattan's American Museum of Natural History, where he decided to turn the visit into a [...] "business trip", <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a possible episode connection to the museum. He initially wanted Lisa to find a [...] "missing link" [...] skeleton, and do an episode reminiscent of the Scopes Monkey Trial. Writer George Meyer convinced him instead to have the focus be on an angel skeleton, while keeping {{an emphasis on the}} conflict between religion and science. Both Cohen and Meyer acknowledged how silly the [...] "angel skeleton" [...] idea was owing to simple questions raised such as why an angel died and why bones were left behind, but they went forward with the idea anyway.|$|E
500|$|After a {{short address}} by Prabhupada, Ginsberg sang [...] "Hare Krishna" [...] to {{the accompaniment of}} sitar, tambura, and drums, {{requesting}} the audience to [...] "ust sink into the sound vibration, <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> peace." [...] Then Prabhupada stood up and led the audience in dancing and singing, as the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Moby Grape joined the chanting and accompanied the mantra with their musical instruments. The audience eagerly responded, playing their own instruments and dancing in circles. The group chanting continued for almost two hours, and concluded with the swami's prayers in Sanskrit while the audience bowed down on the floor. After Prabhupada left, Janis Joplin took the stage, backed by Big Brother and the Holding Company, and continued the event with the songs [...] "The House of the Rising Sun" [...] and [...] "Ball 'n' Chain" [...] late into the night.|$|E

500|$|Woodroof begins {{selling the}} {{drugs on the}} street and at gay nightclubs. He comes back into contact with Rayon, with whom he reluctantly sets up {{business}} since she can bring many more clients. The pair establish the [...] "Dallas Buyers Club", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. He gradually begins to respect Rayon <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her as a friend. When Woodroof has a heart attack caused by a recently acquired dose of interferon, Dr. Sevard learns of the club and the alternative medication. He is angry that it is interrupting his trial, while Richard Barkley of the FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Dr. Saks agrees that there are benefits to AIDS medicine buyers clubs (of which there are several around the country) but feels powerless to change anything. The processes that the FDA uses to research, test and approve drugs is seen as flawed and a part of the problem for AIDS patients. Dr. Saks and Woodroof strike up a friendship.|$|E
500|$|It is {{time for}} farewells, with the Stark family having to split apart. Ned's two daughters journey with their father to the capital. Jon Snow {{journeys}} to join his uncle Benjen {{as a man of}} the Night's Watch at the Wall. Tyrion, who wants to see the [...] "edge of the world", accompanies them. Before leaving, Jon gives a sword to his sister Arya as a present. Lady Catelyn Stark is devastated by her husband's imminent departure and has stood vigil beside her son Bran since his fall. Having always deeply resented Jon, Catelyn asks him to leave when he comes to say goodbye to Bran and then chastises her husband Ned for leaving her and giving in to the demands of King Robert. Before they part, Jon asks Ned about his mother, and Ned promises to tell Jon about her the next time they meet. While stopping for a meal, Robert tells Ned that he has received word about Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo and voices concern about the possibility of Viserys crossing the Narrow Sea with a Dothraki army to overthrow him with help from those in the Seven Kingdoms who still support the Targaryens' claim to the throne <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Robert as a usurper.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt's {{essay on}} Hamlet was later used by David Bromwich in an {{extensive}} comparison of Coleridge's and Hazlitt's critical views in general. Although, to Bromwich, Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet contained {{a greater number}} of original ideas, including the general assessment of Prince Hamlet's character, Hazlitt's view is notable in that it does not, like Coleridge, reduce that character to a single dominating flaw, his inability to act. In one of his lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge claimed that [...] "Shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth that action is the chief end of existence—that no faculties of intellect, however brilliant, can be considered valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes, if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action, and lead us to think <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> doing, until the time has elapsed when we can do anything effectually." [...] Hazlitt, on the other hand, instead of applying this moral, pointed to the necessity of each reader's identifying with Hamlet to understand him (which, he believed, occurred more readily than with any other of Shakespeare's characters) and the reader's judging of Hamlet in part {{on the basis of what}} that reader then saw in himself. This made it unlikely that Hamlet's entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson.|$|E

500|$|Horch, who had {{remained}} a devoted follower of the Roeriches since his acceptance of their spiritual quest {{as his own}} in 1923, [...] started to fall out with them for unclear reasons. The Roeriches maintained that Horch's motives were base: through guile and deception they said he had taken control of the Master Building, closed the cultural institutions it contained, and severed them and their associated from everything connected with the building and its contents. Horch countered that the Roeriches had improperly attempted to countermand his decisions as building owner {{and director of the}} cultural organizations it contained. He said they had shown bad faith when they asserted that they alone could receive and interpret the commands of the supreme being whom they all worshiped. On June 8, 1935, he wrote Helena Roerich to say he feared that the Roeriches had lost confidence in himself and his wife Nettie. Then, on July 13, 1935, Nettie wrote Helena of her and Horch's [...] "fourteen years of complete devotion in heart and in deed" [...] and of their enduring [...] "loyalty and selfless sacrifice" [...] over that period. She reaffirmed their [...] "flaming devotion" [...] which they continued to hold in their hearts. And she said the Roeriches' attempt to exert unilateral control over their affairs had caused them to [...] "contemplate, review <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> matters in a new light." [...] These letters explain actions that Horch took on June 5, 1936, to sever relations between the Institute and the other cultural organizations housed at the Master Building and discharge all their employees. The employees who occupied rent-free apartments were told to vacate immediately.|$|E

50|$|Eyre draws {{inspiration}} {{from what is}} unseen, and images from her dreams. She describes her work as involving the accumulation of impossible memories in an increasingly deliberate and meticulous documenting of an unreality.  While discarding her everyday life, she instead documents an invisible one and constructs an autobiography that depends less on truth than possibility. In exploring these issues of self-identity, Eyre takes a wholly intuitive approach to art-making <b>and</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> her photographs as automatisms. She <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> her art as a healing process {{that can be used}} as we become increasingly alienated from our bodies and selves through advanced technology. She hopes that through her personal art she can become more connected. Janieta is more interested in exploring inner lives <b>and</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> her photographic practice as a sort of meditation.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2013, {{to commemorate}} the 70th anniversary of the incident, the University of Central Lancashire held a symposium.

2500|$|A schoolhouse {{was built}} in the churchyard in 1688, but was {{demolished}} in 1824. The present churchyard contains the hollow trunk of a 1000-year-old yew, held together by chains, and the war grave of a Royal Field Artillery soldier of World War I. The lych gate is a memorial to those who fell in World WarI and is inscribed [...] "Ye who live on, mid-English pastures green. Remember us <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> what might have been".

Some players will play it first on [...] and then go to play it on Vita and enjoy it for seeing that alternate version because it does differ so much. I don't think of the [...] as being the definitive version, just another version." ...|$|E
