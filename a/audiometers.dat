The fieldwork for the Research is carried out on behalf of RAJAR by specialist research contractors, currently Ipsos Mori. The sampling point framework is undertaken by RSMB Ltd. The diary based system is the most common method of measuring radio audiences worldwide.

In the US, employers must provide preventative measures and protection for employees who experience 85 dB or more, over an 8-hour time weighted average. [...] The audio units also contain fit test equipment so that employees who wear respirators (such as dust masks and supplied air masks) are tested to see whether they are physiologically capable of using the equipment without injury and that the equipment properly fits. There are strict health and safety standards and regulations surrounding the occupational use of Personal Protective Equipment at work including respirators.|$|E

5000|$|Stevens {{was born}} at Panteg, Monmouthshire. He was educated at West Monmouth School, University College, Cardiff (obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in physics in 1927) and Jesus College, Oxford (obtaining a further Bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences in 1929). He started working for the Radio Corporation of America {{and then as a}} {{salesman}} for a manufacturer of electrical hearing aids. As he considered that the products he was selling were inadequate, he set up his company (Amplivox) to make better hearing aids. He designed the world's first wearable electronic hearing aid: the microphone went on the lapel, the amplifier went in the jacket pocket and the earphone was small enough not to need a headband. [...] Eventually, as technology improved, Stevens created a hearing aid that was small enough to fit completely in the outer ear. His hearing aids were used by Winston Churchill (who was Stevens's personal client), amongst others. He also designed <b>audiometers</b> and acoustic equipment such as protective communication headsets and helmets. He also had a comprehensive collection of aids to hearing, spanning 400 years. Stevens married Kathleen James in 1933; they had three sons, one of whom is Lord Stevens of Ludgate. [...] Stevens died on 29 January 1995.|$|E

The Telessaúde (TS) audiometer is a low-cost, software-based, and easy-to-use piece of equipment for conducting audiometric screening. Aim: To evaluate the TS audiometer for conducting audiometric screening. Methods: A prospective randomized study was performed. Sixty subjects, divided into {{those who did not}} have (group A, n = 30) and those who had otologic complaints (group B, n = 30), underwent audiometric screening with conventional and TS <b>audiometers</b> in a randomized order. Pure tones at 25 dB HL were presented at frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. A "fail" result was considered when the individual failed to respond to {{at least one of the}} stimuli. Pure-tone audiometry was also performed on all participants. The concordance of the results of screening with both <b>audiometers</b> was evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of screening with the TS audiometer were calculated. Results: For group A, 100 % of the ears tested passed the screening. For group B, "pass" results were obtained in 34. 2 % (TS) and 38. 3 % (conventional) of the ears tested. The agreement between procedures (TS vs. conventional) ranged from 93 % to 98 %. For group B, screening with the TS audiometer showed 95. 5 % sensitivity, 90. 4 % sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values equal to 94. 9 % and 91. 5 %, respectively. Conclusions: The results of the TS audiometer were similar to those obtained with the conventional audiometer, indicating that the TS audiometer can be used for audiometric screening...|$|E
