Clupea {{contains}} three species: the Atlantic herring (the type species) {{found in}} the north Atlantic, the Pacific herring {{found in the}} north Pacific, and the <b>Araucanian</b> <b>herring</b> found {{off the coast of}} Chile. Subspecific divisions have been suggested for both the Atlantic and Pacific herrings, but their biological basis remains unclear.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Araucanian</b> <b>herring</b> is a {{commercial}} species, largely used for fishmeal. Based on the FAO fishery statistics, {{it was the}} 12th most important capture fish species in 2009. All reported landings are from Chile.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Araucanian</b> <b>herring,</b> Clupea bentincki, is a {{fish species}} in the Clupea genus of the Clupeidae family. It is an epipelagic fish, silvery below and dark blue above, which schools in coastal waters off {{the west coast of}} South America. There it filter feeds on smaller {{plankton}} such as diatoms. It reaches sexual maturity when it is about 10 centimetres long, and is a pelagic spawner, spawning between June and November.|$|E
30|$|The main {{marine species}} in {{worldwide}} capture over years were {{the families of}} Gardidae (Alaska Pollock, Atlantic Cod, Blue Whiting, Pacific Cod), Engraulidae (Anchoveta, Japaneese Anchovy), Scombridae (Skipjack Tuna, Chub Mackerel, Yellowfish Tuna, Atlantic Mackerel, Seerfishes Nei), Clupeidae (Sardinellas Nei, Atlantic Herring, European Pilchard, <b>Araucanian</b> <b>Herring,</b> European Sprat, Pacific Herring), Carangidae (Scads Nei), Trichiuridae (Largehead Hairtail), Ommastrephidae (Humboldt Squid, Argentine Shortfin Squid), Nemipteridae (Threadfin Breams Nei), Scomberesocidae (Pacific Saury), Portunidae (Gazami Crab), Akiami Paste Shrimp (FAO 2016). Worldwide, the most important fish families farmed in aquaculture are Cyprinidae (Carp), Salmonidae (Salmon, Trout), Serranidae (Seabass), Acipenseridae (Sturgeon), Scophthalmidae (Turbot), Sparidae (Sea Bream), Mytilidae (Mussels), Ostreidae (Oysters) and some families of clams (European Comission 2012). Thus, due to the abundance of aforeisaid species in worldwide fishing production, an attention must be paid on better utilization of a big amount of by-products rested after their processing.|$|E
