5|$|Catherine's {{three sons}} reigned {{in an age}} of almost {{constant}} civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and <b>anger,</b> <b>to</b> hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E
5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> Initiative Thirteen.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war in 1970, some ethnic {{violence}} has persisted. There has subsequently been a period of relative harmony since the Federal Government introduced tough new measures against religious violence in all affected parts of the country. The 2002 Miss World pageant was moved from Abuja to London in the wake of violent protests in the Northern part of the country that left more than 100people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after Muslims in the country reacted in <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> comments made by a newspaper reporter. Rioters in Kaduna killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital.|$|E
5|$|Confident that he {{was being}} {{targeted}} by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season. In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of <b>anger,</b> <b>to</b> deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken. Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{assigned}} Norway's Hans Rønning as {{the referee}} for this game. The assignment was made {{based on his}} neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials {{were not on the}} ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> rise between both teams.|$|E

25|$|Counterproductive work {{behavior}} (CWB) can {{be defined}} as employee behavior that goes against the goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result {{from a wide range of}} underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft). It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., <b>anger)</b> <b>to</b> job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.|$|E
25|$|Driven {{to despair}} by poverty, starvation, and the atrocities {{suffered}} {{at the hands}} of the khan, his subjects are restless. It seems there is enough fuel in their <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> start the fire of revolt. They need a spark to light the fire. But the khan feasts. Neighbor-feudal lords get together in his palace. Wishing to show his generosity, Hasan khan decides to present one of his guests with a horse. He orders his wrangler Ali bring the best horse from the herd. But unfortunately Ali has driven the herd off to the fields and it is impossible to carry out khan's order. Khan becomes furious and orders Ali to be blinded.|$|E
25|$|He also {{declined}} Generaladmiral Carls' {{desire for a}} breakout through the more southerly Faroe Islands-Iceland gap. As usual, he gave no explanation for any change in operational direction. While the ice-flooded regions of northern Iceland and the Denmark Strait could be easily patrolled by the enemy, as believed by Carls, it offered lower-visibility conditions, giving him much needed cover. Nevertheless, he continued to frustrate his junior officers. Meteorologist Heinz Externbrink suggested increasing speed {{to keep up with}} the fast-moving cloud affording him cover. Lütjens declined without comment, and Externbrink vented his <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> , the most senior officer to survive the operation. Despite his intentions, the British were alerted to the task force's operation by the Swedes, Norwegian Resistance and aerial reconnaissance.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the coup}} d'état of Leguía by the troops {{under the command}} of Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro, the treaty was made public and caused much <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> the Peruvian {{population}} which deemed that the treaty awarded Colombia a section of Peruvian territory. This dispute over the Amazon region controlled by the city of Leticia would eventually cause a short war between Colombia and Peru between 1932 and 1933. The conflict over Leticia, which was populated by both Peruvian and Colombian colonists, was resolved after Sanchez Cerro was assassinated and the new Peruvian president Óscar R. Benavides accepted the Rio de Janeiro Protocol which upheld the Salomón–Lozano Treaty and finally {{put an end to the}} border disputes between Colombia and Peru.|$|E
25|$|Australians {{reacted to}} the event with {{widespread}} shock and horror, and the political effects were significant and long-lasting. The federal government led state governments, some of which (notably Tasmania itself and Queensland) were opposed to new gun laws, to severely restrict the availability of firearms. While surveys showed up to 85% of Australians 'supported gun control', many people opposed the new laws. Concern was raised within the Coalition Government that fringe {{groups such as the}} 'Ausi Freedom Scouts', the Australian League of Rights and the Citizen Initiated Referendum Party, were exploiting voter <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> gain support. After discovering that the Christian Coalition and US National Rifle Association were supporting the gun lobby, the government and media cited their support, along with the moral outrage of the community to discredit the gun lobby as extremists.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the proposed radical changes began with the Protests of the Parlement of Paris addressed to Louis XVI in March 1776, in which the Second Estate, the nobility, resisted the {{beginning of}} certain reforms that would remove their privileges, notably their exemption from taxes. The objections made to the Parlement of Paris were {{in reaction to the}} essay, Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses ("Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth") by Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. The Second Estate reacted to the essay with <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> convince the king that the nobility still served a very important role and still deserved the same privileges of tax exemption {{as well as for the}} preservation of the guilds and corporations put in place to restrict trade, both of which were eliminated in the reforms proposed by Turgot.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of Donald Trump as the 45th. President of the United States of America caught European polity completely off-guard {{with the majority}} of the political, financial & bureaucratic elite having openly come out in support of Hillary Clinton and making disparaging statements about Donald Trump during the US Presidential Campaign period. Brussels has listed the US as posing an existential threat to the EU. Immigration, trade and geopolitical policies unveiled by the Trump administration have provoked reactions ranging from <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> dismay amongst longstanding US allies. Donald Trump has stated that the United Nations and NATO are obsolete in their current form and has threatened to withhold US Government funding and review obligations unless both institutions are revamped to alleviate the financial burden on US-taxpayers and modernize themselves to represent the geopolitical realities of the 21st.century. Statements from Presidential advisors and senior administration officials indicate that President Trump is indifferent {{to the future of the}} European Union and the Euro currency.|$|E
25|$|Among Toledo’s {{initiatives}} {{designed to}} generate revenue and transform the economy were plans to privatize national industries. The first major effort {{of this kind}} was the $167 million sale of two state-owned electric companies. Protests {{in the city of}} Arequipa turned violent as Peruvians reacted with <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> the prospect of layoffs and higher priced electricity. They also recalled that billions of dollars earned from privatization under the Fujimori administration had ended up filling the president’s personal bank accounts. Toledo decided not to carry out the sale of electric companies, but promised to continue privatization efforts, which were a key provision of a deal struck with the International Monetary Fund. Toledo had promised to bring in US$700 million through privatization in 2001 and US$1 billion in 2002. Although he failed to meet these goals, the IMF approved a $154 million disbursement to Peru in December 2002 and allowed the country to raise the fiscal deficit target in its agreement.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{real threat}} to the Royal Navy began with the Second Naval Law. During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the Germans greatly sympathized with the Boers, whom they {{considered}} a racially and culturally akin people. In January 1900, British cruisers on patrol detained three German mail steamers {{off the coast of}} Africa to search them, suspecting them of carrying materiel to the Boers. Although the British quickly apologized, the Germans were outraged, and Admiral von Tirpitz took advantage of the <b>anger</b> <b>to</b> introduce a new naval bill, which passed through the Reichstag with very little opposition on June 20 of that year. This law doubled the size of the fleet from 19 to 38 battleships; two flagships, four battle squadrons of eight battleships each, and four reserve battleships were to be constructed over seventeen years, from 1901 to 1917. This law made clear that not only was the German Navy to be a powerful battle fleet instead of a coastal defence force (in the process turning Germany into the second-strongest naval power in the world), but that the primary opponent of this enlarged fleet was to be the United Kingdom.|$|E
