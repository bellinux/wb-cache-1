5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via <b>arachnoid</b> granulations. These are outpouchings of the <b>arachnoid</b> mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the <b>arachnoid</b> mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the <b>arachnoid</b> mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} <b>arachnoid</b> membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle <b>arachnoid</b> mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the <b>arachnoid</b> mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E
40|$|Current high {{resolution}} Magellan data enables more detailed geological study of <b>arachnoids,</b> first identified by Barsukov et al. as features {{characterized by a}} combination of radar-bright, concentric rings and radiating lineations, named 'arachnoids' {{on the basis of their}} spider and web-like appearance. Identification of <b>arachnoids</b> in Magellan data has been based on SAR images, in keeping with the original definition. However, there is some overlap by other workers in identification of <b>arachnoids,</b> corona (predominantly bright rings), and novae (predominantly radiating lineations), as all of these features share some common characteristics. Features used in this survey were chosen based on their classification as <b>arachnoids</b> in Head et al. 's catalog and on SAR characteristics matching Barsukov et al. 's original definition. The 259 <b>arachnoids</b> have been currently identified on Venus, all of which were considered in this study. Fifteen <b>arachnoids</b> from different regions, chosen for their 'type' characteristics and lack of deformation by other regional processes, were studied in depth, using SAR and altimetric data to map and profile these <b>arachnoids</b> in an attempt to better determine their geologic and altimetric characteristics and possible formation sequences...|$|R
50|$|<b>Arachnoids</b> are {{so named}} because they {{resemble}} a spider's web, featuring several concentric ovals surrounded by a complex network of radial fractures {{similar to those of}} a nova. It is not known whether the 250 or so features identified as <b>arachnoids</b> actually share a common origin, or are the result of different geological processes.|$|R
50|$|Much of what {{is known}} about <b>Arachnoids</b> is the result of studies {{performed}} by C.B. Dawson and L.S. Crumpler.|$|R
5|$|Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} (SAH) is bleeding {{into the}} subarachnoid space — {{the area between}} the <b>arachnoid</b> membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever, and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In {{about a quarter of}} people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger bleed.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the <b>arachnoid</b> granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and <b>arachnoid</b> layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E

40|$|An updated map is {{presented}} {{which shows the}} distribution of more than 200 channels and valleys on Venus. A large number of channels are concentrated in equatorial regions characterized by highlands, rift and fracture zones, an associated volcanic features.

More than half of the sinuous rilles are associated with coronae, coronalike features, or <b>arachnoids.</b> Corona volcanism driven by mantle plume events may explain this association. Many valley network are observed in highlands and in association with coronae, coronalike features, or <b>arachnoids.</b> This indicates that highlands and coronae provided fractures and flow-viscosity lavas, both of which seem to be required for network formation by lava sapping processes.

5|$|The CSF {{occupies}} the subarachnoid space (between the <b>arachnoid</b> mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around {{and inside the}} brain and spinal cord. It fills the ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, {{as well as the}} central canal of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|The {{developing}} forebrain {{surrounds the}} neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within {{it becomes a}} ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF. The CSF quickly fills the neural canal. <b>Arachnoid</b> villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.|$|E
5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via <b>arachnoid</b> granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E
50|$|Other unique {{features}} of Venus's surface are novae (radial networks of dikes or grabens) and <b>arachnoids.</b> A nova is formed when {{large quantities of}} magma are extruded onto the surface to form radiating ridges and trenches which are highly reflective to radar. These dikes form a symmetrical network around the central point where the lava emerged, where {{there may also be}} a depression caused by the collapse of the magma chamber.|$|R
50|$|Some 150 {{northern}} muriquis (Brachyteles <b>arachnoids)</b> {{live today}} at the Fazenda Montes Claros, near Caratinga. It {{is one of their}} last refuges. The muriqui is the largest monkey of the Americas {{and one of the most}} endangered primates of the world. Specialists cite the biological importance of the Fazenda Montes Claros, where three other primate species live along with the muriqui: the buffy headed marmoset, the black-capped capuchin and the brown howler monkey.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known animals fully {{adapted to}} terrestrial conditions appear during the Mid Silurian, including the millipede Pneumodesmus. [...] Some evidence also suggests {{the presence of}} predatory trigonotarbid <b>arachnoids</b> and myriapods in Late Silurian facies. Predatory invertebrates would indicate that simple food webs were in place that included non-predatory prey animals. Extrapolating back from Early Devonian biota, Andrew Jeram et al. in 1990 suggested a food web based on as yet undiscovered detritivores and grazers on micro-organisms.|$|R
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the <b>arachnoid</b> mater and pia mater.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} <b>arachnoid</b> cysts is not known. Researchers {{believe that most}} cases of <b>arachnoid</b> cysts are {{developmental}} malformations that arise from the unexplained splitting or tearing of the <b>arachnoid</b> membrane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Arachnoid</b> cysts are {{cerebrospinal}} fluid covered by arachnoidal cells and collagen that may develop between {{the surface of}} the brain and the cranial base or on the <b>arachnoid</b> membrane, one of the 3 meningeal layers that cover the brain and the spinal cord. <b>Arachnoid</b> cysts are a congenital disorder, and most cases begin during infancy; however, onset may be delayed until adolescence.|$|E
5000|$|The nerubians are {{intelligent}} <b>arachnoids</b> (a race of spider-like creatures) {{native to}} Northrend.

Several nerubians were resurrected by the Lich King to serve for the Scourge, including their former king, Anub'arak. Some living Nerubians, not under the Lich King's command, exist as insurgents in the tunnels around their former capital, Azjol-Nerub.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{analysis}} of data from the Magellan Mission, we have compiled a global survey of the location, dimensions, and subsidiary notes of all identified volcanic features on Venus. More than 90 percent of the surface area was examined and the final catalog comprehensively identifies 1548 individual volcanic features larger than approximately 20 km in diameter. Volcanic features included are large volcanoes, intermediate volcanoes, fields of small shield volcanoes, calderas, large lava channels, and lava floods as well as unusual features first noted on Venus such as coronae, <b>arachnoids,</b> and novae...|$|R
40|$|The {{outer layers}} of the Venusian {{lithosphere}} appear to dissipate heat from the interior through mantle-driven thermal anomalies (hot spots, swells). As a result, Venus exhibits diverse forms of thin-skin tectonism and magmatic transfer to and extrusion from countless numbers of volcanic centers (e. g., shields, paterae, domes) and volcano-tectonic complexes (e. g., coronae, <b>arachnoids).</b> What {{is known about the}} distribution and morphologies of major Venusian shields is summarized, and the evidence for possible structural control of major accumulations as long as 5000 km of small volcanic domes is described...|$|R
25|$|In some cases, <b>arachnoid</b> cysts {{occurring}} in the middle fossa are accompanied by underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or compression of the temporal lobe. The exact role that temporal lobe abnormalities play {{in the development of}} middle fossa <b>arachnoid</b> cysts is unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the Venusian {{surface is}} {{relatively}} flat; it {{is divided into}} three topographic units: lowlands, highlands, and plains. In the early days of radar observation the highlands drew comparison to the continents of Earth, modern research has shown that this is superficial and the absence of plate tectonics makes this comparison misleading. Tectonic features are present to a limited extent, including linear [...] "deformation belts" [...] composed of folds and faults. These may be caused by mantle convection. Many of the tectonic features such as tesserae (large regions of highly deformed terrain, folded and fractured in two or three dimensions), and <b>arachnoids</b> (for those features resembling a spider's web) are associated with volcanism.|$|R
40|$|It {{is unknown}} how shield fields form on Venus or even whether they form via similar processes. By observing {{features}} surrounding these shield fields, associations {{may be made}} to origin processes. 165 shield fields (of approximately 650) were analyzed for spatial relationships between structural lineations (ridges, rifts and grabens), other volcanic features and impact structures. It was found that 100 % of the shield fields were within 100 km of structural features, 73 % were within the structural features, 67 % were near other volcanic features, 30 % were near or within coronae, <b>arachnoids</b> or stellate fractures and 10 % were near impact features. These results are interpreted to show a common relationship of shield field formation to structural features...|$|R
50|$|In October 1983, Venera 15 and Venera 16 entered polar orbits around Venus. The images had a 1-2 {{kilometre}} (0.6-1.2 mile) resolution, {{comparable to}} those obtained by the best Earth radars. Venera 15 analyzed and mapped the upper atmosphere with an infrared Fourier spectrometer. From November 11, 1983 to July 10, 1984, both satellites mapped the northern third of the planet with synthetic aperture radar. These results provided the first detailed understanding of the surface geology of Venus, including the discovery of unusual massive shield volcanoes such as coronae and <b>arachnoids.</b> Venus had no evidence of plate tectonics, unless the northern third of the planet {{happened to be a}} single plate. The altimetry data obtained by the Venera missions had a resolution four times better than Pioneers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} some {{observations on the}} anatomy of the neotropical katydid Arachnoscelis arachnoides Karny (In-secta: Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). Arachnoscelis is a genus of predaceous katydids that comprise species that resemble spi-ders in their general body appearance. The type species, A. <b>arachnoids,</b> was described in 1891 from a single male collected in Colombia. Following the original description, these creatures were never found again, and were thought to have gone extinct or mistakenly assigned to the type locality. But between 1891 and 2012 four more species were described and in-correctly assigned to Arachnoscelis based on a similarity of body form. In this paper we present an anatomical comparai-son of Arachnoscelis and its relatives, and propose that Arachnoscelis {{should be treated as}} a monotypic genus. This implies that other species previously described in Arachnoscelis, should be placed in different genera. Copyright Â© 2013 Magnolia Press...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} a global survey of Magellan data covering over 90 percent of the surface and designed to document the characteristics, location, and dimensions of all major volcanic features on Venus has revealed over 1660 landforms and deposits. These include over 550 shield fields (concentrations of small volcanos less than 20 km in diameter), 274 intermediate volcanos between 20 and 100 km diameter {{with a variety of}} morphologies, 156 large volcanos in excess of 100 km diameter, 86 calderalike structures independent of those associated with shield volcanos and typically 60 - 80 km in diameter, 175 coronae (annulus of concentric ridges or fractures), 259 <b>arachnoids</b> (inner concentric and outer radial network pattern of fractures and ridges), 50 novae (focused radial fractures forming stellate patterns), and 53 lava flood-type flow fields, and 50 sinuous lava channels (all of which are in excess of 10 (exp 2) - 10 (exp 3) km in length). The near-global coverage of Magellan data analyzed in this study confirms and extends the results of earlier observations that showed that volcanism is a widespread and significant process on the surface of Venus for the period of time in the presently observed record (less than about the last one billion years) ...|$|R
40|$|Venus has an unmoving lithosphere, a young surface {{indicative}} of volcanic resurfacing, {{and a wide}} variety of volcanic and tectonic features. The planet s ubiquitous magmatic features include 100, 000 small shield volcanoes as well as the descriptively named pancakes, ticks, and <b>arachnoids</b> [1]. Coronae, volcanic and tectonic features up to 2, 600 km in diameter, have been attributed to lithospheric interactions with upwelling plumes [e. g., 2], but more recently to delamination of the lower lithosphere with [3] or without [4] a central upwelling. Lavas issuing from different volcanic features appear to have a range of compositions, as evidenced by their apparent viscosities and by data from Soviet landers. Steep-sided or "pancake" domes [e. g., 5] appear to consist of more viscous magma [6], perhaps silicic compositions created by remelting basaltic crust [7]. These steep-sided domes are associated with coronae and with shield volcanoes effusing basaltic magmas [7, 8] with apparently low viscosities (low enough to allow fluid flow for hundreds of km, creating channels reminiscent of water rivers on Earth). Pancake domes, in contrast, can be up to 3 km in height and have volumes from 30 to approx. 3, 000 km 3 [calculated from data in 8], and hundreds dot the planet [6 - 8]...|$|R
