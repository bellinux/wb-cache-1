5000|$|The Airline was insured by Aviation Insurance Co., a {{representative}} of Lloyd's of London. Coverage included <b>aircraft</b> <b>liability,</b> property damage, bodily injury to passengers, and damage to passenger's property. Several of the passenger's families sued the airline, but later reluctantly settled for $35,000 per passenger. The mother of Mary McNamara later stated that [...] "I feel badly about it, but we couldn't go through any more. Answering all those questions... They (attorneys for the insurance company) made us feel like she was someone who rented a room from us. I cannot tell you what she meant to me.

40|$|The paper aims {{to analyze}} the Romanian {{insurance}} market in 2011 {{from the perspective of}} gross written premiums on non-life insurance classes, using principal component analysis technique (PCA) and cluster analysis in order to classify the 30 insurance companies by the most important components obtained by PCA. The empirical results showed that <b>aircraft</b> <b>liability</b> insurance, accident and sickness insurance, liability insurance for ships, insurance of legal expenses and the general liability insurance and surety ship insurance explain best the evolution of the insurance market. Grouping companies after the first two principal components, <b>aircraft</b> <b>liability</b> insurance, accident and sickness insurance, which recovers about 53 % of the total variance of the original variables, can highlight three classes of companies: Astra, Allianz-Tiriac and Omniasig. The cluster analysis indicates the existence of four classes of companies: City Insurance, Astra, Groupama Insurances and the rest...|$|E

5000|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Cessna Chairman Russ Meyer and GAMA President Ed Stimpson, the industry pressured Congress, for several years, to enact limits on <b>aircraft</b> manufacturers' product <b>liability.</b> The proposed legislation became known as the [...] "General Aviation Revitalization Act (GARA).|$|R

40|$|Just like in surface {{vehicular}} travel, {{the inevitability}} of collisions between aircraft, {{and the growth of}} the incidence thereof, is equally accepted in air transportation. The necessity of regulating the legal obligations resulting from such incidents, in a convention level, in order to obviate the application of the various domestic laws on the matter which do not contain standard liability provisions, among other things, was long felt. Such need stems from the economic policy obtaining in international air law to define, regulate and limit an <b>aircraft</b> operator's <b>liability</b> from catastrophic losses that usually results from a single aviation accident, and extend reasonable protection to the rights of end-users, including innocent third parties, who may have suffered injury or sustained damage as a result of aircraft operations...|$|R

40|$|The final {{thesis of}} my PhD journey {{concerns}} {{an issue that}} is part of the Air Law. In particular, it addresses the issue of liability for damage to third parties on the ground surface, caused by aircraft flights. After framing the institute, the analysis begins with examining the sources. These are mainly formed by uniform regulations, and the resulting adjustment to the same by the internal regulations. It proceeds with the deepening of aspects characterizing the institution. Which involves, the nature and the conditions of the obligation for compensation, the qualification of the harmful event, the type of liability where the damage determines the start with the related assumptions exclusion and compulsory insurance expected in relation to the institute, with the related method of determination and limitation. The first part of the paper concludes with the examination of the draft revision of the uniform rules. These are inspired by the need to balance the refund of the possible damage with the needs of civil aviation security and stability, also considering increase by specific episodes that can cause such damage. In order to better clarify the characteristics of the institution object of analysis, the second part of the work raises the relative discipline in connection with a number of other issues, in respect of which we highlight the relative similarities and differences. It is, in principle the responsibility regarding the noise determined by the flight of aircraft, the responsibility for collision of aircraft, the peculiar rules established in relation to the equipment used for pleasure or sports flight, military <b>aircrafts</b> and the <b>liability</b> arising from damage caused by space objects...|$|R
40|$|Broadly speaking, 2 ̆ 2 {{space tourism}} 2 ̆ 2 denotes any {{commercial}} activity that offers customers {{direct or indirect}} experience with space travel. 1 Such activities have many different designs, ranging from long-term stays in orbital facilities to short-term orbital or suborbital flights, and even parabolic flights in an aircraft exposing passengers to short periods of weightlessness. 2 Flights into outer space by private individuals are finding increased attention in the public. While there are not yet chartered flights, occasional orbital flights with 2 ̆ 2 space tourists 2 ̆ 2 have taken place. So far, five 2 ̆ 2 space tourists 2 ̆ 2 {{have been taken to}} the International Space Station (2 ̆ 2 ISS 2 ̆ 2), all of whom were charged large sums of money for the experience. The fifth 2 ̆ 2 tourist, 2 ̆ 2 Charles Simonyi, recently flew to the ISS in April 2007. 3 However, interest seems to be shifting to providing 2 ̆ 2 cheaper flights 2 ̆ 2 which are not aimed at the ISS but remain 2 ̆ 2 suborbital 2 ̆ 2 so that they are affordable for a somewhat broader public. Yet, even with such short-term flights, a space tourist has different options. One option, modelled after SpaceShipOne, 4 uses an aircraft to lift a space cabin to a certain altitude. The cabin then separates from the aircraft and continues its suborbital flight to higher altitudes. There are two possibilities for return when this method is used: (a) the space vehicle returns to where it started from, or (b) it returns to a different location on Earth (2 ̆ 2 space transportation 2 ̆ 2). A second option, which is modelled on the 2 ̆ 2 Delta Clipper Experimental, 2 ̆ 2 5 uses a rocket with a space capsule on top which is launched, and then the capsule separates from the rocket at a certain altitude. As a result, the passengers of the space capsule are exposed to Zero-G gravity and both vehicles return to Earth independent from each other. It is expected that Blue Origin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 New Shepard 2 ̆ 2 will use this method. 6 2 ̆ 2 Space tourism 2 ̆ 2 activities may thus include the use of an aircraft and/or spacecraft. Depending on where such activities actually take place, either air law or space law, or even both, may apply. The two legal regimes have historically evolved independently from each other and accordingly show some major differences. A variety of legal issues regarding the conduct of space tourism activities arise as a result. This Article focuses on some of the most problematic issues of relevance such as the delimitation of airspace and outer space, authorization to conduct space tourism, registration of the <b>aircraft</b> or spacecraft, <b>liability</b> to passengers and third parties, and the status of passengers. Regarding air law, there are comprehensive regulations for passenger transportation in both international and national law. International space law, however, does not yet contain detailed regulations of passenger transport. In terms of national space laws, the United States was the first country to include specific reference to 2 ̆ 2 space flight participants 2 ̆ 2 in its national space law. Even if these U. S. regulatory activities are only of national character, however, they may indicate a tendency toward the regulation of space tourism activities on both the international and the national level. In this respect, {{it is interesting to note}} that on January 26, 2007, the Swedish government announced an agreement with Virgin Galactic concerning mid-summer and mid-winter flights of Virgin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 SpaceShipTwo 2 ̆ 2 from Sweden 2 ̆ 7 s spaceport in Kiruna. 7 Their Memorandum of Understanding calls for Swedish authorities to prepare a regulatory regime modelled on that of the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration (2 ̆ 2 FAA 2 ̆ 2). 8 Accordingly, a closer look at the respective recent U. S. regulatory initiatives seems most interesting. 9 When examining these legal aspects, the question naturally arises whether existing laws are sufficient for future space tourism activities, or whether new international legal instruments or an amendment to an existing law or legal structure will become necessary...|$|R
