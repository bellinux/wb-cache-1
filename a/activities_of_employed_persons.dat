30|$|To {{calculate}} the average actual hours worked and {{the volume of}} work, the number <b>of</b> gainfully <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> is calculated and their structure is considered.

The quarterly and annual figures stem from the Employment Accounts (cf. Lüken 2012). As there is no specific subdivision in the Employment Accounts according to working time, one fundamental element of the AZR is the allocation of employees into part-time or full-time employees. For calculating the part-time rate, different statistics are combined in the AZR.|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of depression in}} the Australian workforce is unknown. Epidemiological surveys (e. g., the National Health Survey and National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing) do not routinely include a depression scale and within the mental health field, few studies focus on depression and employment groups specifically. Although {{the inclusion of a}} direct measure of depression in  national surveys is preferable, the {{prevalence of}} depression may be inferred from short screening scales of general mental health. In this paper, scores on the  General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) and the Kessler psychological distress scale (K 10) for a sample <b>of</b> <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> were mapped onto the CES-D (Iowa) measure of depression. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the  recommended GHQ- 12 cut-off point is appropriate for estimating work-related depression prevalence. However, the cut-off point on the K 10 (the short-scale  currently used in Australian national surveys) may need to be substantially  reduced if scores on the K 10 are to be used to identify workers at risk of  depression. The routine inclusion of a direct depression measure in national  surveys is recommended, particularly considering the number <b>of</b> <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> in Australia and large proportion of the sample classified as depressed in this study. <br /...|$|R
