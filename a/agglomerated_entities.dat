40|$|The {{comparability}} {{was tested}} of three aerosol "spectrometers", {{used in a}} program for monitoring the spectra of fine and ultrafine particles in three European cities. Droplets of sebacate, solid ammonium sulfate and agglomerates of elemental carbon {{were used in the}} tests, representing the major chemical and structural types of particles encountered in urban aerosol. Particles in the ultrafine range (10 - 100 nm) are sized by electrical mobility (SMPS, DMPS and EAS) and the "spectrometers" gave very similar size distributions for these aerosols. The integrated number concentrations were on average within 20 % of the directly measured total number concentrations. Particles with a size between 0. 1 and 2. 5 mum, in which most of the volume/mass is concentrated, are being differently classified in the three "spectrometers", respectively, with a low- and a high-flow LAS-X, and field charging in the EAS. The agreement between the three instruments in this size range was less good, which was partly caused by signal overload in the high-flow optical sizer, which was solved using a larger threshold. A complication occurred with the elemental carbon, which was composed of highly <b>agglomerated</b> <b>entities.</b> Particles, sized by the mobility instrumentation as being in the range of 100 - 400 nm, were not detected by the optical sizers. Volume (spectra) for ammonium sulfate deduced from the number spectra were compared with the mass (spectra) obtained with cascade impacters. The comparison was good for the LAS-Xs; the EAS overestimated volume/mass. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceComets are {{composed}} of dust and frozen gases. The ices are mixed with the refractory material either as an icy conglomerate 1, or as an aggregate of pre-solar grains (grains that existed prior {{to the formation of}} the Solar System), mantled by an ice layer 2, 3. The presence of water-ice grains in periodic comets is now well established 4, 5, 6. Modelling of infrared spectra obtained about ten kilometres from the nucleus of comet Hartley 2 suggests that larger dust particles are being physically decoupled from fine-grained water-ice particles that may be aggregates 7, which supports the icy-conglomerate model. It is known that comets build up crusts of dust that are subsequently shed as they approach perihelion 8, 9, 10. Micrometre-sized interplanetary dust particles collected in the Earth’s stratosphere and certain micrometeorites are assumed to be of cometary origin 11, 12, 13. Here we report that grains collected from the Jupiter-family comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko come from a dusty crust that quenches the material outflow activity at the comet surface 14. The larger grains (exceeding 50 micrometres across) are fluffy (with porosity over 50 per cent), and many shattered when collected on the target plate, suggesting that they are <b>agglomerates</b> of <b>entities</b> in the size range of interplanetary dust particles. Their surfaces are generally rich in sodium, which explains the high sodium abundance in cometary meteoroids 15. The particles collected to date therefore probably represent parent material of interplanetary dust particles. This argues against comet dust being composed of a silicate core mantled by organic refractory material and then by a mixture of water-dominated ices 2, 3. At its previous recurrence (orbital period 6. 5 years), the comet’s dust production doubled when it was between 2. 7 and 2. 5 astronomical units from the Sun 14, indicating that this was when the nucleus shed its mantle. Once the mantle is shed, unprocessed material starts to supply the developing coma, radically changing its dust component, which then also contains icy grains, as detected during encounters with other comets closer to the Sun 4, 5...|$|R
40|$|A classificação dos linfomas não-Hodgkin tem sido, ao longo dos últimos trinta anos, motivo de controvérsia. Várias classificações têm sido propostas em busca de um consenso entre patologistas e clínicos. Este trabalho teve como objetivo analisar criticamente três destas classificações através do estudo retrospectivo de 145 casos de linfomas primários de gânglio linfático selecionados do Serviço de Anatomia Patológica do Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho, entre 1979 e 1995. Os casos revistos foram classificados pelas propostas da Working Formulation, de Kiel e da Real. Testes imunoistoquímicos com os anticorpos anti-CD 45, anti-CD 20, anti-CD 45 RO e anti-CD 30 foram realizados. Cento e sete casos (73, 7 %) apresentaram fenótipo B; 33 casos (22, 7 %), fenótipo T; e quatro casos foram nulos (linfoma anaplásico de grandes células). Foi possível prever o fenótipo pela morfologia em 89, 4 % dos casos. Os linfomas de alto grau predominaram (59, 2 %), sendo o linfoma centroblástico o de maior freqüência (31, 7 %). Os linfomas foliculares representaram 29 casos (20 %), com maior incidência dos de grandes células (31 %) do que dos de pequenas células (27, 5 %). Quando comparadas as três classificações, observamos que determinados grupos da Working Formulation abrigam múltiplas entidades. Isto se deve ao fato de a classificação da Working Formulation ser baseada somente em achados morfológicos e, por isso, deve ter seu uso desaconselhado. Já a classificação de Kiel e a da Real devem ter o seu emprego estimulado, pois apresentam, além de uma boa análise histopatológica, um estudo imunológico que define entidades biológicas correlacionando-se, quando possível, com a célula de origem. The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas classifications {{have been}} a {{controversial}} reason for the last thirty years. Many classifications have been proposed trying to achieve a consensus among pathologists and clinicians. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyse critically three of these classifications by the retrospective study of 145 cases of lymph nodes primary lymphomas, selected from the department of Pathology of the Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho between 1979 and 1995. The revised cases were classifiedby the proposal of Working Formulation, Kiel and Real. Immunohistochemical detections were employed with antibodies anti-CD 45, anti-CD 20, anti-CD 45 RO and anti-CD 30. One hundred and seven cases (73. 7 %) showed B phenotype; thirty three cases (22. 7 %), T phenotype and 4 cases were null (anaplastic large cell lymphomas). It was possible to predict the phenotype by the morphology in 89, 4 % of the cases. The high grade lymphomas predominated (59. 2 %), and the centroblastic lymphoma was more frequent (31. 7 %). The follicular lymphomas account for 29 cases (20 %), the large cell type (31 %) have more incidence than the small cell type (20 %). Comparing the three classifications, we observed that certain Working Formulation's groups <b>agglomerate</b> multiple <b>entities.</b> This occurs because it is based only on morphologic characteristics, hence should not be used. Kiel and Real classifications should have their employ stimulated because they present a good histopathologic analysis, a immunologic study that defines biologic entities correlating, whenever possible, with the postulated normal counterpart...|$|R
40|$|The direct partial {{oxidation}} {{of methane}} to oxygenates still {{remains one of}} the greatest challenges in catalysis. Metal-containing zeolites hold great potential for the direct partial oxidation of methane to oxygenates. The nature of the active sites in these materials is, however, still a matter of debate and has been addressed in this PhD thesis for Cu-ZSM- 5 and Co-ZSM- 5 zeolites. For activated Cu-ZSM- 5 zeolites the CT band at 22700 cm- 1 is linearly related to the metal loading and to the activity of the samples for the production of methanol from methane and oxygen. Thus, a quantitative structure-performance relationship between the CT band intensity and the amount of methanol produced has been established. The presence of at least two copper species was observed and confirmed by UV-Vis-NIR DRS, TEM and FT-IR measurements. Part of the copper is present as Cu-O nanoclusters on the outer surface. Based on catalytic experiments and FT-IR measurements of adsorbed pivalonitrile we showed that Cu-O species on the outer surface are inactive for methanol production. A minor part of copper is present inside the microporous channels as visualized by FT-IR of adsorbed NO after pivalonitrile adsorption, which most likely gives rise to the CT band at 22700 cm- 1. These copper species inside the zeolite channels are involved in the oxidation of methane to methanol. In addition, {{for the first time the}} possibility to partially oxidize methane to methanol and formaldehyde at low temperature over Co-ZSM- 5 using air is shown. The influence of the preparation method on the nature of the cobalt species is investigated. The catalytic activity and selectivity for methane oxidation as a function of the cobalt speciation is additionally discussed. Based on UV-Vis-NIR and FT-IR spectroscopy, H 2 -TPR, TEM and kinetic measurements it is concluded that cobalt in ion-exchange positions results mainly in the formation of formaldehyde, while larger Co-oxide particles prepared by impregnation result in the formation of methanol. Often zeolites for methane oxidation consist of small crystals <b>agglomerated</b> to larger <b>entities</b> of typically > 2 ?m. This might hamper the accessibility of the active sites in the zeolite/zeolite aggregates and merits a more detailed investigation. Therefore, the role of pore accessibility on the catalytic performance of Co-ZSM- 5 zeolites for the production of oxygenates from methane has been investigated. Alkaline treatment of templated Na-ZSM- 5 zeolites with NaOH solutions resulted in the creation of intercrystalline mesopores within the zeolite agglomerates, while preserving the micropore volume and crystallinity. It was found that the zeolite external surface area increased with increasing NaOH concentration and pretreatment time. These alkaline treated samples were loaded with cobalt and a linear relationship between the number of cobalt oxidic species and the external surface area of the zeolite could be established. This in turn leads to a linear relationship between the ZSM- 5 surface area and the amount of methanol produced over Co-ZSM- 5 from methane and oxygen. Attempts to remove extra framework alumina species by an acid treatment were successful. However, this acid treatment increased, after Co-deposition, the amount of highly dispersed Co 2 + inside the ZSM- 5 channels, which resulted in a higher selectivity towards formaldehyde...|$|R
