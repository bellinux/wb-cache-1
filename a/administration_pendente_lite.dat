5000|$|<b>Pendente</b> <b>lite</b> is a Latin term meaning [...] "awaiting the litigation" [...] or [...] "pending the litigation" [...] which {{applies to}} court orders {{which are in}} effect while a matter (such as a divorce) is pending. In divorce a <b>pendente</b> <b>lite</b> order {{is often used to}} provide for the support of the lower income spouse while the legal process moves ahead. For more {{elaboration}} on how <b>pendente</b> <b>lite</b> works, see the Tanzanian statute [...] "The Probate and Administration of Estates Act Cap 352 Revised Edition 2002", especially Section 38.|$|R

50|$|The {{relief sought}} {{in such a}} case is not final, but merely interim. It may be {{corrected}} or reversed at a later stage, and is invariably granted <b>pendente</b> <b>lite.</b> For this reason, the test is not as stringent as when final relief is sought; in fact, it favours the applicant.|$|R
50|$|The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA) is an {{independent}} appellate judicial body authorized by Congress and established by the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force pursuant to the exclusive authority under (a). The Court hears and decides appeals of United States Air Force court-martial convictions and appeals <b>pendente</b> <b>lite.</b> Its appellate judges are assigned to the Court by The Judge Advocate General.

50|$|The modern {{concept of}} alimony {{is derived from}} English ecclesiastical courts that awarded alimony in cases of {{separation}} and divorce. Alimony <b>pendente</b> <b>lite</b> was given until the divorce decree, based on the husband's duty to support the wife during a marriage that still continued. Post-divorce or permanent alimony was also based {{on the notion that}} the marriage continued, as ecclesiastical courts could only award a divorce a mensa et thora, similar to a legal separation today. As divorce did not end the marriage, the husband's duty to support his wife remained intact.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Pendente</b> <b>lite</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with lis pendens. Lis pendens also means [...] "a pending lawsuit", but lis pendens is a document filed in the public records of the county where particular real property is located stating that a pending lawsuit may affect the title to the property. Because nobody wants to buy real estate if its ownership is in dispute, a lis pendens notice effectively ties up the property until the case is resolved. Lis pendens notices are often filed in divorce actions when there is disagreement about selling or dividing the family home.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 September 2007, Benazir Bhutto accused Pervez Musharraf's {{allies of}} pushing Pakistan to crisis by refusal to restore {{democracy}} and share power. A nine-member panel of Supreme Court judges deliberated on 6 petitions (including Jamaat-e-Islami's, Pakistan's largest Islamic group) for disqualification of Musharraf as presidential candidate. Bhutto stated that her party may join other opposition groups, including Nawaz Sharif's. Attorney General of Pakistan Malik Mohammed Qayyum stated that, <b>pendente</b> <b>lite,</b> the Election Commission was [...] "reluctant" [...] {{to announce the}} schedule for the presidential vote. Bhutto's party's Farhatullah Babar stated that the Constitution could bar Musharraf from being elected again because he holds the army chief's post. [...] "As Gen. Musharraf is disqualified from contesting for President, he has prevailed upon the Election Commission to arbitrarily and illegally tamper with the Constitution of Pakistan." ...|$|R
5000|$|Today alimony {{is known}} as [...] "maintenance" [...] or [...] "spousal support." [...] Unlike child support, there is a set formula to {{calculate}} spousal support <b>pendente</b> <b>lite</b> (pending the litigation), {{but there is no}} post judgment formula. A grant of spousal support depends on {{the facts of the case}}, such as the disparity between the income of the parties, the duration of the marriage, the health of the parties, and the presence of very young children. In New York, spousal support is rarely granted on a permanent basis, except in cases of physical or mental disability or when the parties are elderly (about 60 years old or older). Generally, it is granted for a set period of time so the other party can get back on their feet after the termination of the marriage. The length of time depends on the facts of the case as the judge sees fit to award.|$|R
60|$|In this {{unity and}} {{indivisibility}} of possession are sunk ten immense and wealthy provinces, full of strong, flourishing, and opulent cities, (the Austrian Netherlands,) {{the part of}} Europe the most necessary to preserve any communication between this kingdom and its natural allies, next to Holland the most interesting to this country, and without which Holland must virtually belong to France. Savoy and Nice, the keys of Italy, and the citadel in her hands to bridle Switzerland, are in that consolidation. The important territory of Liege is torn out of {{the heart of the}} Empire. All these are integrant parts of the Republic, not to be subject to any discussion, or to be purchased by any equivalent. Why? Because there is a law which prevents it. What law? The law of nations? The acknowledged public law of Europe? Treaties and conventions of parties? No,--not a pretence of the kind. It is a declaration not made in consequence of any prescription on her side,--not on any cession or dereliction, actual or tacit, of other powers. It is a declaration, <b>pendente</b> <b>lite,</b> {{in the middle of a}} war, one principal object of which was originally the defence, and has since been the recovery, of these very countries.|$|R
40|$|The role {{which the}} private {{litigant}} {{plays in the}} enforcement of the antitrust laws, either by an action to recover treble damages or to enjoin antitrust violations, is of increasing importance. As these actions become more frequent, additional problems are raised. One such problem is the use of a unilateral refusal to deal as a deterrent to the effective use of the treble damage suit by the private litigant. Two recent parallel cases have dealt with the question of allowing temporary injunctive relief where the defendant has refused to deal with a plaintiff asking for treble damages. In House of Materials, Inc. v. Simplicity Pattern Co., the Second Circuit denied injunctive relief in the above situation, whereas in Bergen Drug Co. v. Parke, Davis 2 ̆ 6 Co., the Third Circuit granted the injunction <b>pendente</b> <b>lite.</b> The purpose of this comment is to examine these recent cases {{in the light of the}} interest protected and the propriety of injunctive relief. Since the two cases involve similar situations but reach different results, a close examination and comparison of their facts and a discussion of the possible implications of their holdings is required. Before analyzing the narrow question involved, it is first necessary to examine the existing law in the general area of refusals to deal, and in the particular area of the simple unilateral refusal to deal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of the {{transfer}} of interest in the context of litigation, which occurs with reasonable frequency in commercial law. The transfer of interest after pendency arises when a litigant assigns his rights or obligations to a third party while the action is pending. This is illustrated by the following short example: A – the owner of some jewelry – brings a suit against B, claiming the restitution of the jewelry, which he lent to B. During the lawsuit, B sells the jewelry to C and tells him about the pending lawsuit, and that A had sold the jewelry to him. However, transfer of interest is not only employed when an individual litigant transfers an asset; it is also relevant in a corporate context when a business organization merges or dissolves <b>pendente</b> <b>lite.</b> As a result, another legal entity is created and, thus, becomes the successor. In this example, the question arises how different legal systems treat the problem of transfer of interest. The answers vary and give cause for shedding more light on the respective rules in a civil law country like Germany, whose procedures are characterized as “inquisitorial,” and a common law country, like the U. S., whose procedure is described as “adversarial. ” The procedural rules concerning the transfer of interest play a considerable role in modern civil procedure and interestingly have not been subject to any comparative analysis so far. This article will analyze the different concepts of transfer of interest. It will focus on the various criteria for substitution and its effects. Furthermore, it will discuss the central objectives of the rules and differences in the legal cultures. Cite as: 19 Annl. Survey Int 2 ̆ 7 l. Comp. L. 301 (2013) ...|$|R
