5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (<b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot)</b> in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is the formation of <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, {{is caused by the}} detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E

5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in a vein, is a common {{cause of death in}} breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> that becomes {{lodged in the}} pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E

5|$|In December 2012 Clinton {{was hospitalized}} {{for a few}} days for {{treatment}} of <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in her right transverse venous sinus. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. <b>A</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E

5|$|This event {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of the Lethal Lockdown and Xscape matches, which became annually held matches at future Lockdown events. During the event, Chris Candido received an injury during his tag team match with Lance Hoyt against Apolo and Sonny Siaki, which later led to Candido's death from <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> as a result of surgery for the injury. Jason Clevett of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the event a 6 out of 10, two marks lower than the 2006 event's ranking by Chris Sokol.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the vertebral artery, which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot,</b> thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E

TNA planned a thirty-minute pre-show prior to the event, featuring Shark Boy versus David Young for {{a spot in the}} Twenty-Man Gauntlet for the Gold to take place during the telecast. TNA opened the show with a ten-bell salute to TNA wrestler Chris Candido, who died on April 28, 2005 due to <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> from surgery to fix an injury sustained at TNA's previous PPV event Lockdown on April 24, 2005.|$|E

50|$|Blood testing may be {{done before}} the biopsy {{to ensure that there}} is no {{evidence}} of infection or <b>a</b> <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> abnormality. Further, <b>an</b> ultrasound or other imaging study of the kidney may be performed before biopsy to exclude structural problems of the kidney, which may theoretically increase the risk of the procedure. These include hydronephrosis, pre-existing arteriovenous fistula in the kidney, cystic kidney disease and small, shrunken kidneys.|$|R
