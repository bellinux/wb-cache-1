40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was a comphensive {{assessment}} of the food of pikeperch fry in the monoculture rearing from the stage of summer fry to the stage of <b>autumn</b> <b>fry</b> in ponds with three different types of management and assessment of the influence of individual treatments for pikeperch production. The experiment was performed in small ponds in experimental facility of FFPW in Vod≈àany. The variants of pond treatment were: a) ponds with additional prey fish (fry of common carp (C. carpio) and grass carp (C. idella)), b) ponds with installed substrate from heather, c) control variant without any support of natural food of pikeperch. All treatments had four repetitions. Rearing of pikeperch fry lasted 97 days. In all treatments, the opportunistic food strategy of pikeperch fry was recorded during the whole period of rearing and the main recorded food was macrozoobenthos, especially insect larvae. Bigger species of zooplankton had also been often found in the stomachs of pikeperch. Considerable development of macrozoobenthos in all experimental ponds was probably caused by the presence of submerged macrophytes. Thus, this factor made harder to estimate influence of installed substrates from heather for production of pikeperch fry and composition of its food. In the treatment with prey fish, the total length (F (9. 450) = 91. 1; p < 10 - 3) and weight (F (9. 450) = 61. 9; p < 10 - 3) of pikeperch fry were for the whole period of rearing significantly higher in comparison to the other treatments. In addition, the survival of pikeperch in the treatment with prey fish reached to 56 - 92, 4 % at the end of rearing. In the treatment with substrate from heather, the total length and weight of pikeperch was significantly higher in comparison to the control treatment only in the first term of sampling. In the rest of pikeperch fry rearing period were the values comparable or higher in control treatment. Thus, for the rearing of pikeperch from the stage of summer fry to the stage of <b>autumn</b> <b>fry</b> is appropriate to stock prey fish in ponds. In comparison to installation of artificial substrate, the diversity of water environment, which is subsequently able to provide sufficiently wide natural food for reared pikeperch, seems to be more decisive...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of estimating {{the distribution and}} abundance of 0 -group fish {{by a combination of}} echo surveying and fishing experiments with pelagic trawl and purse seine is discussed. The existence of scattering layers, their origin, and the identification of sound scatterers are discussed with special reference to observations made in recent years off northern Norway and in the Barents Sea. The scattering layers observed in late summer and autumn in this area consist mainly of 0 -group fish of which herring, cod and haddock are most important. The transport of the larvae from the spawning places in relation to the current systems is described. The observations indicate that during August to October fish fry are abundant in the surface layers of the north and east going currents, {{and by the end of}} <b>autumn</b> the <b>fry</b> are aggregated along the frontiers between the cold and warm water masses covering the area from Spitsbergen to Bear Island and further to the east and south over the central and south-eastern parts of the Barents Sea. The relation between echo signals received from scattering agents distributed at a constant depth and the amount of scatterers is discussed, as well as the effect of variations in depth distribution. Special attention is paid to the signal strength received from targets uniformly distributed in a layer or school of wide horizontal distribution. The needs for theoretical as well as empirical studies of the relationship between the amount of echo signals received and the abundance of sound scatterers are stressed. The first results of charting the echo-abundance distribution are presented. For this purpose an electronic echo-integrator was developed to measure exactly the signal voltages received. Some preliminary data on the relationship between echo-abundance and the catch of fish fry with purse seine are also given...|$|R
60|$|IT {{was late}} June, almost July, when Corey {{took up his}} life in Boston again, where the summer slips away so easily. If you go out of town early, it seems a very long summer {{when you come back}} in October; but if you stay, it passes swiftly, and, seen {{foreshortened}} in its flight, seems scarcely a month's length. It has its days of heat, when it is very hot, {{but for the most part}} it is cool, with baths of the east wind that seem to saturate the soul with delicious freshness. Then there are stretches of grey westerly weather, when the air is full of the sentiment of early <b>autumn,</b> and the <b>frying,</b> of the grasshopper in the blossomed weed of the vacant lots on the Back Bay is intershot with the carol of crickets; and the yellowing leaf on the long slope of Mt. Vernon Street smites the sauntering observer with tender melancholy. The caterpillar, gorged with the spoil of the lindens on Chestnut, and weaving his own shroud about him in his lodgment on the brick-work, records the passing of summer by mid-July; and if after that comes August, its breath is thick and short, and September is upon the sojourner before he has fairly had time to philosophise the character of the town out of season.|$|R
