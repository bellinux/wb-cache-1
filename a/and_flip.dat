5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E
5|$|The Griffins, the Swansons, and Quagmire {{prepare for}} a road trip, ostensibly for a {{vacation}} in Maine. Quagmire distracts Bonnie and Lois as Peter alters course to Virginia instead. The group arrives at a bar in Stoolbend, Virginia, and discover that it was Cleveland who told the bartender the joke. Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo told it to him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots out one of the car's tires, causing it to spin out of control <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive at a Washington hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of the joke. He races away on a handcart through Washington. Losing track of Sal, they are soon captured by several men in black suits who pistol-whip them until they are unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

In addition, a two-door sedan (coupé) with a thin B-pillar <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> out rear side windows was available in 1967 only, and a convertible was offered in 1967 and 1968.|$|E
25|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, an FSM may be built using a {{programmable}} logic device, a programmable logic controller, logic gates <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> flops or relays. More specifically, a hardware implementation requires a register to store state variables, {{a block of}} combinational logic that determines the state transition, and a second block of combinational logic that determines the output of an FSM. One of the classic hardware implementations is the Richards controller.|$|E
25|$|Godard became {{interested}} in making a 3D film in 2010 and asked Aragno to make some camera tests. Aragno was dissatisfied {{with the results of}} professional 3D cameras and built his own custom rigs using Canon 5Ds <b>and</b> <b>Flip</b> Minos. Aragno broke many of the standard rules for 3D cinematography. Godard and Aragno worked on the film for four years, each shooting footage independently before officially beginning production with the actors. Godard edited a 2D version of the film before he and Aragno perfected the 3D cut with color correction and surround sound.|$|E

25|$|Note that v {{does not}} {{represent}} the velocity that magnetic fields lines travel through the conductor. The magnetic field pattern observed depends on the frame of reference. They have no velocity on their own. To illustrate, imagine that one were to take a magnet <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> it 180 degrees. The result of assuming that these field lines actually have velocity of their own would be that magnetic field lines far away would swing to the other side, potentially faster {{than the speed of}} light, however, that is not what happens.|$|E
25|$|Divac had {{an unusual}} style {{compared}} to most other centers of his generation: despite his height, he possessed good mobility, had good {{control of the}} ball, and was a decent shooter. On occasion, he would also act as a play maker. His trademark moves included a mid-range shot {{at the top of}} the key <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> shots around the rim, while facing the complete opposite direction. His quirky moves complemented how he liked playing gags on the court: in the 1989 EuroBasket, he lifted teammate Zoran Radović for a slam dunk. In just four professional seasons in Europe, he became the most sought-after big man on the continent, after Arvydas Sabonis.|$|E

25|$|An edge {{violation}} {{occurs when}} a skater executes a jump on the incorrect edge. The hollow is a groove {{on the bottom of}} the blade which creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater, the outside edge is on the side farthest from the skater, and a flat refers to skating on both edges at the same time, which is discouraged. An unclear edge or edge violation is indicated with an 'e' and reflected in the GOE according to the severity of the problem. Flutz and lip are the colloquial terms for a Lutz <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> jump with an edge violation.|$|E
25|$|The Floor Flipper - The Third Wars onwards - A {{powerful}} pneumatic flipper {{set into}} the floor, capable of throwing a robot across the arena. It was generally only used on robots {{that had already been}} defeated, but was occasionally fired during events such as the House Robot Rebellion. When originally introduced, it just looked like a part of the arena floor. For The Fourth Wars the flipper was given a yellow/black paint scheme similar to the redesigned Pit of Oblivion. For Extreme 1/Series 5 the power of the flipper increased, allowing it to hurl even the heaviest robots into the air, <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> featherweight robots out of the arena. For Series 8, this is no longer used as a coup de grace for defeated robots, but fires independently during a fight. It is positioned diagonally on the floor, and is capable not only of launching robots into the air but also trapping robots as it closes.|$|E

He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that {{it has something to}} do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at my ideas <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E

Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the series premiere four out of four stars, commenting that it was as [...] "involving as any new drama and funnier than any new sitcom [...] matches high visual style with a witty-but-never arch sensibility." [...] He highlighted the performances of the six leading actresses, writing, [...] "Individually, each is terrific; combined, they're an irresistible feminine force", and praised Hatcher's [...] "revelatory performance." [...] Bianco also noted that Cherry avoided making the pilot campy.

[...] However, he praised Cherry's writing {{as well as the}} acting, declaring, [...] "There are almost too many things to love in 'Desperate Housewives.'"

500|$|After a brief {{run as a}} {{face that}} saw him {{defeating}} Chris Benoit at No Mercy, Triple H reverted to his heel persona and restarted his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when it emerged that Triple H had paid off Rikishi to run down Austin at Survivor Series, causing {{him to take a}} year off. While in the storyline Triple H said he had done it in order to shield Austin from the WWF Championship and end his career, in reality Austin's previous neck injuries started bothering him again, forcing him to have surgery. In November 2000, Triple H and Austin had a match at Survivor Series that ended when Triple H tried to trick Austin into coming into the parking lot to run him over again, only to have Austin lift his car up with a forklift <b>and</b> <b>flip</b> the car onto its roof 10feet high. Triple H returned a few weeks later to attack Austin, and their feud continued into 2001 and ended in a Three Stages of Hell match in which Triple H defeated Austin. In 2001, Triple H also feuded with The Undertaker, who defeated him at WrestleMania X-Seven. The night after WrestleMania, Triple H interfered in a steel cage match between Austin (who had just won the WWF Championship) and The Rock where he joined forces with Austin and double teamed on The Rock, forming a tag team called The Two-Man Power Trip. Triple H then defeated Chris Jericho for his third Intercontinental Championship on the April 5 SmackDown!, and won it for a fourth time two weeks later by defeating Jeff Hardy. Triple H then became a world tag team champion by winning the WWF Tag Team Championship {{for the first time at}} Backlash when he and Austin defeated Kane and The Undertaker in a [...] "Winner Take All" [...] tag team match.
