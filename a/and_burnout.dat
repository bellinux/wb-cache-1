40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to measure the degree of job stress <b>and</b> job <b>burnout</b> in the Post Company and identify the relationship between job stress <b>and</b> job <b>burnout.</b> Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper presents an overview of the concept of job stress <b>and</b> job <b>burnout.</b> The research is descriptive, analytical and cross-sectional. It was conducted on 200 employees of the Post Company of I. R. Iran in 2010 using Osipow job stress questionnaire <b>and</b> Geldard job <b>burnout</b> questionnaire; a demographic questionnaire was also developed. Osipow job stress questionnaire consisted of six stress-inducing work roles including role overload, role insufficiency, role ambiguity, role boundary, responsibility and physical environment. The sample size is 200. Findings: The amount of job stress was normal (194. 20) in the sample, <b>and</b> job <b>burnout</b> had a moderate level (194. 42). The research showed that the correlation between the job stress of the Post personnel, <b>and</b> their job <b>burnout</b> in the sample was meaningful (r = 0. 58) in a level of P< 0. 0001. Moreover job stress <b>and</b> job <b>burnout</b> had no meaningful relation to demographic specifications such as age, managerial record, sex, and education, and income.

40|$|Background: Good physician-patient {{communication}} can {{favor the}} adoption of healthy lifestyle habits, which is essential in high blood pressure (BP) management. More empathic physicians tend to have lower <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> better communication skills. We analyzed the association between <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> empathy among primary care physicians and nurses and investigated the influence on BP control performance. Methods: Descriptive study conducted in 2014 investigating <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> empathy levels in 267 primary care physicians and nurses and BP control data for 301, 657 patients under their care. We administered the Maslach <b>Burnout</b> Inventory <b>and</b> the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy and defined good BP control as a systolic BP < 130 mmHg. Results: Low <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> high empathy were observed in 58. 8 % and 33. 7 % of practitioners, respectively. <b>Burnout</b> <b>and</b> empathy were significantly negatively associated (p < 0. 009).

2500|$|Nursing {{professionals}} work in {{a stressful}} environment. According to a report conducted at Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network (LVHHN), nurses {{are at high risk}} for chronic burnout and stress. The nurse's roles are regarded as stress-filled based upon physical labor, human suffering, work hours, staffing, and interpersonal relationships. Work stress <b>and</b> <b>burnout</b> are significant concerns on both an individualistic and an organizational level. On an individualistic level, stress symptoms can contribute to health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. On an organizational level, work stress may lead to absenteeism and turnover, which impedes on the quality of care. According to a 2016 National Healthcare Retention & RN Staffing Report published by NSI Nursing Solutions, the national average turnover rate among nurses is 17.2%, a 0.8% increase from 2014. During the study, 27 nurses voluntarily participated in an 8-week-stress-reduction program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Data analyses revealed that the MBSR program had significant benefits that could be categorized into two. “The early weeks of the training program conveyed that benefits were related to increased relaxation, slowing down, feeling a sense of peace, and learning to be in the present moment." [...] Results in the late weeks of the training program were linked to self-acceptance, self-awareness and self-care.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Tracking and {{addressing}} police members' effectiveness {{in areas that}} could impact on the standard of their services is important. <b>Burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement are specific focus areas in this regard. To measure <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement, {{it is important to}} use reliable and valid instruments. However, {{there is a lack of}} empirical research systematically investigating police <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement in South Africa, as well as serious limitations, including poorly designed studies, a lack of sophisticated statistical analyses and poorly controlled studies. Furthermore, South Africa is a multicultural society <b>and</b> therefore, when <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement measures are applied to different cultural groups, issues of equivalence and bias become important. Because a lack of South African norms exists for the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS) and Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), it is difficult to identify <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement. Therefore, it is important to determine norms for the levels of <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement that could serve as reference for police officers in the South African Police Service (SAPS). It also seems relevant to consider differences in <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement between different demographic groups as well as between the different provinces in South Africa. Furthermore, it appears as if job stressors and coping strategies may be related to <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement. However, no studies were found that included these factors in a causal model of burnout or work engagement in police officers in South Africa The objectives of this research were to standardise the MBI-GS and the UWES for the SAPS and to determine equivalence and bias for each instrument, to determine norms and demographic differences between <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagement levels and to test a causal model that could explain the role of job stress <b>and</b> coping in <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> work engagementDoctora...|$|R

2500|$|According to a {{study on}} spirituality and {{performance}} in organizations, the increase in corporate meditation programs can also be linked to a complex paradigm shift in the structure and system of organizations. The changes in management include a shift from an economic focus to a balance of profits, quality of life, spirituality and social responsibility concerns. For the past 300 years, the mechanical paradigm shaped the economy where the main corporate objectives were to satisfy shareholders by increasing competition and exploitation. The new emerging business paradigm is called the [...] "Spiritual Movement" [...] and moves away from a materialistic to a more spiritual orientation. In this new paradigm, a company's competitive advantage resides in how much it invests in its human capital and the qualities of its employees. The shift in business paradigm's {{can be explained by}} the fact that the business world is more competitive, globalized and fast-pace than ever. The boundaries between work and home are blurred, where work has become central to people's lives and employees can be connected to their work whenever. The increase in the importance of work has led to an increase in stress <b>and</b> <b>burnout.</b> The workplace is a place where employees spend most of their lives, develop friendships, create value and make meaningful contributions to society. This means that they are looking for satisfaction beyond work. According to a report on emerging cultures, the shift in paradigm can also be explained by American demographics. [...] "The American adult population is divided into three groups, each with a different set of values and view of the world." [...] The [...] "Cultural Creatives," [...] whom constitute 24% of US adults are the newest and increasingly growing worldview. [...] "Their values align with ecological sustainability, globalism, women's issues, social conscience, self-actualization and spirituality".

This review aimed to examine the problem of <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> well-being in mental healthcare staff and to present recommendations for future research and interventions. A discursive review was undertaken examining trends, causes, implications, <b>and</b> interventions in <b>burnout</b> <b>and</b> well-being in healthcare staff working in mental health services.
