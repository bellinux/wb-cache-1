500|$|According to the musicologist Walter Everett, Sgt. Pepper {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote {{more than half of the}} album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. He would from this point on provide the artistic direction for the group's releases. Sessions began on 24 November 1966 in Abbey Road Studio Two, the first time that the Beatles had come together since September. Afforded the luxury of a nearly limitless recording budget, they booked open-ended sessions that allowed them to work as late as they wanted. They began with three songs that were thematically linked to their childhoods: [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] and [...] "Penny Lane". The first session saw the introduction of a new keyboard instrument called the Mellotron, the keys of which triggered tape-recordings of a variety of instruments, enabling its user to play keyboard parts using those voices. McCartney performed the introduction to [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] using the flute setting. The track's complicated production involved the innovative splicing of two takes that were recorded in different tempos and pitches. Emerick remembers that during the recording of Revolver, [...] "we had got used to being asked to do the impossible, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the word 'no' didn't exist in the Beatles' vocabulary." [...] In Martin's opinion, Sgt. Pepper [...] "grew naturally out of Revolver", marking [...] "an era of almost continuous technological experimentation".|$|E

For war, billions more, but no more for the poor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1972, Englehart and writers Gerry Conway and Len Wein crafted a metafictional {{unofficial}} crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein, as well as Wein's first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. Beginning in Amazing Adventures #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in Justice League of America #103 (by Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in Thor #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema). As Englehart explained in 2010, [...] "It certainly seemed like a radical concept <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{we had to be}} subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It's really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back — it didn't matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel — I think it was us being creative, thinking what would be really cool to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking in San Francisco to the California Commonwealth Club of California on March 27, 2008, Mukasey defended President Bush's {{program of}} {{wiretapping}} calls between Americans and suspected foreign terrorists without court authorization, and {{implied that the}} government {{might have been able}} to prevent the attacks of September 11, 2001, if it had been able to wiretap a specific call to the U.S. from Afghanistan. Before September 11, 2001, Mukasey said, [...] "We knew that there had been a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it came to the United States. We didn't know precisely where it went." [...] He paused, seemed to stifle tears or at least suppress emotion, then continued, [...] "You've got 3,000 people who went to work that day, and didn't come home, to show for that." [...] In a subsequent letter to Mukasey, House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers questioned whether any such phone call had ever actually occurred and, if so, why the government hadn't been able to use its then-existing legal authority and technological capabilities to monitor it.|$|E
