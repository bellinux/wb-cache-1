40|$|When {{interacting}} two-dimensional electrons {{are placed}} in a large perpendicular magnetic field, to minimize their energy, they capture an even number of flux quanta and create new particles called composite fermions (CFs).

However, being solely influenced by interactions, CFs should possess no memory whatever of the electron parameters.
