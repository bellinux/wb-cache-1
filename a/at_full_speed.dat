5|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} {{sighting}} the lighthouse, the ship ran aground violently <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> amongst the rocks of Maenheere Reef, {{a quarter of}} a mile off The Lizard. Suevic was about 16 miles closer to the shore than her command crew believed.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2015, divers {{found the}} wreck of the USNS Mission San Miguel (T-AO-129) within the monument. She had sunk there on October 8, 1957 when she ran aground on Maro Reef while running <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> and in ballast. Researchers will map and study the wreck in situ.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Mexico on 20 March, {{the fleet}} {{underwent}} {{three weeks of}} target practice. Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as he was completely bedridden and in constant pain, so on 30 March, Connecticut set sail north <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed.</b> She was met two days later by the schooner , which took the admiral to a hospital. Connecticut traveled back south to rejoin the fleet, and Rear Admiral Charles M. Thomas took Evans's place on Connecticut as {{the commander of the}} fleet, which continued its journey north, bound for California.|$|E
5|$|During trials, Delaware was run <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> for 24 hours {{straight}} {{to prove that}} her machinery could handle the stress. She was the first American battleship to achieve the feat. Late in 1910, Delaware sailed to Europe, followed by a trip to South America early in 1911. She made a further two voyages to Europe in 1912 and 1913, {{before returning to the}} US Atlantic Fleet for training exercises that were conducted in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. Delaware took part in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in April–May 1914.|$|E
5|$|The La-7 {{ended the}} superiority in {{vertical}} maneuverability that the Messerschmitt Bf 109G had previously enjoyed over other Soviet fighters. Furthermore, it was fast enough at low altitudes to catch, albeit with some difficulties, Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers that attacked Soviet units on the frontlines and immediately returned to German-controlled airspace <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed.</b> The Yakovlev Yak-3 and the Yakovlev Yak-9U with the Klimov VK-107 engine lacked {{a large enough}} margin of speed to overtake the German raiders. 115 La-7s were lost in air combat, only half the number of Yak-3s.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed,</b> adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed,</b> when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|New Zealands first wartime {{action was}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, {{as part of}} the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty. Beatty's ships were {{originally}} intended to provide distant support for the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast, in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks once the tide rose. When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35a.m., the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the sandbar {{at the mouth of the}} Jade estuary.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on November19, 2010 on MTV and MTV.com. and it involves Mars's efforts to sing to a woman he loves after dragging an upright piano with a rope tied to it through Los Angeles. Scenes also feature the singer singing in a dark bedroom, looking out of a rainy window. He wears a suit and encounters a gang and a pit bull along the way. When he reaches the woman's house and finds out she is with another man, he drags himself and the piano {{in front of a}} train to attempt suicide. As the train approaches Bruno <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed,</b> the video cuts to black.|$|E
5|$|The road charged 25 cents ($ {{in modern}} dollars) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches. The tolls, {{collected}} at three separate gates, primarily reflected {{the cost of}} retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; {{they were able to}} keep the road open through its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed,</b> with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10–25 hours and five changes of horses.|$|E
5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able to jump out of the train <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed.</b> The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{trolling}} motors {{are commonly}} rated by their propulsion force when running <b>at</b> motor's <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> (given in pounds thrust), {{and not by}} horsepower like gas engines, nor by electric motor characteristics such as drawn power or current.|$|R
25|$|String {{operations}} were implemented in microcode in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running <b>at</b> <b>full</b> bus <b>speed.</b> This made string operations {{about five times}} faster in the V80.|$|R
50|$|Some {{profilers}} operate by sampling. A sampling profiler probes {{the target}} program's call stack {{at regular intervals}} using operating system interrupts. Sampling profiles are typically less numerically accurate and specific, but allow the target program to run <b>at</b> near <b>full</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Throughout the day {{the chase}} continued, the British frigates gaining slowly on their quarry and as {{darkness}} fell Pique closed with the larger French ship. At 23:00 Milne {{was close enough to}} open fire on Seine, to which Bigot responded without reducing speed. For the next {{two and a half hours}} the frigates exchanged broadsides <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> as the French coastline rapidly approached ahead. At 01:35 a shot from Seine struck the main topmast on Pique, bringing it crashing down. The consequent loss of speed forced Milne back, Seine pulling away from the smaller ship but unable to escape Jason which was steadily gaining.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Glorious keel {{was laid}} down on 1 May 1915 by Harland and Wolff at their Belfast shipyard. She was {{launched}} on 20 April 1916 and completed on 14 October {{at a cost}} of £1,967,223. During her sea trials the following month, her sister Courageous sustained structural damage while running <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> in a rough head sea and had the damaged areas stiffened shortly afterwards to prevent a recurrence. Glorious did not suffer similar damage and did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Upon commissioning, Courageous served with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. After most of the 1st Cruiser Squadron was sunk at the Battle of Jutland, the squadron was re-formed with Courageous and Glorious. Glorious received six twin-tube torpedo mounts in mid-1917: one mount {{on each side of the}} mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of 'Y' turret on the quarterdeck.|$|E
50|$|In {{a charity}} legends race on March 20, 2010, Glotzbach was {{involved}} in a horrifying crash at Bristol Motor Speedway. He T-boned the driver's side of Larry Pearson <b>at</b> near <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> after Pearson spun. Both drivers suffered injuries, but none were life-threatening.|$|R

Without virtual channels, P0 would be occupying the channel, without actually using the available bandwidth (since it is being blocked).|$|R
50|$|By 2007, {{inspectors}} {{determined that}} the northern segment of the bridge needed replacement. Salt from the beach environment had rotted the wooden support beams, they had been damaged by fires set by beachgoers, the creosote protecting the beams had been worn away, and the bridge did not meet seismic standards. Trains could not travel on the bridge <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speeds,</b> and frequent bridge maintenance was costing US$250,000 per year. Construction began in 2010, and a new concrete replacement for this bridge segment opened in 2012 {{at a cost of}} eight million dollars, paid by federal funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.|$|R
5|$|Jiyuan {{was hit by}} a {{multitude}} of shells, disabling her forward-mounted Krupp gun and severely damaging all the structures above her armour belt. Captain Fang gave orders to flee <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> towards Waihaiwei, with Yoshino in pursuit. Reports differed on why Jiyuan was not overtaken by the faster Japanese cruiser, with one claim stating that Jiyuans aft mounted Krupp gun scored a hit on the bridge of the Yoshino, and another indicating that shot was fired by the Kuang Yi. While Jiyuan got away, the Kuang Yi fought against the remaining two cruisers until she was holed and sinking, at which point she was beached to allow her crew to escape. As the Tsi Yuan headed to Weihaiwei, she passed the Kowshing which was still heading to Korea. The troop ship was stopped by the Japanese, and after prolonged negotiations she was sunk with loss of a great number of the troops and crew on board.|$|E
5|$|That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season {{series against}} the Yankees. A 13-inning {{comeback}} win for the Yankees on July 1 was punctuated by a catch from Derek Jeter, who ran and dove into the stands <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> and came out with facial lacerations when Trot Nixon hit a pop up in an area deep behind third base. On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove {{into the face of}} the Yankees' Álex Rodríguez after Rodríguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodríguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11–10 come-from-behind victory. Both Rodríguez and Varitek were each suspended four games and fined $2,000 for the brawl.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E
60|$|Later on Tom persuaded Dick to ask Hans if {{he would}} not walk down to Cedarville for him, to buy him a baseball. Eager to be accommodating, the German youth {{received}} the necessary permission to leave the academy acres and hurried off <b>at</b> the <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> of his sturdy legs.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} so singular {{in the tone}} of Mrs. Felix Lorraine's voice, and so peculiar in the expression of her countenance, as she uttered these words, that the jest died on Vivian's tongue; and, for want of something better to do, he lashed the little ponies, which were already scampering <b>at</b> their <b>full</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1991 {{the vessel}} had left Liverpool 'ebb way' {{and failed to}} take the correct course downstream, turning full circle and hitting the stage <b>at</b> almost <b>full</b> <b>speed.</b> This caused circa £90,000 worth of damage to the bow {{and a number of}} {{passengers}} were attended to by ambulance crews due to falling over with the impact.|$|R
