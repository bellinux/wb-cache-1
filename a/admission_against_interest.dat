Within this body of work a debate has developed among legal scholars, practitioners, and legislators. Under traditional rules of evidence an apology which acknowledged fault would enter evidence as an <b>admission</b> <b>against</b> <b>interest.</b> Now there is a movement to legislatively 2 ̆ 2 protect 2 ̆ 2 apologies from the effects of the traditional rule in order to facilitate apology without evidentiary encumbrance. Scholars who have argued in favor of the relaxation of the traditional rule have largely relied on anecdotal evidence to support their arguments. Now, in her recent article Apologies and Legal Settlement, Professor Jennifer K. Robbennolt makes a long-overdue empirical contribution to analyses of the role of apology in settlement. Robbennolt concludes that fault-admitting apologies will indeed enhance the likelihood of settlements, and that this is true regardless of whether or not the apology is 2 ̆ 2 protected. 2 ̆ 2 This conclusion matters not only because it provides an empirical basis for the efficacy of fault admitting apologies, but also because of its attraction to legislators who like to see empirical studies before changing long-standing rules of law like the evidentiary rule in question here...|$|E
40|$|Today public apology {{is playing}} a {{positive}} role in policies centered on alternative-informal dispute resolution, due to a restorative justice model. A public gesture of apology by the wrongdoer could help to prevent litigation expecially in moral or punitive damages cases. According to a comparative perspective and a case method, the essay focuses on public apology and its proper legal effects, like <b>admission</b> <b>against</b> <b>interests,</b> moral redress, self-reputation healing...|$|R

50|$|In United States law, a {{statement}} <b>against</b> <b>interest</b> is {{a statement}} made by a person which places them in a less advantageous position than {{if they had not}} made the statement and is as a consequence deemed credible as evidence (usually within a legal trial). For example, if a driver in an automobile accident boasts publicly that they were speeding, it may represent a legal admission of liability. It is analogous to the criminal equivalent, the statement <b>against</b> penal <b>interest</b> which {{is a statement}} that puts the person making the statement at risk of prosecution. Statements <b>against</b> <b>interest</b> by parties not present at a trial may be admitted as evidence where in other circumstances they would be excluded as hearsay.|$|R

What are the means of protecting <b>against</b> <b>interest</b> risks have also been subject to analysis, although in practice it very often comes down to setting variable interest rates that are fixed by certain banks’ decision-making. The author suggests that fixed interest rates should be applied combined with the variable ones with reference parameters. In addition he deals with main features of interest swaps {{and the need for}} their application in Croatian banking, so as to guarantee the parties of the contract: (1) protection <b>against</b> the <b>interest</b> risk, (2) decrease of financing expenses, (3) stable profit and other benefits. Croatian banks may use interest swaps in order to protect their business <b>against</b> <b>interest</b> risk or as intermediaries arrange this kind of business for their clients gaining an extra profit...|$|R
