5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech. The game's gameplay had to be reworked to suit an arcade environment, and support was added for multiplayer games with up to eight linked cabinets. Triotech designed a unique reclined seating cabinet for the game, {{the aim of the}} design was to offer the player <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> and immersive experience. The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting his feet up on the desk, realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{group and}} Botnick {{organized}} a makeshift recording studio at their private rehearsal space, the Doors' Workshop, in a two-story building at 8512 Santa Monica Boulevard. They could then record in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> and relaxed setting while avoiding {{the expenses of}} a professional studio. A mixing console previously owned by Elektra was installed upstairs in the Workshop, while studio monitors, microphones, and keyboards were set up downstairs. To compensate {{for the lack of}} an isolated vocal booth, Morrison recorded in the bathroom doorway, singing into the same microphone used on the Doors' final tour.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|Back at Paramount, Cooper {{returned}} to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> genre in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938) with Claudette Colbert. In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France who {{falls in love}} with an impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife. Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert, American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. After all, it succeeded only in the European market. In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter's romantic comedy The Cowboy and the Lady with Merle Oberon, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy {{who falls in love}} with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady's maid. The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage {{what could have been a}} fine vehicle for Cooper. While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.|$|E
5|$|Passenger traffic {{started on}} 10 October 1825, after the {{required}} licence was purchased, using the Experiment coach hauled by a horse. The coach was initially timetabled {{to travel from}} Stockton to Darlington in two hours, with a fare of 1s, and made a return journey {{four days a week}} and a one-way journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In April 1826 the operation of the coach was contracted for Â£200 a year; by then the timetabled journey time had been reduced to hours and passengers were allowed to travel on the outside for 9d. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> coach, Express, started the same month and charged 1s 6d for travel inside. Innkeepers began running coaches, two to Shildon from July, and the Union, which served the Yarm branch from 16 October. There were no stations: in Darlington the coaches picked up passengers near the north road crossing, whereas in Stockton they picked up at different places on the quay. Between 30,000 and 40,000 passengers were carried between July 1826 and June 1827.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns battle system {{originated}} while ideas were being discussed for the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII, but technical limitations and problems implementing it in a party-based battle system prevented {{it from being}} used in that game. It reemerged {{when some of the}} development team wanted Lightning to change her appearance during battle, and reducing to one playable character opened up the memory space necessary for such a system to be implemented. In making the system revolve around one character, the developers ended up removing any opportunity for story scenes between party members, which was cited by Abe as its main weakness. The time limit sprang from the story concept of a world with a set time to live. When the feature was first announced, there were some who felt it was too new a thing, as a time limit was seen as a taboo in role-playing video games. The mechanic originally received negative feedback from test players who were unable to complete the game in time. In response to this, the team made adjustments so that players were given <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> amount of time. Along with sharing design elements with the previous two XIII games, the system also bears similarities to the battle system of Final Fantasy XV, although the developers said that they were not directly inspired by it.|$|E

25|$|On curves {{the outer}} rail {{may be at}} a higher level than the inner rail. This is called {{superelevation}} or cant.

25|$|The {{design of}} the VierstÃ¤nderhaus or four-post {{farmhouse}} is <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> evolutionary development of the ZweistÃ¤nderhaus built by well-to-do farmers. The building is supported by four rows of uprights arranged longitudinally, of which two form {{the sides of the}} Deele and two form the outer walls. So the outsider walls have a load-bearing function. In farmhouses of more affluent farmers there is also a clearer separation between living quarters and animal stalls.|$|E
25|$|The {{first modern}} {{corridor}} style trams, the R class, {{were introduced in}} 1933. The final order of cars was for the R1 class in the early 1950s. The R class were unable to be coupled together. The R series offered their passengers <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> ride away from the elements, and featured mostly upholstered seating. Some of these cars {{had not been in}} service long enough for a major overhaul before their withdrawal in the late 1950s and early 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Retail shops {{occur in}} a diverse range of types and in many {{different}} contextsâ from strip shopping centres in residential streets through to large, indoor shopping malls. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> shopping environment â protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of electronic-commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions) and mail order.|$|E

25|$|During the {{construction}} of the DD class, a number of changes were made. The first locomotives built featured low running plates with splashers over the driving wheels and a narrow cab. However, after 26 such examples were built the design was altered with high running plates mounted above the driving wheels and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> full-width pressed metal cab of Canadian design, a feature incorporated at the request of Victorian Railways Chief Commissioner and former Canadian Pacific Railway Transportation Manager Thomas Tait. These became hallmarks of all subsequent VR steam locomotive designs.|$|E

Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular Fronte because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located farther back, included an anti-glare dashboard and a round horn pad in the steering wheel.|$|E
