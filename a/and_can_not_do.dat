My interests are scientific: I am interested in determining if congenitally blind people have an appreciation for geometric perspective, since many people conceive of linear perspective as a purely visual phenomenon (but see Heller et al 1996). I found in earlier work that congenitally blind people did not spontaneously produce fore-shortened, tangible drawings of a board at a slant.

40|$|In my own {{thinking}} and, indeed, teaching, about {{book and}} periodical selection for any puipose whatsover it is conven-ient {{to consider the}} problem {{as a series of}} a half-dozen separ-ate but closely related decisions or judgments that have to be made, each one more specific and more personal than the one before it. Any aids, therefore, in selecting books and periodi-cals (or other materials) for a particular library should be aids to help the librarian make these decisions. The value of such help is, of course, dependent to a large extent on how intelligently, or how professionally, if you will, the librarian exploits the aids available to him. Intelligent exploitation is in turn dependent to a large extent on how well the librarian understands what the aids can <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> to help him, and on how well the aids themselves fulfill their own avowed purposes. Aids all by themselves simply can not make decisions. This paper will attempt to bring together and to describe in some detail representative and outstanding currently available aids which should be helpful to librarians in making the neces-sary decisions involved in selecting science literature for gen-eral reading, rather broadly conceived. First, briefly, here are the half-dozen decisions or judgments to be made that may be thought of as the consecutive segments of book or periodical selection: 1. What books or periodicals are being (or have been) published? 2. Of all these, which ones are in fact obtainable?

40|$|By {{examining}} how care is {{practiced in the}} community in Thailand {{from the perspective of}} people with disabilities (PWDs), this paper attempts to trace how “disability” enhances communication between PWDs and people in the community, and how it organizes the human network towards formation of a new community that shares commonality and sociality. PWDs have needs for care which the public care system does not suffi ciently support. The more severe their disability, the greater will be demand for care to meet their basic daily care needs. Therefore, most Thais with disabilities who live in a community depend on care given by family or neighbors. It is not uncommon in Thai society for family take care of a disabled member with the cooperation of a wider network of kin. In addition to family support, most PWDs can utilize inexpensive community services. Thus, PWDs live closely with people in the community. In my investigation in Thailand, however, the role of “care” is not only in providing services for PWDs. It also functions as a tool for building relationships between PWDs and people in the community, as well as among PWDs. Through the practice of care, PWDs construct new relationships and re-defi ne what they can <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do.</b> This means that disability no longer depends solely on the physical condition of PWDs, but rather that it must be defi ned as being created in the social processes involving both the PWDs and the surrounding environment. Relationships among PWDs as well as between PWDs and non-PWDs are based on the fact of “disability. ” Due to this common premise, PWDs and community members can have basic communication, and PWDs can gain care from them smoothly. In their community, PWDs manage their life and getting care by using disability as a skill of communication. Through cooperative activities of care, PWDs are creating a new community by sharing the common experience of disability and care, extending the practice of care into the public sphere...|$|E

Unfortunately, due to the power and economy of modern digital processing tools, creating convincing forgeries is relatively easy. Consequently {{there is a need}} for multimedia authentication methods to restore credibility. Various researchers have proposed techniques based on digital watermarking, cryptography, and content classification.

After introducing some possible applications to clarify the problem and discussing some previously proposed methods, we present a framework for authenticating multimedia under the title "Analog Authentication".

In addition, we analyze the fundamental limits of what <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>done</b> by any scheme.
