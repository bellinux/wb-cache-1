50|$|The most {{commonly}} used and commercially available fluorescent <b>base</b> <b>analogue,</b> 2-aminopurine (2-AP), has a high-fluorescence quantum yield free in solution (0.68) that is considerably reduced (appr. 100 times but highly dependent on base sequence) when incorporated into nucleic acids. The emission sensitivity of 2-AP to immediate surroundings is shared by other promising and useful fluorescent <b>base</b> <b>analogues</b> like 3-MI, 6-MI, 6-MAP, pyrrolo-dC (also commercially available), modified and improved derivatives of pyrrolo-dC, furan-modified bases and many other ones (see recent reviews). This sensitivity to the microenvironment has been utilized in studies of e.g. structure and dynamics within both DNA and RNA, dynamics and kinetics of DNA-protein interaction and electron transfer within DNA. A newly developed and very interesting group of fluorescent <b>base</b> <b>analogues</b> that has a fluorescence quantum yield that is nearly insensitive to their immediate surroundings is the tricyclic cytosine family. 1,3-Diaza-2-oxophenothiazine, tC, has a fluorescence quantum yield of approximately 0.2 both in single- and in double-strands irrespective of surrounding bases. Also the oxo-homologue of tC called tCO (both commercially available), 1,3-diaza-2-oxophenoxazine, has a quantum yield of 0.2 in double-stranded systems. However, it is somewhat sensitive to surrounding bases in single-strands (quantum yields of 0.14-0.41). The high and stable quantum yields of these <b>base</b> <b>analogues</b> make them very bright, and, in combination with their good <b>base</b> <b>analogue</b> properties (leaves DNA structure and stability next to unperturbed), they are especially useful in fluorescence anisotropy and FRET measurements, areas where other fluorescent <b>base</b> <b>analogues</b> are less accurate.
