5|$|The {{character}} gained further {{success with}} the popular Dimitri and Erica pairing. In 1993, viewers named them a supercouple, along with One Life to Live's Bo <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> and Days of our Lives Roman and Marlena. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly listed them among the top seventeen supercouples. Soap Opera Digest compared them to the real life couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton because of their tumultuous nature.|$|E

5|$|Copeland was {{appointed}} a soloist at ABT in August 2007, {{one of the}} youngest ABT dancers promoted to soloist. Although, she was described by early accounts as the first African American woman promoted to soloist for ABT, Anne Benna Sims <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> Kimball were soloists with ABT in the 1980s. Male soloist Keith Lee also preceded her. As of 2008, Copeland was the only African-American woman in the dance company during her entire ABT career. The only male African American in the company during her career, Danny Tidwell, left in 2005. In an international ballet community with a lack of diversity, she was so unusual as an African American ballerina, that she endured cultural isolation. She has been described in the press as the Jackie Robinson of classical ballet.|$|E
5|$|Hay {{enrolled}} at Brown in 1855. Although he enjoyed college life, {{he did not}} find it easy: his Western clothing and accent made him stand out; he was not well prepared academically and was often sick. Hay gained {{a reputation as a}} star student and became a part of Providence's literary circle that included Sarah Helen Whitman <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> Perry. He wrote poetry and experimented with hashish. Hay received his Master of Arts degree in 1858, and was, like his grandfather before him, Class Poet. He returned to Illinois. Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield, and John became a clerk in his firm, where he could study law.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also {{made a conscious decision}} to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{seats and}} a police room {{were added to the}} Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough {{disaster}} in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.|$|E

5|$|Joyce <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> {{went into}} self-imposed exile, moving first to Zurich in Switzerland, where he ostensibly taught English at the Berlitz Language School through an agent in England. It later came to {{fact that the}} agent had been swindled; the {{director}} of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste, which was then part of Austria-Hungary (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in Pola, then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of Croatia). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians—having discovered an espionage ring in the city—expelled all aliens. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.|$|E
5|$|She later joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), {{where she}} was a member of the Dangerous Alliance, a group of wrestlers managed by Paul E. Dangerously. In 1993, she joined the rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the name Alundra Blayze. In the WWF, she feuded with Bull Nakano and Bertha Faye, while holding the WWF Women's Championship three times. Two years after joining the WWF, Miceli {{returned}} to WCW, showing up on an episode of Monday Nitro to throw the WWF Women's Championship belt into a trash can; she was blacklisted by the WWF (later WWE) for the next 20 years as a result. In her second WCW run, Miceli feuded with Bull Nakano and Oklahoma, and became the first woman to hold the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. After training wrestlers such as Torrie Wilson, Stacy Keibler, <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> Greenwald (Molly Holly) at the WCW Power Plant, she left the company in 2001. On March 28, 2015, she was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, under the Alundra Blayze moniker.|$|E
5|$|The Girl {{made its}} {{television}} {{debut in the}} United States on 20 October 2012 on HBO and aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 26 December. Jones and Miller were nominated for awards at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards and the British Academy Television Awards for their roles in the film, which received mixed reviews from critics. The Daily Mirror Jane Simon praised Miller's portrayal of Hedren. Although she endorsed the film, Hedren said its length kept it from showing some of {{the positive aspects of}} her relationship with Hitchcock. Others who knew (and worked with) Hitchcock criticised the film because of its portrayal of him as a sexual predator. Kim Novak (who starred in one of Hitchcock's films) <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> Brown (widow of one of Hitchcock's close friends) disputed the film's version of events.|$|E

5|$|Upon developing, the {{depression}} had a well-defined low-level circulation, {{and with a}} ridge to the north, it moved south of due west. Conditions favored further development, including low wind shear and warm water temperatures. The convection gradually organized, and {{the depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Nora early on October2. Its motion briefly became nearly stationary as Nora rounded the furthest extent of the ridge, although a steady motion to the northwest began on October3. That day, an eye feature developed {{in the center of}} the deep convection, <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> attained hurricane status early on October4. Steady intensification continued to winds of 100mph (160km/h) by later that day, and favorable conditions were expected to allow the hurricane to reach major hurricane status, or winds of 115mph (185km/h). However, Nora did not intensify further, due to unfavorable increased wind shear from the developing Tropical Storm Olaf to its east.|$|E
5|$|By October5, {{the eye of}} Nora was {{no longer}} evident on {{satellite}} imagery, which indicated {{the beginning of a}} weakening trend. However, a Special Sensor Microwave/Imager observed a small eye that was open to the northwest. The convection became ragged, and on October6 the winds decreased below hurricane-force. Around the same time, a strong approaching mid-level trough caused Nora to slow and turn to the east. Continued wind shear and the presence of dry air stripped the thunderstorms away from the center, and by October7 all of the deep convection had dissipated. As a result, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, <b>and</b> <b>Nora</b> weakened {{to the extent that it}} barely met the criteria for being a tropical cyclone. The NHC maintained advisories due to the circulation's proximity to western Mexico, as well as the unlikely potential for redeveloping thunderstorms due to its movement over warmer waters. Nora accelerated to the east-northeast and later to the northeast due to the advancing trough. As it approached western Mexico, an area of curved convection unexpectedly developed over the center. Without additional redevelopment, the poorly defined circulation of Nora made landfall near Mazatlán, Sinaloa early on October9. It dissipated shortly thereafter over the high terrain of western Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD on July 22, 2003. The DVD includes bonus features including an audio commentary, six deleted scenes, three documentaries, two music videos, three trailers, interactive menus and subtitles. The audio commentary presents Ellis, Perry, Bress, and Gruber providing information about {{the making of the}} film and their intentions overall. Deleted scenes are a cross-examination with Isabella's husband Marcus Hudson (Roger Cross), a conversation between Eugene <b>and</b> <b>Nora,</b> a car chase concerning Kimberly's reckless driving, and Eugene's meeting with Death at the hospital, and extended versions of Kimberly's interrogation at the police station and the encounter with Bludworth. The first documentary labelled Bits & Pieces: Bringing Life To Death runs for 30 minutes and recalls the history of splatter film, on top of accounts in relation to the visual effects of the film. The second documentary entitled Cheating Death: Beyond and Back progresses for 18 minutes and brings out people recounting their own real-life experiences with death. The Terror Gauge, the third documentary, is a test screening system of the film in which viewers are subjected to biofeedback and neurological examination under neurophysiologist Dr. Victoria Ibric. Other featurettes of the DVD include the interactive game Choose Your Fate, the music videos of Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory and Seven Days a Week by The Sounds, the theatrical trailers of this film and its antecedent, in addition to informative trivias provided throughout the featurettes.|$|E
