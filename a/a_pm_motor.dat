Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the [...] "dynamo" [...] type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux.

40|$|Abstract — Permanent magnet motors are {{commonly}} used in AC inverter controlled air conditioner systems for home appliances. Acoustic noise and vibration reduction in the outdoor unit compressor is an important task, in addition to attaining high efficiency power usage. It is also required to eliminate motor position sensors such as Hall Effect sensors due to the structural constraint of sealed compressors. These requirements naturally lead manufacturers to incorporate sinusoidal sensor-less PM motor control. Today, most air conditioner units are based on 32 bit RISC microcontrollers to achieve compressor motor control. In outdoor unit air conditioners, {{not only does the}} compressor use an AC inverter but also the fan uses an AC inverter. The fan is also based on <b>a</b> <b>PM</b> <b>motor</b> and its control is based on Hall Effect sensors in today's system. Power factor control is also required for a certain power range of air conditioner, which has normally been implemented by separate analog PFC control IC.
