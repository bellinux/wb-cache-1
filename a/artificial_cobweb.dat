40|$|A novel <b>artificial</b> <b>cobweb</b> routing {{algorithm}} (ACRA) for routing the tree-type {{physical topology}} of a low-voltage distribution network in a smart grid is proposed and analyzed in this paper. The establishment, maintenance and {{reconstruction of the}} route are presented. The <b>artificial</b> <b>cobweb</b> routing algorithm is shown to have broad general applicability for power line communication. To provide a theoretical foundation for further research, the communication delay of the network is calculated accurately. Simulation analysis of the communication delay and throughputs, which were based on Opnet 14. 5, demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} theoretical calculation. For the performance evaluation of ACRA, a test-bed that includes PLC nodes with the ACRA is set up in a noisy environment. Experimental results show the feasibility of the ACRA algorithm. These indicate that ACRA is effective for guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) and reliability in power line communication...|$|E

This stays in place because it snags on objects like shrubs or pushpins. Artificial spiders (often supplied in the same package) and other objects can in turn be snagged into the cobweb.|$|R
