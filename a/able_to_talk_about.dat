500|$|While Brütal Legends {{fate was}} unclear, Schafer was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{the project to}} avoid causing {{problems}} with any potential business deals, until EA Partners picked up the game in December 2008. However, even when {{the fate of the}} publication of the game was unsure, the team continued to work on its development. Schafer reflected that the time spent during development without a publisher was beneficial, allowing them to design the game without pressure from the publisher's goals. EA CEO John Riccitiello, when asked about EA picking up Brütal Legend for distribution prior to December 2008, commented that [...] "Sometimes significant creative risks end up being some of the world’s best products".|$|E
500|$|Brütal Legend was {{originally}} {{to be published}} by Vivendi Games' subsidiary Sierra Entertainment. In 2008, Activision merged with Vivendi's game division (which included Blizzard Entertainment) to become Activision Blizzard, gaining the rights to publication of Brütal Legend. [...] Upon evaluation of their assets, Activision Blizzard chose to drop Brütal Legend along with several other games, leaving the project in limbo. Activision CEO Robert Kotick later claimed the reason for dropping the project was due to: the project running late; missing milestones; overspending the budget and not looking like a good game. Double Fine themselves were unaware that Activision had chosen to drop the game, having been informed through an Activision press release that omitted the game from their upcoming release schedule, according to studio producer Caroline Esmurdoc. Industry rumors suggested that Electronic Arts was interested in publishing the property, and it was confirmed in December 2008 that Electronic Arts would publish the game. During the period when Brütal Legends fate was unclear, Schafer was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E

The spokesperson of the Egyptian Armed Forces, Colonel Ahmed Ali, later denied the rumors that Morsi was badly treated, saying that they had nothing to hide. The Egyptian Army later gave Catherine Ashton the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy for the European Union the permission to meet Morsi.

2500|$|Pamuk {{stated that}} he was {{consequently}} subjected to a hate campaign that forced him to flee the country. He returned later in 2005, however, to face the charges against him. In an interview with BBC News, {{he said that he}} wanted to defend freedom of speech, which was Turkey's only hope for coming to terms with its history: [...] "What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. But we have to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the past." [...] However, when Turkish television, CNN TURK asked Pamuk about his speech, he admitted that he said that [...] "Armenians were killed" [...] but he rejected that he said [...] "Turks killed Armenians" [...] and he estimated the number of deaths (as 1 million) in that speech.|$|E

50|$|These men who {{had always}} been {{unemployed}} were least likely {{to speak of the}} role that outside forces play in shaping a person's chances in life. On the other hand, the men that were a part of some sort of employment had completely different thoughts on mobility and attainment.

2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} Stephen Huvane stated [...] "Personally, she’s {{not comfortable}} with being Janet in public [...] When she’s performing, that’s a different thing. We always planned that when the album came out, we would do the proper promotion." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam commented, [...] "Between albums she likes to go live life, recharge her batteries {{and be able to}} share her experiences. It not only raises her artistic level, she's <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> things she's going through -- and other people can relate. That's {{one of the things that}} allows her to connect truly with the fans." [...] Prior to promotion, Jackson performed a medley of [...] "All for You", [...] "Rhythm Nation", and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Surprise guest Justin Timberlake arrived to perform a duet version of [...] "Rock Your Body," [...] which ended in Jackson's breast being accidentally exposed. The incident resulted in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission enforcing massive fines on conglomerates involved with the broadcast, including CBS, Viacom, and MTV; who then blacklisted Jackson on many radio formats and music channels worldwide as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Stringer characterised Morrissey as a {{man with}} various {{contradictory}} traits, being [...] "an ordinary, working-class 'anti-star' who nevertheless loves to hog the spotlight, a nice man who says the nastiest things about other people, a shy man who is also an outrageous narcissist". He further suggested that part of Morrissey's appeal was that he conveyed {{the image of a}} [...] "cultivated English gentleman (and being every inch the typically English 'gent' he is perfectly representative of that type's loathing for cant and hypocrisy, and his fragile, quasi-gay sexuality)". Similarly, Morrissey biographer David Bret described the singer as being [...] "quintessentially English", while Simpson termed him a Little Englander. During the 1980s, interviewer Paul Morley stated that Morrissey [...] "sets out to be a decent man and he succeeds because that is what he is." [...] Eddie Sanderson, who interviewed Morrissey for the Mail on Sunday in 1992, said that [...] "underneath all the rock star flim-flam, Morrissey is actually a very nice chap, excellent company, perfectly willing and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> any subject one cared to throw at him". Having photographed him in 2004, the photographer Mischa Richter described Morrissey as [...] "genuinely lovely".|$|E
2500|$|One {{suggested}} that a goal of interview preparation should be to present oneself as [...] "comfortable with spontaneous conversation" [...] and be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> interests without sounding like the answers were prepared in advance, and suggested {{it was important to}} show intellectual passion and a love of learning with a deep excitement, and show [...] "social maturity" [...] with sensitivity, empathy for others unlike oneself, and concern for issues larger than personal career ambitions. An applicant should have an attitude that was not be what can the college offer but what can the student offer the college, and he or she should avoid asking questions about facts better answered elsewhere, and show an openness to new ideas, an ability to work cooperatively with others, ambition, and caring about others. Interviewees should be ready for sometimes provocative questions to test social sensitivity; if an interviewer asks a [...] "baiting or leading question", an applicant should respond by laughing while politely disagreeing with the perspective, and to keep trying to enjoy the conversation with the interviewer. Another advisor {{suggested that}} students must be prepared to answer the question What is your biggest failure in an interview. Applicants should avoid sounding snide, annoyed, contemptuous, and avoid describing oneself as humiliated, bored, depressed, angry, shy, inhibited, anxious, frightened, and frustrated, and should be upbeat but avoid going for the hard sell. Another report suggested that shy or timid applicants were at a disadvantage. Another advisor {{suggested that a}} student try to find a common bond with the interviewer, and send a brief follow-up letter afterwards.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to {{traditional}} animators, {{the art of}} building believable characters resides {{in the ability to}} successfully portray a character’s behaviour as the result of its internal emotions, intentions and thoughts. Following this direction, we want our agents <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> explicitly <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their internal thoughts and report their personal past experiences. In order to achieve it, we look at a specific type of episodic long term memory. This paper describes the integration of Autobiographic Memory into FAtiMA, an emotional agent architecture that generates emotions from a subjective appraisal of events. ...|$|R

On choosing to direct this episode specifically, Whedon explained, [...] "I figured just throw me in the deep end and see if I can swim, and I did write {{a little bit of a}} deep end in some of it. I think it worked out." [...] Having Whedon both write and direct this episode meant for star Clark Gregg, [...] "there's really no filter between the voice of this really wild episode ... and us.

What we should have done without him, I am afraid to think, for all the company despising the bride and bridegroom and old Mr. Turveydrop--and old Mr. Thurveydrop, in virtue of his deportment, considering himself vastly superior to all the company--it was a very unpromising case.|$|E

40|$|With in the {{confines}} of this action research project I answered my question about how urban 8 th graders <b>talk</b> critically, specifically <b>about</b> the Holocaust. Using the book Night by Elie Wiesel three students from an urban upstate New York school district met with me and discussed the Holocaust, particularly events around the novel. In addition to participating in two critical discussions, the students wrote in their journals, answered a questionnaire and responded to a picture. The journals, questionnaire, picture response and transcriptions were analyzed using the four dimensions model of critical literacy. The study showed that students were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> critically <b>about</b> the Holocaust and how teacher questioning can affect discussion...|$|R

60|$|I {{have since}} {{found out that}} there is nothing the Germans like so much as an opera. They like it, not in a mild and {{moderate}} way, but with their whole hearts. This is a legitimate result of habit and education. Our nation will like the opera, too, by and by, no doubt.
