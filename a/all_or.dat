5|$|Highways in {{the state}} {{maintained}} by MDOT range from two-lane rural highways up to 12-lane freeways. In addition to the Interstates, other trunklines are built to freeway standards. Sections of US10, US23, US31, US127 and US131 have been upgraded to freeway standards. <b>All</b> <b>or</b> part of several state trunklines are also freeways. In the Metro Detroit area, M-5, M-8 (Davison Freeway), M-10 (Lodge Freeway), M-14, M-39 (Southfield Freeway), M-53 (Van Dyke Freeway), and M-59 have such sections. In {{the rest of the}} state, M-6 near Grand Rapids, Conn. M-13 near Bay City, M-47 near Midland, M-60 near Jackson, and Bus. US131 near Kalamazoo are also freeways, for <b>all</b> <b>or</b> part of their respective lengths. Sections of US12, M-20, M-37, M-46, M-55, M-66 and US223 have been routed to run concurrently with other freeways as well.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Egyptian commanders wanted {{to carry out}} a general war to regain at least a {{significant}} part of the Sinai.

Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating <b>all</b> <b>or</b> most of the Sinai.|$|E
