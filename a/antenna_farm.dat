25|$|In 1957, KFJZ-TV {{moved its}} {{transmitter}} facilities to a tower at the <b>antenna</b> <b>farm</b> in Cedar Hill, which provided {{a signal that}} covered the Dallas–Fort Worth market. The transmitter relocation played {{a major factor in}} throwing Channel 11 into a three-station competition for the NBC affiliation. The network had been affiliated with WBAP-TV since it signed on nine years earlier; however, the heirs of Fort Worth Star-Telegram founder Amon G. Carter chose to continue his legacy of civic boosterism of Fort Worth by refusing to move WBAP's transmitter facilities from eastern Fort Worth to an area between both cities. The lack of adequate reception throughout the entire Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area led NBC to simultaneously maintain an affiliation with WFAA beginning in 1950 to act as its Dallas affiliate (despite their close proximity, Arbitron originally designated Dallas and Fort Worth as separate markets. The Dallas market as Dallas County and surrounding counties in the area's eastern half and the Fort Worth market as neighboring Tarrant County and the counties surrounding it in the west; the two cities would be collapsed into a single television market in 1952).|$|E

2500|$|After {{ownership}} of Carter Publications transferred to his familial heirs after Carter suffered a fatal heart attack two years before, in early 1957, NBC threatened to strip WBAP-TV of its affiliation {{if it did}} not agree to move its transmitter eastward to reach the entire Dallas area. Belo had attempted to get an exclusive NBC affiliation first, and approached the network with an offer to make WFAA its exclusive affiliate for the entire market. The network also approached the Roosevelt family-owned Texas State Network about affiliating with independent station KFJZ-TV (channel 11, now CBS owned-and-operated station KTVT), which had earlier moved its transmitter to the <b>antenna</b> <b>farm</b> in Cedar Hill. Carter's heirs—who initially did not want to move the transmitter closer to Dallas, in their aim to continue Carter's legacy of civic boosterism for Fort Worth—eventually agreed to NBC's demands that it move WBAP-TV's transmitter facilities to Cedar Hill, installing a transmitter antenna on a [...] candelabra tower that was already shared by WFAA and KRLD-TV, and operate it at a higher effective radiated power strong enough to adequately cover Dallas. WFAA lost its NBC affiliation on September 1, 1957, as the network had awarded WBAP-TV the exclusive affiliation for the Dallas-Fort Worth market as a byproduct of the transmitter relocation and signal boost; this left Channel 8 as an exclusive affiliate of ABC.|$|E

2500|$|Ownership of WBAP-TV, WBAP {{radio and}} the Star-Telegram would {{transfer}} to the familial heirs of Carter after he succumbed from the last of several heart attacks he had suffered over {{the previous two years}} on June 23, 1955. NBC grew frustrated with having to maintain affiliations with two stations to carry its programming in an otherwise effectively consolidated market. In early 1957, a taller transmission tower was built at the west end of the Broadcast Hill studio property. However, NBC threatened to strip its affiliation from Channel 5 if it did not relocate its transmitter farther eastward to extend the station's signal deeper into the Dallas metropolitan area; reportedly, the network approached the Roosevelt family-owned Texas State Network about affiliating with independent station KFJZ-TV (channel 11, now CBS owned-and-operated station KTVT), which had then-recently moved its transmitter to the <b>antenna</b> <b>farm</b> in Cedar Hill. Belo also made an attempt to make WFAA the market's exclusive NBC affiliate. To prevent the network from defecting, Carter's heirs—who were reluctant to comply to NBC's demands at first, out of their desire to continue Carter's legacy of pro-Fort Worth civic boosterism—agreed to move WBAP-TV's transmitter facilities to Cedar Hill and boost its effective radiated power to adequately cover Dallas; in the summer of 1957, it installed a transmitter antenna on a [...] candelabra tower that was already shared by WFAA and KRLD-TV (channel 4, now Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW), where sister station WBAP-FM also moved its transmitter. Channel 5 became the sole NBC affiliate for the entire Dallas–Fort Worth market on September 1, 1957, which left WFAA exclusively aligned with ABC. In October 1959, WBAP-TV installed the first color videotape recorder in Texas, allowing it the ability to record a 90-minute segment of programming and replay it in less than five minutes.|$|E

Besides other possible problems, the fact alone of being forced to use several different electromagnetic models of the same object poses traceability issues and requires duplication of effort, making a complete analysis quite expensive. The Astigmatic Beam Tracer (ABT) has been updated to improve its performance with large meshed geometries (aircrafts, satellites, ships) achieving a unique modelling capability. The numerical modelling of the environment based on beam tracing (ABT) and SATIMO measurements capability have been combined in SATSim software.

50|$|KPH {{is now a}} part of the Point Reyes National Seashore and is {{maintained}} and operated by former KPH employees and volunteers of the Maritime Radio Historical Society. There are several reasons that the station was able to survive decommissioning and make a comeback. First, the equipment was old and not suitable for resale, so much of it was left where it was, with connections to power, antennas and land lines still intact. Second, the real estate taken up by buildings and <b>antenna</b> <b>farms,</b> while desirable, was also unsuitable for resale (especially {{to the extent that it}} lay within the Point Reyes National Seashore), meaning that the properties were not bought and redeveloped the way some other stations were. The KPH license and the frequencies assigned to it are made available to the MHRS by the license holder, Globe Wireless. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has granted the MHRS a new coast station license with the callsign KSM, as well as the amateur radio club callsign K6KPH for communicating with radio hams on amateur frequencies. K6KPH is unusually powerful and well-equipped for an amateur station, with its professional grade transmitters, antennas and operators. Operating in amateur radio mode means following a different set of rules (using different frequencies and lower transmitter power levels), but amateurs are not limited in their choice of equipment as long as they stick to these rules.|$|R
40|$|In a {{laboratory}} {{test of a}} low-frequency RFID system the probability of registration was assessed and this system was used to study ranging behavior of laying hens.

In the field test on 12 <b>farms</b> <b>antennas</b> were placed {{on both sides of}} every pophole and tags were attached to a sample of laying hens. The probability of registration of a hen was 94 %. It is suggested to decrease the ID of the tag from 64 bit to 32 bit in order to read tags up to a speed of 3. 2 m/s, reliably. In order to find a possible influence of the magnetic fields that were generated by reading the tags on ranging behavior, the use of two popholes was evaluated while the system at the popholes was alternatively switched off. The use of the two popholes was not affected by that so with the proposed modification of the tag this system seems suitable to study ranging behavior in laying hens...|$|R
