5|$|Losses for 12 July <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{establish}} for either combatant. Tank losses {{attributed to the}} German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to establish}}.|$|E

5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> to determine and may change with further research.

5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic <b>are</b> <b>difficult</b> to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E

5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost.
