50|$|He {{had also}} noted that {{improperly}} pruned trees were unable to heal themselves. He thus became an early advocate of proper pruning techniques, including an <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> to conform to a tree’s natural physiological processes. This proper pruning innovation was radical for the time period, and has only been adopted as the industry standard within the past 25 years.|$|E
50|$|The end of {{the final}} length of exhaust pipe where it vents to open air, {{generally}} the only visible part of the exhaust system part on a vehicle, often ends with just a straight or <b>angled</b> <b>cut,</b> but may include a fancy tip. The tip is sometimes chromed. It is often of larger pipe {{than the rest of}} the exhaust system. This produces a final reduction in pressure, and sometimes used to enhance the appearance of the car.|$|E
5000|$|Compound-miter saw - Compound {{adds the}} ability to rotate the blade head at a range of angles from the board {{allowing}} you to enter the wood at an angle other than 90 degrees. Creates a ramp <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> {{into the side of}} the wood. Allows for more complex cuts and is commonly used in trim work for homes. A compound miter saw is known as a single compound miter saw, meaning that the head only rotates on one side requiring the user to flip the board to get angle cuts in the other direction.|$|E

5000|$|Medeco's {{patented}} {{lock design}} requires the <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> {{of a key}} to elevate and rotate the pins inside the lock {{in order for a}} side-bar to drop, allowing the cylinder to turn. The pins are uniquely chisel-tipped which allows them to be rotated by the <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> on the key and have a slot {{along the length of the}} pin for the sidebar to drop into once the pin has been rotated to its correct orientation.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle’s chromed hammer-forged steel barrel is stated {{to retain}} {{accuracy}} after 20,000 normal (non-sustained) rounds. The barrel {{also features a}} flash suppressor with an <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> at the tip which directs the muzzle blast upward, compensating for muzzle rise. The F2000 has an optional bayonet lug mounted near the muzzle, and an adjustable gas regulator with two settings: [...] "normal" [...] for standard ammunition meeting NATO specifications, and [...] "adverse"—used to send an increased volume of gas into the system to ensure proper functioning when fouled or when using low pressure ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sharp object}} works by concentrating forces which creates a high {{pressure}} {{due to the}} very small area of the edge, but high pressures can nick a thin blade or even cause it to roll over into a rounded tube when it is used against hard materials. An irregular material or <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> {{is also likely to}} apply much more torque to hollow-ground blades due to the [...] "lip" [...] formed {{on either side of the}} edge. More blade material can be included directly behind the cutting edge to reinforce it, but during sharpening some proportion of this material must be removed to reshape the edge, making the process more time-consuming. Also, any object being cut must be moved aside to make way for this wider blade section, and any force distributed to the grind surface reduces the pressure applied at the edge.|$|E
50|$|Plank and beam {{construction}} or framing {{is a type}} of framing with no joists but widely spaced beams spanned by heavy planks. This method developed in the early 19th century for industrial mill floors but may also be found in timber framed roofs. Also known as Slow burning construction, mill construction, and heavy timber {{construction or}}iginated in industrial mills in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The joists are eliminated by the use of heavy planks saving time and strength of the timbers because the joists notches were eliminated. The beams are spaced 4 ft to 18 ft apart and the planks are 2 in or more thick possibly with another layer of 1 in on the top as the finished flooring could span these distances. The planks may be laid flat and tongue and grooved or splined together or laid on edge called a laminated floor. The name slow burning construction was coined in 1870 by Factory Mutual insurance company because large, smooth timbers with chamfered edges ignite slower and last longer in a fire allowing fire suppression crews more time to extinguish a fire. These beams are designed to be self-releasing in case of fire, that is if they burn through and collapse the connection with the masonry wall and joint at the post should allow the beam to fall away without pulling the wall or post down. A common way to join a beam and a masonry wall in this regard is a fire cut, an <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> {{on the end of the}} beam.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The sensing {{setup for}} {{detection}} and measurement {{of carbon dioxide}} and methane was designed. Absorption spectra of many compounds indicate several weak peaks around 1400 - 1600 nm wavelength. Thus, tunable lasers with 20 micron core photonic bandgap fiber matching above wavelengths were chosen for the optical measurement system. Measurements were performed at low pressure to eliminate pressure broadening effect and to sharpen the absorption peaks. The <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> was performed to improve signal to noise ratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of vitrification technology for converting radioactive waste {{into a glass}} solid {{began in the early}} 1960 s. Some problems encountered in the vitrification process are still waiting for a solution. One of them is wicking. During pouring, the glass stream flows down the wall of the pour spout until it reaches an <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> in the wall. At this point, the stream is supposed to break cleanly away from the wall of the pour spout and fall freely into the canister. However, the glass stream is often pulled toward the wall and does not always fall into the canister, a phenomenon known as wicking. Phase 1 involves the assembly, construction, and testing of a melter capable of supplying molten glass at operational flow rates over a break-off point knife edge. Phase 2 will evaluate the effects of glass and pour spout temperatures as well as glass flow rates on the glass flow behavior over the knife edge. Phase 3 will identify the effects on wicking resulting from varying the knife edge diameter and height as well as changing the back-cut angle of the knife edge. The following tasks were completed in FY 97 : Design the experimental system for glass melting and pouring; Acquire and assemble the melter system; and Perform initial research work...|$|E

50|$|There are {{different}} types of cutting blades for bolt cutters, including <b>angle</b> <b>cut,</b> center cut, shear cut, and clipper cut blades. Bolt cutters are available usually in 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 42 inches (30.5, 35.6, 46, 61, 76, 91.4 and 107 cm) in length.

50|$|When {{viewed from}} the top, metal {{counterweight}} is basically rectangular, typically with 45-degree <b>angle</b> chamfers <b>cut</b> at two opposing corners. A slot is cut into {{each end of the}} weight so as to enable the weight to straddle, and be laterally secured by, the arbor rods. In order to facilitate removal of weights with <b>angle</b> <b>cuts,</b> it is customary to stack the weights in alternating orientations so that the square corners of any weight will be aligned with the angled corners of adjacent weights. This simplifies removal because the square corners of each weight protrude beyond the angled corners of the weight below, serving as handles that can be easily gripped, even with gloved hands.|$|R

50|$|Valves and seats {{will usually}} {{have the same}} angle to mate properly. That angle is usually 45 degrees, but 30 degrees {{can be found in}} many modern applications. The mating angle is often {{accompanied}} by top and bottom <b>angle</b> <b>cuts</b> that are 15 degrees deflection each side of the mating angle. For a 45 degree seat, the top angle would be 30 and bottom would be 60). This method increases air-flow, which gives mild horsepower, response, and efficiency improvements.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} grooves, slots, and pockets in the {{work-piece}} may be produced {{from a variety}} of tool bits. Common tool bit types are: square end cutters, ball end cutters, t-slot cutters, and shell mills. Square end cutters can mill square slots, pockets, and edges. Ball end cutters mill radiused slots or fillets. T-slot cutters mill exactly that: T-shaped slots. Shell end cutters are used for large flat surfaces and for <b>angle</b> <b>cuts.</b> There are variations of these tool types as well.|$|R
50|$|For miter joints {{occurring}} at angles other than 90°, for materials {{of the same}} cross-section the proper <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> must be determined so that the two pieces to be joined meet flush (i.e. one piece's mitered end is not longer than the adjoining piece). To find the <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> divide the angle at which the two pieces meet by two. Technically, two different <b>cut</b> <b>angles</b> are required; one for each piece, where the second angle is 90° plus the aforementioned <b>cut</b> <b>angle,</b> but due to angular limitations in common cutting implements (hand circular saws, table saws) a single angle is required and is used to cut the first piece {{in one direction and}} the second piece in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|A cabochon stone, a {{gemstone}} {{that is not}} faceted, usually {{relies on}} the shallow <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> {{into the side of}} the stone which helps the metal to stay in place. With a clear faceted stone, such as a diamond, a shallow groove is cut into the bezel itself. The girdle or widest part of the gem stone is placed in the bezel, which is then pushed down over the girdle. The pressure of the bezel over the edge of the diamond keeps it in place.|$|R
