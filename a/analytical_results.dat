40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} {{characterize}} {{the law of the}} degree correlations in the evolution of complex networks and explore the mechanism responsible for degree correlations, we investigate the degree correlations in mixed networks. We study the two-node degree correlations in networks with preferential attachment and intrinsic attachment. Using the dynamic system’s rate equation approach under the assumption of continuous degree, we give the <b>analytical</b> <b>result</b> for two-node degree correlations, expressed by average nearest-neighbor degree (ANND). <b>Analytical</b> <b>result</b> shows that ANND decreases with respect to degree, which means that networks we studied are disassortative mixing. We also get the degree correlations of Barab¢si-Albert model, which is in the line with the existed <b>result.</b> Finally, the <b>analytical</b> <b>result</b> is in agreement with the numerical simulation...|$|R

25|$|Overdoses with {{lidocaine}} can be {{a result}} of excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children who are more susceptible to overdose, accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgical procedures. These occurrences have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. It is important in the interpretation of <b>analytical</b> <b>results</b> to recognize that lidocaine is often routinely administered intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parental feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more commonplace {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E

The guidance on the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement of the ISO / International Organization for Standardization assumes that the analyst is being asked to give a parameter that characterizes the range of the values that could reasonably be associated with the result of the measurement. In practice, the uncertainty of the <b>analytical</b> <b>result</b> may arise from many possible sources: sampling, sample preparation, matrix effects, equipments, standards and reference materials, among others.
