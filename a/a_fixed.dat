5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. <b>A</b> <b>fixed</b> bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as <b>a</b> <b>fixed</b> partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as <b>a</b> <b>fixed</b> full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>fix</b> {{is called}} <b>a</b> running <b>fix</b> when {{one or more}} of the LOPs used to obtain it is an LOP {{advanced}} or retrieved over time. In order to get <b>a</b> <b>fix</b> the LOP must cross at an angle, the closer to 90° the better. This means the observations must have different azimuths. During the day, if only the Sun is visible, it is possible to get an LOP from the observation but not <b>a</b> <b>fix</b> as another LOP is needed. What may be done is take a first sight which yields one LOP and, some hours later, when the Sun's azimuth has changed substantially, take a second sight which yields a second LOP. Knowing the distance and course sailed in the interval, the first LOP can be advanced to its new position and the intersection with the second LOP yields <b>a</b> running <b>fix.</b>|$|R
