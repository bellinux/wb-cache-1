5|$|During Soviet times, stanitsas, {{no longer}} being Cossack settlements, still {{encompassed}} relatively large populations. In 1926, for example, the populations of five of the sixteen stanitsas then existing exceeded five thousand. As of 2014, there are twelve stanitsas in the republic, accounting for 5.3% of the republic's rural localities, but their combined population accounts for <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the republic's rural population.

The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E
5|$|At the 3 March 1962 election, Askin led the Coalition {{to another}} defeat to the Labor Party, now under Bob Heffron, {{who had become}} Premier {{following}} Cahill's death in October 1959.

40|$|In Zimbabwe's current crisis, {{it is easy}} to {{overlook}} the fact that the country had a resettlement program for two decades before the large-scale, politically motivated land occupations began in 2000. This paper does four things. First, it creates an historical bookmark for the earlier period of land reform {{in the hope that the}} lessons from that experience will not be lost. Second, it reviews some of the major outcomes <b>of</b> resettlement from <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> century <b>of</b> research. Third, it partially sets the stage for some of the papers that follow in this section. Finally, as a caution for those who will shape Zimbabwe's future, it provides some reminders of the interlocking relationships among property, poverty and conflict. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. <b>Almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> all rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known {{that it may be}} more common than the estimates suggest.|$|E
5|$|De Bont came up {{with the}} idea for the film after he had a {{recurring}} nightmare about a cruise ship crashing into an island. Speed star Keanu Reeves was initially supposed to reprise his role as Jack Traven for the sequel, but decided not to commit and was replaced by Patric prior to filming. Production took place aboard Seabourn Legend, the ship on which the film is set. The film's final scene, when the ship crashes into the island of Saint Martin, cost <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the film's budget, and set records as the largest and most expensive stunt ever filmed. Many interior scenes aboard the ship were shot on soundstages in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The film's soundtrack featured mostly reggae music. Mark Mancina returned to compose the film score, which was released as an album 13 years after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} to Singapore the 8th Division was deployed {{to defend the}} island's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division's units were at half-strength. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector. The Japanese landing on 8 February {{took part in the}} Australian sector, however, and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. The division was also unable to turn back the Japanese landing at Kranji and withdrew to the centre of the island. After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore, Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February. Following the surrender 14,972Australians were taken prisoner, though some escaped on ships. These escapees included Major General Bennett, who was found by two post-war inquiries to have been unjustified in leaving his command. The loss of <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> Australia's overseas soldiers, and the failure of the Singapore Strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, stunned the country.|$|E

Another study shown that around 1/3 emissions from China in 2005 are due to exports. Over half of those emissions driven by demand from the West are from transnationals taking advantage of China's developmental policies favouring heavy manufacturing over regions with more developed environmental laws and enforcement.
