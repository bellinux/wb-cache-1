2500|$|The Gacaca court (...) is {{a system}} of {{community}} justice inspired by Rwandan tradition where gacaca can be loosely translated to [...] "justice amongst the grass". This traditional, communal justice was adapted in 2001 to fit the needs of Rwanda {{in the wake of}} the 1994 Rwandan Genocide (also known as [...] "Hutu vs Tutsi" [...] ) where an estimated 800,000 people were killed, tortured and raped. After the genocide, the new Rwandan Patriotic Front's government struggled to pursue justice on such a massive scale, <b>and</b> <b>therein</b> to develop just means for the humane detention and prosecution of the more than 100,000 people accused of genocide, war crimes, and related crimes against humanity. By 2000, approximately 130,000 alleged genocide perpetrators populated Rwanda's prisons (Reyntjens & Vandeginste 2005, 110). Using the justice system Rwanda had in place, the trial of such massive numbers of alleged perpetrators would take well over 100 years during which Rwanda's economy would crumble as a massive amount of their population awaited trial in prison. For this reason they chose to adapt and create a large-scale justice system, which would work alongside the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, in order to heal as a people and to thrive as a country.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Harris Sagaser sets Sonnet 29 {{apart from}} other Elizabethan sonnets in that the speaker is the main focus, as opposed to many love sonnets of the time focused entirely on {{the object of the}} speaker's affection, or so of the poet's desire; this would seem that the poem is about the woman, not the speaker. However, Sasager says, [...] "I do not mean to imply that... (these poems) are {{themselves}} 'about' particular beloveds. But they do pretend to be, <b>and</b> <b>therein</b> is the difference. She goes on to clarify this difference, or what sets sonnet 29 apart from most love object-centered sonnets of the time. [...] "The poet-lover in sonnet 29 admits up front that the fruits of his inward experience are primarily his own, though not his own in terms of everafter fame... Instead, the speaker of 29 is concerned first to wonder" [...] This is to say that though most poetry of the time was at least disguised to be about the object of the speaker's affection, this sonnet does not even attempt to do so. According to Sasager, it is clear that this poem is speaker-focused and about the emotions and experiences of the speaker, not that of the beloved. As discussed by other critics, Sasager addresses the lack of [...] "when... then" [...] structure saying [...] "the poem shifts to representing a particular moment: not a past moment, but now." [...] She makes a point to say this differs notably from other poems of the time.|$|E
