40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} discover a model of assessment that could measure kinesthetic intelligence in <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance from several related variable, both direct variable and indirect variable. The research method used was a qualitative method using path analysis to determine the direct and indirect variable; therefore, the dominant variable that supported the measurement model of kinesthetic intelligence in arranging dance could be discovered. The population used was the students {{of the art of}} dance department and were chosen by using purposive sampling technique so that the kinesthetic intelligence could be well measured. The result of this research was that the correlation between the ability in perceiving movement and the ability in conveying movement was 3. 8048. The correlation between the ability in perceiving movement and kinesthetic intelligence was 0. 3137. The correlation between the ability in perceiving movement and <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance was - 0. 3751. The correlation between conveying movement and kinesthetic intelligence was 0. 1333. The correlation between conveying movement and <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance was - 0. 2399. The correlation between kinesthetic intelligence and <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance was 0. 8529. These result proved that kinesthetic intelligence has significant influence to the ability in <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance. It could be concluded that a smart assessment model of kinesthetic intelligence in <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance that was needed should measure the kinesthetic intelligence first while the ability to perceive and convey movement became the supporting element to strengthen the kinesthetic intelligence in <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance. </p...|$|R

5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and <b>arrange</b> <b>a</b> variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and <b>arrange</b> <b>a</b> better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{discharged}} Palatine Theodore Csanád {{and restored}} Julius Kán {{in the second}} half of 1222. The following year, Pope Honorius urged Andrew to launch a new crusade. If the report of the Continuatio Claustroneuburgensis is reliable, Andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch a new crusade, but no other sources mention this event. Andrew planned to <b>arrange</b> <b>a</b> new marriage for his eldest son, Béla, but Pope Honorius mediated a reconciliation between Béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223. This angered Andrew, and Béla fled to Austria. He returned in 1224, after the bishops persuaded Andrew to forgive him.|$|E
