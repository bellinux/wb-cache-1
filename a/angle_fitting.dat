40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the polarization of compact radio sources from six pointings of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at 350 MHz with 35 % coverage in lambda^ 2. After correcting for the off-axis instrumental polarization with a simple analytical model, {{only a small number of}} 585 strong sources have significant polarizations at these wavelengths. The median depolarization ratio from 1. 4 GHz for the strongest sources is < 0. 2, reinforcing the likelihood that radio galaxies are found in magnetized environments, even outside of rich clusters. Seven sources with significant 350 MHz polarization were selected for a more in-depth Faraday structure analysis. We fit the observed values Q/I and U/I as a function of lambda^ 2 using both a depolarizing screen and two component models. We also performed RM Synthesis/Clean and standard fitting of polarization angle vs. lambda^ 2. We find that a single rotation measure (RM), as found using polarization <b>angle</b> <b>fitting</b> or simple screen models, commonly provides a poor fit when the solutions are translated back into Q, U space. Thus, although a single "characteristic" rotation measure may be found using these techniques, the Faraday structure of the source may not be adequately represented. We also demonstrate that RM Synthesis may yield an erroneous Faraday structure in the presence of multiple, interfering RM components, even when cleaning of the Faraday spectrum is performed. We briefly explore the conditions under which rotation measures and Faraday structure results can be reliable. Many measurements in the literature do not meet these criteria; we discuss how these influence the resulting scientific conclusions and offer a prescription for obtaining reliable RMs. Comment: 26 pages, 24 figures.

40|$|Essential {{requirement}} for the manufacturing of economically viable Si based solar cells is the passivation of Si surfaces and interfaces to reduce recombination loss of light induced charge carriers. This contribution reports on combined optimisation of wet chemical surface pre treatment and application of thin passivating layers which are utilised to achieve these goals. The influ ence of wet chemical silicon substrate pre treatments on surface morphology and electronic interface properties is discussed for various hetero interfaces of crystalline Si c Si and Si oxides SiOx, or amorphous materials such as Si a Si H, Si nitride a SiNx H and Si car bide a SiC H, which are typically applied in Si heterostructure solar cells. The final aim of the chemical pre treat ments is the removal of damaged regions on textured substrates and the saturation of dangling bonds at the interface surface by single bonded species i. e. hydrogen or well defined and bond <b>angle</b> <b>fitting</b> layers i. e. wet chemical oxides. From the viewpoint of global environment conservation, {{as well as to}} improve the economics in silicon solar cells manufacturing, the employment of new, highly efficient cleaning and passivation methods is essential to minimise the chemical consumption and the number of process steps. It was shown that the optimised Si substrate surface state after optimised wet chemical substrate conditioning can be preserved and transferred into amorphous silicon a Si H c Si, silicon nitride a SiNx H c Si and silicon carbide a SiC H c Si interfaces, typically applied in silicon heterostructure solar cells. The resulting interface recombination losses on the het ero junctions prepared by soft a Si H deposition were found to be significantly reduced [].

40|$|We {{report the}} {{application}} of non-polar Electrical Field-Flow Fractionation (Np-EFFF) to the isolation and characterization of membrane bound proteins. These proteins are presently understudied, {{despite the fact that}} about 25 - 30 % of the human genome encodes for them. Present methods, e. g. electrophoresis, denature lipophilic and membrane proteins by adding surfactants to suspend them in aqueous media. They also employ high applied voltages causing thermal degradation, and they force fragile proteins through packed gel beds causing mechanical damage. The Np-EFFF method consists of an ultra thin, open channel defined by two oppositely charged conductive plates. A non-polar medium is passed through the channel in laminar flow profile, and the protein sample is injected into the fluid. As the sample passes between the electrically charged plates, proteins separate into different regions of the flow profiles based on their electrophoretic mobility and size. Theory predicts and previous results show that surface roughness of the conductive plates is a significant degradation to the resolving power of the method.

40|$|As {{the linear}} array sensor such as {{multispectral}} and hyperspectral sensor has great potential in disaster monitoring and geological survey, {{the quality of}} the image geometric rectification should be guaranteed. Different from the geometric rectification of airborne planar array images or multi linear array images, exterior orientation elements need to be determined for each scan line of single linear array images. Internal distortion persists after applying GPS/IMU data directly to geometrical rectification. Straight lines may be curving and jagged. Straight line feature -based geometrical rectification algorithm was applied to solve this problem, whereby the exterior orientation elements were fitted by piecewise polynomial and evaluated with the straight line feature as constraint. However, atmospheric turbulence during the flight is unstable, equal piecewise can hardly provide good fitting, resulting in limited precision improvement of geometric rectification or, in a worse case, the iteration cannot converge. To solve this problem, drawing on dynamic programming ideas, unequal segmentation of line feature-based geometric rectification method is developed.

We calculated impact lie angles and face angles of the club head using this method and also measured the ball flight with a flight measuring machine. The results are as follows: (1) When the golfers used 64 ° (60 °) clubs, all of them hit balls at larger (smaller) impact lie angles than when using 62 ° clubs. (2) Most of the landing points of the ball when the golfers used 64 ° (60 °) clubs were more to the left (right) than 62 ° clubs.

Objective: The objective was to determine the immediate spatiotemporal and kinematic effect of custom-made solid ankle–foot orthoses in early stroke rehabilitation, compared to shod walking. Methods: Five male and three female participants were recruited to the study (n = 8), {{with a mean age of}} 57 (16) years who were 3. 5 (3) weeks post-stroke. Each received a custom-made solid ankle–foot orthosis to a predefined set of design criteria and tuned using heel wedges to control the shank inclination angle during shod walking. Repeated spatiotemporal and three-dimensional gait measures were taken pre- and immediately post-intervention. Study design: A pre–post-test experimental study. Results: With the solid ankle–foot orthosis, walking velocity increased from 0. 22 (0. 2) to 0. 36 (0. 3) m/s (p < 0. 05), overall average step length increased from 0. 28 (0. 1) to 0. 37 (0. 1) m (p < 0. 05), cadence increased from 45 (19) to 56 (19) steps/min (p < 0. 05) and step length symmetry ratio increased from 0. 65 (0. 2) to 0. 74 (0. 2) (not significant). No clear changes were observed in the joint kinematics of the hip and knee.

This was not the case for pelvic <b>angles.</b> The <b>fitting</b> model combined with the CoR showed that 5 - 10 trials are sufficient to obtain good reliability [ICC sup 0. 7; CoR inf 2 standard deviation (SD) ] for most of the spatio-temporal variables. All body angles showed good reliability (ICC sup 0. 7) and low CoR (inf 2 SD) after five trials except for the pelvic angles. The reliability of marker positioning was found to be good (ICC sup 0. 7) to excellent (ICC sup 0. 9). Differences between angles measured using 3 DGA and angles measured with a manual goniometer were found to be less than one percent. Conclusion: The present study shows that most of variables obtained using 3 DGA in hip OA patients are reliable. Moreover, for most variables, 5 - 10 trials are needed to obtain good reliability and to overcome intrinsic variability, rather than 30 or more, thus improving the feasibility of measurement.

40|$|The {{research}} objectives were:- 1. To {{review the}} literature {{to establish the}} factors which have traditionally been regarded as most crucial {{to the design of}} effectlve exhaust ventilation systems. 2. To design, construct, install and calibrate a wind tunnel. 3. To develop procedures for air velocity measurement followed by a comprehensive programme of aerodvnamic data collection and data analysis for a variety of conditions. The major research findings were:- a) The literature in the subject is inadequate. There is a particular need for a much greater understanding of the aerodynamics of the suction flow field. b) The discrepancies between the experimentally observed centre-line velocities and those predicted by conventional formulae are unacceptably large. c) There was little agreement between theoretically calculated and observed velocities in the suction zone of captor hoods. d) Improved empirical formulae for the prediction of centre-line velocity applicable to the classical geometrically shaped suction openings and the flanged condition could be (and were) derived. Further analysis of data revealed that: - i) Point velocity is directly proportional to the suction. flow rate and the ratio of the point velocity to the average face velocity is constant. ii) Both shape, and size of the suction opening are significant factors as the coordinates of their points govern the extent of the effect of the suction flow field. iii) The hypothetical ellipsoidal potential function and hyperbolic streamlines were found experimentally to be correct. iv) The effect of guide plates depends on the size, shape and the <b>angle</b> of <b>fitting.</b> The effect was to very approximately double the suction velocity but the exact effect is difficult to predict. v) The axially symmetric openings produce practically symmetric flow fields. Similarity of connection pieces between the suction opening and the main duct in each case is essential in order to induce a similar suction flow field. Additionally a pilot study was made in which an artificial extraneous air flow was created, measured and its interaction with the suction flow field measured and represented graphically...|$|R
40|$|Purpose We {{present a}} new Bloch-Siegert fOur Angle Saturation Transfer (BOAST) method for {{measuring}} the creatine kinase first-order effectiverate constant kf in human myocardium at 7 tesla. BOAST combines {{a variant of the}} four-angle saturation transfer (FAST) method using amplitudemodulated RF pulses, phosphorus Bloch-Siegert B 1 +-mapping to determine the per-voxel flip <b>angles,</b> and non-linear <b>fitting</b> to Bloch simulations for post-processing. Methods Optimal flip-angles and repetition time parameters were determined from Monte Carlo simulations. BOAST was validated in the calf muscleof 2 volunteers at 3 T and 7 T. The myocardial creatine kinase forward rate constant was then measured in 10 volunteers at 7 T in 82 minutes (after 1 H localisation). Results BOAST kfCK values were 0. 281 ± 0. 002 s- 1 in the calf and 0. 35 ± 0. 05 s- 1 in myocardium. These are consistent with literature values from lower fields. Using a literature values for ATP concentration, we computed creatine kinase flux values of 4. 55 ± 1. 52 mmol kg- 1 s- 1. The sensitive volume for BOAST depends on the B 1 inhomogeneity of the transmit coil. Conclusion BOAST enables measurement of the creatine kinase rate constant in the human heart at 7 T with spatial localization in three dimensions to 5. 6 mL voxels using a 10 cm loop coil. </p...|$|R
