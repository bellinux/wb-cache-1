5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter</b> and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic primary for the 2010 United States Senate {{election}} in Pennsylvania {{took place on}} May 18, 2010, when Congressman Joe Sestak defeated incumbent <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter,</b> {{which led to the}} end of Specter's five-term Senatorial career. Just {{prior to the start of}} the primary campaign, after serving in the Senate as a Republican for 29 years, Specter had switched to the Democratic Party in anticipation of a difficult primary challenge by Pat Toomey; Sestak was ultimately defeated by Toomey in the general election. Political observers and journalists described the race between Specter and Sestak as one of the bitterest and most watched of all the 2010 primary elections.|$|E

5000|$|Actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, {{frequently}} {{appears in}} political advertising to support candidates {{with a history}} of supporting embryonic stem cell research. In 2004, Fox appeared in a television commercial for Republican <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter's</b> 2004 Senate campaign. In the commercial, sponsored by Specter's re-election campaign, Fox says Specter [...] "gets it" [...] and Specter's voice is heard saying [...] "there is hope." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD, Richard McCormack {{was recruited}} by the House Republican Conference for special projects and to help coordinate the summer intern program. Subsequently, he joined the Peace Corps staff, where he helped lead a project to build 1,000 Peace Corps schools in the third world. In 1967, <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter’s</b> mayoralty campaign recruited McCormack to draft a major paper on proposals for improving race relations in Philadelphia.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, Isenhour and Rooney {{met with}} MSNBC news {{commentator}} Chris Matthews {{to discuss the}} possibility of Matthews running against Republican U.S. Senator <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter,</b> although he ultimately did not run. Also that year, Isenhour and her Republican counterpart Luke Bernstein, {{executive director of the}} Republican Party of Pennsylvania, together taught a class about presidential elections at the Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Isenhour and Bernstein both believed it was the first class of its type, and said the two had a very cordial relationship despite representing opposite political parties. Isenhour also taught about electoral politics at other educational institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, Central Penn College and The Washington Center.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down some of the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter</b> for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter</b> was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E
40|$|In {{traditional}} media outlets, on the Internet, {{and throughout}} the halls of Congress, debate about whether the Supreme Court {{should be required to}} televise its public proceedings is becoming more audible and focused. To date, these discussions have included such topics as the potential effects of broadcasting the Court, the constitutionality of Senator <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter’s</b> current congressional initiative, S. 344, and how the public would use or abuse televised sessions of our highest tribunal...|$|R
5000|$|Schwartz {{occasionally}} {{clashed with}} Mayor Frank Rizzo. When Schwartz refused to join Rizzo in opposing <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter's</b> 1973 {{bid for a}} third term as District Attorney, Rizzo ordered his Police Commissioner to form a special hand-picked 34-member police squad to spy on Schwartz. He would {{come to be known}} by the nickname [...] "the silver fox" [...] while he was serving on Council, due to his graying hair, distinguished figure and political clout.|$|R

Scaturro {{is currently working on a}} book about the Alabama Claims dispute between the United States and Great Britain following the Civil War, and how the ensuing arbitration inspired international peacekeeping efforts in future generations.|$|R
2500|$|During the 2004 {{election}} season, Frist {{employed the}} unprecedented political tactic {{of going to}} the home state of the opposition party's minority leader, Democrat Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and actively campaigning against him. Daschle's Republican opponent, John Thune, defeated Daschle. In Daschle's farewell address, Frist arrived late. The two men have since found common ground and work together at the Bipartisan Policy Center and often speak together for healthcare conventions and events. After the 2004 elections, amid the controversy over <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter's</b> post-election remarks, [...] Frist demanded a public statement from Specter to repudiate his earlier remarks and pledge support for Bush's judiciary nominees. Frist rejected an early version of the statement as too weak, and gave his approval to the statement that Specter eventually delivered.|$|R

5000|$|Zev Chafets, {{whose book}} Rush Limbaugh: An Army of One was {{published}} May 25, 2010, wrote {{after the first}} primaries of the 2010 U.S. election season that Limbaugh was [...] "the brains and the spirit behind" [...] the Republican Party's [...] "resurgence" [...] {{in the wake of}} the 2008 election of President Barack Obama. In his May 20, 2010, New York Times op-ed column, Chafets pointed among others to Sen. <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter's</b> defeat, after being labeled by Limbaugh [...] "Republican in Name Only," [...] and to Sarah Palin, whose [...] "biggest current applause line—Republicans are not just the party of no, but the party of hell no—came courtesy of Mr. Limbaugh." [...] More generally, Chafets wrote, Limbaugh has argued the party-of-no Ronald Reagan conservative course for the Republicans vigorously, notably since six weeks after the Obama inauguration, and has been fundamental to, and encouraging to, the more prominently noted Tea Party movement.|$|R
50|$|The party {{held the}} {{governorship}} from 2003 to 2011 {{with the election}} of Ed Rendell in 2002 and his re-election in 2006. The party lost control of the governorship following the election of Republican state Attorney General Tom Corbett in 2010.

25|$|When the new Senate {{was first}} sworn in, {{the balance was}} 58–41 {{in favor of the}} Democrats, because of the {{unresolved}} Senate election in Minnesota. The defection of Republican <b>Arlen</b> <b>Specter</b> of Pennsylvania in April 2009 and the swearing-in of Democrat Al Franken of Minnesota in July 2009 brought the balance to 60–40.
