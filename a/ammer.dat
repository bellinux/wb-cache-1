Deeming the word [...] "you" [...] as moderating the imperative, Sussex stated that the word [...] "you" [...] causes the phrase to seem like a mixture of a command and a hope. He wrote that using [...] "you" [...] in imperatives is more common with people under 25. In her 2001 book The Facts on File Dictionary of Clichés, Christina <b>Ammer</b> wrote about the growing usage of [...] "have a good meal" [...] in restaurants. <b>Ammer</b> opined that the phrase [...] "induces teeth-gnashing irritation when voiced by a particularly incompetent waiter".|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, American English {{professor}} Robert L. Chapman, in {{his book}} American Slang, wrote that the phrase [...] "out of left field" [...] was in use by 1953.

60|$|About half-way up {{we passed}} Ettal, at the {{entrance}} to the Valley of the <b>Ammer.</b> The great white temple, standing, surrounded by its little village, high up amid the mountain solitudes, is a famous place of pilgrimage among devout Catholics. Many hundreds of years ago, one of the early Bavarian kings built here a monastery as a shrine for a miraculous image of the Virgin that had been sent down to him from Heaven to help him when, in a foreign land, he had stood sore in need, encompassed by his enemies. Maybe the stout arms and hearts of his Bavarian friends were of some service in the crisis also; but the living helpers were forgotten. The old church and monastery, which latter was a sort of ancient Chelsea Hospital for decayed knights, was destroyed one terrible night some hundred and fifty years ago by a flash of lightning; but the wonder-working image was rescued unhurt, and may still be seen and worshipped beneath the dome of the present much less imposing church which has been reared upon the ruins of its ancestor.|$|E
60|$|In {{the island}} of Goram, only eight or ten miles long, there are about a dozen Rajahs, {{scarcely}} better off {{than the rest of}} the inhabitants, and exercising a mere nominal sway, except when any order is received from the Dutch Government, when, being backed by a higher power, they show a little more strict authority. My friend the Rajah of <b>Ammer</b> (commonly called Rajah of Goram) told me that a few years ago, before the Dutch had interfered in the affairs of the island, the trade was not carried on so peaceably as at present, rival praus often fighting when on the way to the same locality, or trafficking in the same village. Now such a thing is never thought of-one of the good effects of the superintendence of a civilized government. Disputes between villages are still, however, sometimes settled by fighting, and I one day saw about fifty men, carrying long guns and heavy cartridge-belts, march through the village. They had come from the other side of the island on some question of trespass or boundary, and were prepared for war if peaceable negotiations should fail.|$|E

The {{celestial}} powers seem to have at once closed with this offer. The plague disappeared as if by magic, and every recurring tenth year since, the Ober-Ammergauites have kept their promise and played their Passion Play. They act it to this day as a pious observance. Before each performance all the characters gather together on the stage around their pastor, and, kneeling, pray for a blessing upon the work then about to commence. The profits that are made, after paying the performers a wage that just compensates them for their loss of time--wood-carver Maier, who plays the Christ, only receives about fifty pounds for the whole of the thirty or so performances given during the season, to say nothing of the winter's rehearsals--is put aside, part for the temporal benefit of the community, and the rest for the benefit of the Church. From burgomaster down to shepherd lad, from the Mary and the Jesus down to the meanest super, all work for the love of their religion, not for money. Each one feels that he is helping forward the cause of Christianity." ...|$|E
