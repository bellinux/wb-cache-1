When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the <b>angular</b> <b>motion,</b> sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A {{theoretical}} {{study was}} made of the <b>angular</b> <b>motions</b> of spinning bodies in space. The analysis was based on Euler's dynamic equations which were linearized and solved analytically. The results of the study are directly applicable only to spin-stabilized vehicles with constant moments of inertia and angular displacements not exceeding about 15 °. Simple analytical expressions were obtained which relate <b>angular</b> <b>motions</b> to spin-rate and inertia distributions for a given disturbance. Consideration was given to the effects produced by having artificial damping in the system. The study included numerical examples and comparisons of analytical solutions with machine solutions of exact dynamic equations. The analysis indicated that <b>angular</b> <b>motions</b> are sensitive to inertia distributions. In considering a rectangular-pulse pitching moment, {{it was found that the}} residual motion was very sensitive to the time at which the moment was removed. Artificial damping due to a perfect proportional control system seemed to be more advantageous to pencil-like configurations than to disk-like configurations.

5|$|The {{distance}} to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years (with an accuracy of ±5 light years). The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This is the small <b>angular</b> <b>motion</b> of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.|$|E
25|$|A typical gait {{analysis}} laboratory {{has several}} cameras (video and / or infrared) placed around a walkway or a treadmill, which {{are linked to}} a computer. The patient has markers located at various points of reference of the body (e.g., iliac spines of the pelvis, ankle malleolus, and the condyles of the knee), or groups of markers applied to half of the body segments. The patient walks down the catwalk or the treadmill and the computer calculates the trajectory of each marker in three dimensions. A model is applied to calculate {{the movement of the}} underlying bones. This gives a complete breakdown of the movement of each joint. One common method is to use Helen Hayes Hospital marker set, in which a total of 15 markers are attached on the lower body. The 15 marker motions are analyzed analytically, and it provides <b>angular</b> <b>motion</b> of each joint.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the closed-form modeling of an XY flexure-based nano-manipulator developed {{in our previous}} work [28]. In this nano-manipulator, the flexure hinges are arranged in SIS configurations to transmit linear or <b>angular</b> <b>motions.</b> Analytical modeling reveals that the lever’s compliance significantly increases the estimation error. Thus, a threshold is proposed {{to determine whether the}} lever’s compliance can be neglected or not. Subsequently, a systematic modeling methodology is established to investigate the behavior of the nano-manipulator during linear and <b>angular</b> <b>motions.</b> Experimental results show that the modeling accuracy is significantly improved if the influence of the lever’s compliance, the contact stiffness, and the load mass is taken into consideration.|$|R

The angle between the distant spacecraft will vary by about one degree {{in the course of a}} year. In addition the send and receive directions, for any one telescope, will also vary because of changes in distance, relative velocities of the spacecraft and the flight time of the light. All of these (<b>angular)</b> <b>motions</b> place requirements on the telescope pointing mechanism and the compensating proof mass motions. In this paper we will present the magnitudes of these <b>angular</b> <b>motions,</b> within the context of Keplerian orbits, and the resulting image motions on the detectors...|$|R

500|$|The first {{generalization}} of Newton's theorem {{was discovered by}} Mahomed and Vawda in 2000. As Newton did, they assumed that the <b>angular</b> <b>motion</b> of the second particle was k times faster {{than that of the}} first particle, [...] In contrast to Newton, however, Mahomed and Vawda did not require that the radial motion of the two particles be the same, [...] Rather, they required that the inverse radii be related by a linear equation ...|$|E
500|$|In other words, the {{application}} of an arbitrary central force F(r) to a nearly circular elliptical orbit can accelerate the <b>angular</b> <b>motion</b> by the factor k without affecting the radial motion significantly. If an elliptical orbit is stationary, the particle rotates about the center of force by 180° as it moves {{from one end of}} the long axis to the other (the two apses). Thus, the corresponding apsidal angle α for a general central force equals k×180°, using the general law [...]|$|E
500|$|In {{classical}} mechanics, Newton's theorem of revolving orbits {{identifies the}} type of central force needed to multiply the angular speed of a particle by a factor k without affecting its radial motion (Figures1 and 2). Newton applied his theorem to understanding the overall rotation of orbits (apsidal precession, Figure3) that is observed for the Moon and planets. The term [...] "radial motion" [...] signifies the motion towards or away {{from the center of}} force, whereas the <b>angular</b> <b>motion</b> is perpendicular to the radial motion.|$|E
40|$|Helicopter drop {{tests were}} made of models of the Pioneer Venus probe descent {{configurations}} to characterize their unsteady forces and angular dynamics in equilibrium descent. The axial and normal forces {{were found to be}} unsteady in magnitude by about 10 and 5 % of the mean axial force, respectively. A cycle of the axial variation takes place in flight distances of from 15 to 40 diameters. The unsteadiness almost certainly is associated with the wake. <b>Angular</b> <b>motions</b> which do not converge to zero angle of attack even in very long duration descent are excited by the unsteady pitching moments. The nearly spherical large probe model was aerodynamically more unsteady than the round-nosed conical small probe model.

500|$|Vera Florence Cooper Rubin (July 23, 1928 – December 25, 2016) was an American {{astronomer}} who pioneered work on galaxy rotation rates. She {{uncovered the}} discrepancy between the predicted <b>angular</b> <b>motion</b> of galaxies and the observed motion, by studying galactic rotation curves. This phenomenon became known as the galaxy rotation problem, and was evidence of the existence of dark matter. Although initially met with skepticism, Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades. Her legacy was described by The New York Times as [...] "ushering in a Copernican-scale change" [...] in cosmological theory.|$|E
500|$|Wishing {{to avoid}} {{controversial}} areas of astronomy, including quasars and galactic motion, Rubin {{began to study}} the rotation and outer reaches of galaxies, an interest sparked by her collaboration with the Burbidges. She investigated the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, again beginning with Andromeda, by looking at their outermost material, and observed flat rotation curves: the outermost components of the galaxy were moving as quickly as those close to the center. This was an early indication that spiral galaxies were surrounded by dark matter haloes. She further uncovered {{the discrepancy between the}} predicted <b>angular</b> <b>motion</b> of galaxies based on the visible light and the observed motion. [...] Her research showed that spiral galaxies rotate quickly enough that they should fly apart, if the gravity of their constituent stars was all that was holding them together; because they stay intact, a large amount of unseen mass must be holding them together, a conundrum that became known as the galaxy rotation problem.|$|E

The LATDYN program is a tool for analyzing the controlled or uncontrolled dynamic transient behavior of interconnected deformable multi-body systems which can undergo large <b>angular</b> <b>motions</b> of each body relative other bodies. The program accommodates large structural deformation as well as large rigid body rotations and is applicable, but not limited to, the following areas: (1) development of large flexible space structures; (2) slewing of large space structure components; (3) mechanisms with rigid or elastic components; and (4) robotic manipulations of beam members. Presently the program is limited to two dimensional problems, but in many cases, three dimensional problems can be exactly or approximately reduced to two dimensions. The program uses convected finite elements to affect the large <b>angular</b> <b>motions</b> involved in the analysis. General geometry is permitted. Detailed user input and output specifications are provided and discussed with example runstreams. To date, LATDYN has been configured for CDC/NOS and DEC VAX/VMS machines.
