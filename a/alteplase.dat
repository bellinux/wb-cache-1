2500|$|Ischemic stroke {{occurs because}} of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, {{initiating}} the ischemic cascade. Brain tissue ceases to function if deprived of oxygen for more than 60 to 90 seconds, and after approximately three hours will suffer irreversible injury possibly leading {{to the death of}} the tissue, i.e., infarction. (This is why fibrinolytics such as <b>alteplase</b> are given only until three hours since the onset of the stroke.) Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow, by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel, or by releasing showers of small emboli through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques. Embolic infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atrial fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries, break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and block brain blood vessels. Since blood vessels in the brain are now blocked, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts into using anaerobic metabolism within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism produces less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but releases a by-product called lactic acid. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal acid-base balance in the brain.

Henry# ABSTRACT: Recent guidelines recommend bolus-dose <b>alteplase</b> for treating massive pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the safest and most effective treatment is as yet unknown. In the present study, a meta-analysis of published studies of <b>alteplase</b> infusion, bolus-dose <b>alteplase</b> and streptokinase was performed. The outcome measures were as follows: objective assessment of thrombolysis; all-cause mortality; deaths due to initial PE, major bleeding episodes and recurrent PE; and morbidity. In total, 26 studies were identified; however, only two comparative studies of <b>alteplase</b> infusion versus either bolus-dose <b>alteplase</b> or streptokinase were found. Meta-analysis revealed {{no significant difference between the}} three regimens, but was compromised by a paucity of data. Crude analysis of summated data on thrombolytic efficacy from all studies revealed that <b>alteplase</b> infusion was more effective than bolus-dose <b>alteplase</b> (relative risk (RR) : 1. 95; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 19 – 3. 2), whereas streptokinase was more effective than <b>alteplase</b> infusion (RR: 1. 27; 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 1. 47). <b>Alteplase</b> infusion had a lower mortality due to the initial PE than bot...|$|E
40|$|Tissue type {{plasminogen}} activator is available, through recombinant technology, for thrombolytic use as <b>alteplase.</b> <b>Alteplase</b> {{is relatively}} clot specific and should cause less bleeding side effects than the non-specific agents such as streptokinase. <b>Alteplase</b> {{has been used}} successfully in evolving myocardial infarction (MI) to reopen occluded coronary arteries. It is probably equally effective or superior to streptokinase in opening arteries and reducing mortality in Mi. <b>Alteplase</b> is most effective when given early in Mi and is probably ineffective when given 12 h after the onset of symptoms. The effectiveness of <b>alteplase</b> in Mi can be increased by front loading with a bolus of 15 mg, followed by an infusion of 50 mg over 30 min and 35 mg over 60 min.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (<b>alteplase)</b> on the clinical course, angiographic changes and the outcome of subsequent coronary angioplasty, 36 patients with angina at rest, despite bedrest and medical treatment including heparin, and with concomitant ECG changes, were studied. After diagnostic angiography, patients were randomized to receive either <b>alteplase</b> 100 mg in 3 h (19 patients), or placebo (17 patients).

40|$|CONTEXT: Incorrect dosing of <b>alteplase</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with worse clinical outcomes in patients. However, patients at high risk of adverse events are more prone to dosing errors, thus confounding this relationship. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the association between incorrect dosing of <b>alteplase</b> and adverse outcomes is related to cause and effect or to confounding. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Observational analysis in May 2004 of a double-blind, double-dummy trial of 16, 949 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT- 2) trial and were assigned to either a bolus of tenecteplase (with <b>alteplase</b> placebo bolus plus infusion) or a bolus of <b>alteplase</b> (with tenecteplase placebo plus infusion). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thirty-day mortality, in-hospital stroke, and major bleeding associated with incorrect dosing of active <b>alteplase</b> compared with placebo <b>alteplase.</b> RESULTS: Incorrect dosing occurred in 4. 9 % of patients who received active <b>alteplase</b> and in 4. 6 % of patients who received <b>alteplase</b> placebo. Patients receiving incorrect doses of <b>alteplase</b> or <b>alteplase</b> placebo {{were more likely to be}} older, female, black, shorter, have lower body weight and systolic blood pressure, and have a higher Killip class at presentation. Thirty-day mortality was higher in patients who received an overdose (9. 8 %) or underdose (19. 5 %) of <b>alteplase</b> compared with those who received a correct dose (5. 4 %). The same pattern was present in patients who received an <b>alteplase</b> placebo (10. 0 % for overdose, 23. 5 % for underdose, and 5. 4 % for correct dose). Similar patterns were seen for in-hospital intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding. The higher rates of adverse outcomes with incorrect dosing were largely accounted for by adjusting for baseline characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between incorrect dosing and patient outcome in ASSENT- 2 is primarily due to confounding factors rather than incorrect dosing itself. These data highlight the need for caution when ascribing a causal relationship to associations between incorrect dosing and adverse outcomes. status: publishe...|$|E

For a control group, we used patients contemporaneously treated with sub– 3 -hour 0. 9 mg/kg IV <b>alteplase</b> following standard selection criteria. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24 -hour perfusion/angiographic imaging with CT or MRI. Eligibility criteria for tenecteplase (but not <b>alteplase)</b> treatment included a perfusion lesion at least 20 % greater than the infarct core, with an associated vessel occlusion. Primary outcomes, assessed blind to treatment group, were reperfusion (reduction in baseline– 24 -hour mean transit time lesion) and major vessel recanalization. Results: Fifteen patients received tenecteplase, and 35 patients received <b>alteplase.</b> The tenecteplase group had greater reperfusion (mean 74 % vs 44 % in the <b>alteplase</b> group, p = 0. 01) and major vessel recanalization (10 / 15 tenecteplase vs 7 / 29 <b>alteplase,</b> p = 0. 01). Despite later time to treatment, more tenecteplase patients (10 / 15 vs 7 / 35 <b>alteplase,</b> p = 0. 001) had major neurologic improvement at 24 hours (NIH Stroke Scale reduction ≥ 8).

In the coregistered mismatch patients, of whom 45 received <b>alteplase</b> and 43 received placebo, the primary outcome measure of geometric mean infarct growth was significantly attenuated by a ratio of 0. 58 with <b>alteplase</b> compared to placebo (1. 02 vs 1. 77; 95 % CI, 0. 33 – 0. 99; P= 0. 0459). When using coregistration techniques to determine the presence of mismatch at study entry, <b>alteplase</b> significantly attenuated infarct growth. This highlights the necessity for a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial of <b>alteplase</b> using penumbral selection beyond 3 hours...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—It {{remains unknown}} whether {{the effects of}} 0. 6 mg/kg <b>alteplase</b> differ with {{occlusion}} site of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). We therefore evaluated the effects of 0. 6 mg/kg intravenous <b>alteplase</b> in patients with different sites of MCA occlusion. Methods—An exploratory analysis was made of 57 patients enrolled in the Japan <b>Alteplase</b> Clinical Trial II (J-ACT II), originally designed to evaluate 0. 6 mg/kg <b>alteplase</b> in Japanese patients with unilateral occlusion of the MCA (M 1 or M 2 portion). The residual vessel length (in mm), determined by pretreatment magnetic resonance angiography, was used to reflect the occluded site. The proportions of patients with valid recanalization (modified Mori grade 2 to 3) at 6 an...|$|E

However, the drug is usually indicated for use in patients aged < 81 years due to insufficient literature regarding the drug&# 39;s safety in older individuals. Nevertheless, the elderly can benefit from <b>alteplase</b> after they experience an acute ischemic stroke. Age differences have been observed in the clinical presentation of acute ischemic stroke; however, the safety and efficacy of <b>alteplase</b> for patients with acute ischemic stroke do not depend on age or sex. Evidence of an increasing rate of intracerebral hemorrhage among the elderly with acute ischemic stroke, following <b>alteplase</b> treatment, has not been reported. Severe intracranial hemorrhage is a known side effect of <b>alteplase</b> but is not associated with age in patients with acute ischemic stroke. <b>Alteplase</b> can be used safely and effectively to treat elderly patients who suffer an acute ischemic stroke, including those {{over the age of}} 80 years.

40|$|Background—Thrombolytic {{therapy with}} {{intravenous}} <b>alteplase</b> within 4. 5 hours of ischemic stroke onset increases the overall likelihood of an excellent outcome (no, or nondisabling, symptoms). Any improvement in functional outcome distribution has value, and herein we provide {{an assessment of}} the effect of <b>alteplase</b> on the distribution of the functional level by treatment delay, age, and stroke severity. Methods—Prespecified pooled analysis of 6756 patients from 9 randomized trials comparing <b>alteplase</b> versus placebo/open control. Ordinal logistic regression models assessed treatment differences after adjustment for treatment delay, age, stroke severity, and relevant interaction term(s). Results—Treatment with <b>alteplase</b> was beneficial for a delay in treatment extending to 4. 5 hours after stroke onset, with a greater benefit with earlier treatment. Neither age nor stroke severity significantly influenced the slope of the relationship between benefit and time to treatment initiation. For the observed case mix of patients treated within 4. 5 hours of stroke onset (mean 3 hours and 20 minutes), the net absolute benefit from <b>alteplase</b> (ie, the difference between those who would do better if given <b>alteplase</b> and those who would do worse) was 55 patients per 1000 treated (95...|$|E
