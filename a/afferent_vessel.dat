Methods: : Seven patients with age-related macular degeneration underwent an RPE-choroid graft translocation in a prospective institutional cohort study. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) {{was used to measure}} the revascularization stage. With PRD-OCT the presence of flow was imaged postoperatively. Results: : The PRD-OCT confirmed flow in three patients when SD-OCT indicated the <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> ingrowth stage, and in all seven patients when the SD-OCT indicated the efferent vessel ingrowth stage.

40|$|PURPOSE: The authors {{evaluated}} {{the usefulness of}} three-dimensional rotational angiography (3 DRA) in surgical planning and postoperative evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 111 consecutive aneurysms in 100 patients (32 emergency referrals due to haemorrhage) were evaluated with 3 DRA {{over a period of}} 3 years. The rotational study was always performed with a single injection of 20 cc of contrast agent in the <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> after diagnostic cerebral angiography in the two orthogonal projections. Three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained for the pre- and postoperative assessment. RESULTS: Three-dimensional RA provides a virtual view of the surgical field with the same orientation required for the surgical approach and, compared with surgical findings, reliably defined location, orientation, morphology and relationship with parent vessels of the aneurysm in all cases. Postoperatively, it allowed better assessment of any residual lesion and of the relationship between surgical clips and parent vessels, compared with standard 2 D angiography. CONCLUSIONS: 3 DRA is a reliable method for preliminary assessment of cerebral aneurysms undergoing surgery. It provides multiple projections with a preview of the surgical field and study of lesion characteristics, which can help achieve faster and safer surgery. Compared with 2 D angiography, the 3 D model, with its multiple views, allows better assessment of postoperative outcomes.

40|$|Background. Lots of {{articles}} describe structure of lymph nodes with blood in their sinuses, {{but there are}} still many controversies between them due to the absence of single system of classification. Objective. The purpose of this work was to characterize the structure of human atypical lymph nodes and offer the new system of their classification. Methods. Atypical lymph nodes were taken during autopsy from patients who died due to cardiovascular or respiratory pathology. Standard histological methods were used including staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Results. Based on comparative morphological study we subdivided all atypical lymph nodes into three subtypes. I - Hemolymph node – it receives mixture of blood and lymph; during filtration through the system of sinuses all erythrocytes are eliminated, while efferent lymph vessels receive pure lymph. Such nodes are usually revealed close to kidneys and spleen. II – Hemal nodes – they receive blood through direct communication between blood vessels and sinuses; {{depending on the type of}} <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> they are further subdivided into arterial and venous. Their efferent vessels contain blood with comparatively high content of leukocytes. III – Hyperemic lymph node – there are no afferent vessels bringing blood to the sinuses, but there are lots of dilated blood vessels with signs of hemoconcentration. All atypical lymph nodes contain different number of extravasated erythrocytes, assuming the possibility to filtrate blood antigens. Conclusion. Analyzing different types of human lymph nodes we offer a new system of their classification; the major criteria are summarized in the article. Citation: Pototska OYu, Lapsar HS.

40|$|Abstract:- This study adopts {{numerical}} simulation {{to discuss the}} fluid flow inside the stented lateral aneurysm arising from the straight parent vessel. The implicit solver {{was based on the}} time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of laminar flow. Solutions were generated by a cell-center finite-volume method that used second order upwind and second order center flux difference splitting for the convection and diffusion term, respectively. The second order Crank-Nicolson method was used in the time integration term. To handle the pressure-velocity coupling the SIMPLEC algorithm was adopted. Complementary flow visualization was performed to validate the numerical code. The straight <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> had an inner diameter 10 mm. The diameters of the aneurysmal orifice, neck, and fundus were 14 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, respectively, and the distance between the orifice and dome measured 20 mm. A 30 mm long helix-shaped stent with four blocking ratios of 0 %, 30 %, 50 %, 75 % were examined. The density and dynamic viscosity of working fluid were 1050 kg/m 3 and 3. 5 cp, respectively. Human volume flow rate waveform of the posterior carotid artery was considered with maximum Reynolds number of 250 and Wormersley number of 3. 9. Computational results are presented in terms of the pulsatile main and secondary flow velocity vector fields, inflow velocity (IV) into the aneurysm, and the distributions of wall shear rate (WSR), and wall tension stress. It is found that as the blocking ratio increases, both the IV and WSR decrease exponentially. In general, the hemodynamic flow patterns and parameters examined are found to change favorably for the formation of thrombosis after stenting...|$|E

VAAs embolization was performed using Squid, pushable (MReye, Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA) or detachable coils (Interlock, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) of variable diameter and length, and in particular cases, also Amplatzer Vascular Plugs (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA). The target artery and the nidus of AVMs were embolized using PVA particles, Squid, and in particular cases also coils. One Amplatzer plug was used only in one case of a giant AVM needing a simultaneous transfemoral arterial and transjugular approach: the plug was placed to occlude the right gonadic vein to simultaneously reduce the AVM outflow and to avoid further episodes of pulmonary embolisms (metastatic chorioncarcinoma conditioning giant pelvic AVM, pulmonary metastases and embolisms). Type 2 endoleaks were embolized using Squid alone after catheterization of the superior mesenteric artery or the hypogastric artery with standard 4 -French angiographic catheters (Cobra, Simmons) and subsequent advancement of a coaxial microcatheter through Riolano arch-inferior mesenteric artery or ileo-lumbar artery, respectively. Preoperative embolization of the target artery was performed usually 1 day before surgery in case of giant masses or hypervascular tumors or pulmonary sequestration (Avsenik et al., 2015) using Squid and PVA (Amplatzer plug) to minimize the bleeding risk during surgery. Squid was used as embolic agent with PVA in case of acute arterial bleeding due to traumatic or iatrogenic large arterial rupture. Finally Squid was also used with coils using a transjugular approach to embolize distal branches of hypogastric veins in case of female varicocele conditioning a pelvic congestion syndrome after a preliminary phlebography performed with 4 -French standard angiographic catheters (Headhunter, Cobra).|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{usefulness}} of power Doppler (PD), a new color Doppler ultrasonography technique, namely {{in the diagnosis}} and management of hypoechoic thyroid nodules in comparison with color Doppler (CD) is investigated in this study. Patients and methods: 157 hypoechoic thyroid nodules were studied by CD and PD. The distribution of vascular patterns was compared with the results obtained at cytology and/or histology. Results: Three characteristic PD patterns were found: type A=ring sign, defined as the perilesional vascular signal; type B=complex ring sign, subdivided into B 1 for the perilesional and moderate intralesional vascular signal with regular vessels course and B 2 for the perilesional and high intralesional vascularization, with anarchic structure and winding vessels course; C=delta sign, defined as a small vascular perilesional halo with a large <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> and winding course and flow. All tumors, benign and malignant, showed a pattern type B 2, except one which showed a pattern type C and another with a type B 1. All the lesions with patterns A and B 1 were hyperplasias. Forty-six hyperplastic lesions showed a pattern B 2 : in these cases the analysis of flow indices predicted the negative cytology. In fact, Doppler measurements showed that all 117 nodules with CD pattern type II and III had systolic peak velocity (Pv) 50 cm/s and 9 / 10 had RI 50 cm/s and among these, four had RI> 0. 75 and two 0. 75. In this series of 157 thyroid nodules, both sensitivity and specificity of PD were higher than CD technique (95 % versus 75 % and 66. 4 % versus 38. 7 %).

The purpose of this study was to investigate geometrical changes caused by closed-cell design stents in bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms. 31 patients with 34 aneurysms underwent SACE with closed-cell design stents. Inflow angle α, determined by aneurysm neck and <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel,</b> and angle between afferent and efferent vessel close to (δ 1), respectively, more remote from the aneurysm neck (δ 2) were graphically determined in 2 D angiography projections. Stent assisted coiling resulted in a significant increase of all three angles from a mean value (±SEM) of α = 119 ° (± 6. 5 °) pretreatment to 130 ° (± 6. 6 °) posttreatment (P ≤. 001), δ 1 = 129 ° (± 6. 4 °) to 139 ° (± 6. 1 °), (P ≤. 001) and δ 2 = 115 ° (± 8. 4 °) to 126 ° (± 7. 5 °), (P ≤. 01). Angular change of δ 1 in AcomA aneurysms was significant greater compared to sidewall aneurysms (26 °± 4. 9 ° versus 8 °± 2. 3 °, P ≤. 05). The initial angle of δ 1 and δ 2 revealed a significantly inverse relationship to the angle increase (δ 1 : r = - 0. 41, P ≤. 05 and δ 2 : r = - 0. 47, P ≤. 01). Moreover, angle δ 1 was significantly higher in unruptured compared to ruptured aneurysms (135 °± 7. 1 ° versus 103 °± 10. 8 °, P ≤. 05). Stent deployment modulates the geometry of the aneurysm-vessel complex, which may lead to favorable hemodynamic changes more similar to unruptured than to ruptured aneurysms. Our findings also suggest that the more acute-angled aneurysm-vessel anatomy, the larger the angular change. Further studies are needed to investigate whether these changes improve the clinical outcome...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} history of {{anatomical}} research, starting with John Hunter and Astley Cooper, into the arterial anastomosis at the knee and uses dissection to determine the reality. The final draft is available below. (Ann R Coll Surg Engl. 2013 Sep; 95 (6) : 405 - 9) INTRODUCTION Textbook representations of the genicular arterial anastomosis show a large direct communication between the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (DBLCFA) and a genicular branch of the popliteal artery {{but this is not}} compatible with clinical experience. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the arterial anastomosis at the knee is sufficient, in the event of traumatic disruption of the superficial femoral artery, to infuse protective agents or to place a stent to restore flow to the lower leg. METHODS Dissection of ten cadaveric lower limbs was performed to photograph the arterial anatomy from the inguinal ligament to the tibial tubercle. Anastomosis with branches of the popliteal artery was classified as: ‘direct communication’, ‘approaching communication’ or ‘no evident communication’. RESULTS A constant descending artery in the lateral thigh (LDAT) was found to have five types of origin: Type 1 (2 / 10 limbs) involved the lateral circumflex femoral branch of the femoral artery, Type 2 (3 / 10 limbs) the lateral circumflex femoral branch of the profunda femoris artery, Type 3 (1 / 10 limbs) the femoral artery, Type 4 (3 / 10 limbs) the superficial femoral artery and Type 5 (2 / 10 limbs) the profunda femoris artery. In one limb, there were two descending arteries (Types 4 and 5). Collateral circulation at the knee was also variable: direct communicating vessels (3 / 10 limbs); approaching vessels with possible communication via capillaries (5 / 10 limbs); no evident communication (2 / 10 limbs). Communicating vessels, if present, are too small to provide immediate collateral circulation. CONCLUSIONS Modern representations of the genicular arterial anastomosis are inaccurate, derived commonly from an idealised image that first appeared Gray’s Anatomy in 1910. The <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> is not the DBLCFA. The majority of subjects have the potential to recruit collateral circulation via the LDAT following gradual obstruction to normal arterial flow, which may be important if the LDAT is removed for bypass or flap surgery. A direct communication is rarely present and is never as robust as generally depicted in textbooks...|$|E
40|$|A {{knowledge}} of the cerebral circulation is of great importance in the understanding cerebrovascular disease. The ability to visualize the brain vasculature has become key in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} cerebrovascular disease. Modern imaging modalities, such as digital subtraction angiography, computed tomography (CT) angiography and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, allow the in vivo examination of the patient in great detail. A novel completely noninvasive method to visualize cerebral perfusion is arterial spin labeling (ASL) MR imaging. Using ASL the water protons in the blood are magnetically labeled by radiofrequency pulses and, in this manner, are used as an endogenous tracer instead of contrast agents. In this thesis the possibilities of territorial and perfusion ASL MR imaging are described as well as its importance in studying the cerebral hemodynamics. Examination of the cerebral circulation in patients with ischemic stroke may be of crucial importance to differentiate between a thromboembolic and hemodynamic etiology. In patients with steno-occlusive carotid artery disease, collateralization is stimulated to maintain adequate oxygenation and cell function. Variability in the cerebral perfusion territories of the major brain feeding arteries requires therefore special consideration in these patients. Planning-free vessel encoded pseudo-continuous ASL (VE p-CASL) is a suitable general purpose territorial ASL (T-ASL) strategy for mapping cerebral perfusion territories in clinical MRI exams. It is a highly efficient method, since multiple vessels are labeled simultaneously, and requires a minimum amount of planning. VE p-CASL may be used to determine the possible contribution of collateral arteries, identify border zones, and, in combination with appropriate image processing, to detect areas with mixed perfusion. Cerebral hemodynamics may be further examined by combining perfusion ASL MR Imaging with a vasodilatory challenge. Cerebral hemodynamic impairment depends on the degree of stenosis in the <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel,</b> the presence of collateral vessels to provide additional blood flow, and the remaining autoregulatory function of the tissue. Autoregulative vasodilation maintains adequate cerebral blood flow during perfusion pressure fluctuations. Perfusion ASL measurements before and after a vasodilatory challenges may be used to evaluate the degree of hemodynamic impairment or more specifically to determine the remaining vasodilatory capacity of the terminal arterioles in afflicted brain parenchyma. Primary collateral pathways via the circle of Willis, as well as secondary collateral pathways such as leptomeningeal arteries, {{play an important role in}} the hemodynamic impairment of brain parenchyma in patients with steno-occlusive carotid artery disease. The influence of collateral pathways on cerebral hemodynamics can be investigated by relating the actual territory being supplied by these collaterals to the presence of hemodynamic impairment. Collateral blood flow is shown to be a sign of inadequate capacity of the major brain feeding arteries, especially in the case of secondary collateral blood flow, which signals sever hemodynamic impairment in patients with steno-occlusive carotid artery disease. The studies presented in this thesis investigated the use of ASL for imaging of cerebral hemodynamics. Research is still ongoing to establish its exact role in clinical practice, these studies however show ASL MR Imaging can visualize perfusion territories, determine primary and secondary collateral blood flow routes, and evaluate cerebral perfusion and hemodynamic impairment in patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease. ASL MR Imaging is still relatively uncommon outside of research groups, partly due to lack of support from vendors for clinical purposes. This may change due to increasing demands as ASL proves itself as a powerful non-invasive alternative to other modalities. Personalized medicine in the near future may possible include territorial and perfusion ASL MR Imaging to evaluate cerebral hemodynamic processes in individual patients...|$|E

40|$|As a {{lymphoid organ}} {{was found in}} the {{vascular}} system, its anatomical and histological structure was studied. The position of this organ differs slightly in the male and female. In the female, it is pressed by the ovary onto the upper anterior part of the liver. An afferent and many efferant vessels led in and out are observed. The former is connected with the antennal artery and runs along the anterior edge of the liver to be led ultimately into the organ. In the female, the <b>afferent</b> <b>vessel</b> passes through the ovary. It is composed of an endotherial cell layer and surrounding loose fibrous tissue. Mesodermal reticular cells are scattered in this fibrous tissue. The effernt vessels emarging from several places of this organ usually expand to form cysts but those emarging from the anterior external edge and from the interior edge are tubiform. The former are connected to {{the upper part of the}} leucopoietic organ, dorsal epidermis, gonads, etc. Tne latter are linked with the lymphoid vessels below the cardiac stomach. The cystiform vessels complicatedly bending around the organ are linked with the lymphoid vessels, but the one linked with the liver tunica penetrates the small openings of the tunica into the liver. The efferent vessels are composed of adventitia of longitudinally running fibers and the intima of endothelial cells. The affrent vessel is bifurcated progressively immediately after entering the organ, and each becomes the central artery of the sheath which is a structural unit of this organ. The spaces between the peri-arterial sheaths take the form of winding, interconnected sinuses. The wall of sinus is made up of sporadical endotherial cells and argyrophil lattice fibers. The pulp of this organ is the peri-arterial sheath which surrounds the bifurcated artery in the organ. The wall of the central artery is made up of a layer of flat endotherial cells in which interstices are found. The periarterial sheath is composed of free cells and interstitial tissues which consist of reticular tissue and fibrous tissues. In fibrous tissues, argyrophil fibers are distributed in flagments and concentrically with in the peri-arterial sheath, and collagenous fibers are distributed outside this layer of argyrophil fibers. The grater part of the free cells in the periarterial sheath are lymph-like cells and distributed mainly in the argyrophil fiber layer. In this ﻿fibrous layer, there are observed lymph-like cells which are belived to be their young cells. Moreover, these free cells are extruding into the arterial lumen through interstices in the endotherial cell layer. Lymph-like cells measure 2. 5 - 4. 0 μ in diameter and nuclei which are stained well by haematoxylin especially at the peripheries. Discoid free cells, measuring 6. 0 - 8. 0 μ in diameter and poorly stained by the haematoxylin can also be recognized in the sinuses. Comparing these free cells with the lymphocyte-type cells produced in leucopoietic organ, which resemble each other most closely, the lymph-like cells are clearly distinguishable from the lymphocyte-types, but free cells in the sinuses can not be distinguished from them. The lymph-like cells of the peri-arterial sheath frequently vary in quantity with the abnormal changes in the body. The peri-arterial sheath, as well as the central artery, is filled with lymph-like cells and their young cells. Besides this, the reticular cells of the peri-arterial sheath degeneratively bccome fibers and a large amount of granules appear in the fibers. It can be further confirmed that those cells are released into the central artery. コウライエビの循環系にリンパ様器官が存在するのが見つかったので,その形態について調べてみた。 1. 器官の位置は雌と雄とでは多少異っているが,雌では卵巣に圧迫されて肝臓先端の上縁に圧着されている。 2. この器官には 1 本の輸入管と多教の輸出管があり,輸入管は触角動脈に接続していて肝臓の上面にそって伸びリンパ様器官の門から器官内に進入している。雌ではこの輸入管が卵巣を貫ぬいている。また,輸入管は内皮細胞層とこれを包む疎性線維層からなっていて,線維層内には中胚葉性の細網細胞が散在している。輸出管は,器官の数ケ所から出ており大部分は嚢状となっている。しかし,器官の前方外側縁,および,内側縁からでている輸出管は管状をしていて,前者は造血器官の上,背部表皮,生殖巣等に連絡し,後者は噴門胃の下面にあるリンパ様管に連絡している。嚢状の輸出管は器官のまわりで複雑に屈曲しているがいづれもリンパ様管に接続している。肝臓の被膜につながっている嚢様管は被膜の細孔を通して肝臓内部と連絡している。輸出管は厚味が特にうすく縦走する膠原線維の外膜と内皮細胞層の内膜とからなつている。 3. 器官内に進入した輸入管は直ちに分枝して細かく分れ,各々は器官の単位構造である鞘組織の中心を走る動脈となっている。また,動脈鞘間は洞様管となっていてこれ等は鞘間を迂曲してたがいに連絡している。洞様管の管壁は断裂的な内皮細胞層と好銀性の細網組織からなっている。 4. この器官の実質組織は動脈をとりまく動脈鞘である。中心動脈壁は扁平な内皮細胞層からなっている。しかし,細胞間はところどころに隙間がある。動脈鞘は自由細胞と間質組織とからなっていて,間質は細網組織と線維組織からなっている。また,線維組織には好銀性で鞘内に同心円的に散在している切れ切れになった線維と,この層の外側にある膠原性の線維とからなっている。 5. 動脈鞘内の自由細胞は大部分がリンパ様細胞であり,主として好銀性線維層にみられる。また,この線維層にはリンパ様細胞の幼体と思われる細胞もみられる。さらに内皮細胞層の間隙から血管内にリンパ様細胞が浸出しているのを認めることもできる。リンパ様細胞は直径が 2. 5 ～ 4. 0 μで細胞質は非常にうすく,核はヘマトキシリン好染性で周辺が特に濃く染まる。洞様管内にもまた直径が 6. 0 ～ 8. 0 μでヘマトキシリンに対する染色性がうすい自由細胞がみられる。これ等の自由細胞を一番よく似ているリンパ型血球と比べた場合,前者は明らかに異っているといえるが後者は血球でないとはいいきれない。 6. 動脈鞘内のリンパ様細胞の量は体の異常状態に応じて増減しているようであるが,その要求が多い時は好銀性線維組織内は勿論のこと動脈内にもリンパ様細胞およびその幼体が充満している。この外,動脈鞘の退行変性像として細網細胞が線維化し,この線維内には多数の顆位が生じてこれ等が動脈内に放出されている状態をみることもできる...|$|E
40|$|After {{reviewing}} {{current and}} past medical Literature regarding celiac axis aneurysms {{the case of a}} 70 year-old emphysematous patient with an aneurysm of the celiac axis measuring 6 cm in diameter is reported. The patient's pulmonary function testing status strongly precluded a surgical option. Angiographic embolization of the aneurysm was then performed. The Authors observed that embolization with immediate occlusion of all <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> of the celiac axis leads to no serious short or long-term consequences as long as an adequate collateral hepatic circulation is maintained through the gastroduodenal and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries. This case would appear to be the first described in the Literature and the Authors hold this technique to be a valid alternative whenever a surgical procedure would be difficult or impossible to perform...|$|R

50|$|The lymph nodes, the spleen and Peyer's patches, {{are known}} as {{secondary}} lymphoid organs.

40|$|AbstractProposed reflex {{mechanisms}} for generalized neurohumoral activation in heart failure include decreased input from inhibitory baroreceptor <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> and increased input from excitatory <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> arising from arterial chemoreceptors, skeletal muscle metaboreceptors or the lungs. Not all subjects with {{left ventricular dysfunction}} have increased sympathetic nerve activity, but the magnitude of sympathoneural activation appears to independently predict survival. This association suggests both a causative mechanism linking sympathetic activation with adverse outcome and a therapeutic opportunity to improve the prognosis of such patients by inhibiting central sympathetic outflow. Generalized sympathetic activation {{is not unique to}} heart failure, and its functional consequences appear to be both organand condition-specific. Sympathetic activation is present in other disorders such as mild hypertension, cirrhosis and aging that do not share the dim prognosis of congestive heart failure. The adverse effects of adrenergic activation on the diseased myocardium may be a function of the magnitude and time course of increases in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, the mechanical and electrophysiologic consequences of nonuniform abnormalities of sympathetic innervation in the failing heart and the absence of specific countervailing mechanisms present in other conditions also characterized by increased sympathetic traffic. The hypotheses that activation of adrenergic drive to the diseased myocardium is the causative mechanism linking sympathoexcitation to adverse outcome and that interventions that inhibit sympathetic outflow to the heart will improve the prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure have not been specifically tested. Greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneity of sympathetic activation in response to ventricular dysfunction, for cardiac-specific and generalized activation of the sympathetic nervous system and for the stimulation or suppression of countervailing mechanisms capable of resisting its adverse effects is fundamental to the development of better therapies for congestive heart failure...|$|R
40|$|A 76 -year-old {{woman with}} {{hepatitis}} C cirrhosis presented with tarry stools and hematemesis. An endoscopy demonstrated bleeding duodenal varices {{in the second}} portion of the duodenum. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed markedly tortuous varices around {{the wall in the}} duodenum. Several afferent veins appeared to have developed, and the right ovarian vein draining into the inferior vena cava was detected as an efferent vein. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) of the varices using cyanoacrylate was successfully performed in combination with the temporary occlusion of the portal vein. Although no previous publications have used cyanoacrylate as an embolic agent for BRTO to control bleeding duodenal varices, this strategy can be considered as an alternative procedure to conventional BRTO using ethanolamine oleate when numerous <b>afferent</b> <b>vessels</b> that cannot be embolized are present...|$|R
