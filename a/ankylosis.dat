5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth <b>ankylosis</b> occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, <b>ankylosis,</b> malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E

25|$|In {{specimen}} AMNH 5464, {{the neural}} spines {{of several of}} the caudal vertebrae show an <b>ankylosis</b> that is a result of a severe injury sustained by this individual during its lifetime. Evidence of this injury is also present in the outer surface of the left ischium, where there is a large, irregularly shaped growth of bone that has formed across a healed fracture.|$|E
25|$|Normally {{metabolizing}} {{tooth root}} cells have an internal cell pressure (osmolality) of 280-300 mOs and a pH of 7.2. When {{there is an}} uninterrupted blood supply, all of the metabolites (calcium, phosphate, potassium) and glucose that the cells require are provided. When the tooth is knocked-out, this normal blood supply is cut off and within 15 minutes most of the stored metabolites have been depleted and the cells will begin to die. Within one to two hours, enough cells will die that rejection of the tooth by the body {{at a later time}} is the usual outcome. The method by which the body rejects the replanted tooth is a process called “replacement root resorption”. During this process, the tooth root cells become necrotic (dead) and will activate the immunologic mechanism of the body to attempt to remove this necrotic layer and literally eats away the tooth root. This is called “root resorption” It is a slow, but non-painful, process that is sometimes not observed by x-rays for years. Once this process starts, it is irreversible and the tooth will eventually fall out. In growing children, this can cause bone development problems because the replacement resorption (also termed <b>ankylosis)</b> attaches the tooth firmly to the jaw bone and stops normal tooth eruption and impedes normal jaw growth.|$|E
500|$|In 1896, Murphy was {{the first}} person to {{successfully}} unite a femoral artery severed by a gunshot wound. In 1898, Murphy was first in the United States to induce artificial immobilization and collapse of the lung (pneumothorax) in treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. He pioneered bone grafting techniques and made inroads in the management of <b>ankylosis,</b> especially with reconstruction. [...] He was also considered an innovator for surgical intervention for prostate cancer, performance of end-to-end anastomosis of hollow viscera.|$|E
500|$|In 1906, an American Museum of Natural History {{expedition}} led by paleontologist Barnum Brown {{discovered the}} type specimen of Ankylosaurus magniventris (AMNH 5895) in the Hell Creek Formation, near Gilbert Creek, Montana. The specimen (found by collector Peter Kaisen) {{consisted of the}} upper part of a skull, two teeth, part of the shoulder girdle, cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, ribs, and more than thirty osteoderms. Brown scientifically described the animal in 1908; the genus name is derived from the Greek words [...] /ankulos ('bent' or 'crooked'), referring to the medical term <b>ankylosis,</b> the stiffness produced by the fusion of bones in the skull and body, and /sauros ('lizard'). The name can be translated as [...] "fused lizard", [...] "stiff lizard", or [...] "curved lizard". The type species name magniventris is derived from the [...] ('great') and [...] ('belly'), referring to the great width of the animal's body.|$|E
500|$|Other pathologies {{reported}} in Allosaurus include: Willow breaks in two ribs. Healed fractures in the humerus and radius. Distortion of joint surfaces {{in the foot}} possibly due to osteoarthritis or developmental issues. Osteopetrosis along the endosteal surface of a tibia. Distortions of the joint surfaces of the tail vertebrae possibly due to osetoarthritis or developmental issues. [...] "xtensive 'neoplastic' <b>ankylosis</b> of caudals," [...] possibly due to physical trauma {{as well as the}} fusion of chevrons to centra. Coossification of vertebral centra {{near the end of the}} tail. Amputation of a chevron and foot bone, both possibly a result of bites. [...] "xtensive exostoses" [...] in the first phalanx of the third toe. Lesions similar to those caused by osteomyelitis in two scapulae. Bone spurs in a premaxilla, ungual, and two metacarpals.

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Georgescu had entered his most fecund stage as a prose writer, {{regularly}} publishing his novels at one-year intervals. At the same time, {{his life and}} career were being changed by disease. He had a malformation of the vertebral column and was already walking with a limp; in old age, his limbs were affected by <b>ankylosis,</b> which greatly reduced his mobility, and he developed a tendency for obesity. According to his friend Manea, [...] "the assault of diseases and age", coupled with resentment from Ceauşescu's [...] "functionaries of the Dogma", had physically isolated Georgescu from his peers.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1892, Renoir {{developed}} rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, {{he moved}} to the warmer climate of [...] "Les Collettes," [...] a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life even after his arthritis severely limited his mobility. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and <b>ankylosis</b> of his right shoulder, requiring him to change his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand. The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{treatment}} for condylar fractures is controversial. There {{are two main}} options, namely closed reduction or open reduction and fixation. Closed reduction may involve intermaxillary fixation, where the jaws are splinted together in the correct position {{for a period of}} weeks. Open reduction involves surgical exposure of the fracture site, which can be carried out via incisions within the mouth or incisions outside the mouth over the area of the condyle. Open reduction is sometimes combined with use of an endoscope to aid visualization of fracture site. Although closed reduction carries a risk of the bone healing out of position, with consequent alteration of the bite or the creation of facial asymmetry, it does not risk temporary damage to the facial nerve or result in any facial scar that accompanies open reduction. A systematic review was unable to find sufficient evidence of the superiority of one method over another in the management of condylar fractures. [...] Paediatric condylar fractures are especially problematic, owing to the remaining growth potential and possibility of <b>ankylosis</b> of the joint. [...] Early mobilization is often recommended as in the Walker protocol.|$|E
60|$|It {{was in this}} mental disposition, {{physically}} very empty, {{but still}} nauseated by what he had seen, {{that he had come}} upon the Professor. Under these conditions which make for irascibility in a sound, normal man, this meeting was specially unwelcome to Chief Inspector Heat. He had not been thinking of the Professor; he had not been thinking of any individual anarchist at all. The complexion of that case had somehow forced upon him the general idea of the absurdity of things human, which in the abstract is sufficiently annoying to an unphilosophical temperament, and in concrete instances becomes exasperating beyond endurance. At the beginning of his career Chief Inspector Heat had been concerned with the more energetic forms of thieving. He had gained his spurs in that sphere, and naturally enough had kept for it, after his promotion to another department, a feeling not very far removed from affection. Thieving was not a sheer absurdity. It was a form of human industry, perverse indeed, but still an industry exercised in an industrious world; it was work undertaken for the same reason as the work in potteries, in coal mines, in fields, in tool-grinding shops. It was labour, whose practical difference from the other forms of labour consisted in the nature of its risk, which did not lie in <b>ankylosis,</b> or lead poisoning, or fire-damp, or gritty dust, but in what may be briefly defined in its own special phraseology as “Seven years hard.” Chief Inspector Heat was, of course, not insensible to the gravity of moral differences. But neither were the thieves he had been looking after. They submitted to the severe sanctions of a morality familiar to Chief Inspector Heat with a certain resignation.|$|E
