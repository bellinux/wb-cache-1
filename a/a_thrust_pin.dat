50|$|A witch begged {{every day}} from the inn, and Bella Venezia promised her half her fortune if she could {{put an end to}} the daughter. The witch went into the forest as a pedlar, persuaded the girl to let her in, and while showing her <b>a</b> hair <b>pin,</b> <b>thrust</b> it into the girl's head.

60|$|It was now {{the part}} of the huge porter to step forward; but the lubbard was so {{overwhelmed}} with confusion of spirit--the contents of one immense black jack of double ale, which he had just drunk to quicken his memory, having treacherously confused the brain it was intended to clear--that he only groaned piteously, and remained sitting on his stone seat; and the Queen would have passed on without greeting, had not the gigantic warder's secret ally, Flibbertigibbet, who lay perdue behind him, <b>thrust</b> <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> into the rear of the short femoral garment which we elsewhere described.|$|R
5000|$|A second [...] "cat head" [...] was {{associated}} with a ship's anchor-cable and windlass. This was <b>a</b> square <b>pin</b> <b>thrust</b> into one of the handspike holes of a ship's windlass. When at anchor, the anchor rope (called a cable or [...] ) was secured to this with a smaller rope tie called a seizing. The English term for this pin was 'Norman'. In German, however, it was called a Kattenkopf (cat-head), and in this case it is a reference to the traditional way the top was notched and chamfered off so that in cross section, it resembled the ears of a cat.|$|R
60|$|The {{gray suit}} was well cut, well made, and {{completely}} undistinguished. It was a standard suit. White piping on the V of the vest added a flavor {{of law and}} learning. His shoes were black laced boots, good boots, honest boots, standard boots, extraordinarily uninteresting boots. The only frivolity was in his purple knitted scarf. With considerable comment on the matter to Mrs. Babbitt (who, acrobatically fastening {{the back of her}} blouse to her skirt with a safety-pin, did not hear a word he said), he chose between the purple scarf and a tapestry effect with stringless brown harps among blown palms, and into it he <b>thrust</b> <b>a</b> snake-head <b>pin</b> with opal eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Burning Secret is a 1988 drama film, {{based on}} the short story Brennendes Geheimnis by Stefan Zweig, about an American diplomat's son who befriends a mysterious baron while staying at an Austrian spa during the 1920s. This symbol-filled story, filmed with sensuous detail and nuance, is set in Austria in the 1920s. While being treated for asthma at a country spa, an American diplomat's lonely 12-year-old son is befriended and {{infatuated}} by a suave, mysterious baron. During a story of his war experiences, the baron reveals the scar of a wound from an American soldier and <b>thrusts</b> <b>a</b> <b>pin</b> through it, saying [...] "see—no feeling." [...] Little does the boy {{realize that it is}} his turn to be wounded. But soon his adored friend heartlessly brushes him aside and turns his seductive attentions to his mother. The boy's jealousy and feelings of betrayal become uncontrollable.|$|R
60|$|On a {{night he}} had come nearly {{as far as this}} before, but in the tail of big fellows with a turnip lantern. Into the wood-work of the east window they had <b>thrust</b> <b>a</b> <b>pin,</b> to which a button was tied, and the button was also {{attached}} to a long string. They hunkered afar off and pulled this string, and then the button tapped the death-rap on the window, and the sport was successful, for the Painted Lady screamed. But suddenly the door opened and they were put to flight by the fierce barking of a dog. One said that the brute nabbed him in the leg, another saw the vive tongue of it, a third played lick at it with the lantern; this was before they discovered that the dog had been Grizel imitating one, brave Grizel, always ready to protect her mother, and never allowed to cherish the childish fears that were hers by birthright.|$|R
