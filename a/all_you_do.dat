He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E

The series's first champion Nelson Piquet Jr. (NextEV NIO) spoke of his excitement for the eRace and believed Formula E combining the worlds of simulation and real-life racing was a positive step: [...] "I think this is going to be really fun with all the drivers together." [...] Andretti driver Robin Frijns revealed his interest in how he would compare against sim drivers: [...] "I don’t really know what to expect, maybe the sim drivers or the fans are really good, maybe not, we don’t know.
