Although this kind of documents originally were prepared to register foundations’ incomes and expenditures, they had various information about the period they belonged to. Particularly <b>accounting</b> <b>books</b> for the foundations which were built by Ottoman sultans, their family members or government officials have been more crucial. They were usually managed and audited by state officials, supported {{when they were in}} need, employed people around the government. In other words these kind of Ottoman foundations were not independent from economic, social or political aspects of the Empire. Moreover <b>accounting</b> <b>books</b> could be benefited understanding the foundations’ structure, management, wealth and public services.

The archives consisted of all its correspondence, reports, <b>account</b> <b>books,</b> hospital directories, printed reports, histories, maps and charts, claims of some 51,000 soldiers and sailors investigated by it, miscellaneous papers, etc. The library promised that they would be preserved and accessible to the public.|$|E

25|$|The first {{scholarly}} book on Saunière's activities was {{by local}} historian and chief librarian of Carcassonne René Descadeillas, who sifted through the priest's <b>account</b> <b>books</b> and personal correspondence, {{as well as}} the records of Saunière's ecclesiastical trial lodged in the Carcassonne Bishopric - and concluded in his 1974 Mythologie du trésor de Rennes: histoire véritable de l'abbé Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château that there never was any treasure or mystery; all of the priest's wealth was generated from selling Masses and accepting donations. This conclusion was shared by the local priest and author Abbé Bruno de Monts, who himself contributed essential information during the 1980s and 1990s, as well as by other French authors like Jean-Jacques Bedu and more recently David Rossoni.|$|E
25|$|<b>Account</b> <b>books</b> {{are easily}} {{accessible}} to all the member-sisters, ensuring transparency. Lijjat follows its own financial accountability principle. There is no credit method for running operations in the organisation. Every payment is done on a daily basis, except for the outside supply of raw material. Profits and losses are shared equally {{among the members of}} a given branch. In the initial days of Lijjat, the profits of the first six months were shared equally among all sisters in the form of gold. This sharing practice is still in effect, but now the decision whether to share the profits in gold or in cash is made at the branch level. The cost of national-level advertising is borne by all branches and divisions, depending on their individual production abilities.|$|E

The priest-Treasurer and Governor, in addition to being expected to celebrate Mass in the Alms Row chapel at least once monthly, was also required to supervise the keeping of the Charity Rules by the pensioners. He was also to pay the latter their monthly allowance of 5s (later raised to the original sum of 6s 8d), their annual wood allowance of 24s, and a sum of 12s for their livery.

25|$|The village church {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary Magdalene has been rebuilt several times. The earliest church {{of which there}} is any evidence on the site may date to the 8th century. However, this original church was almost certainly in ruins by the 10th or 11th century, when another church was built upon the site—remnants {{of which can be}} seen in Romanesque pillared arcades {{on the north side of}} the apse. This survived in poor repair until the 19th century, when it was renovated by the local priest, Bérenger Saunière. Surviving receipts and existing <b>account</b> <b>books</b> belonging to Saunière reveal that the renovation of the church, including works on the presbytery and cemetery, cost 11,605 Francs over a ten-year period between 1887 and 1897.|$|E
25|$|The {{revision}} {{is expected}} to roughly double the dictionary in size. Apart from general updates to include information on new words and other changes in the language, the third edition brings many other improvements, including changes in formatting and stylistic conventions to make entries clearer to read and enable more thorough searches {{to be made by}} computer, more thorough etymological information, and a general change of focus away from individual words towards more general coverage of the language as a whole. While the original text drew its quotations mainly from literary sources such as novels, plays, and poetry, with additional material from newspapers and academic journals, the new edition will reference more kinds of material that were unavailable to the editors of previous editions, such as wills, inventories, <b>account</b> <b>books,</b> diaries, journals, and letters.|$|E
25|$|Saunière also {{funded the}} {{construction}} of another structure dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene. Named after his church, he built the Tour Magdala originally named the Tour de L'horloge {{on the edge of}} the village which he used as his library, it features a circular turret with twelve crenellations, on a belvedere that connected it to an orangery, a tower-like structure. The tower has a promenade linking it to the Villa Bethania, which was not actually used by the priest. He stated at his trial that it was intended as a home for retired priests. Surviving receipts and existing <b>account</b> <b>books</b> belonging to Saunière reveal that {{the construction of}} his estate including the Tour Magdala and Villa Bethania (including the purchases of land) between 1898 and 1905 cost 26,417 Francs.|$|E
