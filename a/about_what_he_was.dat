25|$|Louisiana's Supreme Court {{ruled in}} 2014 that a priest may be {{compelled}} to testify <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> told in the confessional regarding a particular sexual abuse case, leaving the priest at risk of excommunication if he even confirms that a confession took place, or jail for contempt of court should he refuse to testify. However, the Court later ruled that a priest has no duty to report confidential information heard during a sacramental confession.|$|E
25|$|Since the Army {{was officially}} {{responsible}} {{for the security of}} the Pearl Harbor facilities and Hawaiian defense generally, and so of the Navy's ships while in port, Army actions are of particular interest. Short reported to Washington he had increased his alert level (but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in Washington and led to misunderstanding there <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> really doing). In addition, Short's main concern was sabotage from fifth columnists (expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack), which accounts for his orders that Army Air Corps planes be parked close together {{near the center of the}} airfields. There seems to have been no increased Army urgency about getting its existing radar equipment properly integrated with the local command and control in the year it had been available and operational in Hawaii before the attack. Leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed. Anti-aircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness, with ammunition in secured lockers. Neither Army long-range bombers nor Navy PBYs were used effectively, remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule. Short evidently failed to understand he had the responsibility to defend the fleet. In Short's defense, it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet, and the best patrol aircraft, B-17s and B-24s, were in demand in the Philippines and Britain, both of which had higher priority.|$|E
500|$|Saari {{left behind}} two {{handwritten}} {{notes in his}} school dormitory indicating {{that he had been}} planning the massacre for six years. A police spokesperson commented: [...] "Saari left notes saying he had a hatred for mankind, for the whole of the human race, and that he had been thinking <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do for years. The notes show he was very troubled and he hated everything." [...] Police said that although most of the victims were female, the motive {{did not seem to be}} a hatred of women. One of Saari's friends noticed a change in his behaviour two years before the shootings, when Saari began expressing a fondness for guns and an admiration of the school shootings in the United States. He said that around 18 months previously Saari had sent him a message saying that he would carry out a school shooting the next day. Saari reportedly denied being serious about carrying out his threat.|$|E

500|$|Acting {{gradually}} became {{a passion for}} Hoffman: [...] "I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that's when I decided it was what I wanted to do." [...] At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: [...] "We were attracted {{to the fact that}} he was genuinely serious <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing. Even then, he was passionate." [...] Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between starting on the program and graduating from Fairport High School, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre's summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If I run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On the {{day before}} the killing, Chapman accosted singer-songwriter James Taylor at the 72nd Street subway station.

2500|$|On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an {{encounter}} with Mark David Chapman, who would assassinate John Lennon just one day later.

And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." [...] The next night, Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented: [...] "I heard him shotâ€”five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} {{the conflict between}} Parcells and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft {{took control of the}} team after Parcells was hired, {{and the two of them}} had different ideas on how to run the organization. Six days before the Super Bowl, in an article by Will McDonough, the Boston Globe reported Parcells would leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl to become the coach of the New York Jets. The book Patriot Reign alleges the Patriots have cell phone records showing Parcells was in constant contact with the Jets during the week. Then-Patriots defensive coordinator (and now head coach) Bill Belichick is quoted as saying Parcells' plans to leave for the Jets were a distraction, [...] "Yeah, I'd say it was a little bit of a distraction all the way around. I can tell you first-hand, there was a lot of stuff going on prior to the game. I mean, him talking to other teams. He was trying to make up his mind <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do. Which, honestly, I felt [...] totally inappropriate. How many chances do you get to play for the Super Bowl? Tell them to get back to you in a couple of days. I'm not saying it was disrespectful to me, but it was in terms of the overall commitment to the team." [...] Parcells even refused to travel back with the rest of the Patriots after the game, and was eventually hired by the rival Jets.|$|E
