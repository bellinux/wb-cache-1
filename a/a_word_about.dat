25|$|Ashokavadana– The Aśokāvadāna is a 2nd-century CE text {{related to}} the legend of Ashoka. The legend was {{translated}} into Chinese by Fa Hien in 300 CE. It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India. The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring {{the relationship between the}} king and the community of monks (the Sangha) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the laity (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits. The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion {{has nothing to do with}} the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> his belonging to the Maurya dynasty.

In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the Polish diplomat Edward Bernard Raczyński, Raczyński and General Sikorski met {{privately with}} Churchill and Alexander Cadogan on 15 April 1943, {{and told them}} that the Poles had {{concrete}} proof that the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. Raczyński reports that Churchill, [...] "without committing himself, showed by his manner that he had no doubt of it". Churchill said that [...] "The Bolsheviks can be very cruel". However, at the same time, on 24 April 1943, Churchill assured the Soviets: [...] "We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism". Unofficial or classified UK documents concluded that Soviet guilt was a [...] "near certainty", but the alliance with the Soviets was deemed to be more important than moral issues; thus the official version supported the Soviets, up to censoring any contradictory accounts. Churchill asked Owen O'Malley to investigate the issue, but in a note to the Foreign Secretary he noted: [...] "All this is merely to ascertain the facts, because we should none of us ever speak <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] O'Malley pointed out several inconsistencies and near impossibilities in the Soviet version. Later, Churchill sent a copy of the report to Roosevelt on 13 August 1943. The report deconstructed the Soviet account of the massacre and alluded to the political consequences within a strongly moral framework but recognized there was no viable alternative to the existing policy. No comment by Roosevelt on the O'Malley report has been found. Churchill's own post-war account of the Katyn affair gives little further insight. In his memoirs, he refers to the 1944 Soviet inquiry into the massacre, which found the Germans responsible, and adds, [...] "belief seems an act of faith".|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name is curious; it is not from the German Eidegenossen as has been supposed.

I'll say <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> it to settle the doubts of those who have strayed in seeking its origin. The superstition of our ancestors, to within twenty or thirty years thereabouts, was such that in almost all the towns in the kingdom they had a notion that certain spirits underwent their Purgatory in this world after death, and that they went about the town at night, striking and outraging many people whom they found in the streets. But the light of the Gospel has made them vanish, and teaches us that these spirits were street-strollers and ruffians. In Paris the spirit was called le moine bourré; at Orleans, le mulet odet; at Blois le loup garon; at Tours, le Roy Huguet; and so on in other places. Now, it happens that those whom they called Lutherans were at that time so narrowly watched during the day that they were forced to wait till night to assemble, for the purpose of praying God, for preaching and receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that although they did not frighten nor hurt anybody, the priests, through mockery, made them the successors of those spirits which roam the night; and thus that name being quite common in the mouth of the populace, to designate the evangelical huguenands in the country of Tourraine and Amboyse, it became in vogue after that enterprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|... …Of course {{even if the}} {{implication}} of the dictum in Gerstein were what the Court says, that would be poor reason for keeping a wrongfully arrested citizen in jail contrary to the clear dictates of the Fourth Amendment. What is most revealing of the frailty of today's opinion is that it relies upon nothing but that implication from a dictum, plus its own (quite irrefutable because entirely value laden) [...] "balancing" [...] of the competing demands {{of the individual and}} the State. With respect to the point at issue here, different times and different places — even highly liberal times and places — have struck that balance in different ways. Some Western democracies currently permit the Executive a period of detention without impartially adjudicated cause. In England, for example, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, 14(4), 5, permits suspects to be held without presentation and without charge for seven days. 12 Halsbury's Stat. 1294 (4th ed. 1989). It was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to put this matter beyond time, place and judicial predilection, incorporating the traditional common-law guarantees against unlawful arrest. The Court says not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>about</b> these guarantees, and they are determinative. Gersteins approval of a [...] "brief period" [...] of delay to accomplish [...] "administrative steps incident to an arrest" [...] is already a questionable extension of the traditional formulation, though it probably has little practical effect and can perhaps be justified on de minimis grounds. [...] To expand Gerstein, however, into an authorization for 48-hour detention related neither to the obtaining of a magistrate nor the administrative [...] "completion" [...] of the arrest seems to me utterly unjustified.
