50|$|Resonant {{inductive}} coupling or magnetic phase synchronous coupling is the phenomenon that the coupling is enhanced when the secondary {{side of the}} loosely coupled coil resonates. The most basic resonant {{inductive coupling}} consists of one drive coil on the primary side and one resonance circuit on the secondary side. In this case, when the resonant state on the secondary side is observed from the primary side, two resonances as a pair are observed. One of them is called the <b>antiresonant</b> <b>frequency</b> (parallel resonant frequency 1), {{and the other is}} called the resonant frequency (serial resonant frequency 1'). The short-circuit inductance and resonant capacitor of the secondary coil are combined into a resonant circuit. When the primary coil is driven with a resonant frequency (serial resonant frequency) of the secondary side, the phases of the magnetic fields of the primary coil and the secondary coil are synchronized. As a result, the maximum voltage is generated on the secondary coil due to the increase of the mutual flux, and the copper loss of the primary coil is reduced, the heat generation is reduced, and the efficiency is relatively improved. The resonant inductive coupling is the near field wireless transmission of electrical energy between magnetically coupled coils, which is part of a resonant circuit tuned to resonate at the same frequency as the driving frequency. This process occurs in a resonant transformer, an electrical component which consists of high Q coil wound on the same core with capacitors connected across the coils to make coupled LC circuit. Resonant transformers are widely used in radio circuits as bandpass filters, and in switching power supplies. Resonant inductive coupling is also being used in wireless power systems. Here the LC circuit is in different devices; a transmitter coil in one device transmits electric power across an intervening space to a resonant receiver coil in another device. This technology is being developed for powering and charging portable devices such as cellphones and tablet computers at a distance, without being tethered to an outlet. The WiTricity type magnetic resonance is that the primary side resonant is added to the basic resonant inductive coupling system in order to increase the power transmission intensity of the resonance. Thus, the WiTricity type magnetic resonance is characterized in that the resonant coils on the primary side and the resonant coils on the secondary side are paired.|$|E

This paper investigates mistuning using a transfer function approach where the frequency response functions (FRFs) are described by natural <b>frequencies</b> and <b>antiresonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Using this approach, <b>antiresonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> are {{shown to be a}} critical factor in determining the maximum blade response.

Numerical examples are given using a spring-mass-oscillator model of a bladed disk.

The absorber mass amplitudes were 0. 8 - 0. 85 pm at atmospheric pressure while the drive mass amplitudes were below 0. 1 pm.

Zrs at high oscillation frequencies including the first <b>antiresonant</b> <b>frequency</b> (far, 1) may contain important information about airway mechanics.

40|$|Abstract—To {{address the}} need for {{fundamental}} universally valid definitions of exact bandwidth and quality factor () of tuned antennas, as well as {{the need for}} efficient accurate approximate formulas for computing this bandwidth and, exact and approximate expressions are found for the bandwidth and of a general single-feed (one-port) lossy or lossless linear antenna tuned to resonance or antiresonance. The approximate expression derived for the exact bandwidth of a tuned antenna differs from previous approximate expressions in that it is inversely proportional to the magnitude 0 (0) of the frequency derivative of the input impedance and, for not too large a bandwidth, it is nearly equal to the exact bandwidth of the tuned antenna at every frequency 0, that is, throughout antiresonant as well as resonant frequency bands. It is also shown that an appropriately defined exact of a tuned lossy or lossless antenna is approximately proportional to 0 (0) and thus this is approximately inversely proportional to the bandwidth (for not too large a bandwidth) of a simply tuned antenna at all frequencies. The exact of a tuned antenna is defined in terms of average internal energies that emerge naturally from Maxwell’s equations applied to the tuned antenna. These internal energies, which are similar but not identical to previously defined quality-factor energies, and the associated are proven to increase without bound as the size of an antenna is decreased. Numerical solutions to thin straight-wire and wire-loop lossy and lossless antennas, as well as to a Yagi antenna and a straight-wire antenna embedded in a lossy dispersive dielectric, confirm the accuracy of the approximate expressions and the inverse relationship between the defined bandwidth and the defined over frequency ranges that cover several resonant and <b>antiresonant</b> <b>frequency</b> bands.

40|$|Wave {{propagation}} in {{a sandwich}} beam with internal resonators was investigated. Two continuum Timoshenko beam models were presented {{and used to}} interpret the dispersion characteristics of the original sandwich beam. One model treats the resonators as continuously distributed mass {{and the other with}} an effective mass density. It was found that the range of frequencies that yield negative mass densities in the continuum Timoshenko beam actually correspond to a bandgap in which no harmonic waves can propagate in the sandwich structure without attenuation in amplitude. Also, the bandgap can be tailored by altering the local resonance frequency of the resonator. The resonator can give rise to a significant wave attenuation effect near the local resonance frequency, and hence can be used to block disturbances with certain frequencies from entering the structure. Besides resonators, periodic structural assemblies are also capable of filtering waves with certain frequencies. A sandwich beam with periodic cores were presented and its dynamic behavior was investigated. It was found that the bandgap can be adjusted by altering the material properties of the core. Also, in order to block disturbances in the low frequency range, the dimension of the structure has to be large. By comparing the beam with resonators and the beam with periodic cores, it was concluded that the resonators have a better effect on wave attenuation and vibration reduction. If a uniform harmonic pressure was applied to the top surface of a supported sandwich beam containing spring-mass resonators, the local resonance frequency of the resonator becomes the <b>antiresonant</b> <b>frequency</b> of the whole structure. A simple two-degree-of-freedom system consisting of an absorbing mass connected by springs to a drive mass was introduced and employed to interpret the vibration characteristics of the sandwich structure. It was found that the sandwich structure with resonators could be effective in mitigating vibration induced by wave slamming impact which produces dynamic motion with a dominant frequency. ...|$|E

Intervals of continuous irregular response alternate with integer mode-locked regions with bistable excitation edge. There is an even-all multimodal transition between the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 states {{in the vicinity of}} the main resonance, which is analogous to the odd-all transition discovered earlier in the high-frequency regime.
