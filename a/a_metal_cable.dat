5000|$|A wire saw is a {{saw that}} uses <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> wire or <b>cable</b> for cutting. Industrial wire saws are usually powered. There are also hand-powered survivalist wire saws {{suitable}} for cutting branches. Wire saws {{are classified as}} continuous (or endless, or loop) or oscillating (or reciprocating). Sometimes the wire itself {{is referred to as}} a [...] "blade".|$|R
5000|$|In the {{immediate}} post-World War II era, most downhill ski bindings {{were of the}} [...] "Kandahar" [...] pattern of cable binding. This consisted of <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> cup {{at the front of}} the ski that kept the boot centred, with a leather strap buckled over the toe to hold it down into the cup. <b>A</b> long <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> or spring ran around the back of the boot, over a flange protruding from the heel. The strap held the boot forward and kept the toe in the cup and under the strap. The system was designed to keep the toe firmly in place while allowing the heel to rise off the ski. This allowed for a smooth cross-country striding motion. For downhill use, the cable was clipped down near the heel to keep the boot in firmer contact with the ski, and allow some level of lateral control.|$|R
5000|$|The cable was {{produced}} and laid by Prysmian Group and Nexans SA. [...] The system {{consists of two}} bipolar high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables with a transmission capacity of 200 MW and an operating voltage of 250 kV of each, and <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> return <b>cable.</b> It has a total transmission capacity of 400 MW. The maximum depth of the submarine cable is 1485 m. It is the second longest submarine power cable after NorNed and the second deepest after SAPEI. [...] The submarine part of the cable is 240 km long and the land cable is 7 km long. [...] There are converter stations in Morvedre and Santa Ponsa, built by Siemens.|$|R
50|$|An {{evolution}} of the Huitfeldt designs was {{the replacement of the}} heel strap with <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> and springs. Invented in 1929 by the Swiss ski racer Guido Reuge, patented by him and marketed in 1932, the spring-loaded cable binding was named for the Lord Roberts of Kandahar Cup ski races. Kandahar-style cable bindings would be almost universal into the early 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The train {{operated}} {{by allowing the}} weight of a loaded train to pull a lighter, empty train up the slope. <b>A</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> connected the two trains. Operation was controlled from the control room located in the top station. Trains ran on a normal track gauge (1435 mm). In the middle of the route a branch allowed the simultaneous passage of the wagons.|$|E
50|$|As {{the balloon}} was {{anchored}} {{to the ground with}} <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cable,</b> it was only able to ascend and descend vertically. It was approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to ascend to a maximum altitude of 180 metres, or around 48 stories. Flights to either 150 metres or 180 metres were offered. It could accommodate a maximum of 29 passengers in its gondola.|$|E
5000|$|The Pukka {{is powered}} by two 12-volt sealed {{lead-acid}} batteries contained in a rear compartment, held by the frame behind the seat. It has an electronic motor control board which uses pulse-width modulation, and can provide up to 55 amps when required. [...] It receives low voltage signals from the throttle, which {{is attached to the}} right handle bar. The braking system is a drum brake activated through <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> brake <b>cable</b> from <b>a</b> brake handle on the left handle bar. A circuit runs through the brake handle to allow the motor control board to detect when the brake is being used and shut off power to the motor. Thus, the Pukka is designed so that the motor and the brakes cannot be used at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|For {{situations}} where the marker's bolt or barrel can be quickly removed, a [...] "cable squeegee" [...] may be used. A cable squeegee is simply one or more rubber disks mounted perpendicular to <b>a</b> flexible <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> (usually with <b>a</b> plastic jacket to avoid marring the barrel's surface). The end opposite the disc(s) (the [...] "pull end") is inserted into {{the rear of the}} bolt chamber or the chamber side of the barrel, as appropriate, and fed through until the pull end protrudes {{from the front of the}} barrel. The squeegee is then pulled through the breech and/or barrel. Some designs incorporate a swab of an absorbent material that picks up anything the disc(s) leave behind. Because they require removal of the bolt or barrel, they are slower to use than a rod squeegee; however, being composed mainly of a flexible cable, they can be easily coiled up into a very compact size.|$|R
50|$|Great {{improvements}} {{were also}} {{made in the}} hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work. As {{the depth of the}} diggings increased, the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical, as their self-weight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength (breaking weight). After hemp rope, iron chains began to become more common. However, fracture was quick, at around half a millisecond. In 1829 Wilhelm Albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating <b>a</b> twisted <b>metal</b> <b>cabling</b> known as Albert Rope. In 1864 Andrew Smith Hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors; his wire rope went on to be used in San Francisco's famous cable cars, and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the Comstock Lode. Another innovation, were spring loaded cages. The only way {{in and out of a}} shaft mine, was in the cage, cabled to the hoist.|$|R

The waves were focused (by curving the antenna) and refracted (by a prism-shaped graphene bilayer because the conductivity in the two-atom-thick prism is larger than in the surrounding one-atom-thick layer.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Each man {{is known}} by the weapon(s) he wields, hence {{the names of the}} title characters. Most men wield one of the six {{traditional}} weapons: sword, club, sticks, staff, daggers or morning star (more commonly known as a heavy flail - a spiked ball on a chain). Sos, originally named 'Sol the Sword', is forced to give up his name and weapon after being defeated by Sol of All Weapons, and learns to use a non-standard weapon: <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> with weights on the end of it. Var wields sticks, essentially two batons, also made of metal. Neq wields a traditional sword.|$|E
50|$|This buckled strap {{was later}} {{replaced}} by <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cable.</b> The cable binding remained in use, and even increased in popularity, throughout this period as cross-country skiing {{developed into a}} major sport of its own. Change eventually came though {{the evolution of the}} Rottefella binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s. It has now generally been replaced by the NNN system.|$|E

40|$|Freezing of gait is an episodic gait disorder,characterized by the {{inability}} to generate effective forward stepping movements. The pathophysiology underlying freezing of gait remains insufficiently understood, and this hampers the development of better treatment strategies. Preliminary evidence suggests that impaired force control during walking may contribute to freezing episodes, with difficulty to unload the swing leg and initiate the swing phase. Here, we used external loading to manipulate force control and to investigate its influence on freezing of gait. Twelve Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait performed three contrasting tasks: (1) loaded gait while wearing a belt fortified with lead weights; (2) weight supported gait using a parachute harness connected to <b>a</b> rigid <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> running above the gait trajectory; and (3) normal gait. Gait tasks were used to provoke freezing episodes, including rapid 360 ° turns. Freezing episodes were quantified using blinded, videotaped clinical assessment. Furthermore, ground reaction forces and body kinematics were recorded. Loading significantly increased {{the mean number of}} freezing episodes per trial compared to the normal gait condition (P< 0. 05), but the effect of weight support was not consistent. Loading particularly increased the number of freezing episodes during rapid short steps. Step length was significantly smaller during loaded gait compared to normal gait (P< 0. 05), but changes in anticipatory postural adjustments were not different. Our results may point to impaired force control playing a key role in freezing of gait. Future studies should further investigate the mechanism, i. e., the contribution of deficient load feedback, and evaluate which forms of weight support might offer treatment opportunities. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In 1935 the U.S. Forest Service {{retained}} the noted skier Alf Engen to hike {{into the area}} and determine its potential as a future ski area. Engen's reports expressed great promise for the area, and recommended the purchase of additional surrounding lands to form the ski area. In 1937 a prominent Salt Lake City lawyer, Joe Quinney, along with other local businessmen, formed the Utah Winter Sports Association to oversee the development of skiing at Alta. In the following year construction began on the original Collins chairlift, fashioned from a surplus mining ore tramway system that featured a clamp-cam bullwheel gripping <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> strung with single-seat chairs. Slow but dependable, {{it was just the}} third such lift in the United States, after Sun Valley and the Magic Mile at Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood. Alta opened to skiers {{for the first time in}} 1939 on January 15, offering a single ride on the chair for 25 cents.|$|E

5000|$|... 1932: a major {{advance on}} the Huitfeldt concept was {{introduced}} to the market by Guido Reuge in 1932. Reuge replaced the heel strap with <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> connected to a spring {{at the front of the}} toe. The spring provided even tension as the boot moved. Previously, the strap was adjusted so it had enough slack to allow the boot to rotate as high as the skier wished, but as the boot rotated back down to the ski it became increasingly slack again. The cable removed this limitation, and held the boot firmly through its entire motion, greatly increasing the solidity of the fit. A later advance added two small metal clips near the rear of the foot that the cable could be clipped under. These held the boot firmly to the ski during downhill portions of the runs. Cable bindings remained in use for some time for cross-country, and are today popular for telemark skiing. However, the Rottefella design from the 1930s became more popular for Nordic skiing through the 1950s and into the 1970s until the Salomon Nordic System (SNS) binding entirely re-invented bindings used for Nordic skiing.|$|E
5000|$|Several campsites usually share a bear cable {{away from}} the campsite. This is <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>cable</b> strung between two sturdy trees at least ten feet above the ground; {{it is used to}} hang bear bags {{containing}} items that might attract animals.Campsites also share a latrine or toilet. Philmont latrines have the possibility of housing spiders below the seat, which is why campers are encouraged to remove possible pests {{on the underside of the}} boards with a stick. The latrines come in different configurations, but all of them are for excrement only, and are not to be urinated in, in order to reduce smell. The open-air style latrine with two adjacent seats is affectionately called the [...] "pilot to copilot" [...] design; this results from the joking conversation which often takes place between two campers using the toilet simultaneously. The other open-air configuration latrine, called the [...] "pilot to bombardier", is generally preferred because its two seats are back-to-back and offer somewhat more privacy than the [...] "pilot to copilot". Occasionally a [...] "single pilot" [...] - one open-air seat — may be found. The enclosed configuration, with walls and a red roof, is known as a Red Roof Inn, in joking reference to the hotel chain. Older Red Roof Inns contain two adjacent seats and no doors ("pilot to copilot"), while newer models have two back-to-back seats ("pilot to bombadier"), with a wall between. Portable toilets ("Time Machines") are rare in the backcountry and only found in places such as French Henry camp.|$|E

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1973 {{we were asked to}} perform a {{theoretical}} investigation of the propagation of low frequency (LF) radio waves down deep (10, 000 feet) hoistshafts* for the case where the hoist cable ("rope") is the only metal conductor present. Propagation is by means of the TEM coaxial mode of transmission in which the hoist cable serves as the inner conductor and the surrounding rock acts as the outer conductor. Since the rock is a relatively poor electrical conductor the current in the outer conductor of the coaxial line is not confined to a very thin surface layer as in <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> coaxial <b>cable,</b> but spreads radially to a distance that is generally many times the shaft diameter. This feature of the wave propagation requires a more sophisticated theoretical treatment than the approximate skin-depth theory that is adequate for metal coaxial lines. In this Part we treat the hoist shaft wave propagation loss, characteristic impedance, and the field current distributions in the surrounding rock medium. We also show that the large penetration of the wave into the rock outer conductor does not present a difficult problem with regard to coupling the transmitter or receiver to the transmission line with a minimum of insertion loss, but that the large impedance mismatch caused by the capacitance termination between the cage and shaft wall may well be the most significant contribution to overall system loss. Inductive coupling and impedance matching to the hoist rope/shaft transmission line are also treated briefly. Preliminary results indicate that a broad minimum in overall system loss should occur between 100 kHz and 1 MHz, possibly centered around 300 kHz. Further work is needed to better quantify this signal loss behavior, compare it with hoist shaft electromagnetic noise spectral data recently acquired by NBS, and identify the most favorable operating frequencies...|$|R
