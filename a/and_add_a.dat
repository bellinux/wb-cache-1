Rappaport also planned to have an apartment in one of the York Row houses. However, like many other Rappaport-owned buildings, they ended up being left vacant and neglected, becoming a target for vandals and the homeless.|$|E

5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash.

5|$|Kameo {{is known}} for its {{prolonged}} development cycle, which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing and nurturing monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more befitting of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was repurposed from a fairy to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly finished for the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used the extra time to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.|$|E

However, the club went into administration in May 2002, and Richmond was replaced by new co-owners Julian Rhodes and Gordon Gibb. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb's pension fund for £5million, with the club's offices, shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for an additional £2.5million. Bradford City's annual rent bill in 2011 to Gibb's pension fund is £370,000. The total budget for the year, including other rent payments, rates, maintenance and utility bills is £1.25million.|$|E

5|$|To {{resolve the}} problem of overcrowding, the station began upgrade works in 2017. This {{includes}} a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street, accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place leading to both the Victoria line and the Circle and District line platforms. This upgrade is due to be finished by 2018, and tunnelling for the project was completed in September 2015. The work involved enlarging the existing Victoria line ticket hall serving the railway station <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> new relief bank of escalators there, which opened in January 2017. The redevelopment has been criticised, as access to platforms from the new escalators will be long and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators.|$|E
