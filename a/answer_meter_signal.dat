This paper gives a brief summary of the control of roundabouts using <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> and describes the basic concepts of an analytical model of the operation of roundabouts with <b>metering</b> <b>signals.</b> The model estimates capacities and performance measures (delay, queue length, stop rate, and so on) of the metered and controlling approaches of the roundabout as well as other approaches which operate as normal roundabout entries. Timing of roundabout <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> is discussed and a case study is presented demonstrating the application of the model to a real-life roundabout in Melbourne, Australia. Alternative timing strategies are explored. It has been found that the model gives lower cycle times than those used in practice for roundabout <b>metering</b> <b>signals.</b> © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRoundabouts show great {{advantages}} due {{to their}} geometry and their priority system, {{both in terms of}} capacity and road safety, compared to other intersections. However, unbalanced flows may be a problem even at medium demand levels. One single approach may cause queues on the downstream approaches as drivers are not allowed to entry the roundabout. If that downstream approach has the highest flow demand, average delay is highly increased; so, the roundabout can be collapsed. This operational problem is derived from one of roundabouts fundamental properties: movements with greater traffic demand cannot be prioritized, unlike signalized intersections. A few solutions may be found, but the most cost-effective measure is traffic regulation by <b>metering</b> <b>signals.</b> The aim of the research is to analyze capacity improvements and operational performance on roundabouts with <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> using traffic microsimulation, for Spain local conditions. <b>Metering</b> <b>signals</b> are based on creating gaps in the circulating stream in order to alleviate excessive delays on the main approach of the roundabout. Consequently, they are used only on heavy demand conditions during peak hours. On the metered approach, which causes problems for a main downstream approach (controlling approach), <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> are implemented. The metered approach is stopped by red signals controlled by a queue detector on the controlling approach. So, the controlling approach is benefited by <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> as drivers can easily enter the roundabout; and the roundabout overall traffic operation is improved. The research was conducted in 5 stages: roundabouts selection; field study; calibration and validation of a traffic microsimulation model in VISSIM; generation of multiple scenarios; and, analysis of the results. Two roundabouts with known unbalanced flow patterns on Valencia (Spain) were selected; traffic counts were carried out to describe their traffic flow patterns, which resulted on limited capacity at both locations. In order to quantify traffic operation improvement on metered roundabouts, a traffic microsimulation model in VISSIM was elaborated. The model was calibrated and validated using critical gaps, queues, delays, and speeds. Afterwards, a <b>metering</b> <b>signal</b> technique was implemented on VisVAP, based on an ad hoc signal control logic design. Almost 400 combinations of design and control <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> parameters were required to obtain the optimal model (distances to yield line, red and green time settings) which presented the lowest average delay. It could be concluded that, for the same medium-high circulating flow, a higher demand would be able to enter the roundabout (of up to 80 % from the controlled approach) with less average delay values (22 % and 56 % at each studied roundabout) by installing <b>metering</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R

The high voltage is passed out of the power supply through the special connector, and is also applied to a voltage divider that converts it to a low voltage <b>metering</b> <b>signal</b> compatible with low voltage circuitry. The <b>metering</b> <b>signal</b> is used by a closed-loop controller that regulates the high voltage by controlling inverter input power, and it may also be conveyed out of the power supply to allow external circuitry to monitor the high voltage output.|$|R

40|$|A simple explorative {{study shows}} that roundabouts {{are too small to}} be {{equipped}} with permanently operating traffic lights. The conclusion of a recent, more detailed study was not fundamentally different to this: at a small two-lane roundabout with four legs and with leg-by-leg control the shortest green time is 11 to 13 seconds, irrespective of the volume of traffic on the least busy leg. This results in a great deal of unnecessary waiting time. Leg-by-leg control at a four-lane roundabout is therefore not regarded as a robust solution. In view of this, at small roundabouts incidental <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> are used. At single lane roundabouts, <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> provide a more balanced distribution of the waiting time, whereas at two-lane roundabouts, the <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> also have the potential to improve traffic flow. This was shown as early as 2003, in research conducted in collaboration with the author. This article explains the theoretical background to the research. In addition, general design principles for roundabout <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> (RMS) are deduced. In 2011, research carried out as part of a Master's thesis supervised by the author studied the robustness of RMS for various traffic loads and roundabout types. Two types of roundabout were studied:  a standard turbo roundabout and  a spiral roundabout. A simulation model was used that underestimated rather than overestimated the effect of an RMS. The results show that, even under less than optimum conditions, traffic performance of the whole roundabout was improved by approximately 10 %. Traffic performance in the relevant (saturated) leg improved by more than this, namely by 15 - 45 %. The reduction of time loss at all legs taken together is even greater: - 20 % to - 50 % in total, and as much as - 70 % for the saturated leg. Notably, altering a dominant load pattern can even reduce waiting time in the leg with the metering light...|$|R

40|$|In United States, roundabouts have {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} effective and efficient alternative to conventional signalized intersections for the control of traffic at junctions. This thesis includes two investigations related to the operations of roundabouts. The first investigation examines {{the ability of a}} planning-level tool (the critical sum method) to serve as an indicator variable for the results of the Highway Capacity Manual’s average delay per vehicle measure for a roundabout facility; to what extent do the results of one predict the results of the other? The critical sum method was found to accurately predict the HCM average delay per vehicle for low-volume conditions, approximately up to an average delay of 15 seconds per vehicle, but the tool was found to provide inaccurate predictions for higher volume conditions. The second investigation looks at the potential of <b>metering</b> <b>signals</b> on a roundabout facility to transfer excess capacity from a low-volume approach to an adjacent higher-volume approach. The analysis indicated positive results for the theoretical benefits of the <b>metering</b> <b>signal</b> when only placing simulated traffic on two of the approaches, but the results were not duplicated when analyzing more-realistic volume scenarios with traffic on all four approaches.
