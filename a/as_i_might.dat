25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E
2500|$|Landsmark {{was active}} {{in trying to get}} more {{minority}} contractors in the construction industry, but he hadn't been paying attention to the busing protests. According to Landsmark, [...] "I had difficulty finding a parking space in downtown Boston, and I was running a few minutes late for the meeting in city hall. So I was in a hurry and perhaps not paying as much attention <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have as I approached a corner, where the young demonstrators were coming in the other direction. I did not see them until both they and I were at that corner." ...|$|E

[...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now that my husband had become so famous I really thought it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Steve Englehart, {{who wrote}} issues #5–16, said Graham [...] "helped me plot, {{so that by}} the end it was pretty much a co-production." [...] Graham is {{formally}} credited as co-writer of issues #14-15, though as Englehart's writing collaborator for those issues, Tony Isabella recalled, [...] "Billy Graham is credited as the co-scripter of my first issue [...] and, try <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> I simply do not recall getting anything other than the usual penciled pages to script. I skimmed a little of that issue and, making no judgment as to whether this is a good or bad thing, the writing does strike me as all mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|After graduating {{high school}} in 2008, she {{attended}} California State Polytechnic University, Pomona where she intended to major in graphic design. During her freshman year, she looked up some online forums regarding voice-over and attended Anime Expo, where she learned about and attended an Adventures in Voice Acting workshop conducted by Tony Oliver. On Oliver's suggestion that she was pretty good at it, she changed her major to theatre, [...] and continued to take voice acting lessons and workshops while studying at school. She also did a production internship at Bang Zoom! Entertainment where she got to sit in {{on some of the}} recording sessions. Her first voice acting project was on K-On! where she voiced some incidental characters. Her first big voice-over role was for Battleship, based on the movie of the same name, where she got to voice a main character among many veteran voice actors. However, video game reviewers panned the game because none of the movie's actors reprised their roles in the game, and faulted the game's limited acting, which was relegated to mostly radio chatter and mission updates. At one point in college, she had some health issues that led her to take an absence from school and acting, so she pursued production work, which her parents thought would make for a more practical career; she later dropped it as she was encouraged by Oliver to pursue acting and to finish school. That was when she landed the lead role as Ayesha in the video game [...] She described Ayesha as a bit airheaded and ditsy but relatable and resembles her personality at times. [...] Video game reviewer Sean Madson of Diehardgamefan found the dub to be of decent quality, but said Ayesha [...] "sounded a bit too obnoxious with her airheadedness." [...] Matt Sainsbury of Digitally Downloaded thought the dub was reasonable but disliked their American accents as not suiting the Japanese personality of the game. [...] Vince Ingenito of IGN wrote that [...] "both the writing and voice acting fail to lend any weight to her plight. Ayesha seems about as upset over her missing sister <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be over a glass of spilled milk, making it really hard to care about the outcome of her quest." [...] Harlacher also voiced Sadira, a spider-themed woman and new character to the Killer Instinct series.|$|E

60|$|In {{view of this}} painful possibility, I {{will not}} (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>might)</b> appeal indignantly to my other {{writings}} as a proof that I am incapable of such a deed: I will not (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>might)</b> point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History--I will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened.|$|E
