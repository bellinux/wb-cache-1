She {{encountered}} Vaan, who was arrested along with Balthier and Fran. This encounter forced her into a series of events, when she was kidnapped by Bangaa headhunter Ba'gamnan and held as hostage in exchange for Balthier. When she managed to escape, she met with Larsa Solidor, one of the sons of Archadian Emperor Gramis, who took care of her and convinced her he wished to make peace with Dalmasca. When she is finally reunited with Vaan, she made him promise not to leave her side, <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> traveled with Vaan, furthering their relationship as sky pirate and partner.|$|E
5|$|Route S3 {{was defined}} in 1929 {{to run from}} Route 3 in East Rutherford west to Route 6 (US46) in Clifton, (this {{is now part of}} Route 3). In 1942, the state took over the {{alignment}} and made it an unnumbered state highway was defined to run from the intersection of Clifton Avenue and Van Houten Avenue southwest to Route S3, which then ran along Allwood Road. World War II delayed completion of Route S3 long enough for an alternate freeway route to be selected, and the part of Allwood Road that was taken over is no longer a state highway. In 1948, the route was assigned the number Route S3 Spur. The number was changed to Route 161 in the 1953 state highway renumbering, <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> then it has remained an isolated state highway.|$|E

25|$|Another early {{representation}} is in a mosaic in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli (Rome, Italy), probably {{made in the}} year 682. It shows a grown, bearded man in court dress but contains no trace of an arrow. The archers and arrows begin to appear by 1000, <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> have been far more commonly shown than the actual moment of his death by clubbing, {{so that there is}} a popular misperception that this is how he died.|$|E
25|$|Next is Aristophanes, {{the comic}} playwright. Aristophanes tells a fantastical, mythological {{story about how}} humans were at one time twice {{the people that they}} are now, but this was seen as {{threatening}} to the gods, so Zeus to cut everyone in half. <b>And</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since,</b> humans go about in search of their other half, in order to become whole. Agathon, the host, follows Aristophanes, and his speech sees Eros as youthful, beautiful, and wise; and as the source of all human virtues.|$|E
25|$|Also {{present in}} large numbers {{relative}} to other regions of Canada (except Toronto), <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> the province was first settled (unlike Toronto), are many European ethnicities {{of the first and}} second generation, notably Germans, Scandinavians, Yugoslavs, Italians and Spaniards. Third-generation Europeans are generally of mixed lineage, and traditionally intermarried with other European-derived ethnic groups more than in any other Canadian province. First-generation Britons remain a strong component of local society despite limitations on immigration from Britain since the ending of special status for British subjects in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|When In Flames were {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, The Jester Race, Anders Fridén and Niklas Sundin {{came up with}} an idea to create a symbol/mascot for In Flames. The result was the Jester Head. This symbol made its first appearance in the cover artwork of The Jester Race <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since,</b> the Jester has been featured in various forms somewhere on every studio album that In Flames has released, either as a song title or on the album artwork. The Jester Head is also featured in lots of In Flames' merchandise and has been featured in banners as part of In Flames' live set.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the logic}} of the {{decision}} was extended by an appeals court to cover claims made under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The Supreme Court itself later expressed doubt as to the legal soundness of that holding, and in the 1985 case Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon expressly held that it did not. This led lower courts to begin to overrule Wilko as well, and in 1989 the Court itself did so in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., part of a series of decisions in the 1980s <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> that greatly expanded the use of arbitration in dispute resolution.|$|E
25|$|In Flames' musical {{style is}} {{characterized}} by the constant use of harmonized lead guitar melodies and screaming-style singing along with death growl. In early albums such as The Jester Race, In Flames would often employ two harmonized lead guitars playing over a rhythm guitar. However, since the band only has two guitar players, they found it hard to reproduce those songs during live performances <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> Reroute to Remain they have focused on writing songs with the intention of playing them live. On the album Soundtrack to Your Escape, the band focused on less guitar melodies, giving place for more synths. However, this has not been continued on the later albums.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{collective}} sports in Slovakia is ice hockey. Slovakia became the member of IIHF on 2 February 1993 <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> has won 4 medals in Ice Hockey World Championships, consisting of 1 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze medal. The most recent success is a silver medal from 2012 IIHF World Championship in Helsinki.

The country has 8280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the IIHF World Ranking at present. Prior to 2012, Slovak team HC Slovan Bratislava joined the Kontinental Hockey League, considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{have been}} winning under 15% {{of the black}} vote in recent {{national}} elections (1980 to 2016). While historically the party had been supporters of rights for African Americans starting in the 1860s, it lost its leadership position in the 1960s. The party abolished slavery under Abraham Lincoln, defeated the Slave Power, and gave blacks the legal right to vote during Reconstruction in the late 1860s. Until the New Deal of the 1930s, blacks supported the Republican Party by large margins. Black voters shifted to the Democratic Party beginning in the 1930s, when major Democratic figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt began to support civil rights, and the New Deal offered them employment opportunities. They became one of the core components of the New Deal Coalition. In the South, after the Voting Rights Act to prohibit racial discrimination in elections was passed by a bipartisan coalition in 1965, blacks were able to vote again <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> have formed a significant portion (20–50%) of the Democratic vote in that region.|$|E

25|$|Belcourt {{was open}} to the public as a museum of antiquities and {{architectural}} and social history. Of the 60 rooms at Belcourt, over a dozen were viewable on tour. A visit to the castle included viewings of an English library (added in 1910 by John Russell Pope; the ceiling is a replica of the one in Haddon Hall's Long Gallery), a banquet hall, a chapel, two of three grand halls, a music room, an Empire-style dining room, a French gothic-style ballroom, two principal bedrooms, a loggia and a gallery. All of the rooms are furnished with pieces from the Tinney Family collections. The first tours of Belcourt were given in 1957 <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> then the castle has been a fixture on Bellevue Avenue. The collections included furnishings, art and artifacts from 33 European and Oriental countries and 37 other Newport mansions. The Tinney Family's enormous collection earned Belcourt a notable status within Newport's thriving tourism industry. Belcourt was also the only mansion in Newport which was both {{open to the public}} and had a private owner in residence. Harle Tinney frequently guided tours through her home and was often present to greet visitors when she was in residence.|$|E
25|$|The {{lake was}} {{the home of the}} Māori Muaūpoko iwi, who lived in several villages around it and {{harvested}} longfin and shortfin eels, waterfowl, and kakahi from its wetlands. Brown teal were chased into snares hung just above the water. The forest was preserved for its groves of kie kie, which produced a sweet fruit and much-prized succulent flower bracts (called tāwhara). The main island, Papaitonga (1.2 ha), was cleared and planted in groves of karaka trees, and a smaller man-made island, Papawharangi (0.3 ha), was built in 1820 from canoe-loads of soil and mussel shells. Both were fortified to use as pā in times of war.In 1822, Te Rauparaha and the Ngāti Toa arrived in the area. They were initially welcomed, but after the murder of a Muaūpoko woman Te Rauparaha narrowly escaped being assassinated; his son and daughter were killed. He and his warriors vowed revenge, and eventually returned and massacred 600 Muaūpoko on Papaitonga Island; the tribe was defeated and lost their territory, influence, and prestige. The lake was taken over by a hapū of Ngāti Raukawa, <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> ownership and use of it has been contested by both them and descendants of the surviving Muaūpoko.|$|E
25|$|In early 1916, the Germans had an {{advantage}} in trench warfare equipment, being equipped with more and better hand grenades, rifle grenades and trench mortars. It was easier for the Germans to transfer troops, artillery and ammunition along the Western Front than the Franco-British, who had incompatible weapons and ammunition and a substantial cadre of German pre-war trained officers NCOs and soldiers remained. The British wartime volunteers gained experience in minor tactics but success usually came from machine-guns and the accuracy and quantity of artillery support, not individual skill and bravery but in the underground war, the BEF tunnellers overtook their German counterparts in technological ability and ambition. With sufficient artillery, the capture of {{a small part of}} the opponents' line was possible but holding it depended on the response of the opponent. When the Bluff was captured, the British retaliated and retook it and Mount Sorrel and Tor Top were retaken by Canadian troops; when the British took ground at St Eloi and Vimy Ridge, the Germans took it back. The constant local fighting was costly but enabled the mass of inexperienced British troops to gain experience, yet had the front been less densely occupied, more troops could have trained and the wisdom of each school of thought was debated at the time <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the Brook {{production}} seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> 1955, {{there has been a}} steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale's production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of Titus, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths {{at the end of the}} play were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at the end of the play swastikas rained down onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.|$|E

Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that time I had a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew that they would be watching and I wanted to let them know I was thinking of them.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{team won}} six Campionat de Catalunya titles between 1930 and 1938, but success at {{national}} level (with {{the exception of the}} 1937 disputed title) evaded them.

In 1978 Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> members of the club have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. Núñez's main objective was to develop Barça into a world-class club by giving it stability {{both on and off the}} pitch.
