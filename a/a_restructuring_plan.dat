2500|$|In October 2013, Peugeot {{closed their}} {{production}} plant at Aulnay-sous-Bois {{as part of}} <b>a</b> <b>restructuring</b> <b>plan</b> to reduce overcapacity {{in the face of}} a shrinking domestic market. [...] By December 2013, Chinese investors were rumoured to be potential investors. [...] In February 2014, the Peugeot family agreed to give up control of the company by reducing its holdings from 25% to 14%. As part of this agreement, Dongfeng Motors and the French government were each to buy 14% stakes in the company, creating three partners with equal voting rights. The board of directors was to be composed of six independent members, two representatives of each Dongfeng, the French state and the Peugeot family, and two members representing employees and employees shareholders.

The equity participation by Dongfeng expanded an already budding relationship with Peugeot. The pair at the time were jointly operating three car-manufacturing plants in China, with a capacity of producing 750,000 vehicles a year.
