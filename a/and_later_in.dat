5|$|A {{military}} station, {{operated by}} the Royal Air Force and later the United States Navy, was opened on part of Home Farm close to the parish boundary with Ruislip in 1917, later becoming known as RAF West Ruislip.

5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains.

5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and {{a small number of}} brief truces occurred.|$|E

5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek {{them out on the}} streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E
5|$|All stories {{starring}} Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor are complete, {{though many}} episodes no longer survive on their original videotapes and were only available from black-and-white overseas prints upon recovery; these episodes have subsequently been restored to colour {{using a variety}} of methods.

The latter was recovered from overseas, initially from a tape in the NTSC format, <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the original PAL format on a tape returned from Dubai.|$|E
5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder <b>and</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> his international career became an agile slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E
