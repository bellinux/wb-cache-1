The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E
500|$|In 1959, Johnson was {{suspended}} indefinitely by the Lions after {{he missed the}} team plane back to Detroit following a November 1 blowout loss to the 49ers. To that point, the Lions had a 1–5 record, and coach George Wilson used Johnson's suspension {{as an opportunity to}} scold the whole team for its lack of [...] "desire." [...] Johnson was ultimately fined $1,000. Wilson took the brunt of the blame for Detroit's struggles in 1958 and 1959, but he questioned the resolve of some of the team's higher-paid players, including Johnson. Following the season, Johnson was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for two draft picks. [...] "That's <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get for him," [...] explained Wilson.|$|E
500|$|West Ham manager Alan Pardew {{described}} the defeat {{as hard to}} take: [...] "It felt like a defeat when the third goal went in. We rallied and had a great chance in extra time. We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I felt {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>could.</b> I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{timing of}} the first raid was {{influenced}} by advice given by Sir Malcolm McAlpine, {{the chairman of the}} construction company Sir Robert McAlpine, who suggested that the Watten site should be attacked while the concrete was still setting. On 27 August 1943, 187 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the US 8th Air Force attacked the site with devastating effect. The fortified train station {{on the north side of}} the bunker was especially badly damaged, as concrete had just been poured there. Dornberger later wrote that following the attack the site was [...] "a desolate heap of concrete, steel, props and planking. The concrete hardened. After a few days the shelter was beyond saving. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do was roof in a part and use it for other work." [...] The bombing killed and injured hundreds of the slave workers on site; although the Allies had sought to avoid casualties by timing the raid with what they thought was a change of shifts, the shift pattern had been changed by the Germans at the last minute to achieve the day's work quota.|$|E
500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E

At {{the start of}} the occupation, Fretilin radio sent the following broadcast: [...] "The Indonesian forces are killing indiscriminately. Women and children are being shot in the streets. We are all going to be killed.... This is an appeal for international help. Please do something to stop this invasion." [...] One Timorese refugee told later of [...] "rape [...] cold-blooded assassinations of women and children and Chinese shop owners". Dili's bishop at the time, Martinho da Costa Lopes, said later: [...] "The soldiers who landed started killing everyone they could find. There were many dead bodies in the streets – <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see were the soldiers killing, killing, killing." [...] In one incident, a group of fifty men, women, and children – including Australian freelance reporter Roger East – were lined up on a cliff outside of Dili and shot, their bodies falling into the sea. Many such s took place in Dili, where onlookers were ordered to observe and count aloud as each person was executed. It is estimated that at least 2,000 Timorese were massacred in the first two days of the invasion in Dili alone. In addition to Fretilin supporters, Chinese migrants were also singled out for execution; five hundred were killed in the first day alone.|$|E

With this overwhelming alarm, the Canadians started digging trenches and positioning themselves on Hill 677. They also put positions on the mile-long ridge that was connected to it. Hill 677 for the Canadians was positioned {{on the west side}} of the Kapyong River. On Hill 504, dug in were the 3rd Royal Australian Regiment which was on the other side of hill 677 and who were also ready for the Chinese attack.|$|E

Zaghba was born to a Moroccan Muslim father and an Italian Catholic Christian mother who had converted to Islam to marry. Zaghba had dual Moroccan and Italian nationality. When his parents divorced, he went to Italy with his mother. In 2016, Zaghba was stopped at Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport by Italian officers who found ISIS-related materials on his mobile phone; he was stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. Italian authorities said Zaghba was monitored continuously while in Italy and that the UK was informed about him. Giuseppe Amato, an Italian prosecutor, said [...] "We did our best. We could just monitor and surveil... and send a note to British authorities, that's <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do and we did it.

2500|$|When Flagler envisioned {{successes in}} the oil industry, he and Rockefeller started {{building}} their fortune in refining oil in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland became very well known for oil refining, as, [...] "More and more crude oil was shipped from the oil regions to Cleveland for the refining process because of transportation facilities and the aggressiveness of the refiners there. It was due largely {{to the efforts of}} Henry M. Flagler and John D. Rockefeller." [...] Flagler and Rockefeller worked hard for their company to achieve such prominence. Henry explained: [...] "We worked night and day, making good oil as cheaply as possible and selling it for <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get." [...] Not only did Flagler and Rockefeller's Standard Oil company become well known in Ohio, they expanded to other states, as well as gained additional capital in purchasing smaller oil refining companies across the nation. According to Allan Nevins, in John D. Rockefeller (p 292), [...] "Standard Oil was born as a big enterprise, it had cut its teeth as a partnership and was now ready to plunge forward into a period of greater expansion and development. It soon was doing one tenth of all the petroleum business in the United States. Besides its two refineries and a barrel plant in Cleveland, it possessed a fleet of tank cars and warehouses {{in the oil}} regions as well as warehouses and tanks in New York." ...|$|E
