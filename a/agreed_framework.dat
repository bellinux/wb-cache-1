25|$|The {{construction}} of light water reactors - under the 1994 <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework</b> two light-water reactors {{would be built}} {{in return for the}} closure of North Korea's graphite-moderated nuclear power plant program at Yongbyon. This agreement broke down after both sides defaulted, especially since 2002.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{evidence}} from Pakistan, Libya, and multiple confessions from North Korea itself, the United States accused North Korea of noncompliance and halted oil shipments; North Korea later claimed its public {{confession of guilt}} had been deliberately misconstrued.

25|$|Fuel {{reprocessing}} facility that recovers uranium and plutonium from spent fuel using the PUREX process. Based on extended Eurochemic reprocessing plant design at the Mol-Dessel site in Belgium. In 1994 its activity was frozen {{in accord with}} the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework.</b> On April 25, 2009, North Korean news agency KCNA, reported the resumption of reprocessing of spent fuel to recover plutonium.|$|E
25|$|Two Magnox {{reactors}} (50MWe and 200MWe), {{under construction}} at Yongbyon and Taechon. If completed, 50MWe reactor would {{be capable of}} producing 60kg of plutonium per year, enough for approximately 10 weapons and 200MWe reactor 220kg of plutonium annually, enough for approximately 40 weapons. Construction was halted in 1994 about a year from completion in accord with the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework,</b> and by 2004 the structures and pipework had deteriorated badly.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} environment {{changed with the}} election of U.S. president George W. Bush in 2001. His administration rejected South Korea's Sunshine Policy and the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework.</b> The U.S. government treated North Korea as a rogue state, while they subsequently redoubled their efforts to acquire nuclear weapons {{in order to avoid the}} fate of Iraq. On 9 October 2006, North Korea announced it had conducted its first nuclear weapons test.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the light}} water {{reactors}} would require enriched uranium to be imported from outside North Korea, {{the amount of}} reactor fuel and waste could be more easily tracked, {{making it more difficult}} to divert nuclear waste to be reprocessed into plutonium. However, the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework</b> was mired in difficulties, with each side blaming the other for the delays in implementation; as a result, the light water reactors were never finished. In late 2002, after fuel aid was suspended, North Korea returned to using its old reactors.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 1993, North Korea {{said that}} it planned to {{withdraw}} from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and refused to allow IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear sites. By 1994, the United States believed that North Korea had enough reprocessed plutonium to produce about 10 bombs with the amount of plutonium increasing. Faced with diplomatic pressure after UN Security Council Resolution 825 and the threat of American military air strikes against the reactor, North Korea agreed to dismantle its plutonium program as part of the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework</b> in which South Korea and the United States would provide North Korea with light water reactors and fuel oil until those reactors could be completed.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{with support}} of the UK Government's Department of Health, {{a wide range of}} UK organisations signed a {{memorandum}} of understanding (MoU) setting out an <b>agreed</b> <b>framework</b> for activities by parties concerned to help address the issues raised by the practice of conversion therapy in the UK. In addition to many of the professional bodies that previously issued the consensus statement, signatories included the UK Association of Christian Counsellors, the Royal College of General Practitioners, NHS England and NHS Scotland. The signatory organisations recognised a shared commitment to protecting the public from the risks of conversion therapy. They committed to raise awareness among healthcare professionals and psychological therapists of ethical issues involved in conversion therapy and to provide training to enable therapists to support clients in distress in an appropriate way.|$|E

25|$|A newer {{nuclear reactor}} with a {{capacity}} of 5MWe. This gas-graphite moderated Magnox type reactor is North Korea's main reactor, where practically all of its plutonium has been produced. A full core consists of 8,000 fuel rods and can yield a maximum of 27–29kg of plutonium if left in the reactor for optimal burnup. The North Korean Plutonium Stock, Mid-2006, {{is estimated to be}} able to produce 0.9 grams of plutonium per thermal megawatt every day of its operation. The material required to make a single bomb is approximately four to eight kilograms. Often, North Korea has unloaded the reactor before reaching the maximum burnup level. There are three known cores which were unloaded in 1994 (under IAEA supervision in accordance with the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework),</b> 2005, and 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, North Korea and the United States {{signed an}} <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework</b> which was {{designed}} to freeze and eventually dismantle the North's nuclear weapons program in exchange for aid in producing two power-generating nuclear reactors and the assurance that it won't be invaded again. In 2000, after a meeting with Madeleine Albright, he agreed to a moratorium on missile construction. In 2002, Kim Jong-il's government admitted to having produced nuclear weapons since the 1994 agreement. Kim's regime argued the secret production was necessary for security purposesciting the presence of United States-owned nuclear weapons in South Korea and the new tensions with the United States under President George W. Bush. On 9 October 2006, North Korea's Korean Central News Agency announced that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{publicly}} condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea, naming North Korea one {{of three}} states in an [...] "axis of evil", and saying that [...] "the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons." [...] Within months, [...] "both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework</b> of October 1994." [...] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on [...] " [...] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world". Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to [...] "a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula", and stated that [...] "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities {{would be considered a}} grave threat to the United States", for which North Korea would be held accountable. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of 2007. By May 2009, North Korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack South Korea.|$|E

2500|$|Under the 1994 <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework,</b> the U.S. {{government}} {{agreed to}} facilitate the supply of two light water reactors to North Korea in exchange for North Korean disarmament. Such reactors are considered [...] "more proliferation-resistant than North Korea's graphite-moderated reactors", but not [...] "proliferation proof". Implementation of the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework</b> foundered, and in 2002 the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Framework</b> fell apart, with each side blaming the other for its failure. By 2002, Pakistan had admitted that North Korea had gained access to Pakistan's nuclear technology in the late 1990s.|$|E
