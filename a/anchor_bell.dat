50|$|The program {{originally}} debuted {{under the}} title ABC News This Morning on July 5, 1982. In early 1983, the program was retitled ABC World News This Morning.

5000|$|In 1989, Williams rejoined KYW-TV as co-anchor of the 6 and 11pm newscasts with Steve Bell and KYW ran a [...] "Beverly's Back" [...] {{campaign}} in 1989. She was brought back {{in hopes of}} bringing in more ratings to the station which had low ratings compared to rivals WCAU-TV and WPVI-TV. KYW changed the news format in 1991. Williams and Bell were replaced by Jennifer Ward at 11pm in August of that year but still remained in the 6pm time slot. In 1992, Beverly was demoted to weekend <b>anchor</b> while <b>Bell</b> was let go by the station. Williams solo anchored the weekend evening news for eight years expanding from 1992 to 2000.|$|R
5000|$|In Timeline, news <b>anchor</b> Steve <b>Bell</b> {{and four}} ethnically diverse field reporters (Siboletto of Zimbabwe, Owen of Canarfon, Luis de Jaen and Selim Karasi) report from six {{watershed}} events {{in human history}} between 1066 and 1492. Owing its inspiration to Walter Cronkite's You Are There which aired on CBS from 1953 to 1957, Timeline also included faux commercials for products and services first available {{at that time in}} history. While the premier episode [...] "The Crusades" [...] aired to good ratings and received extensive press coverage, PBS's decision to broadcast each half-hour episode only on a bi-monthly basis (paired with comedian Mark Russell's half-hour satirical TV specials) provided no audience continuity and the series soon disappeared from public view.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese {{water spider}} spins four main kinds of silk: (1) silk {{used for the}} diving bell, (2) silk to <b>anchor</b> the diving <b>bell</b> to water plants, (3) silk for “walking” so as to get prey and mate, and (4) silk for the egg-cocoon. The diving bell silk is “used for breathing,” that is it serves to {{oxygenate}} the diving bell. Females produce larger diving bells than males. Males build their diving bells less carefully than females do. Males also frequently make more walking threads than females.|$|R

50|$|In 1612, Edge {{sailed to}} Spitsbergen as {{master of the}} Sea Horse. From 1613 to 1619 Edge served either as {{commander}} or co-commander of the English whaling fleet. He appears to have spent several of these seasons aboard ships that <b>anchored</b> in <b>Bell</b> Sound (Bellsund), the principal area for English whaling. He often {{had to deal with}} foreign interlopers intent on whaling in Spitsbergen. For example, in 1615 several Danish men-of-war, led by Gabriel Kruse, tried to force him to pay a fine to whale in what was claimed by the Danish to be part of Christian IV's territory, but he refused. In 1617 he ordered away a whaleship from Vlissingen but also allowed two Danish whaleships to hunt whales in Horn Sound, while in the following year he had to deal with several more vessels from the Dutch provinces. In 1620, to cover debts, the Muscovy Company handed over the whaling side to four members of the company, one being Edge. In 1621 and 1622 Edge and his partners again sent ships to Spitsbergen.|$|R
5000|$|That same year, {{the station}} notched its first three Emmy Award {{nominations}} in its history, winning two; Keith Cate won [...] "Best News Anchor", {{and the news}} department as a whole won for [...] "Best Live Reporting". However, the station became embroiled in behind-the-scenes disputes with management and former on-air talent that were let go after Media General took over and Land decided to relaunch the news department; {{this led to a}} number of breach of contract, fraud and defamation of character and racial discrimination lawsuits against the station and/or Media General by former on-air and production employees, including former sports <b>anchor</b> Doug <b>Bell</b> and former longtime general manager Hoyle Broome (Land's direct predecessor, who had been with the then-WBMG since 1977), as well as a group of former African-American employees (calling themselves the Birmingham Seven). Over the next few years, more newscasts would be added to WIAT's schedule: the station debuted a half-hour newscast at 6:00 p.m. on Monday through Saturday evenings in September 2001, followed by the addition of a two-hour weekday morning newscast in September 2004.|$|R
50|$|On 15 October, {{the first}} team of USN divers from Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit ONE (MDSU-1) began {{assessing}} the sunken vessel. Working in low- to zero-visibility conditions, 66 MDSU-1 and 30 Japanese JMSDF divers from the submarine rescue ship ARS Chihaya conducted 526 dives over 29 days, searching the wreck. Ōnishi, relatives {{of some of the}} missing crewmembers, and several Japanese government officials observed the operation from the dive support ships. The divers recovered the bodies of eight of the nine missing people (three crewmembers, four students, and the two teachers), many personal effects, and several items unique to the ship, such as its nameplate, <b>bell,</b> <b>anchors,</b> and helm.|$|R
500|$|Internally, the building's form centres on a full-height, {{octagonal}} {{hall that}} sits below the central dome. [...] The hall has round, arched openings {{from the first}} floor upwards, providing large gallery spaces, whilst its floor is decorated with a mosaic depicting the points of a compass. Office spaces are located off long central corridors, which are decorated with white Calcutta Marble. A {{large portion of the}} building costs (approximately 25%) were spent on decorations and fittings; the inside of the building is lavishly decorated using expensive materials including mahogany from Spain and oak from Danzig for the woodwork, bronze for the floor furniture and fittings, and white marble for the floors and walls. One noted interior feature is the grey granite grand staircase, which is lined with stained glass windows adorned with images of Poseidon, <b>anchors,</b> ships <b>bells</b> and shells and dedications to countries of the British Empire [...] including Singapore, South Africa, Canada and Australia. The grand nature of the inside of the building's interior has meant that it {{has been used as a}} film set in several productions, including The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.|$|R
50|$|With {{a budget}} {{in excess of}} two million dollars for just six half hours, Timeline was one of PBS’s most {{expensive}} productions for that time. Funding was provided by Texas-based Meadows Foundation, PBS, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Maryland Public Television, Holmes Associates in London (UK), Television Espagna & Turkish Radio & Television.While each partner country was responsible for crew and cast on their own locations, an international team of department heads supervised overall production. With creator and director Leo Eaton at its head, this team - consisting of series producer Diane Holmes, Hollywood production designer Peter Wooley, Spanish costume designer Gumersindo Andrés López, and British production manager Brian True-May - spent three months commuting between production centers in Madrid, Istanbul and London before filming finally began on the Isle of Man (UK) {{in the summer of}} 1978.The four field reporters were cast from the four partner countries. American actress Fran Dorn played Siboletto of Zimbabwe, British actor Robert Bathurst played Owen of Canarfon, Spanish actor Iñaki Aierra played Luis de Jaen and Turkish actor Engin Cezzar played Selim Karasi. News <b>anchor</b> Steve <b>Bell</b> (formerly news <b>anchor</b> of ABC’s Good Morning America) played himself.|$|R
50|$|Bell Island and Little Bell Island {{are one of}} the few {{locations}} in North America that German forces directly attacked during the Second World War. U-boats raided the island twice in 1942, sinking four ore carriers and killing more than 60 men. The Sydney to Port-aux-Basques passenger ferry SS Caribou was sunk in the Gulf of St. Lawrence with the loss of 136 people, including women and children, and four ore carriers were torpedoed at <b>anchor</b> at Wabana, <b>Bell</b> Island, killing 69 men. It was later discovered that a spy was involved. On board U-518 was Werner von Janowski, an agent of Germany’s Abwehr intelligence service. At the request of the Newfoundland Commission of Government, Canadian authorities developed defensive plans in case the Germans tried to capture St. John's.|$|R
60|$|The port--the mart, {{the civil}} and {{religious}} capital of these rude Islands--is called Tai-o-hae, and lies strung {{along the beach}} of a precipitous green bay in Nuka-hiva. It was midwinter when we came thither, and the weather was sultry, boisterous, and inconstant. Now the wind blew squally from the land down gaps of splintered precipice; now, between the sentinel islets of the entry, it came in gusts from seaward. Heavy and dark clouds impended on the summits; the rain roared and ceased; the scuppers of the mountain gushed; {{and the next day}} we would see the sides of the amphitheatre bearded with white falls. Along the beach the town shows a thin file of houses, mostly white, and all ensconced in the foliage of an avenue of green puraos; a pier gives access from the sea across the belt of breakers; to the eastward there stands, on a projecting bushy hill, the old fort which is now the calaboose, or prison; eastward still, alone in a garden, the Residency flies the colours of France. Just off Calaboose Hill, the tiny Government schooner rides almost permanently at <b>anchor,</b> marks eight <b>bells</b> in the morning (there or thereabout) with the unfurling of her flag, and salutes the setting sun with the report of a musket.|$|R
