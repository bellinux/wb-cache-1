5|$|Upon {{designation}} as {{a tropical}} disturbance, the predecessor to Cyclone Bejisa dropped heavy rainfall across the Seychelles. A weather station on Mahé observed 164mm (6.46in) of rain over a 24-hour period beginning on December27.

5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge over <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E

5|$|September 10, 1964– Hurricane Dora makes {{landfall}} as {{a weakening}} Category 2 hurricane near Jacksonville, the first hurricane in <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{to strike the}} area. Dora produces moderate to heavy amounts of precipitation which peaks at 23.73inches (603mm) in Mayo, causing flooding damage and killing one from drowning. Wind gusts peak at 125mph (200km/h) near St. Augustine, causing massive utility failures and heavy damage to buildings. Two Navy personnel die when their evacuating plane crashed upon takeoff. Damage totaled about $220million (1964USD, $1.53billion 2008USD).|$|E

40|$|This section {{provides}} the options to manage aging effects during <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation. Since {{this report is}} generically applicable to the plants identified in Section 1. 1 of this document, only program attributes are given. Plant-specific details will be developed during the preparation of license renewal applications. The program attributes are based on requirements currently accepted in the industry. Since the rate of age-related degradation does not change, for most aging effects these requirements will remain acceptable to maintain intended functions consistent with the CLB during <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation. Additional justification for aging effects that do not occur at a linear rate, if applicable, will be provided {{at the end of}} the program description in Section 4. 0. Therefore, PWR containment intended functions are maintained during <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation. Section 3. 0 identifies the aging effects that require management during <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation. Section 4. 1 provides program attributes using current license basis, and Section 4. 2 provides additional activities and attributes required to manage aging effects. Details and implementation guidance are provided. Deviations from the attributes provided will require descriptions and justifications in plant-specific applications. Aging management attributes are summarized by aging management program (AMP) tables (see Table 4 - 1). These tables summarize program attributes and activities that will be the basis for programs implemented by utilities during <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation...|$|R
5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba for <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop. Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered for <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> This washed away {{large areas of}} topsoil, which would take {{a long period of}} time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} 1982 to 1991, Godwin {{produced}} another {{collection of short}} fiction and four more novels. According to Publishers Weekly, it was A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) and A Southern Family (1987) that substantially expanded her readership. These novels remained on bestseller lists for <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Godwin's earlier works had sold an average of less than 8,000 copies, while A Mother and Two Daughters sold more than 1.5 million. It {{was the most popular}} of Godwin's early works and {{the first time she had}} written a narrative from the point-of-view of multiple characters. In 1987, Godwin was awarded the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for her work on The Southern Family.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Juan {{remained}} at peak intensity for over 24hours. After moving northwestward for <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> it turned and accelerated to the north. The eye became less distinct on September28, and the hurricane weakened slightly. Due to its fast forward motion, Juan {{had little time}} to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect (near Halifax) on September29 with winds of 100mph (160km/h). It weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern Canadian Maritimes and crossing the Nova Scotia peninsula as a hurricane. Juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over Prince Edward Island by early September29. Later that afternoon, the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, {{the city}} council decided that a branch was to be built during {{construction}} at Nørrebro, to allow a future branch line from the City Circle Line towards Brønshøj. The {{first part of this}} line was intended to be constructed {{at the same time as}} the City Circle Line, to avoid a multitude-higher construction cost and long interruptions of operations later. This did not involve a final decision, only an option for future construction. The Herlev/Brønshøj line was ultimately dropped as the City of Copenhagen withdrew its share of the cost of the Nørrebro branch chamber in its 2009 budget, and the state refused to continue the project. Any branch to the Herlev / Brønshøj region would now require a shutdown of the City Circle Line for <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service for <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within {{four weeks of}} Iniki, while other areas were without power {{for up to three}} months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are over <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.|$|E

He was unable to speak, instead communicating through his wife. He returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews were published in print. In July 2007, he revealed {{that he was still}} unable to speak. Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate, eventually using a copy of his own voice created from his recordings by CereProc. In March 2010, his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Ebert later proposed a test to determine the realism of a synthesized voice.|$|E
