40|$|Today {{enterprises}} {{are exposed}} to an increasingly dynamic environment. Last but not least increasing competition caused by globalisation more and more requires gaining competitive advantages by improved process control, within and beyond an enterprise. Autonomous control of logistic processes is proposed {{as a means to}} better face dynamics and complexity. Autonomous control means the ability of logistic objects to process information, to render and to execute decisions on their own. To engineer logistics systems based on autonomous control, dedicated methodologies are needed. This paper proposes a methodology for system specification that consists of a notational part, a procedure model and a software tool, covering a substantial part of the overall system engineering process. Supported by this methodology a logistics process <b>expert</b> <b>shall</b> be enabled to specify an autonomous logistic system adequately...|$|R
