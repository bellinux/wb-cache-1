25|$|The 1938 {{effort to}} remove the {{building}} {{was the last one}} for 30 years. Various reasons have been suggested for why the Old Post Office Building survived. A common claim is that the federal government, fighting the Great Depression, simply did not have the money.

Architectural historians have also argued that President Franklin D.

[...] After fifteen years in the rank, jokes circulated about his being the most senior first lieutenant in the Air Corps, but he was finally promoted to captain on 1 August 1935. He was temporary major from 20 October 1935 to 16 June 1936, and again on 4 October 1938, before the rank finally became substantive on 1 July 1940.

I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned.

In reality, few goods are completely non-rival as rivalry can emerge at certain levels. For instance, road (or internet) use is non-rival up to a certain capacity, after which congestion means that each additional user decreases speed for others. For that, recent economic theory views rivalry as a continuum, not as a binary category, where many goods are somewhere between the two extremes of completely rival and completely non-rival. <b>A</b> <b>perfectly</b> non-rival <b>good</b> can be consumed simultaneously by an unlimited number of consumers.|$|R

The main finding is that only a finite number of distributions of the divisible good is consistent with strategy-proofness and nonbossiness. Under various additional assumptions - neutrality, individual rationality, object efficiency, weak decentralization - the distribution of the divisible good is further restricted. For instance, under neutrality the outcome of the mechanism can have only one distribution, which is hence independent of individual preferences. In this case the mechanism becomes serially dictatorial. On the other hand, individual rationality leads to a fixed price equilibrium with a well-defined rationing method (Gale's top-trading cycle procedure) ...|$|R

The formal analysis of these situations, which originates in a seminal paper by O’Neill (1982), proposes a number of well-behaved rules recommending a division of the resources among agents that depends both on the endowment and on the agents’ claims. The term “well-behaved” indicates that these rules may satisfy principles of fairness or other appealing properties. In this context, how can claimants commit to a distribution of resources?

50|$|Labour {{demand is}} a derived demand; that is, hiring labour is not desired {{for its own}} sake but rather because it aids in {{producing}} output, which contributes to an employer's revenue and hence profits. The demand for an additional amount of labour depends on the Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) and the marginal cost (MC) of the worker. With <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> competitive <b>goods</b> market, the MRP is calculated by multiplying the price of the end product or service by the Marginal Physical Product of the worker. If the MRP is greater than a firm's Marginal Cost, then the firm will employ the worker since doing so will increase profit.
