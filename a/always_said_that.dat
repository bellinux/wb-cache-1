The background, and its wealth of detail, will naturally capture the interest of players. But it's the simplicity of the rules which makes the computerization possible." [...] After Paragon Software acquired the video game rights to Traveller from Game Designers Workshop, Miller contributed [...] "generous support and research material" [...] to Paragon's development efforts.|$|E

[...] Carlos Alberto Torres, the captain of Brazil's winning team in 1970, said that the country lost due to a [...] "feeling of 'we've already won'". He added that [...] "Germany played how I like to see and Scolari's tactics for this match were suicidal". Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella struggled to explain Brazil's loss, saying [...] "Football is illogical". In contrast, Argentinian icon Diego Maradona was seen singing a song mocking the Brazilian defeat.|$|E

500|$|On 30 August 2013, Tasci {{moved to}} Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow for an {{undisclosed}} fee. Upon leaving Stuttgart, he told the press, [...] "It {{was not an easy}} decision. The present decision is not a decision against VfB, but for the new task. I had an incredibly great time at VfB, have played in the youth here, then I turned pro and recently been the captain. I have <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I am a VfBler and that I will remain." [...] Immediately after joining the club, his debut was delayed by the injuries he sustained while at Stuttgart and he did not play for three weeks. He made his first appearance with the club on 2 October 2013 when he appeared in training. After damaging his meniscus, Tasci announced he would return in January following an operation. He made his debut for the club on 17 March 2014 in a 2–2 draw against Anzhi Makhachkala. He made three more appearances that season.|$|E
500|$|When Dixon first {{emerged into}} the public {{spotlight}} with Mis-Teeq, she was primarily the group's MC, whilst one of her band-mates Sabrina Washington usually sang lead vocals on the records. Washington encouraged her to rap from the band's inception, saying: [...] "When she started she was a bit shy, but I <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it adds something, an element of difference. It {{was the first time}} I'd ever heard a woman MC and I was like, 'Alesha, you have got to do that,' and she was like 'No Bri, don't make me look stupid'". However, when she began her solo career her first UK album, The Alesha Show, saw Dixon undergo a genre-shift. The album featured no rapping and was primarily R and soul, unlike Mis-Teeq's music, which focused mainly on garage and hip hop. Dixon commented that the record consisted of [...] "a lot more guitar-written songs with pop produced around it". Dixons third album The Entertainer consists mainly of uptempo pop and dance-pop tracks.|$|E
500|$|Eve Myles {{previously}} {{appeared in}} the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] as Gwyneth, a 19th-century clairvoyant. Gwyneth had {{a connection to the}} Cardiff Rift, which later became a central plot device in Torchwood. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, Russell T Davies denied they were connected, stating they are [...] "just two names beginning with [...] "G"." [...] Subsequently however, Davies' 2008 Doctor Who episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] alluded to a familial relationship between the characters (with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was), explaining their physical resemblance as the result of [...] "spatial genetic multiplicity". Eve Myles said of the two characters, [...] "it was never on the cards as such, but something {{in the back of my}} head <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they were going to be connected somehow." [...] Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that [...] "It's not familial as we understand it" [...] instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as [...] "an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift." ...|$|E

500|$|In their {{analysis}} of the case, the journalists Simon Freeman and Barry Penrose state that Thorpe probably formed {{the outline of a}} plan to silence Scott early in 1974, after the latter's re-emergence became a matter of increasing concern. Holmes later said that Thorpe was insistent that Scott be killed: [...] " [...] he would never be safe with that man around". Uncertain how to proceed, late in 1974 Holmes approached a business acquaintance, a carpet salesman named John Le Mesurier (not {{to be confused with the}} actor of that name). Le Mesurier introduced Holmes to George Deakin, a fruit machine salesman who, he thought, would have contacts with people who might be prepared to deal with Scott. Holmes and Le Mesurier concocted a story involving a blackmailer who needed to be frightened off; Deakin agreed to help. In February 1975 Deakin met Andrew Newton, an airline pilot, who said he was willing to deal with Scott for an appropriate fee—between £5,000 and £10,000 was suggested. Deakin put Newton in touch with Holmes. Newton <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he had been hired to kill, not frighten, citing the size of the fee that he was offered—too much, he said, simply to scare someone.|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 2007, in an {{unexpected}} turn of events, Henry {{was transferred to}} Barcelona for €24million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season. It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if I ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've <b>always</b> <b>said</b> <b>that.</b> You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E
