5|$|The first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway (C), {{opened in}} 1890. Its early success {{resulted}} in a rush of proposals to Parliament for other deep-level routes under the capital, but by 1901 only two more lines had opened: the Waterloo & City Railway (W) in 1898 and the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900. Construction had started on one other line <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> following a financial crisis. The rest of the companies were struggling to raise funding.|$|E

He would not win the tournament again until 1998 when he KO'd all three of his opponents in front of 63,800 spectators at the Tokyo Dome. In what {{is considered to be}} one of the best Grands Prix ever, and the pinnacle of Aerts' career, he stopped Masaaki Satake with a knee strike in the quarters and forced the referee to stop his semi-final match with long-time rival Mike Bernardo. In one of the most significant moments in K-1 history, he knocked out Andy Hug with one of his famous high kicks in the final. He won this tournament in six minutes and forty-three seconds, which was the quickest K-1 GP win ever at the time. This record stood until 2009 when it was beaten by Semmy Schilt.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{contemporary}} rock drummers such as Ginger Baker and John Bonham, Moon hated drum solos {{and refused}} to play them in concert. At a Madison Square Garden show on 10 June 1974, Townshend and Entwistle decided to spontaneously stop playing during [...] "Wasp Man" [...] to listen to Moon's drum solo. Moon continued briefly <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>stopped,</b> shouting [...] "Drum solos are boring!" [...] However, in 1977, he made a guest appearance in a Led Zeppelin concert, joining John Bonham for his [...] "Moby Dick" [...] drum solo. The concert was bootlegged as For Badgeholders Only.|$|E
500|$|From the start, {{the coin}} failed to circulate. In 1976, a Treasury study done in {{conjunction}} with a private-sector firm found that the Eisenhower dollar had a near-100 percent attrition rate, that is, almost always, a coin was used in only one transaction, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> circulating (by comparison, the attrition rate of the quarter was close to zero). This was because of the coin's large size, its weight, and the lack of potential uses for it. Even so, it was successful in replacing private-issue tokens in Nevada casinos. According to numismatist Randy Camper, about 70% of Eisenhower dollars were used in casinos. Although the vending machine industry lobbied for the Eisenhower dollar, they converted few machines to take the pieces. Lange recalled, [...] "The fact is that these coins never circulated outside of casinos and nearby areas, and I don't recall ever seeing a vending machine that accepted them." ...|$|E

The Apperson {{brothers}} had notified the Kokomo townspeople {{of the test}} drive and a crowd gathered to witness the event. Haynes was concerned that his vehicle could injure someone in the crowd, so he had the vehicle towed by a horse and buggy to Pumpkinvine Pike, away from the crowd. The car started with Haynes driving and Elmer Apperson riding as a passenger, and [...] traveled at 7mph (11km/h). He traveled for [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>stopped</b> the vehicle to manually turn it around with Elmer's help. He proceeded to drive it several more miles back into town without stopping. His trip convinced him that the vehicle was worthwhile and could become a valuable enterprise, although he was disappointed in the vehicle's handling and decided he needed to improve the steering system {{and find a way}} to divert the motor's exhaust smoke away from the carriage.|$|E

The state eventually even began supplying janissaries with [...] "Provencal clothing", which sold in low-priced lots, in preference to Salonican wools, whose quality had continued to deteriorate. Short of cash, the Jews were forced into paying the grand vizier more than half of their taxes in the form of promissory notes.
