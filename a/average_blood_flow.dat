40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} data on {{the blood}} flow velocity in the internal carotid artery, which was obtained using the optical flow method (OFM) with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and the time-of-flight (TOF) technique using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Materials and Methods: Images were obtained from 12 cerebrovascular patients who underwent both brain DSA and MRA imaging. The OFM was applied on the DSA images to determine the <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity. The calculated results were compared with the values obtained from the TOF-MRA data. A linear fit {{was performed on the}} data and Bland-Altman plots were analyzed. Results: The blood flow velocity was closely associated with vascular diseases. Color-coding of the OFM measurements were superimposed on to the DSA images, which quantitatively illustrated the relative flow in the vessels. The <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity was calculated using OFM and DSA, which demonstrated a high correlation with the MRA measurements in the anterior-posterior (AP) view (R = 0. 71). In contrast, the <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity was low in the lateral view (R = 0. 28). The consistency between the high and low blood velocity in the AP view was better compared to the lateral view. The blood flow velocity distribution in the AP view was statistically closer to the MRA measurement compared to the lateral view. Conclusions: This study evaluated the correlation of blood flow measured using DSA and TOF-MRA in a smal...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cervical spine manual {{therapy has}} been {{associated}} with a small risk of serious adverse neurovascular events, particularly to the vertebral arteries. Sustained end-range rotation is recommended clinically as a pre-manipulative screening tool; however ultrasound studies have yielded conflicting results about the effect of rotation on blood flow in the vertebral arteries. There has been little research on internal carotid arterial flow or utilising the reference standard of angiography. Objectives: To evaluate the mean effect of cervical rotation on blood flow in the craniocervical arteries and blood supply to the brain, as well as individual variation. Design: This was an observational study. Method: Magnetic resonance angiography was used to measure <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> volume in the vertebral arteries, internal carotid arteries, and total cerebral inflow, in three neck positions: neutral, end-range left rotation and end-range right rotation in healthy adults. Results: Twenty participants were evaluated. There was a decrease in <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> volume in the vertebral and internal carotid arteries on contralateral rotation, compared to neutral. This was statistically significant on left rotation only. Ipsilateral rotation had no effect on <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> volume in any artery. Total cerebral inflow was not significantly affected by rotation in either direction. Conclusions: It appears that in healthy adults the cerebral vasculature can compensate for decreased flow in one or more arteries by increasing flow in other arteries, to maintain cerebral perfusion. Sustained end-range rotation may therefore reflect the compensatory capacity of the system as a whole rather than isolated vertebrobasilar function...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of Salviae miltiorrhizae and its component, salvianolic acid B (SA-B), on the microcirculation of liver in mice with portal {{hypertension}} induced by endothelin- 1 (ET- 1). Methods: Eighty-four Kunming mice were randomly divided into 7 groups: untreated group, endothelin A receptor (ETAR) blocker group, Astragali mongolici group, Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) group, Corydalis Yanhusuo group, Salviae miltiorrhizae group and SA-B group. There were 12 mice in each group. Mice were pretreated with a corresponding equivalent volume of drug or distilled water for 3 days, and then the portal hypertension in mice was induced by continuous injection of ET- 1 into coccygeal vein using a micro-injection pump. Six mice in each group were used to observe the average liver blood flow volume by laser-Doppler flow instrument before and after injection of ET- 1, and the other six rats were used to observe the hepatic microcirculation velocity in vivo by an inverted microscope. Results: The <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> of liver in mice decreased in each group after ET- 1 injection. But the changes of <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the SA-B group and the ETAR blocker group were less than that in the untreated group (P＜ 0. 01). The changes of average blood volume in the Astragali mongolici group and the APS group were {{similar to that in}} the untreated group, but more than that in the SA-B group after injection of ET- 1. The change of <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the SA-B group showed no significant difference when compared with the ETAR blocker group. The microcirculatory flow velocity in liver also decreased in each group after ET- 1 injection. But the changes of microcirculatory flow velocity in the SA-B group and the ETAR blocker group were less than that in the untreated group (P＜ 0. 05, P＜ 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences in}} the changes of microcirculatory flow velocity among the Salviae miltiorrhizae group, the SA-B group and the ETAR blocker group. Conclusion: Salviae miltiorrhizae and SA-B can decrease the <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and microcirculatory flow velocity in liver in mice with portal hypertension, which may be one of the mechanisms of Salviae miltiorrhizae and SA-B in decreasing portal hypertensio...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{cerebral}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> decreases during chronic hyperglycemia, {{a condition}} frequently associated with elevated hematocrit. To test {{the hypothesis that}} an elevated hematocrit {{is responsible for the}} reduced regional cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during chronic hyperglycemia, I used isovolemic hemodilution to normalize the hematocrit in seven normoglycemic and seven streptozotocin-treated (hyperglycemic) rats. Regional cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was measured in 28 awake, restrained rats (14 normoglycemic and 14 hyperglycemic) using [14 C]iodoantipyrine and dissection of 17 brain regions. Hemodilution lowered the hematocrit by 6 units (13 %) and increased the <b>average</b> cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> by 14 %. Chronic hyperglycemia did not elevate the hematocrit, but it decreased the <b>average</b> cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> by 12 % and that in nine nontelencephalic brain regions by 17 %. This effect was independent of changes in hematocrit caused by hemodilution. The reduced regional cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during chronic hyperglyce-mia is not caused by elevated hematocrit.

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{deals with}} the {{parameter}} identification problem in outflow models used in one-dimensional simulations of arterial <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> Specifically, the resistive elements that define the models used {{to account for the}} blood supply to the vascular territories in arterial networks are computed by solving a system of non-linear equations using a Broyden method. This strategy is employed to compute the terminal parameters in the vascular territories of an anatomically detailed model of the arm comprising 67 arterial segments and 16 vascular territories. A comparison with a simple analytical approach, in terms of vascular territory resistances, <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> and time-dependent hemodynamic quantities, is performed. Also, a sensitivity analysis is presented to assess the performance of this new approach in normal and abnormal cardiovascular scenarios. This identification procedure allows to correctly set up hemodynamics simulations in highly detailed arterial networks making possible to gain insight in the aspects related to the blood circulation in arterial vessels...|$|R
40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is a {{commensal}} bacterium {{of the human}} nasopharynx. Occasionally, this bacterium reaches the bloodstream and causes meningitis after crossing the blood–brain barrier by an unknown mechanism. An immunohistological study of a meningococcal sepsis case revealed that neisserial adhesion was restricted to capillaries located in low <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> regions in the infected organs. This study led to the hypothesis that drag forces encountered by the meningococcus in the bloodstream determine its attachment site in vessels. We therefore investigated the ability of N. meningitidis to bind to endothelial cells {{in the presence of}} liquid flow mimicking the bloodstream with a laminar <b>flow</b> chamber. Strikingly, <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> reported for various organs strongly inhibited initial adhesion. As cerebral microcirculation is known to be highly heterogeneous, cerebral blood velocity was investigated at the level of individual vessels using intravital imaging of rat brain. In agreement with the histological study, shear stress levels compatible with meningococcal adhesion were only observed in capillaries, which exhibited transient reductions in flow. The flow chamber assay revealed that, after initial attachment, bacteria resisted high blood velocities and even multiplied, forming microcolonies resembling those observed in the septicemia case. These results argue that the combined mechanical properties of neisserial adhesion and blood microcirculation target meningococci to transiently underperfused cerebral capillaries and thus determine disease development...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} low frequency electrical stimulation on monoamine neurotransmitters, cerebral blood flow and hemorheology in children with cerebral palsy. Methods: A total of 83 children with cerebral palsy were divided into the control group (n= 42) and the observation group (n= 41) according to the random data table, patients {{in the control group}} were treated with routine rehabilitation treatment, on this basis; the children in the observation group were treated with low-frequency electric stimulation. Before and after the treatment, the levels of monoamine neurotransmitter [dopamine (DA) and 5 -hydroxy tryptamine (5 -HT) and norepinephrine (NE) ], cerebral blood flow [the <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity of anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) ] and blood rheology index [high/low shear whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and fibrinogen (FIB) ] of two groups were compared. Results: Before treatment, there were no significant difference of the levels of DA, 5 -HT, NE, the <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity of ACA/MCA/PCA, high/low shear whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and FIB between the two groups. After treatment, two groups of DA, 5 -HT and NE levels were significantly higher than those in the same group before treatment, and the observation group of DA, 5 -HT and NE levels were significantly higher than those of the control group, the difference was statistically significant; The <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> rate of ACA/MCA/PCA in the observation group after treatment was significantly higher than those in the same group before treatment; After treatment, the levels of high shear/low shear blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and FIB of the two groups were significantly lower than those in the same group before treatment, and the levels of observation group after treatment were significantly lower than that in the control group, the difference was statistically significant.

40|$|Intensive Care Units (ICUs) {{have high}} {{impact on the}} {{survival}} of critically-ill patients in hospitals. Recent statistics have shown that only 10 % of the 5 million patients admitted to ICUs in the United States die each year.

Arterial blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate (HR) are the most commonly recorded waveforms which provide key information to the ICU clinical staff.

Twenty normal subjects served as controls. The following <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> parameters were determined based on three 60 -second recordings: volume (ChBVol), velocity (ChBVel), and flow (ChBF), the last being proportional to blood flow if the hematocrit remains constant.

40|$|The brain obtains {{energy by}} keeping the {{cerebral}} <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> constant against unexpected changes in systemic blood pressure. Although this homeostatic mechanism is widely known as cerebrovascular autoregulation, it is not understood how widely and how robustly it works in the brain. Using a needle-like objective lens designed for deep-tissue imaging, we quantified the degree of autoregulation in the mouse hippocampus with single-capillary resolution. On <b>average,</b> hippocampal <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> exhibited autoregulation over a comparatively broad range of arterial blood pressure and did not significantly respond to pressure changes induced by the pharmacological activation of autonomic nervous system receptors, whereas peripheral tissues showed linear <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> changes. At the level of individual capillaries, however, about 40 % of hippocampal capillaries did not undergo rapid autoregulation.

40|$|Although {{previous}} studies report {{a reduction in}} myocardial volume during systole, myocardial volume changes during the cardiac cycle have not been quantitatively analyzed with high spatiotemporal resolution. We studied {{the time course of}} myocardial volume in the anterior mid-left ventricular (LV) wall of normal canine heart in vivo (n = 14) during atrial or LV pacing using transmurally implanted markers and biplane cineradiography (8 ms/frame). During atrial pacing, there was a significant transmural gradient in maximum volume decrease (4. 1, 6. 8, and 10. 3 % at subepi, midwall, and subendo layer, respectively, P = 0. 002). The rate of myocardial volume increase during diastole was 4. 7 ± 5. 8, 6. 8 ± 6. 1, and 10. 8 ± 7. 7 ml·min− 1 ·g− 1, respectively, which is substantially larger than the <b>average</b> myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the literature measured by the microsphere method (0. 7 – 1. 3 ml·min− 1 ·g− 1). In the early activated region during LV pacing, myocardial volume began to decrease before the LV pressure upstroke. We conclude that the volume change is greater than would be estimated from the known <b>average</b> transmural <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> This implies the existence of blood-filled spaces within the myocardium, which could communicate with the ventricular lumen. Our data in the early activated region also suggest that myocardial volume change is caused not by the intramyocardial tissue pressure but by direct impingement of the contracting myocytes on the microvasculature...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a mathematical model}} of the cerebral venous outflow for the simulation of the <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> and pressures in the main drainage vessels of the brain. The main features of the model are that it includes a validated model for the simulation of the intracranial circulation and it accounts for the dependence of the hydraulic properties of the jugular veins {{with respect to the}} gravity field, which makes it an useful tool {{for the study of the}} correlations between extracranial blood redistributions and changes in the intracranial environment. The model is able to simulate the average pressures and flows in different points of the jugular ducts, taking into account the amount of blood coming from the anastomotic connections; simulate how the blood redistribution due to change of posture affects flows and pressures in specific points of the system; and simulate redistributions due to stenotic patterns. Sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the model was performed. The model reproduces average physiologic behavior of the jugular, vertebral, and cerebral ducts in terms of pressures and flows. In fact, jugular flow drops from ~ 11. 7 to ~ 1. 4 ml/s in the passage from supine to standing. At the same time, vertebral flow increases from 0. 8 to 3. 4 ml/s, while cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> venous sinuses pressure, and intracranial pressure are constant around the average value of 12. 5 ml/s, 6 mmHg, and 10 mmHg, respectively.

The aim {{of the study was}} to establish the degree of correlation between blood flow through the vascular access for hemodialysis and echocardiographic parameters for the assessment of left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular dilatation and left ventricular function. The research included 115 patients (M:F 71 : 44), average age 53. 30 ± 12. 17 years, average length of dialysis 4. 51 ± 4. 01 years and average Kt/Vsp index 1. 17 ± 0. 23. Results.

The participants were 25 healthy volunteers, each receiving acupuncture manipulations on points LI 4 and LI 11 bilaterally. Skin temperatures and blood flow were recorded continuously on both arms. The study found that acupuncture significantly increased skin temperature on the needling arm by 0. 3514 °C on average, but decreased it on the contralateral arm by 0. 2201 °C on <b>average.</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> decreased significantly in both arms during needling (− 3. 4 % and − 5. 97 % for the ipsilateral and the contralateral sides, respectively), but the changes in skin temperature did not correlate with the changes in blood flow.

A pulsatile physiological blood flow circuit was constructed using sections of silicone tubing to simulate blood vessels with whole blood as the fluid. Instantaneous recording of flow from an electromagnetic flow meter (EMF) provided the gold standard measurement. Biplanar dynamic digital x-ray images of the blood vessel with injection of contrast medium were acquired at 25 fps using a PC frame capture card. Imaging of a Perspex calibration cube allowed 3 D reconstruction of the vessel and determination of true dimensions. Blood flow waveforms were calculated off-line on a Sun workstation using the new algorithm.

Methods: A total of 86 patients with CSF who were admitted in our hospital {{were included in the}} study and randomized into the treatment group and the control group with 43 cases in each group. The patients in the control group were given aspirin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, and ACEI. On this basis, the patients in the treatment group were given nicorandil. The patients in the two groups were continuously treated for 6 months. The coronary artery microcirculation and hemodynamic indicators before and after treatment in the two groups were detected and compared. Results: TAT, ET- 1, and hs-CRP levels, LAD, LCX, RCA, TIMI <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> frame count value, and IMR after treatment in the two groups were significantly reduced when compared with before treatment (P< 0. 05). The above indicators after treatment in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05). FMD after treatment in the two groups was significantly elevated when compared with before treatment (P< 0. 05). FMD after treatment in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Nicorandil in the treatment of CSF can effectively improve the coronary artery microcirculation and hemodynamics, with a significant efficacy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We studied hemodynamic changes {{leading to}} orthostatic vasovagal presyncope to {{determine}} whether changes of cerebral artery <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity precede or follow reductions of arterial pressure. BACKGROUND: Some evidence suggests that disordered cerebral autoregulation contributes to the occurrence of orthostatic vasovagal syncope. We studied cerebral hemodynamics with transcranial Doppler recordings, and we closely examined the temporal sequence of changes of cerebral artery <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity and systemic arterial pressure in 15 patients who {{did or did not}} faint during passive 70 degrees head-up tilt. METHODS: We recorded photoplethysmographic arterial pressure, RR intervals (electrocardiogram) and middle cerebral artery <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocities (mean, total, mean/RR interval; Gosling's pulsatility index; and cerebrovascular resistance [mean cerebral velocity/mean arterial pressure, MAP]). RESULTS: Eight men developed presyncope, and six men and one woman did not. Presyncopal patients reported light-headedness, diaphoresis, or a sensation of fatigue 155 s (range: 25 to 414 s) before any cerebral or systemic hemodynamic change. <b>Average</b> cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> velocity (CBFV) changes (defined by an iterative linear regression algorithm) began 67 s (range: 9 to 198 s) before reductions of MAP. Cerebral and systemic hemodynamic measurements remained constant in nonsyncopal patients. CONCLUSIONS: Presyncopal symptoms and CBFV changes precede arterial pressure reductions in patients with orthostatic vasovagal syncope. Therefore, changes of cerebrovascular regulation may contribute to the occurrence of vasovagal reactions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> is {{the main}} {{regulator}} of skeletal muscle's oxygen supply, and several studies have shown heterogeneous <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> among and within muscles. However, it remains unclear whether exercise changes the heterogeneity of flow in exercising human skeletal muscle. Muscle <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and spatial flow heterogeneity were measured simultaneously in exercising and in the contralateral resting quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle in eight healthy men using H 2 (15) O and positron emission tomography. The relative dispersion (standard deviation/mean) of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was calculated as an index of spatial <b>flow</b> heterogeneity. <b>Average</b> muscle <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in QF was 29 (10) ml x (kg muscle) (- 1) x min(- 1) at rest and 146 (54) ml x (kg muscle) (- 1) x min(- 1) during exercise (P = 0. 008 for the difference). <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> was significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in the vastus medialis and the vastus intermedius than in the vastus lateralis and the rectus femoris, both in the resting and the exercising legs. Flow was more homogeneous in the exercising vastus medialis and more heterogeneous (P < 0. 001) in the exercising vastus lateralis (P = 0. 01) than in the resting contralateral muscle. Flow was more homogeneous (P < 0. 001) in those exercising muscles in which flow was highest (vastus intermedius and vastus medialis) as compared to muscles with the lowest flow (vastus lateralis and the rectus femoris). These data demonstrate that muscle <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> varies among different muscles in humans both at rest and during exercise. Muscle perfusion is spatially heterogeneous at rest and during exercise, but responses to exercise are different depending on the muscle...|$|R

The <b>average</b> tissue <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> rates to the cerebral cortex, cerebral medulla, brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord during retrograde cerebral perfusion at 25 mm Hg of external jugular venous pressure were 10. 5 ± 10. 3, 4. 2 ± 4. 6, 11. 1 ± 9. 8, 12. 3 ± 8. 6, and 9. 1 ± 5. 8 ml/min per 100 gm, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Herewith {{we present}} a new method for {{measurement}} of the volumetric blood flow in absolute units in the ophthalmic artery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Philips EnVisor HD ultrasound unit with a 12 - 3 MHz linear transducer {{was used to measure}} flow in the ophthalmic artery in 8 healthy young subjects. The transducer was mounted on a custom-made holder which enabled precise and reproducible positioning in 3 axes as well as in rotation angle. Blood flow velocity and vessel diameter were measured during 10 consecutive heartbeats. The measurements were ECG-gated. Blood vessel diameter and blood flow velocity were calculated in an average heartbeat cycle. Hence blood volume over time within a heartbeat cycle as well as blood flow in mL/min were determined. Simultaneously, cardiovascular parameters have been recorded by Finapres. Short time reproducibility (5 measurements on day 1) and long time reproducibility (5 days once daily) as well as interindividual coefficient of variation were evaluated. RESULTS: <b>Average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the ophthalmic artery in all measurements was 39. 7 mL/min. The short-term intraindividual coefficient of variation was 24. 1 +/- 9. 2 %, the long-term coefficient 32. 0 +/- 13. 8 %. Interindividual coefficient of variation was 32. 8 %.

40|$|Average {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} determinations were performed 26 times comparing argon desaturation curves measured by mass spectrometry to the krypton 85 desaturation technique of McHenry. 1 During 17 of these studies krypton 85 and argon desaturations were performed simultaneously. Mean {{cerebral blood flow}} difference was 7. 2 ± 5. 7 % for simultaneous determinations and 7. 9 ± 6. 6 % for the total, establishing that the two techniques are comparable. Some {{of the advantages of}} using argon in mass spectrometry include: no blood needs to be withdrawn, curves can be observed at the time they are obtained, radiation precautions are not required, multiple studies do not affect the patient, and partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide can be observed constantly.

40|$|Vascular {{targeting}} of malignant tissues with systemically injected nanoparticles (NPs) holds promise in molecular imaging and anti-angiogenic therapies. Here, a computational model {{is presented to}} predict the development of tumor neovasculature over time and the specific, vascular accumulation of blood-borne NPs. A multidimensional tumor-growth model is integrated with a mesoscale formulation for the NP adhesion to blood vessel walls. The fraction of injected NPs depositing within the diseased vasculature and their spatial distribution is computed {{as a function of}} tumor stage, from 0 to day 24 post-tumor inception. As the malignant mass grows in size, <b>average</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and shear rates increase within the tumor neovasculature, reaching values comparable with those measured in healthy, pre-existing vessels already at 10 days. The NP vascular affinity, interpreted as the likelihood for a blood-borne NP to firmly adhere to the vessel walls, is a fundamental parameter in this analysis and depends on NP size and ligand density, and vascular receptor expression. For high vascular affinities, NPs tend to accumulate mostly at the inlet tumor vessels leaving the inner and outer vasculature depleted of NPs. For low vascular affinities, NPs distribute quite uniformly intra-tumorally but exhibit low accumulation doses. It is shown that an optimal vascular affinity can be identified providing the proper balance between accumulation dose and uniform spatial distribution of the NPs. This balance depends on the stage of tumor development (vascularity an...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY We {{compared}} the 1 MXe clearance method and the microsphere technique (15 -pm spheres) for cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> determination in 16 mongrel dogs. The luXe clearance curve obtained from sampling dorsal sagittal sinus blood following left ventricular injection showed either {{two or three}} components. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> calculated from the first component can be correlated with the <b>average</b> gray matter <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> through the caudate nucleus, the cortical gray, and the thalamus calculated from the microsphere data. The second component of the llJXe curve correlated well with the white matter <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> measured with microspheres. In seven out of 15 experiments, there was a third component in the luXe clearance curve. The <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> obtained from the third component showed a close correlation with extracranial muscle <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> determined with microspheres. The mean cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> measured with the '"Xe clearance method was {{in close agreement with}} that obtained by the micro-sphere technique. After the injection of luXe into extracranial muscles, the slope of the clearance curve obtained from the dorsal sagittal sinus correlated well with that of the third component following left ventricular injection.
