5|$|Although he was {{a proponent}} of secular politics, Nasser was an observant Muslim who made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1954 and 1965. He {{was known to be}} {{personally}} incorruptible, a characteristic which further enhanced his reputation among the citizens of Egypt <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> world. Nasser's personal hobbies included playing chess, American films, reading Arabic, English, and French magazines, and listening to classical music.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet {{censorship}} and control, {{and the majority}} of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Spring. Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu has {{historically}} {{served as a}} media hub. In 1975, the Somali Film Agency (SFA), the nation's film regulatory body, was established in Mogadishu.

5|$|Second in {{importance}} {{after the supreme}} deity, were over sixty ancestral gods of the Palmyrene clans. Palmyra had unique deities, such as the god of justice and Efqa's guardian Yarhibol, the sun god Malakbel, and the moon god Aglibol. Palmyrenes worshiped regional deities, including the greater Levantine gods Astarte, Baal-hamon, Baalshamin and Atargatis; the Babylonian gods Nabu and Nergal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Azizos, Arsu, Šams and Al-lāt.|$|E

5|$|Al-Birwa {{stood on}} a rocky hill {{overlooking}} the Acre plain, with an average elevation of 60 meters above sea level. It was situated {{at the intersection of}} two highways—one led to Acre and the other towards Haifa. Located 10.5 kilometers east of Acre, the other nearest localities to al-Birwa included al-Damun (depopulated in 1948) to the south, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> towns of Jadeida to the northwest, Julis to the north, Sha'ab to the east, and Majd al-Kurum to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Said was a {{controversial}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples. Said advocated {{the establishment of a}} Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the right of return to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the status quo as the remit of the public intellectual who has “to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual” man and woman.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} war of such length, the {{drawn-out}} Byzantine–Arab Wars had long-lasting effects {{for both the}} Byzantine Empire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> world. The Byzantines experienced extensive territorial loss, while the invading Arabs gained strong control in the Middle East and Africa. The focus of the Byzantine Empire shifted from the western reconquests of Justinian to a primarily defensive position, against the Islamic armies on its eastern borders. Without Byzantine interference in the emerging Christian states of western Europe, the situation gave a huge stimulus to feudalism and economic self-sufficiency.|$|E

5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into {{direct contact with}} the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|Gaza's Jewish {{community}} was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. Most of them fled from Gaza after the 1929 Palestine riots, when they consisted of fifty families. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had {{a population of}} 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1971, {{though the}} Shah of Iran was {{claiming}} historical sovereignty over Bahrain, he accepted a referendum {{held by the}} United Nations and eventually Bahrain declared independence and signed a new treaty of friendship with the United Kingdom. Bahrain joined the United Nations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League later in the year. The oil boom of the 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bahrain replaced Beirut as the Middle East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was driven {{out of the country}} by the war.|$|E

5|$|Pressure from {{consistent}} pro-Nasser {{demonstrations in}} northern Syria and Damascus and from pro-union Ba'athist leaders like Jamal al-Atassi, the Nasserists <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Nationalist Movement (ANM), {{coupled with the}} weakness of the Ba'athists at the popular level in Syria, led to unification efforts between the new government and the governments of Egypt and Iraq. The latter's anti-UAR government had also been overthrown by pro-UAR officers in 1963. On 17 April a new stage-based unity agreement was reached that would include the three states in a federal union with Nasser as President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|The Eleventh Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union {{delivered}} a disappointing result: {{a change in}} growth from 5 to 4%. During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able to defer economic collapse by trading with Western Europe <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> World. The Soviet Union still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev's rule was that certain Eastern Bloc countries became more economically advanced than the Soviet Union.|$|E

From the 10th century {{until the end of the}} 12th, the Byzantine Empire projected an image of luxury and travellers were impressed by the wealth accumulated in the capital.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat at}} Bathys Ryax signalled {{the end of}} the Paulicians as a {{military}} power and a threat to Byzantium. Basil followed this success by a series of campaigns in the East against the Paulician strongholds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> emirates. Tephrike itself was taken in 878 and razed to the ground. The remaining Paulicians were resettled in the Balkans, while a large contingent was shipped off to Southern Italy to fight for the Empire under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Melitene profoundly {{shocked the}} Muslim world: {{for the first}} time, a major Muslim city had fallen and been {{incorporated}} into the Byzantine Empire. Kourkouas followed this success by subduing parts of the district of Samosata in 936 and razing {{the city to the}} ground. Until 938, the East remained relatively calm. Historians suggest that the Byzantines were likely preoccupied with the full pacification of Melitene, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> emirates, deprived of any potential support from the Caliphate, were reluctant to provoke them.|$|E
5|$|Umar al-Aqta {{was able}} to {{overcome}} the initial Byzantine resistance against his invasion and reach {{the shores of the}} Black Sea.

The subsequent battle ended in a complete Byzantine victory and the death of the Emir on the field, and was followed by a successful Byzantine counteroffensive across the border. The Byzantine victories proved decisive: the main threats to the Byzantine borderlands were eliminated, and the era of Byzantine ascendancy in the East, which would culminate in the great conquests of the 10th century, had begun.|$|E
