6000|$|Snorro gives vividly enough {{his view}} {{of it from the}} Icelandic side: A ring of stalwart Norsemen, close ranked, with their steel tools in hand; English Harold's Army, mostly cavalry, prancing and {{pricking}} all around; trying to find or make some opening in that ring. For a long time trying in vain, till at length, getting them enticed to burst out somewhere in pursuit, they quickly turned round, and quickly made an end, of that matter. Snorro represents English Harold, with <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>party</b> of these horse coming up, and, with preliminary salutations, asking if Tosti were there, and if Harald were; making generous proposals to Tosti; but, in regard to Harald and what share of England was to be his, answering Tosti with the words, [...] "Seven feet of English earth, or more if he require it, for a grave." [...] Upon which Tosti, like an honorable man and copartner, said, [...] "No, never; let us fight you rather till we all die." [...] "Who is this that spoke to you?" [...] inquired Harald, when the cavaliers had withdrawn. [...] "My brother Harold," [...] answers Tosti; which looks rather like a Saga, but may be historical after all. Snorro's history of the battle is intelligible only after you have premised to it, what he never hints at, that the scene was {{on the east side of}} the bridge and of the Derwent; the great struggle for the bridge, one at last finds, was after the fall of Harald; and to the English Chroniclers, said struggle, which was abundantly severe, is all they know of the battle.|$|E

5000|$|An {{insurance}} company has many duties to its policyholders. The kinds of applicable duties vary depending upon whether {{the claim is}} considered to be [...] "first party" [...] or [...] "third party." [...] <b>A</b> common <b>first</b> <b>party</b> context is when an {{insurance company}} writes insurance on property that becomes damaged, such as a house or an automobile. In that case, the company is required to investigate the damage, determine whether the damage is covered, and pay the proper value for the damaged property. Bad faith in <b>first</b> <b>party</b> contexts often involves the insurance carrier's improper investigation and valuation of the damaged property (or its refusal to even acknowledge the claim at all). Bad faith can also arise in the context of <b>first</b> <b>party</b> coverage for personal injury such as health insurance or life insurance, but those cases tend to be rare. Most of them are preempted by ERISA.|$|R
