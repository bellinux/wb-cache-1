5|$|Skeptics of New World Order {{conspiracy}} theories <b>accuse</b> its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, {{a belief that}} significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places {{conspiracy theories}} in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|After Lieder, {{the first}} person to {{propagate}} her Planet X idea was Mark Hazlewood, {{a former member of the}} ZetaTalk community, who in 2001 published a book titled Blindsided: Planet X Passes in 2003. Lieder would later <b>accuse</b> him of being a confidence trickster. A Japanese cult called the Pana Wave Laboratory, which blocked off roads and rivers with white cloths to protect itself from electromagnetic attacks, also warned that the world would end in May 2003 after the approach of a tenth planet.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet {{censorship}} and control, {{and the majority}} of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they <b>accuse</b> of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring. Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} other {{criminal}} proceedings, it is optional for the <b>accused</b> to testify. If the <b>accused</b> does testify, he or she cannot be cross-examined on the offence before the court unless the <b>accused</b> testifies about the offence itself. This only applies to the offence the <b>accused</b> is charged with and not with other offences committed by the <b>accused.</b> The rule {{does not apply to}} any other witnesses in the hearing.|$|R
5|$|By {{trapping}} initially and blackmailing later, Shankar gets hold of Delhi Suri with whose help, {{he creates}} a rift between Damodar and Nagaraju {{which leads to}} the latter's murder. By blackmailing Sukanya that they would reveal her past to Damodar, they trap Mallikharjun with her help and <b>accuse</b> him of a rape attempt on Sukanya. However, the fact that Mallikharjun was gay, which was concealed by him for a long time, was believed by none. He is murdered by eating poisoned food.|$|E
5|$|By {{what right}} do you dare <b>accuse</b> the nation of... want of {{perseverance}} in the emperor's interest? The nation has followed him on the fields of Italy, across the sands of Egypt and the plains of Germany, across the frozen deserts of Russia.... The nation has followed him in fifty battles, in his defeats and in his victories, {{and in doing so}} we have to mourn the blood of three million Frenchmen.|$|E

50|$|The <b>accused</b> are Shahidul Islam, {{domestic}} help, contractor Syed Sajjad Mainuddin Hasan, {{his assistant}} Badal, and carpenter Shaniram Mandal. Two other <b>accused</b> were maids Estema Khatun Minu and Parvin. On 2 September 2003, the six <b>accused</b> {{were sentenced to}} death by Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal. On 10 July 2006 Bangladesh High Court upheld the death sentence of the <b>accused</b> but acquitted Shaniram Mandal. On 26 April 2009 Appellate Division accepted the leave-to-appeal prayers of the <b>accused.</b> In 2 August 2016 all the <b>accused</b> except Shahidul Islam were acquitted by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>accused</b> {{persons are}} {{released}} {{at the time}} of arrest on a promise to appear. Where the police decide to hold the <b>accused,</b> the police must produce the <b>accused</b> before a Justice of the Peace within 24 hours. At that point a bail hearing will be held. An <b>accused</b> person generally does not bear the onus justifying release, subject to a few exceptions, such as if the <b>accused</b> is charged with murder, trafficking in narcotics, terrorism offences (see Bail in Canada). An <b>accused</b> may be released or detained pending the trial and, if found guilty, the passing of sentence.|$|R
50|$|Juanita Broaddrick <b>accused</b> Clinton of rape; Kathleen Willey <b>accused</b> Clinton of groping {{her without}} consent; and Paula Jones <b>accused</b> Clinton of exposing himself and sexually harassing her.

In addition to these accusers, several other women have <b>accused</b> Clinton of consensual adultery.|$|R
5|$|Human rights organisations <b>accuse</b> {{police and}} {{military}} forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists. Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents {{at the behest of}} the government. However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Nokia {{was granted}} a {{preliminary}} injunction in the Netherlands against STMicroelectronics, which had supplied HTC with microphone components for the device that contained Nokia’s proprietary technology. Despite the injunction being against STM, Nokia still used the injunction to publicly <b>accuse</b> HTC of copying technology from its products. HTC would {{still be able to}} use the remaining microphones it acquired in good faith; the offending component was replaced with an alternative version in future production runs.|$|E

At home, Kate is angry when it becomes clear Charlie told Owen and his friend about Kate smoking crack. That night, she rebuffs Charlie's sexual advances. At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students <b>accuse</b> her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>accused</b> who {{is found}} to be unfit to stand trial is subject to the {{jurisdiction}} a Review Board. While the considerations are essentially the same, there are a few provisions which apply only to unfit <b>accused.</b> A Review Board must determine whether the <b>accused</b> is fit to stand trial. Regardless of the determination, the Review Board must then determine what conditions should be imposed on the <b>accused,</b> considering both the protection of the public and the maintenance of the fitness of the <b>accused</b> (or conditions which would render the <b>accused</b> fit). Previously an absolute discharge was unavailable to an unfit <b>accused.</b> However, in R. v. Demers, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the provision restricting the availability of an absolute discharge to an <b>accused</b> person who is deemed both [...] "permanently unfit" [...] and not a significant threat to the safety of the public. Presently a Review Board may recommend a judicial stay of proceedings in the event that it finds the <b>accused</b> both [...] "permanently unfit" [...] and non-dangerous. The decision is left to the court having jurisdiction over the <b>accused.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first seven}} <b>accused,</b> who {{actually}} {{took part in}} the killing, were found guilty under Section 302, 143, 147 and 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

2500|$|Controversy {{arose in}} the court case of the 26 <b>accused</b> as the state was alleged to have {{suppressed}} the legal rights of the <b>accused.</b> On 23 October [...] lawyers of the <b>accused</b> walked out in protest against the stand taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate. The lawyers wanted to meet the <b>accused</b> alone, however, they had moved an application stating that police did {{not allow them to}} meet their clients alone and that the Court should direct the police not to remain present while they were talking to the <b>accused.</b> The Metropolitan Magistrate countered that it was not possible as police had to be with the <b>accused.</b> He is said to have hinted at collusion between the lawyers and the <b>accused,</b> causing a walk out by the accused's lawyers. The next day, in two different cases, the designated Metropolitan Court remanded all the 26 <b>accused</b> to police custody till 31 October.|$|R
5|$|Ser Alliser Thorne convenes {{the other}} black {{brothers}} and takes responsibility for Jon's murder. Several black brothers <b>accuse</b> Thorne {{and the other}} officers of treason, but Thorne wins them over by citing Jon's actions and stating that Jon would have destroyed the Night's Watch by letting in the Wildlings. Alliser and the other mutineers then surround the store-room and promise Davos and Jon's friends amnesty if they surrender, but threaten to attack if they don't open the door by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|The Khawalid {{brothers}} {{share an}} anti-West conservative ideology. They {{believe that the}} West is conspiring with Iran against Bahrain and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries and often <b>accuse</b> the United States of secretly supporting the Bahraini opposition. They are allied with Saudi Arabia and Sunni Islamist groups, and hold an anti-Shia ideology, viewing them as a fifth column to Iran. Based on their beliefs, the Khawalid brothers have pushed a security approach {{to deal with the}} Shia instead of political reforms, and have allegedly used sectarianism as a political tool.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi Arabian {{government}} and other Gulf region governments strongly support the King of Bahrain. Although {{government officials and}} media often <b>accuse</b> the opposition of being influenced by Iran, a government-appointed commission found no evidence supporting the claim. Iran has historically claimed Bahrain as a province, but the claim was dropped after a UN 1970 survey found that most Bahraini people preferred independence over Iranian control.|$|E
50|$|An <b>accused</b> {{person may}} be arrested without warrant where a peace officer {{believes}} on reasonable grounds that the <b>accused</b> has failed {{to comply with a}} condition or by warrant. An <b>accused</b> arrested for an alleged breach will be detained in custody pending a hearing to determine whether a breach occurred. The <b>accused</b> may apply for bail pending the hearing. However, under subsection 515(6) the <b>accused</b> bears the onus. Upon the earliest of the <b>accused</b> being arrested for an alleged breach or upon the issuance of a warrant, the conditional sentence stops running. At a breach hearing the Crown bears the onus to prove a breach on a balance of probabilities. If the court finds that a breach occurred, the <b>accused</b> bears to onus to justify the continuation of the conditional sentence. The court may do one of four things: take no action, order that the <b>accused</b> serve a portion of the conditional sentence in custody, terminate the conditional sentence and order that the <b>accused</b> serve the remainder of the conditional sentence in custody or change a condition of the order.|$|R
50|$|Since s. 525, the {{automatic}} review provision, is addressed the institution head holding the <b>accused,</b> an <b>accused</b> cannot invoke the provision directly. If the institution head has not brought the <b>accused</b> before a superior court of criminal jurisdiction, the <b>accused</b> may apply for either a writ {{of habeas corpus}} or mandamus to compel the institution head {{to comply with the}} provision. A breach of this provision by an institution head will not lead to a finding of lack of jurisdiction over the <b>accused.</b>|$|R

5|$|While Meir and the Israeli Labor Party won the {{elections}} held in late-December, {{the release of}} the Agranat Commission's findings in April 1974 and its failure to <b>accuse</b> the nation's political leadership of any shortcomings—while recommending the dismissal of several senior officers—led to widespread public outrage. Meir resigned in response to public criticism, but Dayan remained steadfast. Eventually, the 1977 elections saw the end of Labor Party's unchallenged reign over Israeli politics with the election of Menachem Begin and the Likud Party.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to <b>accuse</b> him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Brand {{testified in}} 1954 at the {{controversial}} libel trial in Jerusalem of Malchiel Gruenwald, who was sued by the Israeli government {{on behalf of}} Rezső Kasztner. Gruenwald was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who had moved to Israel after the war. In a self-published pamphlet in 1952 he accused Kasztner, by then an Israeli civil servant, of having collaborated with the Nazis by dealing with Eichmann. Brand testified for Kasztner, but instead of defending him {{took the opportunity to}} <b>accuse</b> the Jewish Agency, whose officials became the first Israeli government, of having helped the British scupper the blood-for-goods proposal.|$|E
50|$|In various instances, it was men {{rather than}} women who {{constituted}} {{the majority of}} the <b>accused.</b> For instance, in Iceland 92% of the <b>accused</b> were men, and in Estonia 60% of the <b>accused</b> victims were male, mainly middle-aged or elderly married peasants, and known healers or sorcerers. In the witch trials of Moscow, Russia, two-thirds of those <b>accused</b> were male.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to <b>accuse</b> him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary critics {{gave the}} song mixed reviews, some {{claiming}} {{it to be}} Allen's sweetest lyrical moments, while others <b>accuse</b> it of being a fraud. The single peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Singles Chart, being her first single not {{to reach the top}} twenty in the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video portrayed a view over the mundane moments of a dying relationship, with Allen watching herself and her ex-boyfriend together. It was directed by Nima Nourizadeh and was mainly shot in black and white. The song was performed live during her 2007 concert tour and also during her 2009 concert tour.|$|E

She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly <b>accuse</b> her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} that when courts explain the right to legal {{representation}} to <b>accused</b> persons and an <b>accused</b> person facing a serious charge elects to remain unrepresented, the magistrate should ask the <b>accused</b> why he or she wanted to appear in person and if {{it appeared that the}} <b>accused</b> was under some or other misunderstanding that has to be put right.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{in certain}} states, the {{prosecution}} has 48 hours {{to decide whether or}} not to file formal charges against the <b>accused.</b> For example, in California, if no formal charges are filed within the 48-hour period, the <b>accused</b> must be released from custody. If formal charges are filed, the <b>accused</b> will be asked to appear at their arraignment. At the arraignment, the <b>accused</b> will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty, and the judge will set a bail amount (or refuse to set bail) for the <b>accused.</b>|$|R
