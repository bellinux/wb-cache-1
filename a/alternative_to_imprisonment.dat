Author tried to present proposals based on studying literature, laws, judicial decisions and comparison with foreign legislations, which could lead to improving Czech legal regulation in this area. The thesis is composed of 8 chapters. In the introductory chapter readers are informed about content of the thesis, purpose of the thesis and methods used. Next three chapters deal with topics related to the purpose and functions of punishment, the benefits of <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>imprisonment</b> and factors, which counteract against the efforts to reduce prison population. Author deemed necessary to analyze purpose of punishment, before he examined specific <b>alternatives.</b> Author tried <b>to</b> show that some conception of the purpose of punishment supports the use of <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>imprisonment,</b> but attention must be also paid to social and economic conditions of offenders. He pointed out that the economic advantages of alternatives must be taken only as a supportive argument not [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In 1841, John Augustus, a Boston cobbler, {{convinced}} {{a judge to}} grant him custody of a man convicted of public intoxication. The man would have been incarcerated, otherwise. The judge agreed, and instead, Augustus paid the man's fine and took him in. Augustus returned with the drunkard three weeks later for an evaluation. The judge perceived the man to be sober and respectable, and Augustus had found him a job. Impressed, the judge allowed Augustus to continue taking offenders into his custody for a probationary period as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>imprisonment.</b> Augustus took in over a thousand offenders, the majority of whom never returned to the criminal justice system. Augustus’s method became popular, and was therefore implemented by Massachusetts as a public alternative to incarceration, and later by the other states in the United States. This slowly replaced private, voluntary probation such as that practiced by Augustus.|$|E
50|$|The country's {{prison system}} was the {{responsibility}} of the Ministry of Internal Affairs until 1998, when it was placed under the newly created State Penal Department. In December 2010 it was reorganized as the State Penitentiary Service of Ukraine, which is directed by the Ministry of Justice.

There are 177 penal institutions in Ukraine (for January 1, 2015 - 31 pre-trial detention prisons, 139 penal facilities of different levels of security, six corrective penal settlements for minors). On 1 January 2015, the prison population numbered 73,431 people (162 prisoners per 100,000 people, down from 347 per 100,000 people in July 2011). Approximately one-sixth are remanded prisoners.

Pedro enters, masked, and reveals that he will be fighting Antonio, relieving some of Florinda's fears. Belvile enters, disguised as Antonio. Pedro accuses [...] "Antonio" [...] of having [...] "the advantage of me in Angellica" [...] and the men start to fight. Florinda runs in to stop them. Belvile is confused as to why Florinda would defend his rival but they push her away and fight. Florinda stops them again just as Belvile disarms Pedro. She begs him [...] "by her you love" [...] to spare Pedro. Belvile lays his sword at Florinda’s feet and swears his love to her. The action redeems him in Pedro’s eyes, so he gives his sister to the man he believes to be Antonio, demanding that they get married at once. Florinda protests, but Belvile secretly lifts his mask to show her who he is.|$|E
40|$|Many jurisdictions have {{introduced}} other non-custodial measures {{to decrease the}} usage of fines, nevertheless they are still a popular sanction. Although the majority of offenders fined pay their fine, some are {{unable or unwilling to}} do so and as a consequence can be imprisoned. At a time when prisons are overcrowded and short term sentences are a substantial administrative endeavour, with little to no re-socializing potential, many jurisdictions have implemented other measures to prevent imprisonment for fine default such as unpaid work. Both Austria and Scotland have implemented the possibility of unpaid work as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>imprisonment</b> for fine default. While Scotland has almost 20 years of experience, Austria has just recently implemented the option of community work for fine defaulters in 2008.

50|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of {{organization}} groups, such as the American Bar Association, in promoting <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>imprisonment,</b> they seem <b>to</b> be ignored {{when it comes to}} the federal government. Some alternatives introduced in this article include confinement, community service, tracking devices, and expanded terms in halfway houses. Some other ideas include an increase in supervision for a decrease in time as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> long-term <b>imprisonment.</b> This technically wouldn’t be an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> incarceration, but rather to full-term supervision. There are often cases such as with parents and drug abusers that need special attention and aren’t so easy to incarcerate. When it comes to parents, the court should determine what kind of parent the defendant is. Actions should be made based on that alone. Those addicted to drugs should be looked at carefully. For less dangerous criminals, treatment facilities should be the first option. The Residential Drug Abuse Program helps inmates addicted to drugs get released early, through the overcoming of their addiction.|$|R

Data were collected using three methods which include: questionnaire, interview, and Focus Group Discussion (FGD).

40|$|Magister Artium - MACommunity {{service as}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>imprisonment</b> at its {{inception}} {{was taken up}} very strongly by the judiciary {{as part of the}} reform {{of the criminal justice system}} in Uganda. The successful enactment of the Community Service Act, Act no: 5 / 2000, was an achievement towards the implementation of the programme in the country. However, its implementation as an alternative sentence is currently proceeding at a slow pace. The Ugandan law still allows courts to exercise their discretionary powers with regard to either using prison sentences or community service. Courts still seem to prefer to use imprisonment irrespective of the nature of the offence, thus leading to unwarranted government expenditure and prison overcrowding. An additional problem is that some offenders come out of prison having been negatively affected by their interaction with even more serious offenders. This study was undertaken to establish whether community service as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>imprisonment</b> can be effective with regard to reducing recidivism and to accelerating reconciliation and reintegration of minor offenders back into their communities.
