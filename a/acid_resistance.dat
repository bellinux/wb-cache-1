50|$|This {{bacterium}} {{is often}} involved in mutualistic relationships with legumes. It performs {{atmospheric nitrogen fixation}} for the plants and in exchange it receives organic carbon {{through the process of}} rhizodeposition. Free-living bacteria become housed inside specialized root cells in root nodules, which creates anaerobic microhabitat in which efficient N-fixation can occur. This mutualism has been observed with many plant species, including Medicago polymorpha and Medicago truncatula plants from around the world. The extent of the mutualism may be dependent upon soil pH, as it was thought that acidity can constrain Sinorhizobium medicae. Current thinking is that <b>acid</b> <b>resistance,</b> particularly in strain WSM419, can be transferred on plasmids.|$|E

5000|$|GadY RNA (previously named IS183 in [...] ) is a non-coding RNA. The GadY gene {{is located}} on between and on the {{opposite}} strand to the GadX and GadW genes. GadY can form base pairs with the 3' UTR of its target mRNA gadX, this pairing is thought to confer increased stability to the transcript, allowing accumulation of gadX (a transcriptional regulator of the acid response) and therefore increased expression of downstream <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> genes. The GadY gene produces three overlapping transcripts that differ in length. The long form is 105 nucleotides in length and two processed versions are 59 and 90 nucleotides in length.

5000|$|The extreme <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> of Z. bailii {{has been}} {{reported}} by many authors. On several occasions, growth of the yeast has been observed in fruit-based alcohols (pH 2.8 - 3.0, 40 - 45% (w/v) sucrose) preserved with 0.08% (w/v) benzoic acid, and in beverages (pH 3.2) containing either 0.06% (w/v) sorbic acid, 0.07% (w/v) benzoic acid, or 2% (w/v) acetic acid. Notably, individual cells in any Z. bailii population differ considerably in their resistance to sorbic acid, with a small fraction able to grow in preservative levels double that of the average population. In some types of food, the yeast is even able {{to grow in the}} presence of benzoic and sorbic acids at concentrations higher than those legally permitted and at pH values below the pKa of the acids. For example, according to the European Union (EU) legislation, sorbic acid is limited to 0.03% (w/v) in soft drinks (pH 2.5 - 3.2); however Z. bailii can grow in soft drinks containing 0.05% (w/v) of this acid (pKa 4.8). Particularly, there is strong evidence that the resistance of Z. bailii is stimulated by the presence of multiple preservatives. Hence, the yeast can survive and defeat synergistic preservative combinations that normally provide microbiological stability to processed foods. It has been observed that the cellular acetic acid uptake was inhibited when sorbic or benzoic acid was incorporated into the culture medium. Similarly, ethanol levels up to 10% (v/v) did not adversely influence sorbic and benzoic <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> of the yeast at pH 4.0 - 5.0. Moreover, Sousa et al. (1996) [...] have proved that in Z. bailii, ethanol plays a protective role against the negative effect of acetic acid by inhibiting the transport and accumulation of this acid intracellularly.|$|E

Sulfur concrete is resistant to some compounds like acids which attack normal concrete. Sulfur concrete was developed and promoted as building material to get rid of large amounts of stored sulfur produced by hydrodesulfurization of gas and oil. Sulfur concrete is also a possible building material for a lunar base.

50|$|The gcvB RNA gene encodes a small non-coding RNA {{involved}} in the regulation {{of a number of}} amino acid transport systems as well as amino acid biosynthetic genes. The GcvB gene is found in enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli. GcvB regulates genes by acting as an antisense binding partner of the mRNAs for each regulated gene. This binding is dependent on binding to a protein called Hfq. Transcription of the GcvB RNA is activated by the adjacent GcvA gene and repressed by the GcvR gene. A deletion of GcvB RNA from Y. pestis changed colony shape as well as reducing growth. It has been shown by gene deletion that GcvB is a regulator of <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> in E. coli. GcvB enhances the ability of the bacterium to survive low pH by upregulating the levels of the alternate sigma factor RpoS. A polymeric form of GcvB has recently been identified.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the HdeA {{family of}} proteins (HNS (histone-like nucleoid structuring)-dependent expression A) is a stress response protein family found in highly acid resistant bacteria such as Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli, {{but which is}} lacking in mildly acid tolerant bacteria such as Salmonella. HdeA {{is one of the}} most abundant proteins found in the periplasmic space of E. coli, where it is one of a network of proteins that confer an <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> phenotype essential for the pathogenesis of enteric bacteria. HdeA is thought to act as a chaperone, functioning to prevent the aggregation of periplasmic proteins denatured under acidic conditions. The HNS protein, a chromatin-associated protein that influences the gene expression of several environmentally-induced target genes, represses the expression of HdeA. HdeB, which is encoded within the same operon, may form heterodimers with HdeA. HdeA is a single domain protein with an overall fold that is similar to the fold of the N-terminal subdomain of the GluRS anticodon-binding domain.|$|E

It was found that at 180 oC and with a reaction time of 1 hour, the percent decomposition of PET was 94. 9 %. The obtained ethylene glycol had a purity of 92. 7 % and the prepared surfactant had a critical micelle concentration of 0. 003 mol/l. All coatings synthesized from this surfactant were milk-like liquids and gave films with good flexibility, good adhesion, excellent water resistance but fair alkali and <b>acid</b> <b>resistances.</b> Furthermore, the results also showed that at 0. 003 mol/l of the surfactant, the coating exhibited better properties than those prepared with other surfactant concentrations...|$|R
5000|$|Amorphous {{polyolefin}} (APO/APAO) polymers {{are compatible}} with many solvents, tackifiers, waxes, and polymers; they find wide use in many adhesive applications. APO hot melts have good fuel and <b>acid</b> <b>resistance,</b> moderate heat resistance, are tacky, soft and flexible, have good adhesion and longer open times than crystalline polyolefins. APOs tend to have lower melt viscosity, better adhesion, longer open times and slow set times than comparable EVAs. Some APOs can be used alone, but often they are compounded with tackifiers, waxes, and plasticizers (e.g., mineral oil, poly-butene oil). Examples of APOs include amorphous (atactic) propylene (APP), amorphous propylene/ethylene (APE), amorphous propylene/butene (APB), amorphous propylene/hexene (APH), amorphous propylene/ethylene/butene. APP is harder than APE, which is harder than APB, which is harder than APH, in accordance with decreasing crystallinity. APOs show relatively low cohesion, the entangled polymer chains have fairly high degree of freedom of movement. Under mechanical load, most of the strain is dissipated by elongation and disentanglement of polymer chains, and {{only a small fraction}} reaches the adhesive-substrate interface. Cohesive failure is therefore a more common failure mode of APOs.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} {{revealed}} the negligible effects of different sugars on preservative resistance of Z. bailii, e.g. comparable sorbic and benzoic <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> was observed regardless whether {{the cells were}} grown in culture medium containing glucose or fructose as fermentable substrates. However, the preservative resistance of the yeast is influenced by glucose level, with maximum resistance obtained at 10 - 20% (w/v) sugar concentrations. As Z. bailii is moderately osmotolerant, the salt and sugar levels in foods are usually insufficient to control its growth. The highest tolerance to salt has been observed at low pH values, e.g. the maximum NaCl allowing growth was 12.5% (w/v) at pH 3.0 whereas this was only 5.0% (w/v) at pH 5.0. Moreover, the presence of either salt or sugar has {{a positive effect on}} the ability of Z. bailii to initiate growth at extreme pH levels, e.g. the yeast showed no growth at pH 2.0 in the absence of NaCl and sucrose, but grew at this pH in 2.5% (w/v) NaCl or 50% (w/v) sucrose.|$|E
50|$|For a long time, it {{has been}} known that Z. bailii can {{maintain}} an acid gradient across the cell membrane, which indicates the induction of a system whereby the cells can reduce the intracellular acid accumulation. According to Warth (1977), Z. bailii uses an inducible, active transport pump to expel acid anions from the cells for counteracting the toxic effects of the acids. As the pump requires energy to function optimally, high sugar levels enhance Z. bailii preservative resistance. Nevertheless, this view was disputed from an observation that the concentration of acid was exactly as predicted from the intracellular, extracellular pH’s and pKa of the acid. Besides, {{it is unlikely that}} an active acid extrusion alone would be sufficient to achieve an unequal acid distribution across the cell membrane. Instead, Z. bailii might have developed much more efficient ways of altering its cell membrane to limit the diffusional entry of acids into the cells. This, in turn, will dramatically reduce any need for active extrusion of protons and acid anions, thus saving a lot of energy. Indeed, Warth (1989) has reported that the uptake rate of propionic acid by diffusion in Z. bailii is much lower than in other acid-sensitive yeasts (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Hence, it is conceivable that Z. bailii puts more effort on limiting the influx of acids in order to enhance its <b>acid</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

50|$|By the 1800s Lambeth in London {{has become}} a centre for the {{production}} of salt glaze stoneware, and most especially after the establishment of Doulton and Watts Pottery, which later became Royal Doulton. The company was founded in 1815 when John Doulton formed a partnership with the owner, Martha Jones and foreman, John Watts, of an existing pottery in Lambeth. Initially the factory specialised in utilitarian salt glazed stoneware, similar to that produced by the Fulham factories. During the 1830s and 1840s considerable amounts of salt-glazed sewer-pipes were produced by Doultons following Sir Edwin Chadwick's advocacy of improved sanitary conditions. Doultons were also one of the earliest manufacturers of electrical insulators, initially using salt glaze stoneware and for the electrical telegraph systems. Also, from about 1830 they started production of salt glaze stoneware vessels, which were valued for their <b>acid</b> <b>resistance,</b> for the emerging chemical industries. From the 1850s Doulton & Co.'s decorative stoneware, that was produced in association with the nearby Lambeth School of Art, enjoyed significant success at various international exhibitions, including at The Great Exhibition in 1851, Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876, and also at Chicago in 1893. Their salt glaze decorative products became known as 'Doulton Ware'. By 1890 their decorative stoneware were so successful that 350 designers and artists were employed at the Lambeth factory, including the famous George Tinworth. Doulton’s Lambeth factory closed in 1956, due largely to new clean air regulations that prohibited the production of salt glaze in the urban environment. Production, but not of salt glazing, was transferred to their factory in Burslem which had been established in 1877.|$|E
40|$|Extreme <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> {{contributes}} to the successful transmission of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) through acidic food matrices and the stomach, allowing it {{to gain access to}} the intestine and elicit disease in humans. Alternative sigma factor N (σN, encoded by rpoN) was previously identified as a novel regulator of extreme <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> in EHEC. This study investigated the role for σN and co-expressed products of the rpoN operon in the <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> phenotype of EHEC. The results revealed that σN primarily controls <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> through repression of the glutamate-dependent <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> (GDAR) system through control of the σS-directed GadXW pathway. σN was also determined to repress additional <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> systems, including arginine-dependent <b>acid</b> <b>resistance,</b> and an anaerobic <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> mechanism. Two gene products of the rpoN operon, hpf and ptsN, were also determined to negatively affect GDAR, as well as expression of the σN dependent genes glnA, astA, and pspA. Mutation of hpf and ptsN did not however alter the transcription of rpoN. Transcript levels of rpoN operon genes were observed to be differential, and inconsistent with the hypothesis of expression as a single transcriptional unit. Together this data signifies the importance of rpoN operon genes in the negative regulation of extreme <b>acid</b> <b>resistance</b> systems, and suggests that the products of hpf and ptsN control the activity of σN at its promoters...|$|E
