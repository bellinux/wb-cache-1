500|$|In the 1500m final race, {{with one}} lap {{remaining}} and currently in second place, Ohno {{attempted to make}} a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno raised his arms to signal he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm not going to say any more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> say it was right and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> say it's wrong. I've seen moves like that before that were not called. But I've seen them called too".|$|E
500|$|Commenting on {{the success}} of American {{producers}} such as Skrillex, Skream stated: [...] "I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger. The bad side of that is that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me. I like the music he makes." [...] Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as [...] "a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. [...] Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision. [...] The term metalstep has been used for a fusion of brostep and metal.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, a {{teaser trailer}} leaked online before its {{official}} release with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2. The studio released the teaser {{three days after}} the leak. The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of Slate wrote it successfully built hype, while Kofi Outlaw of ScreenRant showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an [...] "announcement trailer" [...] than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had [...] "hammy" [...] dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the Inception trailer. The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of [...] Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of income inequality and an [...] "Occupy Gotham" [...] campaign within the world of the story.

[...] The executive also commented that the trailer will [...] "provide the best potential exposure for TDKR." [...] Warner Bros. released the trailer online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before they attached it to theatrical prints of The Avengers.|$|E
