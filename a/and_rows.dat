5|$|The Hamden tornado {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tornado of this family, and possibly the most damaging of the entire outbreak. It touched down at 5:38pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway. Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of houses, as well as an industrial park, were flattened. The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45. The damage path was only five miles long, stopping just short of the city of New Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures in its path.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{cemetery}} {{is surrounded}} by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance. For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots <b>and</b> <b>rows,</b> and a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, industrial landscape of factories <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} examples of Ottoman architecture in Istanbul are the Anadoluhisarı and Rumelihisarı fortresses, which assisted the Ottomans during their siege of the city. Over {{the next four}} centuries, the Ottomans made an indelible impression on the skyline of Istanbul, building towering mosques and ornate palaces. The largest palace, Topkapı, includes a diverse array of architectural styles, from Baroque inside the Harem, to its Neoclassical style Enderûn Library. The imperial mosques include Fatih Mosque, Bayezid Mosque, Yavuz Selim Mosque, Süleymaniye Mosque, Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque), and Yeni Mosque, {{all of which were}} built {{at the peak of the}} Ottoman Empire, in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the following centuries, and especially after the Tanzimat reforms, Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles. An example of which is the imperial Nuruosmaniye Mosque. Areas around İstiklal Avenue were filled with grand European embassies <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of buildings in Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoğlu—including churches, stores, and theaters—and official buildings such as Dolmabahçe Palace.|$|E

50|$|Figure 2 {{shows the}} {{percentage}} surplus of emissions as calculated by production-based accounting over consumption-based accounting. In general, production-based accounting proposes lower emissions for the EU and OECD countries (developed countries) and higher emissions for BRIC <b>and</b> <b>RoW</b> (developing countries). However, consumption-based accounting proposes the reverse with lower emissions in BRIC <b>and</b> <b>RoW,</b> <b>and</b> higher emissions in EU and OECD countries. This led Boitier to term EU and OECD ‘CO2 consumers’ <b>and</b> BRIC <b>and</b> <b>RoW</b> ‘CO2 producers’.|$|R

25|$|Though {{modestly}} sized, Mehtar Mahal {{dated to}} 1620 {{is one of}} the most elegant structures in the fort; the entry gate in particular has been built in Indo-Saracenic style. The façade has three arches, which depict exquisite “cornice supported on carved corbels”. A gateway leads to the Mehtar mosque, which is a three-storey building. It has two slender minarets that are covered with delicately carved birds <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of swans. The carvings are in Hindu architectural style, in the form of brackets supporting the balconies and stone trellis work. The building has a flat roof and minarets have rounded top.|$|E
25|$|Another site {{to explore}} the deeply rooted Chinese culture in George Town is the Khoo Kongsi, a large Chinese clan house at Cannon Square. Originally built as a meeting place for the Khoo clan, the Khoo Kongsi still retains its {{authentic}} Chinese architecture, with its granite-paved courtyard surrounded by an intricately-built association building, a theatre stage <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of smaller houses inhabited by the clan members in the past. The Khoo Kongsi is {{actually one of the}} numerous clan houses that are scattered in the city, which were built by separate surname-based clan associations established to assist the newly arrived Chinese immigrants in the 19th century.|$|E

With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking rows <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink and stares down for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory.

25|$|The listed train {{shed roof}} which is 105 metres wide between {{platforms}} 1 and 12, has four spans, two spans 185 metres in length over {{the eastern part}} of the station date from the 1860s while the other two at the western side measuring 150 metres long were built in the early 1880s. The roof is supported by masonry walls with round-headed windows alongside platforms 1 and 12 <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> of cast iron columns. The roof spans have wrought iron trusses with cast iron struts on girders between the columns. The original roof was covered with slates with some glazing. The slates were subsequently replaced with boarded felt. Between 1997 and 1999 the roof was refurbished and 10,000 panes of toughened glass 'float' above the wrought iron trusses.|$|E
25|$|Another large {{presence}} in the city is the Crystal Lake Park District, which runs all of the city's numerous parks and the yearly events which take place within them. Two major parks run by the park district are Veterans Acres, along Walkup Road, and Main Beach, along with the namesake Crystal Lake. Crystal Lake is open whenever the weather is accommodating. However, boating is often restricted due to disputes with both the homeowners on the lake and the village of Lakewood, in which approximately 30% of the lake lies. The Crystal Lake Rowing Club has a boathouse in Kamijima Park, on {{the west end of}} Crystal Lake, <b>and</b> <b>rows</b> on the lake during the no-wake hours (usually early mornings and early evenings). In Crystal Lake lies the famed Dole mansion, where visitors can take tours for a small donation.|$|E
