5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn. Stavka hoped a quick breakthrough at the Emajõgi front would open <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>for</b> the armoured units to the north, thus cutting the Army Detachment Narwa {{off from the}} rest of Army Group North. The Red Army command presumed that the main direction of retreat for the German forces would be Tallinn, and concentrated their forces there in an attempt to block the roads.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>for</b> itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E

5|$|Rane, {{in command}} of {{a section of the}} 37th Assault Field Company, {{attached}} to the 4th Dogra Battalion, was sent forward to help clear <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>for</b> the battalion. As Rane and his team started clearing a minefield, mortar fire from the Pakistanis killed two sappers and wounded five others, including Rane. Despite this, by the evening of 8 April, Rane and his surviving men cleared the minefield which enabled the supporting tanks to move forward. A safe lane still had to be prepared for the tanks as the road ahead was still dangerous; the Pakistani forces had yet to be cleared from the area. This lane was created by Rane through the night. The next day, his section worked for twelve continuous hours to clear mines and roadblocks. As the road was still too difficult to deal with, he made a diversion for the battalion to forward. Rane continued this work despite ongoing artillery and mortar fire from the Pakistanis.|$|E
5|$|The {{relocation}} to Indianapolis was {{an arduous}} task. At {{the time it}} was an eleven-day journey by horseback from Corydon to the new capital. To complicate matters, no road existed and <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>for</b> the wagons had to be cut through the dense forests during the winter transit as the long caravan moved north. The caravan was large because it contained the state treasury, state library, state records, the furniture of the General Assembly, Supreme Court, and ExecutIve Offices, along with a whole host of other implements to aid the caravan on its long journey. Colonel Samuel Merrill, the state treasurer, was authorized by the General Assembly to oversee the move. Ultimately, it took more than a month to relocate the government to Indianapolis. The first session of the General Assembly convened there in January 1825.|$|E
5|$|Moving on a west-northwest {{track at}} roughly 20 mph (30 km/h) early on September 22, the storm {{initially}} changed little in intensity. However, a large upper tropospheric anticyclone {{developed over the}} southern Atlantic coast, producing the favorable wind shear needed for tropical cyclone development. A second reconnaissance flight reported an intensifed tropical cyclone, indicating that the storm system had reached tropical storm strength. At 0000 UTC on September 23, the depression attained tropical storm strength, with maximum winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a central minimum pressure of 1013 mbar (hPa; 29.92 inHg). The US Weather Bureau issued their first advisory on the newly developed tropical storm at 1600 UTC later that day, giving the storm the name Helene. Despite the storm's poor organization, Helene gradually intensified in favorable conditions generated by the large anticyclone. Throughout the day, a second anticyclone moved eastward until it was situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, while a mean trough in {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere became situated over the United States East Coast. This would set up <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>for</b> Helene to pass very close to the United States. The tropical storm attained hurricane intensity by 2200 UTC on 2200 UTC on September 24, while located 425 mi (685 km) east of Fort Pierce, Florida. However, in post-season analysis, it was found that Helene reached hurricane intensity earlier that day, by 1200 UTC. At the time, gale-force winds extended up to 220 mi (355 km) out from the storm's center of circulation.|$|E

5|$|Ripley {{makes her}} way back to Ricardo, who {{explains}} that the Working Joes, the station's service androids, abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. He also tells her that Samuels is attempting to interface with the station's controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, APOLLO's defensive countermeasures electrocute Samuels shortly after he managed to open <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>for</b> Ripley into APOLLO's control core. Upon reaching APOLLO, Ripley discovers that Seegson, who has been trying to sell off Sevastopol for years, has finally found a buyer: Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien. When Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, it refuses due to an unidentified presence within the station's reactor. Ripley arrives there and discovers that it has been converted into an alien nest. She then initiates a reactor purge to destroy the nest, but some aliens manage to escape and begin to overrun Sevastopol. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent by Weyland-Yutani to retrieve the alien, and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crosses her and takes her hostage aboard the Anesidora.|$|E
5|$|The Das Reich {{division}} attacked on {{the same}} day, along {{the west side of}} Kharkov. After penetrating into the city's Zalyutino district, the advance was stopped by a deep anti-tank ditch, lined with Soviet defenders, including anti-tank guns. A Soviet counterattack was repulsed after a bloody firefight. A detachment of the division fought its way to the southern approaches of the city, cutting off the road to Merefa. At around 15:00, Hoth ordered Hausser to immediately disengage with the Das Reich, and instead redeploy to cut off escaping Soviet troops. Instead, Hausser sent a detachment from the Totenkopf division for this task and informed Hoth that the risk of disengaging with the Das Reich was far too great. On the night of 11–12 March, a breakthrough element crossed the anti-tank ditch, taking the Soviet defenders by surprise, and opening <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>for</b> tanks to cross. This allowed the Das Reich to advance to the city's main railway station, which would be the farthest this division would advance into the city. Hoth repeated his order at 00:15, on 12 March, and Hausser replied as he had replied on 11 March. However, a third attempt by Hoth was obeyed, and Das Reich disengaged, using a corridor opened by LSSAH to cross northern Kharkov and redeploy east of the city.|$|E
