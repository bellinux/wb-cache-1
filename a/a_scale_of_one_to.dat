500|$|... "Our Father" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; some {{thought that it}} was dull, though Smits' performance received widespread critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that he was [...] "frustrated" [...] by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, [...] "I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of Dexter Morgan's world as I need to." [...] Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was [...] "an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the edge of my seat" [...] but that Smits as Miguel could improve [...] "even [...] great [...] like Dexter". The Australians Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, [...] "Dexter has gone from an eight to a six" [...] on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> ten, saying that the show [...] "has lost its edge" [...] with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships. Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was [...] "not sure yet whether [...] good". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that [...] "the series has settled into a state of complacency" [...] and could not [...] "escape the feeling I've seen this before". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman wrote that [...] "the whiff of normalcy for Dexter" [...] gives viewers [...] "a magnificent tease" [...] and likened the fast-moving plot to [...] "the urgency of brilliance". TV Squad critic Debra McDuffee was [...] "pleasantly surprised by Smits" [...] and said that, thus far, [...] "season three is a good one". TV Guides Paula Paige, who was [...] "thrilled" [...] to see Smits join the cast, said, [...] "What the Dexter season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made up for in Jimmy Smits." [...] Daniel Fienberg, writing for Zap2it, said that the combination of Hall and Smits was [...] "as good as TV acting gets" [...] and that, in comparison to the second season's opening, [...] "the show's creative team appears to have done it again".|$|E

2500|$|Nicholas Syrett, a {{professor}} of history at the University of Northern Colorado, has been a vocal critic of the evolution of fraternities in the 20th century. Syrett has stated that [...] "fraternal masculinity has, for at least 80 years, valorized athletics, alcohol abuse and sex with women." [...] Time magazine columnist Jessica Bennett has denounced fraternities as breeding [...] "sexism and misogyny that lasts long after college." [...] In her column, Bennett recounts that, while she was an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California, doormen at fraternity parties [...] "often ranked women on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> 10, with only 'sixes' and up granted entry to a party." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Texas death-penalty statute {{required}} that the jury consider whether Barefoot would pose [...] "future dangerousness". [...] Along with other evidence, the prosecution called two psychiatrists who, answering hypothetical questions, testified that Barefoot was likely to remain a danger to society. Neither psychiatrist had examined Barefoot nor asked to do so, but each summarized their professional experience as equipping them {{to answer the questions}} accurately. One psychiatrist called Barefoot a [...] "criminal sociopath" [...] and said there was no treatment for this condition and that Barefoot was likely to commit acts of violence in the future. The other psychiatrist testified that Barefoot had [...] "a fairly classical, typical, sociopathic personality disorder." [...] He placed Barefoot in the [...] "most severe category" [...] of sociopaths, and on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> ten, Barefoot was [...] "above ten". The jury considered this as well as other evidence and imposed the death penalty.|$|E
