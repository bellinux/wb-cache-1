40|$|Abstract—Scatterometers are {{remote sensing}} radars {{designed}} to measure near-surface winds over the ocean. The difficulties of accommodating traditional fan-beam scatterometers on spacecraft has {{lead to the development}} of a scanning pencilbeam instrument known as SeaWinds. SeaWinds will be part of the Japanese <b>Advanced</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Observing</b> <b>Satellite</b> II (ADEOS-II) to be launched in 1999. To analyze the performance of the SeaWinds design, a new expression for the measurement accuracy of a pencil-beam system is required. In this paper we derive a general expression for the backscatter measurement accuracy for a pencil-beam scatterometer which includes the effects of transmit signal modulation with simple power detection. Both separate and simultaneous signal+noise and noise-only measurements are considered. The utility of the new expression for scatterometer design tradeoffs is demonstrated using a simplified geometry.

40|$|International audienceThe Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) {{instrument}} was routinely functioning aboard the second <b>Advanced</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Observing</b> <b>Satellite</b> (ADEOS- 2) from April to October 2003. A series of algorithms dedicated to Earth radiation budget, water vapor, and clouds {{are applied to}} the POLDER data.

These narrowband albedos are used to estimate the broadband shortwave albedo at the top of atmosphere in a companion paper. Here we focus on the 670 nm (over land) / 865 nm (over ocean) albedo. Although our derivation is based on the plane-parallel hypothesis, and thanks to the multidirectional capability of POLDER, results appear reliable for both cloudy and clear-sky scenes. A quality index is introduced from the comparison between the angular variability of the retrieved "directional" albedo values and that of the measured reflectances. This quality index is "good" in 80 % of the cases. Moreover, the retrieved albedo values are found to be statistically little dependent on the viewing direction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{need for}} {{on-board}} decision-making for plan-ning science observations on <b>Earth</b> <b>Observing</b> <b>Satellites</b> {{is based on}} the fact that the scientific utility of acquiring an image can change dynamically from the time the observation is scheduled to the time it is taken. Currently, <b>Earth</b> <b>observing</b> <b>satellites</b> cannot communicate directly with each other, and can only communicate with ground stations about 5 % to 10 % of the time. Because of the limited communication windows a ground-based mission scheduler would have little to no opportunity to revise an observation schedule in response to changes in the observation environment. For this reason, a distributed science planning system combining a ground-based scheduler with on-board schedule revision capabilities is warranted. This paper will focus on on-board autonomous planning capabilities for <b>Earth</b> <b>observing</b> <b>satellites,</b> and the design of a set of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of on-board decision making using the Space Communication Emulation Facility (SCEF) at Glenn Research Center I...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{algorithm is}} derived for retrieving wind vectors from microwave scatterometer observations. The azimuthal {{dependence of the}} sea-surface radar cross section is modeled by a double-cosine function, rather than the traditional second-order cosine expansion. The algorithm is tested using the aircraft scatterometer observations obtained during the AAFE-RADSCAT Experiment in 1975 and 1976. There is little difference between {{the performance of the}} simplified algorithm and the more involved least-squares searching algorithm. The AAFE-RADSCAT aircraft observations are sampled so as to simulate the three-look satellite scatterometer NSCAT that will be launched on the Japanese <b>Advanced</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Observing</b> <b>Satellite.</b> The results of the retrievals indicate that it is probably not possible to uniquely determine the wind direction using just NSCAT observations because of a 180 degree ambiguity. However, if forecast models can predict the wind direction to an accuracy of +/- 90 deg, thereby eliminating the ambiguity, then the results indicate that NSCAT can determine the wind direction to an accuracy of about +/- 20 deg. Better performance is obtained when the three observations are the same polarization (either v-pol or h-pol), as compared to using a mix of v-pol and h-pol observations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The SeaWinds {{scatterometer}} {{was originally}} designed to measure wind vectors over the ocean by exploiting the relationship between wind-induced surface roughening and the normalized radar backscatter cross section. Rain can degrade scatterometer wind estimation; however, the simultaneous wind/ rain (SWR) algorithm was developed to enable SeaWinds to simultaneously retrieve wind and rain rate data. This algorithm is based on colocating data from the Precipitation Radar on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and SeaWinds on QuikSCAT. This paper develops a new wind and rain radar backscatter model for SWR using colocated data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) and SeaWinds aboard the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Observing</b> <b>Satellite</b> II. This paper accounts for rain height in the model in order to calculate surface rain rate from the integrated rain rate. The performance of SWR using the new wind/rain model is measured by comparison of wind vectors and rain rates to the previous SWR algorithm, AMSR rain rates, and National Center for Environmental Prediction numerical weather prediction winds. The new SWR algorithm produces more accurate rain estimates and improved winds, and detects rain with a low false alarm rate. Index Terms—Atmospheric measurements, rain, scattering, wind. I...|$|E

POLDER is a multispectral imaging radiometer/polarimeter designed to collect global and repetitive observations of the solar radiation reflected by the Earth/Atmosphere System, with a wide field of view (2400 km) and a moderate geometric resolution (6 km).
