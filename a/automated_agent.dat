Even so, succeeding in designing proficient <b>automated</b> <b>agents</b> remains an important objective. In recent years we have invested much effort in facilitating the design and evaluation of <b>automated</b> <b>agents</b> interacting with people, making it more accessible to researchers.

5000|$|Kraus {{has made}} highly {{influential}} contributions to numerous subfields, most notably to multiagent systems (including people and robots) and non-monotonic reasoning. One of her important contributions is to strategic negotiation. Her {{work in this}} area {{is one of the first}} to integrate Game Theory with Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, she started new research on automated agents that negotiate with people, and established that these agents must be evaluated via experiments with humans. In particular, she has developed Diplomat, the first <b>automated</b> <b>agent</b> that negotiated proficiently with people. This was followed with other agents that interact well with people by integrating qualitative decision-making approach with machine learning tools, to face the challenge of people being bounded rational. [...] Based on Kraus’s work, others have begun to develop automated agents that negotiate and interact with people.Consequently, Kraus’s work has become the gold standard for research in negotiation, both among automated agents and between agents and humans. This work has provoked the curiosity of other communities and was published in journals of political science, psychology and economics.|$|E

40|$|In service-based systems, {{services}} from various providers {{can be integrated}} following specific workflows to achieve users ’ goals. These workflows are often executed and coordinated by software agents, which invoke appropriate services based on situation changes. These agents need to be deployed on underlying platforms with respect to various requirements, such as access permission of agents, real-time requirements of workflows, and reliability of the overall system. Deploying these agents manually is often error-prone and time-consuming. Furthermore, agents need to migrate from hosts to hosts at runtime to satisfy deployment requirements. Hence, an <b>automated</b> <b>agent</b> deployment mechanism is needed. In this paper, an approach to <b>automated</b> <b>agent</b> deployment in service-base systems is presented.

We consider the incentives of all participants, and show how such an arrangement canbe in their best interest.

40|$|Many {{tasks in}} day-to-day life involve {{interactions}} among several people. Many of these interactions involve negotiating over a desired outcome. Negotiation {{in and of}} itself is not an easy task, and it becomes more complex under conditions of incomplete information. For example, the parties do not know in advance the exact tradeoff of their counterparts between different outcomes. Furthermore information regarding the preferences of counterparts might only be elicited during the negotiation process itself. In this paper we propose a model for an automated negotiation agent capable of negotiating with bounded rational agents under conditions of incomplete information. We test this agent against people in two distinct domains, in order to verify that its model is generic, and thus can be adapted to any domain as long as the negotiators ’ preferences can be expressed in additive utilities. Our results indicate that the <b>automated</b> <b>agent</b> reaches more agreements and plays more effectively than its human counterparts.

40|$|Persuasion is {{a common}} social and {{economic}} activity. It usually arises when conflicting interests among agents exist, {{and one of the}} agents wishes to sway the opinions of others. This paper considers the problem of an <b>automated</b> <b>agent</b> that needs to influence the decision of a group of self-interested agents that must reach an agreement on a joint action. For example, consider an <b>automated</b> <b>agent</b> that aims to reduce the energy consumption of a nonresidential building, by convincing {{a group of people who}} share an office to agree on an economy mode of the air-conditioning and low light intensity. In this paper we present four problems that address issues of minimality and safety of the persuasion process. We discuss the relationships to similar problems from social choice, and show that if the agents are using Plurality or Veto as their voting rule all of our problems are in P. We also show that with K-Approval, Bucklin and Borda voting rules some problems become intractable. We thus present heuristics for efficient persuasion with Borda, and evaluate them through simulations. ...|$|E

We formally describe this problem and show that it is NP-hard. We therefore present two <b>automated</b> <b>agents</b> for the problem, based on two different models of human behavior.

Accomplishing this requires that the <b>automated</b> <b>agents</b> be under autonomous, intelligent control.

40|$|Off-task {{speech is}} speech that strays {{away from an}} {{intended}} task. It occurs in many dialog applications, such as intelligent tutors, virtual games, health communication systems and humanrobot cooperation. Off-task speech input to computers presents both challenges and opportunities for such dialog systems. On the one hand, off-task speech contains informal conversational style and potentially unbounded scope that hamper accurate speech recognition. On the other hand, an <b>automated</b> <b>agent</b> capable of detecting off-task speech could track users’ attention and thereby maintain the intended conversation by bringing a user back on task; also, knowledge of where off-task speech events are likely to occur can help the analysis of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors.
