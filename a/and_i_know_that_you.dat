500|$|The song {{opens with}} the main melody from the Hungarian piece [...] "Csárdás" [...] by Italian {{composer}} Vittorio Monti played on violin, as a distressed Gaga (speaking in a Spanish accent) states: [...] "I {{know that we are}} young, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may love me/But I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro." [...] The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: [...] "You know that I love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." [...] By the end of the song, the three protagonists – Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto – are bidden farewell by Gaga.|$|E
500|$|In a 24 August 2012 {{newsletter}} to fans {{about the}} upcoming release of [...] "Trouble," [...] {{it was announced that}} aspiring musicians and fans could produce their own remix for [...] "Trouble" [...] and win the chance to have their remix released along with the single. Lewis told fans, [...] "I can't wait for you guys to start remixing 'Trouble'. It is such an important song to me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will put all your creative talents into it! I'm looking forward to hearing what you come up with and don't forget there are some great prizes to be won too!" [...] Lewis and Fraser T Smith (co-producer and co-writer of the song) were amongst the judges for the shortlisted songs. Matty Graham won the competition, and his remix of [...] "Trouble" [...] was released alongside the original version as part of a Digital EP available exclusively to MyPlayDirect.com, Lewis' official music store.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{characters}} {{include the}} [...] "Dogs", representing fervent capitalists, the [...] "Pigs", symbolising political corruption, and the [...] "Sheep", {{who represent the}} exploited. Croskery described the [...] "Sheep" [...] as being in a [...] "state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity", a false consciousness. The [...] "Dog", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone {{with no one to}} trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. Waters used Mary Whitehouse {{as an example of a}} [...] "Pig"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: [...] "You know that I care what happens to you. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> care for me too." [...] However, he also acknowledges that the [...] "Pigs" [...] are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a [...] "Dog" [...] who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them.|$|E
2500|$|Michael, you've {{got a lot}} {{to answer}} for, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you're gonna call... if you need me." ...|$|R
60|$|But in {{the morning}} he wore a troubled look, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the hour of my triumph approached.|$|R
60|$|Thus he wailed, {{then came}} the sound of sword blows <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this prophet was dead also.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{will wait}} here till morning, Will. There {{will be no}} {{hardship}} in that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don’t like speaking to anyone.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very simple. I'm such a blasted fool as to {{love you}} {{with all my heart}} and soul, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't care twopence for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kissing takes two, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> blinded him," [...] muttered Jodd, [...] "for I crucified the brutes you {{commanded}} to do {{the deed}} to which they confessed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They must be fools," [...] he said. [...] "I see a sledge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{some man}} made it--for who {{ever heard of}} a sledge making itself? I see a world, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Great Spirit made it, because a world cannot make itself. The {{greatest}} Spirit must be One, because two greatests are impossible, and He is good--because good is better than evil, and the Greatest includes the Best." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{something}} {{seemed to}} grip my throat <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had died--for the world floated away from beneath me.|$|R
60|$|Laughter {{came into}} her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not vexed her. But I had spoken stupidly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> reddened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take her, Colonel," [...] {{the count}} said, putting {{her hand into}} that of Fergus. [...] "You have won your bride fairly and well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will be a worthy husband to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, Asaph," [...] said Marietta, quickly, [...] "that {{you are not}} {{thinking}} of going into debt for clothing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> haven't been working to earn money. What arrangements have you been making?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{now it is}} {{time for}} bed, or you will be heavy in the morning; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> intend {{starting}} at dawn, with the dogs, and have promised to bring in some hares for dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Also I had a {{regard for}} Mr. Eustace Meeson, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{he had lost}} his {{inheritance}} through a quarrel about myself." ...|$|R
60|$|But, as you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that,</b> {{with the}} {{exception}} of the last sentence, was not the truth of the matter at all.|$|R
60|$|Prof. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> will. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my lords {{that are}} there {{will be glad to}} hear it, and to see you also.|$|R
60|$|The packet {{will contain}} a claret-jug. I {{hope it is}} a pretty thing in itself for your table, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and Mrs. Wills will like it none the worse because it comes from me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} it back," [...] he said. [...] "I have heard of you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have no love for The Sheik, your father. Neither have I. I will not betray you. Let me see the picture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for me, Monsieur," [...] said Suzanne, suddenly, as {{she looked}} through a wealth of brown curls across at Sir Andrew, [...] "I trust you absolutely, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>KNOW</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will bring my dear father safely to England, just as you brought us to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She won't say a word," [...] {{came from}} Sam [...] "She said she didn't feel well, <b>that's</b> all; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> wasn't true altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost as {{unlikely}} as you are. One has to risk {{dangers in}} the world, but one makes the risk {{as little as}} possible. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> they won't give me a pony that will tumble down; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I've told you to look {{to see that they}} don't. You chose the pony, but I had to choose you. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> very much about ponies, but <b>I</b> do <b>know</b> something about a lover, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have got one that will suit me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to a plenary question on the UN's role in regards to cholera in Haiti at the International Peace Institute, Bokova responded, [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about this problem <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there is a legal process that is being engaged in currently. <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> {{the details of this}} legal process, <b>I</b> just <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it is going there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there is an idea to establish a fund for indemnities. I will be advocating also for this action to be taken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There is none, Miss Temple,” said Edwards quickly; “there is none {{who has a}} {{right to}} aspire to you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will wait to be sought by your equal; or die, as you live, loved, respected, and admired by all who know you.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not all of them, Gran'pa Jim, {{although}} {{they all seem}} to have been 'passed by the Board of Censors'--perhaps when their eyes were shut. I love the good pictures, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do, but some we have seen lately gave me the shivers. So, perhaps Miss Stearne is right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know I do. It {{seems an}} obvious {{thing to do}} when the pudding is there in front of me. But if it were not there, I should neither eat it nor miss it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> care nothing about it. There would be another five or six pounds a year.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} left {{about that}} time. I am nineteen now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was born a}} few weeks after he came out to Alexandria." ...|$|R
60|$|Reginald {{puckered}} {{his brow}} into a tortured frown, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> my point was gained. He was debating what tie {{would go with}} which waistcoat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she went}} on laughing, [...] "you will get very little to eat for your pains, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{soldiers}} always like good dinners." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{am going}} over to Rochester to post this letter, and must write another to Townshend before I go. My dear Cerjat, I have written lightly enough, because I {{want you to know}} that I am {{becoming}} cheerful and hearty. God bless you! I love you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are very}} kind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{do not want}} to be paid for your kindness; but I am well off, and I know you have lost your horse and cow, and so you must let me pay you for what you do for me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because, Stephen, {{there is}} really a good reason. Don't ask me, for I can't tell you. You must {{take it from me}} that I am right. You know, dear, that I wouldn't willingly {{disappoint}} you; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had set your heart on this. But indeed, indeed I have a good reason.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{but this}} will be a picture,--a real picture; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Kami will let me send it to the Salon. You don't mind, do you?' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} that he was interested, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> as <b>I</b> spoke he had looked through the window and seen the man writing the letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{but this}} will be a picture,--a real picture; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Kami will let me send it to the Salon. You don't mind, do you?" ...|$|R
