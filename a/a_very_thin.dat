5|$|In {{the final}} 2008 Rocky Mountain News poll before the Heisman votes were announced, McCoy {{moved to the}} top of the list, but had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> lead over Sam Bradford and Tim Tebow, who were in second and third place, respectively. The poll had {{correctly}} predicted the Heisman winner in 18 of the previous 21 years. On December 10, McCoy, Bradford, and Tebow were selected as the three finalists for the Heisman Trophy. Bradford won the trophy with 1,726 total points, and McCoy finished second with 1,604 points in the Heisman voting.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are , 8–10 by 5.5–7μm, and amyloid—which means they will turn blue-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have stout sterigmata, and measure 34–40 by 7–9μm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), that measure 32–40 by 8–12μm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> cuticle, under {{which is a}} narrow hypoderm, while {{the remainder of the}} tissue comprises densely matted tufts of mycelia, and stains deep vinaceous-brown in iodine. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of the four-spored forms.|$|E
5|$|Pagan priests, too, were {{interested}} in suppressing any threat to traditional religion. The Christian Arnobius, writing during Diocletian's reign, attributes financial concerns to provisioners of pagan services:The augurs, the dream interpreters, the soothsayers, the prophets, and the priestlings, ever vain...fearing that their own arts be brought to nought, and that they may extort but scanty contributions from the devotees, now few and infrequent, cry aloud, 'The gods are neglected, and in the temples there is now <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> attendance. Former ceremonies are exposed to derision, and the time-honoured rites of institutions once sacred have sunk before the superstitions of new religions.'They believed their ceremonies were hindered {{by the presence of}} Christians, who were thought to cloud the sight of oracles and stall the gods' recognition of their sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|The {{forewings}} {{are short}} oblong leathery plates {{used to cover}} the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and {{in the pattern of}} folding that requires the use of the cerci.|$|E
5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. The alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
5|$|The slender smooth-hound has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> {{body and}} a broad, highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5000|$|... {{thinning}} {{from below}} - this low thinning can be split into 4 Grades: A Grade is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> light <b>thinning,</b> that removes all overtopped trees Kraft crown class 4 and 5. B Grade is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> light <b>thinning</b> that removes overtopped trees and intermediates which are Kraft Crown class 4,5 and some 3s, C Grade and D Grade are a moderate and heavy thinning respectively removing {{anything that will}} not lead to high quality tree crown growth.|$|R

5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E

25|$|Modern composers {{will often}} specify the beating spot {{to alter the}} sound of the drum. When the timpani are struck {{directly}} in the center, they have a sound that is almost completely devoid of tone and resonance. George Gershwin uses this effect in An American in Paris. Struck close to the edge, timpani produce <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin,</b> hollow sound. This effect is used by composers such as Bartók, Bernstein, and Kodály.|$|E

25|$|Descemet's {{membrane}} (also posterior limiting membrane): a thin acellular layer {{that serves}} as the modified basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, from which the cells are derived. This layer is composed mainly of collagen type IV fibrils, less rigid than collagen type I fibrils, and is around 5-20 μm thick, depending on the subject's age.

25|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} are polarized capacitors {{and generally}} require an anode electrode voltage {{to be positive}} relative to the cathode voltage. However, the cathode foil of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is provided with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin,</b> natural air-originated oxide layer. This oxide layer has a voltage proof of approximately 1 to 1.5V. Therefore, aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte can withstand a very small reverse voltage and, for example, can be measured with an AC voltage of about 0.5V, as specified in relevant standards.|$|E
25|$|Amorphous silicon is {{the most}} {{well-developed}} thin film technology to-date. An amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline silicon. Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density infrared portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>thin</b> layer of silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).|$|E
