25|$|Locus {{of control}} is a salient factor in the {{successful}} academic performance of students. During the 1970s and '80s, Cassandra B. Whyte did significant educational research studying locus of control as related to the <b>academic</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> students pursuing higher education coursework. Much of her educational research and publications focused upon the theories of Julian B. Rotter {{in regard to the}} importance of internal control and successful academic performance. Whyte reported that individuals who perceive and believe that their hard work may lead to more successful academic outcomes, instead of depending on luck or fate, persist and achieve academically at a higher level. Therefore, it is important to provide education and counseling in this regard.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of {{the effects}} of {{terrestrial}} forms of ionizing radiation on the CNS has been documented from radiotherapy patients, although the dose is higher for these patients than would be experienced by astronauts in the space environment. CNS behavioral changes such as chronic fatigue and depression occur in patients who are undergoing irradiation for cancer therapy. Neurocognitive effects, especially in children, are observed at lower radiation doses. A recent review on intelligence and the <b>academic</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> children after treatment for brain tumors indicates that radiation exposure is related to a decline in intelligence and academic achievement, including low intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, verbal abilities, and performance IQ; academic achievement in reading, spelling, and mathematics; and attention functioning. Mental retardation was observed in the children of the atomic-bomb survivors in Japan who were exposed to radiation prenatally at moderate doses (<2 Gy) at 8 to 15 weeks post-conception, but not at earlier or later prenatal times.|$|E

25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the <b>academic</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E

40|$|Parental {{alcoholism}} {{leads to}} a dysfunctional environment in the family, which carries the potential to cause various difficulties for the children. The {{aim of the research}} is to exam of the correlation between the <b>academic</b> <b>achievements</b> <b>of</b> adolescents from alcoholic families and the adolescent’s role in the family. For this purpose CAST- 6 (Children of Alcoholics Screening Test, Hodgins and Shimp, 1995) was used; it is meant for identifying the individuals from alcoholic families. To assess the child‘s role in family was used CRI (Children’s Role Inventory) by A. Potter and D. Williams, 1991. <b>Academic</b> <b>achievements</b> <b>of</b> adolescents were asked about their average grades in mathematics and Lithuanian of the last semester. The subjects of the study were 320 schoolchildren in their 8 th – 11 th school year. 192 girls (60 %) and 128 boys (40 %). The results of the study showed that the Lost Child role in girls is more expressed in families with drinking problems. The rest of the roles are expressed with the same frequency in families with and without drinking problems. The <b>academic</b> <b>achievements</b> <b>of</b> adolescents from families with drinking problems do not differ from the <b>academic</b> <b>achievements</b> <b>of</b> adolescents from families without drinking problems. The <b>academic</b> <b>achievements</b> <b>of</b> adolescents can be predicted by examining their roles in the family and their sex. A strongly expressed role of the Hero determines higher average grades in mathematics, while a strongly expressed role of the Mascot results in lower average grades in the same subject. A strongly expressed role of the Hero in the family together with being a female determines higher average grades in the Lithuanian language, while a strongly expressed role of the Mascot results in lower average grades in the Lithuanian language.
