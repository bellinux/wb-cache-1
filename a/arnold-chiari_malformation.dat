In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the frequency and}} degree of severity of abnormalities in the auditory pathways in patients with Chiari malformations type I and II. METHOD: This is a series-of-case descriptive study in which the possible presence of auditory pathways abnormalities in 75 patients (48 children and 27 adults) with Chiari malformation types I and II were analyzed by means of auditory evoked potentials evaluation. The analysis {{was based on the}} determination of intervals among potentials peak values, absolute latency and amplitude ratio among potentials V and I. RESULTS: Among the 75 patients studied, 27 (36 %) disclosed <b>Arnold-Chiari</b> <b>malformations</b> type I and 48 (64 %) showed <b>Arnold-Chiari</b> <b>malformations</b> type II.

OBJETIVO: Avaliar a freqüência e grau de comprometimento das vias auditivas em tronco cerebral por meio de potencial evocado auditivo, em pacientes afetados por malformações de Arnold-Chiari de tipos I e II. MÉTODO: Foi efetuado um estudo descritivo de tipo série de casos, sendo selecionados 75 pacientes (48 crianças e 27 adultos) nos quais foi realizada avaliação dos potenciais evocados das vias auditivas, com base à determinação dos valores dos intervalos entre picos de potenciais, da latência absoluta e da razão entre as amplitudes dos potenciais V e I. RESULTADOS: Entre os 75 pacientes avaliados, 27 (36 %) apresentavam malformações de Arnold-Chiari de tipo I e 48 (64 %) apresentavam malformações de tipo II. Em 53 (71 %) do total de pacientes os potenciais evocados auditivos mostraram algum grau de anormalidade. Os testes foram normais nos restantes 22 (29 %).

MMC was the first nonlethal anomaly to be treated by fetal surgery. Studies in animals provide compelling evidence that the primary cause of the neurological deficit associated with MMC is not simply incomplete neurulation but rather chronic mechanical injury and amniotic-fluid-induced chemical trauma that progressively damage the exposed neural tissue during gestation. Initial results suggest that the surgical repair of MMC before 25 weeks of gestation may preserve neurological function, reverse the hindbrain herniation of the <b>Arnold-Chiari</b> II <b>malformation,</b> and obviate the need for postnatal placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

Hydrocephalus was most prominent in the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, but other lesions occurred at various levels of the ventricular system. Virus was isolated from three animals at one day of age (two months after inoculation). However, mumps virus was not recovered from one-month-old monkeys.

40|$|The off ering of {{screening}} for neural tube defects by maternal serum-fetoprotein (MSAFP) measurement {{is recommended for}} all pregnant women who are seen for prenatal care in locations that have adequate counseling and follow-up services available (see Clinical Intervention). Screening with MSAFP may be offered as part of multiple-marker screen-ing (see Chapter 41). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the offering {{of screening}} for neural tube defects by midtrimester ultrasound examination to all pregnant women, but recommendations against such screening may be made on other grounds (also see Chapter 36). Daily multivitamins with folic acid {{to reduce the risk}} of neural tube defects are recommended for all women who are planning or capable of pregnancy (see Clinical Intervention). Neural tube defects, including anencephaly, encephalocele, and spina bifida, account for substantial morbidity and mortality. Anencephaly is almost always lethal, usually resulting either in stillbirth or death within hours or days of birth. Spina bifida can range from mild (spina bifida occulta) to severe (myelomeningocele). The manifestations of severe spina bifida may include infectious complications, paraplegia, bladder and bowel incontinence, <b>Arnold-Chiari</b> <b>malformations,</b> hydrocephalus, and, as a complication of hydrocephalus, diminished intelligence. 1 Aggressive surgical and medical care is often necessary for severely affected cases, along with special schooling and rehabilitative services for patients with permanent disabilities.

To minimize the morbidity of subcutaneous tunneling or an open abdominal wound, {{we developed a}} simplified technique for laparoscopy-assisted placement of lumboperitoneal shunts. Methods: Patients deemed candidates for lumboperitoneal shunts underwent laparoscopy-assisted lumboperitoneal shunt placement. Using a Tuohy needle, the neurosurgeon obtains access to the lumbar subthecal space. Simultaneously, the laparoscopist obtains access to the peritoneal cavity with two 5 -mm ports for the take down of the descending colon, {{clearing the way for}} the passage of the shunt passer from the back into the peritoneal cavity. Results: Over the last 5 years, 45 patients have undergone laparoscopy-assisted lumboperitoneal shunt placement. Patients have been followed with neuropsychiatric examinations, imaging studies, and repeated neurological examinations. No complications related to the laparoscopy have occurred. Neurosurgical complications included postural headaches caused by overdrainage in 4 patients requiring laparoscopic modification of the shunt slit and in 1 patient with acquired <b>Arnold-Chiari</b> I <b>malformation.</b> Conclusion: Laparoscopy-assisted lumboperitoneal shunt offers many advantages over percutaneous ventriculoperitoneal or laparoscopic transabdominal lumboperitoneal shunts.

40|$|Spina bifida is {{a serious}} birth defect that in-volves an {{incomplete}} closure of the spine, spinal cord, brain, and/or protective covering of the fe-tal spine. Even though the causes of spina bifida are still uncertain, diabetes, obesity, severe hyperthermia in early pregnancies, and poor nu-trition {{are believed to be}} causes of neural tube defects (NTDs). Because spina bifida may go undetected by α-fetoprotein screening and am-niocentesis, sonography becomes a valuable tool in its identification.
