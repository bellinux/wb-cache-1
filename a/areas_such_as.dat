He concedes {{that there have been}} gains in certain <b>areas,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> information technology, but argues that in other important <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> finance, which is 8% of GDP, there has been less value created.|$|E

5|$|The Australian magpie prefers open <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> grassland, {{fields and}} {{residential}} <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage {{mainly on the}} ground in these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.|$|E

5|$|The willie wagtail {{is at home}} in a {{wide variety}} of habitats, but avoids densely forested <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> rainforest.

It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and can often be seen hunting in open, grassed <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> lawns, gardens, parkland, and sporting grounds. The species spread into the Western Australian Wheatbelt after the original vegetation had been cleared for agriculture.|$|E
