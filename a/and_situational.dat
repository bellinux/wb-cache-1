5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background <b>and</b> <b>situational</b> factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

25|$|Numerous biases in the {{attribution}} process have been discovered. For instance, the fundamental attribution error is {{the tendency to}} make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations. The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior <b>and</b> <b>situational</b> attributions for our own. The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, <b>and</b> <b>situational</b> causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people. Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality. Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).|$|E

25|$|Biological {{approaches}} conceptualize aggression as {{an internal}} energy released by external stimuli, {{a product of}} evolution through natural selection, part of genetics, a product of hormonal fluctuations.

25|$|Active versus {{reactive}} – This question explores whether humans primarily act through individual initiative (active) {{or through}} outside stimuli. Traditional behavioral theorists typically believed {{that humans are}} passively shaped by their environments, whereas humanistic and cognitive theorists believe that humans are more active in their role.

25|$|To {{the extent}} {{that a person is}} fearful of social {{encounters}} with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.).

They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences (stable personality traits) <b>and</b> <b>situational</b> factors (the environment). Situational factors include both the task (social and decision structure) and the perception of the task.|$|E

25|$|Several {{cognitive}} processes related to situation awareness are briefly {{described in this}} section. The matrix shown below attempts to illustrate the relationship among some of these concepts. Note that situation awareness <b>and</b> <b>situational</b> assessment are more commonly discussed in information fusion complex domains such as aviation and military operations and relate more to achieving immediate tactical objectives. Sensemaking and achieving understanding are more commonly found in industry and the organizational psychology literature and often relate to achieving long-term strategic objectives.|$|E
25|$|Collins and Feeney {{review a}} number of studies showing how each {{attachment}} style relates to the willingness to self-disclose, the willingness to rely on partners, and the willingness to engage in physical intimacy. The secure attachment style is generally related to more self-disclosure, more reliance on partners, and more physical intimacy than other attachment styles. However, the amount of intimacy in a relationship can vary due to personality variables <b>and</b> <b>situational</b> circumstances, and so each attachment style may function to adapt an individual to the particular context of intimacy in which they live.|$|E

25|$|Why {{attachment}} styles {{change is}} not well understood. Waters, Weinfield and Hamilton propose that negative life experiences often cause changes in attachment styles. Their proposal is supported by evidence that people who experience negative life events also tend to experience changes in attachment styles. Davila, Karney and Bradbury have identified four sets of factors that might cause changes in attachment styles: (a) situational events and circumstances, (b) changes in relational schemas, (c) personality variables, and (d) combinations of personality variables <b>and</b> <b>situational</b> events. They conducted a study to see which set of factors best explained changes in attachment styles. Interestingly, {{the study found that}} all four sets of factors cause changes in attachment styles. Changes in attachment styles are complex and depend on multiple factors.|$|E
25|$|All-round pilot {{vision was}} {{provided}} by a wrap-around windshield and bubble canopy. Unlike the F-16's steeply raked seat and sidestick controller, however, the Lavi employed a conventional upright seat and central control column. The cockpit employed HOTAS (hands-on-throttle and stick) controls, while a Hughes Aircraft wide-angle diffractive optics head up display (HUD) was integrated onto a single El-Op up-front control panel. There were {{a total of three}} conventional display units, two of which were color. Display redundancy was ensured via data-sharing between the HMDs. A fully computerised Elta ARC-740 ultra high frequency (UHF) radio was incorporated along with a navigation suite, the latter of which included the Tuman TINS 1700 advanced inertial navigation system.
