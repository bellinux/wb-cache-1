40|$|Above a {{critical}} surface chemistry-dependent particle loading associated with nanoscale interparticle spacing, ligand-ligand interactions-both electrostatic and steric-come into play and govern {{the structure and}} dynamics of charged oligomer-functionalized nanoparticle suspensions. We report in particular on the structure, ion transport, and rheology of suspensions of nanoparticle salts created by cofunctionalization of silica particles with tethered sulfonate salts and oligomers. Dispersion of the hairy ionic particles into medium and high dielectric constant liquids yields electrolytes with unique structure and transport properties. We find that electrostatic repulsion imparted by ion dissociation can be tuned to control the dispersion state and rheology through counterion size (i. e., Li+, Na+, and K+) and dielectric properties of the dispersing medium. Analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) structure factors and the mechanical modulus shows that when the interparticle spacing approaches nanometer dimensions, weakly entangled anchored ligands experience strong and long-lived topological constraints analogous to those normally found in well-entangled polymeric fluids. This finding provides insight into the molecular origins of the surprisingly similar rubbery plateau moduli observed in hairy nanoparticle suspensions and entangled polymers of the same chemistry as the tethered ligands. Additionally, we find that a time-composition superposition (TCS) principle exists for the suspensions, {{which can be used}} to substantially extend the observation time over which dynamics are observed in jammed, soft glassy suspensions.

The main message is that, depending on initial data, the MNLS equation can behave either like the defocusing NLS equation, like the focusing NLS equation (in both cases the analogy is asymptotically accurate in the semiclassical limit when the NLS equation is posed with appropriately modified initial data), or like an interesting mixture of the two.

Some important features in inflationary dynamics arise whenever anisotropy is present even in the form of small perturbations. This point has not been emphazised yet in the literature of inflation. The conjunction of the cosmological constant, anisotropy and matter fields implies the existence of a saddle-center E in phase space 1.

We found the population to be disassortatively mixed (i. e. male mice mixing with female mice more often than same sex mixing) at a constant level over time. The macroparasite H. polygyrus has previously been shown to exhibit male-biased transmission so we used a Susceptible-Infected (SI) mathematical model to simulate the effect of increasing strengths of male-biased transmission on the prevalence of the macroparasite using empirically-derived transmission networks. When transmission was equal between the sexes the model predicted macroparasite prevalence to be 73 % and infection was male biased (82 % of infection in the male mice). With a male-bias in transmission ten times that of the females, the expected macroparasite prevalence was 50 % and was equally prevalent in both sexes, results that both most closely resembled empirical dynamics.

To overcome this challenge, data assimilation (DA) methods, and specifically ensemble methods, use the computational model itself to estimate the uncertainty of the model to optimally combine these observations into an initial condition for predicting the future state. Here, we build and verify four distinct DA methods, and then, we perform a twin model experiment with the computational fluid dynamics simulation of the loop using the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) to assimilate observations and predict flow reversals.

What prevents one partner from reaping {{the benefits of the}} interaction without paying the costs? Using field experiments and observations, we examined factors affecting mutualism stability in six fig tree–fig wasp species pairs. We experimentally compared the fitness of wasps that did or did not perform their most basic mutualistic service, pollination. We found host sanctions that reduced the fitness of non-pollinating wasps in all derived, actively pollinated fig species (where wasps expend time and energy pollinating), but not in the basal, passively pollinated fig species (where wasps do not). We further screened natural populations of pollinators for wasp individuals that did not carry pollen (‘cheaters’). Pollen-free wasps occurred only in actively pollinating wasp species, and their prevalence was negatively correlated with the sanction strength of their host species. Combined with previous studies, our findings suggest that (i) mutualisms can show coevolutionary <b>dynamics</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> those of ‘arms races’ in overtly antagonistic interactions; (ii) sanctions are critical for long-term mutualism stability when providing benefits to a host is costly, and (iii) there are general principles that help maintain cooperation both within and among species...|$|R

It is shown that the generalized potential plays a role in the <b>dynamics</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> that of the ordinary nonrelativistic potential in a Schrodinger equation and determines the scattering to the same extent. Below the threshold for inelastic processes the generalized potential is real and its energy dependence in the elastic region is expected for certain particle combinations (such as the nucleon-nucleon) to be weak. In such cases one may uniquely define, for use in the Schrodinger equation, an energy-independent ordinary potential that coincides with the potential of Charap and Fubini (Abstr. 1960 A 01252). In general, when the potential is complex and energy-dependent the dynamical problem involves iteration of an integral equation deduced by Mandelstam (Abstr. 1959 A 04941).

40|$|The term `history effect' {{refers to}} the {{contribution}} of any past mass transfer events between a gas bubble and its liquid surroundings towards the current diffusion-driven growth or dissolution dynamics of that same bubble. The history effect arises from the (non-instantaneous) development of the dissolved gas concentration boundary layer in the liquid in response {{to changes in the}} concentration at the bubble interface caused, for instance, by variations of the ambient pressure in time. Essentially, the history effect amounts to the acknowledgement that at any given time the mass flux across the bubble is conditioned by the preceding time-history of the concentration at the bubble boundary. Considering the canonical problem of an isolated spherical bubble at rest, we show that the contribution of the history effect in the current interfacial concentration gradient is fully contained within a memory integral of the interface concentration.

The experiments were run from exponential growth into the stationary phase (six days after nitrogen depletion), allowing us <b>to</b> track biogeochemical <b>dynamics</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> bloom situations in the ocean. Elevated CO 2 had a fertilizing effect and enhanced uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by about 8 % for T. weissflogii and by up to 39 % for D. fragilissimus. This was also reflected in higher cell numbers, build-up of particulate and dissolved organic matter, and transparent exopolymer particles. The CO 2 effects were most prominent in the stationary phase when nitrogen was depleted and CO 2 (aq) concentrations were low. This indicates that diatoms in the high CO 2 treatments could take up more DIC until CO 2 concentrations in seawater became so low that carbon limitation occurs. These results suggest that, contrary to common assumptions, diatoms could be highly sensitive to ongoing changes in oceanic carbonate chemistry, particularly under nutrient limitation. Warming from 15 to 20 °C had a stimulating effect on one species but acted as a stressor on the other species, highlighting the importance of species-specific physiological optima and temperature ranges in the response to ocean warming.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a point-mutation model describing the evolutionary dynamics {{of a population}} of adult stem cells. Such a model may prove useful for quantitative studies of tissue aging {{and the emergence of}} cancer. We consider two modes of chromosome segregation: (1) Random segregation, where the daughter chromosomes of a given parent chromosome segregate randomly into the stem cell and its differentiating sister cell. (2) "Immortal DNA strand" co-segregation, for which the stem cell retains the daughter chromosomes with the oldest parent strands. Immortal strand co-segregation is a mechanism, originally proposed by Cairns (J. Cairns, Nature 255, 197 (1975)), by which stem cells preserve the integrity of their genomes. For random segregation, we develop an ordered strand pair formulation of the <b>dynamics,</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the ordered strand pair formalism developed for quasispecies dynamics involving semiconservative replication with imperfect lesion repair (in this context, lesion repair is taken to mean repair of postreplication base-pair mismatches). Interestingly, a similar formulation is possible with immortal strand co-segregation, despite the fact that this segregation mechanism is age-dependent. From our model we are able to mathematically show that, when lesion repair is imperfect, then immortal strand co-segregation leads to better preservation of the stem cell lineage than random chromosome segregation. Furthermore, our model allows us to estimate the optimal lesion repair efficiency for preserving an adult stem cell population for a given period of time. For human stem cells, we obtain that mispaired bases still present after replication and cell division should be left untouched, to avoid potentially fixing a mutation in both DNA strands.

We solve these equations using a nonlinear code which finds stationary rotating magnetised stars by an iterative procedure. We find that despite the general nature of our approach, the mixed-field configurations we produce are all dominated by their poloidal component. We calculate distortions induced both by magnetic fields and by rotation; our {{results suggest that the}} relationship between the magnetic energy and the induced ellipticity should be close to linear for all known neutron stars. We then investigate the oscillation spectra of neutron stars, using these stationary configurations as a background on which to study perturbations. This is done by evolving the perturbations numerically, making the Cowling approximation and specialising to purely toroidal fields for simplicity. The results of the evolutions show a number of magnetically-restored Alfv´en modes. We find that in a rotating star pure inertial and pure Alfv´en modes are replaced by hybrid magneto-inertial modes. We also show that magnetic fields appear to reduce the effect of the r-mode instability. Finally, we look at precession-like dynamics in magnetised fluid stars, using both analytic and numerical methods. Whilst these studies are only preliminary, they indicate deficiencies in previous research on this topic. We suggest ways in which the problem of magnetised-fluid precession could be better understood. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
