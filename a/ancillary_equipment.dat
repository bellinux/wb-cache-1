5|$|The final {{deliveries}} included six non-rigid airships, several kite {{balloons and}} additional aircraft, including two Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2C, and single examples of Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2D and Vickers F.B.9, {{along with some}} replacement airframes, bringing the total to 120 aircraft. In addition to the aircraft, numerous spares were sent, including engines and <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> such as cameras and seaplane beaching gear, along with 300 support vehicles consisting of motor transports, trailers and motorcycles. The value of the Imperial Gift was about $5 million, {{more money than the}} Canadian government spent on aviation from 1919 to 1923.|$|E
30|$|A {{fuel cell}} system {{consists}} of a stack and various <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipments</b> including air compressors, cooling water circulation, humidifier, pumps, and electrical control equipment. Among all the <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipments,</b> the power consumption of air compressor is the greatest, typically accounting for up to 80  % power of the overall <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipments</b> and 15  %– 20  % of the {{fuel cell system}} [2, 4]. For a fuel cell stack, air flowrate must be greater than the amount needed by the electrochemical reaction, and the oxygen excess ratio (OER), which is the ratio between the flowrate of oxygen provided and reacted, is critical to ensure the system stability and reliability. If the OER is too low, even though higher than 1, {{it is likely to}} cause “oxygen starvation” [5, 6] and results in cell reversal, which is harmful to the stack. On the other hand, a higher OER will lower the concentration difference in cathode flow field and improve the fuel cell performance, while greater air flow results in higher power consumption for the air compressor and lower system efficiency, which is called “oxygen saturation.” In addition, the air pressure in cathode flow field of the fuel cell stack and the pressure difference between both sides of proton exchange membrane must be maintained in a certain range during operation. Air flow control is important to maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the system, and different air flow control techniques have been provided by researchers [7, 8, 9, 10].|$|R

25|$|At this time, trams were {{starting}} to be considered out-dated and inflexible and the phasing out and replacement by diesel buses or trolleybuses started in earnest around 1935, when {{a large proportion of}} the trams and of the tracks and <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> were nearing the end of their useful life. Replacement continued until hostilities stopped the conversion programme in June 1940, leaving only the South London trams and the routes that went through the Kingsway subway into North London. After World War II, shortages of steel and electrical machinery were cited as reasons for not investing in maintenance, while the LCC reported that the service ran at a loss.|$|E
40|$|IPN Orsay is {{presently}} involved in several R&D {{programs for the}} future accelerators in Europe. High intensity linear proton accelerators are proposed for Nuclear Physics (EURISOL) and for Nuclear Waste Transmutation (XADS). Both projects propose to use Superconducting RF cavities for the whole energy range (5 MeV- 1 GeV). Two types of cavities are developed: spoke type for the low/intermediate energy and elliptical multi-cell type for the high-energy range. Power couplers, cold tuning systems and <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipments</b> are also under development. A horizontal cryostat (CRYHOLAB), constructed {{in collaboration with the}} CEA Saclay, is now entered into a routine operation phase. An associated helium liquefier and RF power sources allow to test cavities with couplers and auxiliary equipments under conditions which are very close to those encountered in a real accelerator. More recently IPN Orsay has started a new SRF development for the Spiral- 2 Radioactive Beams Facility project. A 176 MHz half-wave resonator was designed and is under construction. Other important activities concern the new developments around the TESLA cavities, in particular the low temperature characterization of materials proposed for some components like the power couplers or the piezo tuning system...|$|R

500|$|Join Hands {{was issued}} on 7 September 1979 by Polydor Records. It reached No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart. At that time, the breach between McKay and Morris {{and the rest}} of the group had become important. A warm-up show in Ireland had caused {{problems}} for McKay; none of the <b>ancillary</b> <b>equipment</b> arrived at the venue, forcing him to play without all his effects pedals. Finally, after a brawl at a record shop, McKay and Morris abruptly left the band on the day of the album's release, just a few hours before a concert at the Capitol Theatre in Aberdeen. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, but they never returned. Severin later remarked, [...] "Is there another band that that's happened to? I don't think so".|$|E

50|$|<b>Ancillary</b> player <b>equipment</b> {{has also}} changed. The studded boots for grass fields are banned (and were {{in any case}} very uncomfortable) on synthetics, and have been {{replaced}} with boots specifically designed for synthetic turf. Shin guards have improved padding. Many players have taken to wearing padded gloves, particularly on their left hand, both to protect against contact {{and allow them to}} scrape that hand (while holding the stick) across the synthetic turf without injury. Finally, the wearing of mouthguards to protect the teeth is now compulsory for safety in many countries.|$|R

40|$|Sharing {{needles and}} <b>ancillary</b> {{injection}} drug <b>equipment</b> places {{injection drug users}} (IDU) at risk for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), a highly infectious blood-borne virus. A limited {{number of studies have}} analyzed the per-contact infectivity of HCV {{associated with the use of}} previously-used needles, but per-contact infectivity of <b>ancillary</b> injecting <b>equipment</b> has not been previously investigated. Our goal is to estimate the per-contact infectivity of HCV associated with (1) injecting with another person's previously-used needle, classified as receptive needle sharing (RNS), and (2) using another person's previously-used <b>ancillary</b> injecting <b>equipment,</b> such as cookers to melt drugs and cottons to strain impurities from the melted drugs, termed receptive equipment sharing (RES). Estimates of per-contact probabilities were calculated based on self-reported exposures to RNS and RES. A probabilistic exposure model was used on the UFO (yoU Find Out) dataset composed of 784 IDU under the age of 30 who were surveyed quarterly between 2003 - 2008 and 2010 - 2014. For each participant, we selected the first survey with an HCV seronegative status up through their next seropositive survey, leaving us with 505 subjects on whom to conduct the analysis. A marginal maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) considering only RNS gives a per-contact infectivity of HCV as 0. 39 % (95 % CI: 0. 188 % - 0. 679 %). A joint MLE gives RNS as 0. 44 % (95 % CI: 0. 0001 % - 0. 600 %) and RES as 0 % (95 % CI: 0. 00 % - 0. 69 %), thus needles are a much bigger cause of concern than equipment. Though both probabilities are small, 13 % (65 / 505) of the subjects studied seroconverted to an HCV-postitive status. Strategies for reducing RNS, and RES to a lesser extent, are important for reducing the spread of HCV and its related maladies. StatisticsMastersUniversity of New Mexico.
