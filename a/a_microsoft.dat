5|$|The Viva Piñata {{team was}} a model for {{productivity}} and regular output within Rare and Microsoft Studios. Though compared to the 12-person teams behind earlier Rare games, the company's Xbox 360 development teams consisted of 50 to 60 people. The Viva Piñata team included about 50 people at its zenith. Microsoft transitioned its development teams to use its XNA package to streamline and reduce duplication in engineering efforts. Microsoft pressured the Viva Piñata development team to keep the game's themes children-friendly, as the parent company planned for the game and resulting franchise to increase the market appeal of their Xbox 360. In 2006, <b>a</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Games executive called the game its most important franchise. But its reception was tepid.|$|E

5|$|These {{limitations}} {{have caused}} problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied {{each year and}} was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and <b>a</b> <b>Microsoft</b> tool that switches zones automatically. In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar.|$|E

5|$|Windows 8.1 adds tighter {{integration}} with several Microsoft-owned services. OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is integrated {{at the system}} level to sync user settings and files. Files are automatically downloaded in the background when they are accessed from the user's OneDrive folder, unless they are marked to be available offline. By default, only file metadata and thumbnails are stored locally, and reparse points are used to {{give the appearance of}} a normal directory structure to provide backwards compatibility. The OneDrive app was updated to include a local file manager. OneDrive use on Windows 8.1 requires that a user's Windows account be linked to <b>a</b> <b>Microsoft</b> account; the previous SkyDrive desktop client (which did not have this requirement) is not supported on Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows RT {{and core}} edition of Windows 8.1 include device encryption, a feature-limited version of BitLocker that encrypts the whole system.

The recovery key is stored {{to either the}} Microsoft account or Active Directory, allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all versions of 8.1, unlike BitLocker, device encryption requires that the device meet the InstantGo (formerly Connected Standby) specifications, which requires solid-state drives, non-removable RAM (to protect against cold boot attacks) and a TPM 2.0 chip.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Windows {{version of}} the game, ported by Demiurge Studios, was {{released}} on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks every ten days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, {{five years after the}} release of the original Xbox 360 version, Mass Effect was ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring some lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the Mass Effect Trilogy compilation.
