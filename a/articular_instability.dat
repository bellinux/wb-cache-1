40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the best treatment for anterior cruciate ligament hypoplasia or aplasia. To our knowledge, no comparative study between operative and conservative treatment of this condition has ever been performed. Conservative treatment is {{a viable alternative to}} surgery for ACL aplasia. Two siblings were examined at our outpatient clinic. The male patient underwent bilateral ACL reconstruction, while his sister was treated conservatively. Our results show a worse long-term outcome for the operative patient. At her last follow-up, the female patient treated conservatively showed subjective improvement in stability and gait. A review of the literature shows inconsistent outcomes after reconstruction in contrast to reports with cruciate ligament agenesis that did not undergo reconstruction with acceptable to good outcomes. Cruciate reconstruction should be reserved for cases of impaired <b>articular</b> <b>instability,</b> objectively manifest in the frequency of giving-way episodes. Treatment depends on the patient’s condition and expectations. Surgery should therefore only be suggested after proper patient counseling...|$|E
40|$|Avaliaram-se oito articulações metacarpofalangeanas (MCF) de eqüinos adultos pelos exames radiográfico e ultra-sonográfico após indução cirúrgica de uma instabilidade articular, para mimetizar as alterações iniciais da osteoartrite (OA) naturalmente adquirida. Foram mensurados a circunferência articular, a {{amplitude}} do movimento articular e o grau de claudicação dos membros torácicos (avaliação clínica). Dez dias após a intervenção cirúrgica os animais foram exercitados em um andador por um período de 60 dias. Os exames radiográfico e ultra-sonográfico foram realizados antes da intervenção cirúrgica e após 25, 40 e 70 dias, e a avaliação clínica, semanalmente, durante todo o período experimental. Observaram-se alterações ultra-sonográficas aos 25 dias após a instabilidade articular, enquanto as alterações radiográficas somente foram visualizadas aos 40 dias. Houve aumento significativo (P Eight {{metacarpophalangeal joints}} (MCP) of mature horses {{were evaluated by}} radiographic and ultrasonographic exams after surgically instability-induced that mimics the early changes of naturally acquired osteoarthritis (OA). Joint circunference, range of motion and lameness score were measured (clinical evaluation). Ten days after surgically joint instability the animals were walked on a horse walker by a 60 -day period. Radiography and ultrasonography were taken immediately before desmotomy and 25, 40 and 70 days after surgery. Clinical evaluation was performed at each 7 -day intervals. Ultrasonographic changes were observed on day 25 after <b>articular</b> <b>instability</b> while radiographic changes were only visualized on day 40. Joint circunference was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in OA joints (25. 75 cm± 1. 1) on day 7 as compared with contralateral joints (24. 88 cm± 1. 0) {{and a range of}} motion was significantly less (P< 0. 05) in OA joints (96. 38 º± 10. 7), on day 25, compared with basal value (109. 24 º± 10. 3) and contralateral joint (108. 75 º± 8. 3). Lameness score significantly increased (P< 0. 05) over time with mean score 1. 5 for the 70 -day study period. In conclusion, changes of induced OA joint were earlier and better detected by ultrasonography than by radiography. The measure of joint circunference and range of motion are useful in joint disease evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Lesions of the glenoid labrum can be {{associated}} with and cause shoulder instability and symptomatology by (1) allowing the shoulder to dislocate recurrently (ana-tomical instability); (2) allowing the shoulder to sublux-ate (anatomical instability); and (3) allowing the shoulder to click, catch, and lock secondary to partially attached fragments becoming interposed between the <b>articular</b> surfaces (functional <b>instability).</b> The latter two clinical entities are usually associated with "lesser " labral dam-age and diagnosis can be difficult. Six illustrative cases are presented and salient diagnostic and therapeutic points are discussed. The glenohumeral axillary arthro-tomogram is presented as a sensitive diagnostic test for detecting labral lesions...|$|R
