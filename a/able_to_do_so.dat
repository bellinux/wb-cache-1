5|$|The French, Russian and Argentine federations {{were able}} to insure their NBA players, and several other federations were also {{expected}} to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Over 30 NBA players participated in EuroBasket 2011, while Ben Gordon and Marcin Gortat opted out due to insurance concerns.|$|E
5|$|All {{players are}} awarded for {{completing}} a challenge {{if one of}} the members is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> and will be reflected in the individual players' career progress. in addition, players can unlock new avatars, outfits, and other content by completing challenges. The rewards of the challenges are used to replace the previous in-game money reward in previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services, the Australian Army's {{most senior}} medical officer, with {{the rank of}} major general. He oversaw the {{construction}} of major military hospitals in the capital cities. In 1944 he accepted a commission to edit the medical series volumes of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1939–1945 but was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> as {{he was killed in}} a plane crash in 1945.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, Varian {{announced}} {{that she would be}} working with the California Rangeland Trust to place her ranch into a conservation easement to protect it from development. She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E

5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action {{in a court of}} equity for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the court of equity may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|A popular product, {{with a lower}} screen {{resolution}} and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. Its basic design formed {{the core of the}} first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. The iPad 2 has been able to run six major versions of iOS, from 4 to 9, the only iOS device to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> The iPhone 4S is a close second with support from iOS 5 to iOS 9, as well as the iPhone 5, which was supported from iOS 6 to iOS 10.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, {{the player}} learns {{that the council}} city-states {{are now trying to}} find Remnants all around the world to use to fight the Conqueror, who is in turn binding and {{transforming}} the Remnants of the city-states, even those that are already bound. Rush and Irina's parents, once found, reveal that their research at the academy had been to create tablets that can transform Remnants and it is through one of these that Wagram stole that the Conqueror is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> When the party travels to the God-Emperor's city, Undelwalt, to try to determine why he is supporting the Conqueror, they find Wagram, who tells them that the Conqueror is a Remnant himself. Wagram and the God-Emperor are supporting him in his quest to destroy the people of the world, who are misusing Remnants and destroying the balance of the world.|$|E

5|$|In April 1964, with {{financial}} {{help from his}} half-sister Ella Little-Collins, MalcolmX flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as {{the start of his}} Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca obligatory for every Muslim who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned. He had received Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam's book The Eternal Message of Muhammad with his visa approval, and he contacted the author. Azzam's son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning MalcolmX learned that Prince Faisal had designated him as a state guest. Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, MalcolmX had an audience with the prince.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Oran fatwa, the {{predominant}} position of Islamic scholars {{had been that}} a Muslim could not stay {{in a country where}} rulers made proper religious observance impossible. Therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave, when they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Even before the systematic forcible conversion, religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from erosion. Notably, the contemporary North African scholar Ahmad al-Wansharisi, who was considered the leading authority on the subject of Muslims in Spain, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, Al-Wansharisi urged severe punishment for the Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in hell in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders' attack {{began with}} a night-time advance on 24 August by the 1st Infantry Brigade to clear the {{approaches}} to Bapaume, including Loupart Wood and Grévillers. Brigadier General Charles Melvill, commanding the brigade, was directed to move onto Bapaume if it were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> quickly. However, progress was delayed by heavy machine gun fire and artillery took its toll on the supporting tanks allocated to the brigade. Furthermore, {{in contrast to the}} previous three days, the weather was poor. Despite this, Grévillers fell to the brigade along with 380 prisoners and several field guns. There were over 100 casualties among the attacking New Zealanders, including the commander of 2nd Auckland Battalion.|$|E

50|$|Amaranth and Hunter were {{subsequently}} accused by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of conspiring to manipulate natural gas prices. When a 2-day congressional hearing found Hunter {{not guilty of}} pushing up prices, and thus adversely affecting end consumers of the gas, CFTC framed accusations against Hunter for trying to push the prices too low and FERC framed similar ones, but going one step further, accused Hunter of being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> {{in the state of}} Kerala. This is important because {{it has been shown that}} measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium {{in the body}} mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E

40|$|For those Mexicans that choose <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> {{migration}} <b>to</b> the U. S. {{can be both}} incredibly {{costly and}} risky. But with annual wages {{less than a third}} the cost of migration, how are migrants <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so?</b> Jeronimo Cortina looks at the role of Mexico’s Procampo agricultural assistance program, finding that its cash transfers are inadvertently encouraging many Mexicans to emigrate to the U. S. He argues that for the subsidy to achieve its purpose, then it must be conditional, or that instead, the Mexican government should create a regional structural fund aimed at rural counties in which migration is not yet prevalent to provide incentives to transform idle arable land into a productive investment, thus minimizing migratory pressures...|$|R
50|$|Finally, Tolstoy {{says that}} the fourth that he is taking is the one of just holding on, living despite the absurdity of it, {{because he is not}} willing or <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} else. <b>So</b> it seems utterly hopeless - at least without God.|$|R
5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|Workers first emerge between May and July. During {{this first}} emergence, {{reproductive}} males also emerge with this first brood and {{are called the}} early males. These males provide a great adaptation because they allow {{for the presence of}} reproductive males. Nests with a greater number of early males produce a greater number of workers, cells, pupae, and emergences. Although it is uncertain as to why, queen deaths are common in Polistes exclamans, most frequently in May. The majority of original queens are dead by July, “well before eggs that became autumn reproductive were laid,” as reproductives emerged from late August through September. Thus, queens must remain alive post June in order to birth future reproductives, and if they are not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> the eldest former worker then becomes the new queen. The reproductive early males produced may be adaptive for the deaths of the queens so that the colony will not die and will be able to continue.|$|E

They are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this <b>so</b> well that, in many respects, large-scale networks appear as coherent, almost intelligent, organisms. The design {{and control of}} such networks present challenges of a mathematical, engineering and economic nature. This paper outlines how mathematical models {{are being used to}} address current issues concerning the stability and fairness of rate control algorithms for the Internet...|$|R
2500|$|Some bugs are {{revealed}} by inputs {{that may be}} difficult for the programmer to re-create. [...] One cause of the Therac-25 radiation machine deaths was a bug (specifically, a race condition) that occurred only when the machine operator very rapidly entered a treatment plan; it took days of practice <b>to</b> become <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, <b>so</b> the bug <b>did</b> not manifest in testing or when the manufacturer attempted to duplicate it. [...] Other bugs may disappear when the program is run with a debugger; these heisenbugs (humorously named after the Heisenberg uncertainty principle).|$|R
60|$|Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. 'Let me try, dear,' she said, {{and indeed}} {{that was what}} he had come to ask her to do; and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the {{children}} stood around to see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>so</b> easily, but Mr. Darling was far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.|$|R
