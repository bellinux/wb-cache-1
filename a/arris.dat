25|$|In {{preparation}} for the service's launch, The Weather Channel reached agreements with various information service providers to offer content for Local Now to supplement its in-house weather data and video content. Initial partners included the Associated Press, which provides headlines and video for its news segments; Sportradar, a sports information agency which provides sports scores and schedules for its local news and sports segment; INRIX, which provides real-time incident data sourced from intelligent transportation systems; and TrafficLand, a traffic video integration service that provides footage from cameras maintained by state departments of transportation. The Weather Channel collaborated with <b>Arris</b> Global Services to provide technological management services for Local Now, handling design and integration, test validation, deployment, customized HTML software development and managed services. Local Now utilizes integration of the company's transcoders and Anevia's ViaMotion+ packaging software, {{and was the first}} service to implement CPE virtualization technology from ActiveVideo (a cloud video provider operated as joint venture of <b>ARRIS</b> and Charter Communications).|$|E

From 18 May till 18 June 1831, Carl revisited the Cederberg and Wupperthal on horseback.|$|E

50|$|<b>Arri</b> {{standard}} is a lens mount developed by <b>Arri</b> {{for use with}} both 16 mm and 35 mm movie cameras. Lenses are distinguished by a tab inside an outer ring. Because of the weak seating strength and ability of the aluminum mount to gradually become poorly seated, the stainless steel <b>Arri</b> bayonet mount superseded the <b>Arri</b> standard mount in 1965, debuting on the 16BL. However, cameras with the bayonet mount are also able to accommodate <b>Arri</b> standard lenses due to both mounts having the same flange focal distance and diameter. Unfortunately, cameras with <b>Arri</b> standard mounts are unable to fit lenses with <b>Arri</b> bayonet mounts, due to the bayonet mount's locking mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Arri</b> bayonet is a {{lens mount}} {{developed}} by <b>Arri</b> {{for use with}} both 16 mm and 35 mm movie camera lenses. Lenses of this type are distinguished by [...] "outer wings" [...] which both control aperture and bayonet alignment, and are placed in the mount while two pressure tabs are simultaneously depressed {{at the side of}} the lens mount on the camera. These tabs provide a relatively strong locking mechanism which allows for higher quality lens seating than offered by the <b>Arri</b> standard mount. Debuting in 1965 with the 16BL, the <b>Arri</b> bayonet mount superseded the <b>Arri</b> standard mount, but cameras with the bayonet mount were also able to accommodate <b>Arri</b> standard lenses due to both mounts having the same flange focal distance and diameter. However, cameras with <b>Arri</b> standard mounts were unable to fit lenses with <b>Arri</b> bayonet mounts, due to the locking mechanism. The bayonet mount began to be superseded around 1980 by the <b>Arri</b> PL mount, which has since become an overwhelmingly predominant mount for most modern cameras, along with Panavision and their PV mount.|$|R
25|$|In 1844, {{he married}} Lydia, {{youngest}} {{daughter of the}} Rev. Henry North. In 1847, he was appointed an assistant-surgeon to the hospital, and <b>Arris</b> and Gale professor at the Royal College of Surgeons. He held this professorship for six years and each year gave six lectures in surgical pathology. The first edition of these lectures, which were the chief scientific work of his life, was published in 1853 as Lectures on Surgical Pathology. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1851. In October 1851, he resigned the wardenship of the hospital. He had now become known as a great physiologist and pathologist; he had done for pathology in England what Rudolf Virchow had done in Germany, but he had hardly begun to get into practice, and he had kept himself poor so he might pay his share of his father's debts, a task that took him 14 years to fulfill.|$|E
500|$|Local New Jersey governments made {{efforts to}} protect bathers and the economy from man-eating sharks. The Fourth Avenue Beach at Asbury Park was {{enclosed}} with a steel-wire-mesh fence and patrolled by armed motorboats; it remained the only beach open following the Everingham incident. After the fatal attacks of Stilwell, Fisher, and Dunn, residents of Matawan lined Matawan Creek with nets and detonated dynamite {{in an attempt to}} catch and kill the shark. Matawan mayor <b>Arris</b> B. Henderson ordered the Matawan Journal to print wanted posters offering a $100 reward ($ in [...] dollars) to anyone killing a shark in the creek. Despite the town's efforts, no sharks were captured or killed in Matawan Creek. [...] The [...] "Matawan Journal" [...] reported the shark account incident in the front page of its July 13, 1916 issue with another article about the capture of a shark in Keyport a neighboring town in the issue of July 20, 1916.|$|E
500|$|In {{parallel}} with {{his career as}} a throat surgeon at a teaching hospital, Negus become a leading expert on the comparative anatomy of first the larynx and then the nose and the paranasal sinuses. This strand of his professional life started with the research he carried out in his thirties in the 1920s that eventually led to his degree of Master of Surgery (MS), awarded by the University of London. This work started as early as 1921 in the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, whose museum housed the collections of animal specimens gathered by the anatomist John Hunter. Working on these specimens, and adding to them with others supplied by the Zoological Society of London, Negus carried out meticulous dissections that enabled him to trace the stages of evolution and development of the larynx across a wide variety of animals. Part of this research was submitted as his thesis, and the excellence of the work was recognised by the award of a Gold Medal with his MS degree in 1924. In addition to this, Negus gave the <b>Arris</b> and Gale Lecture on 28 April 1924 at the Royal College of Surgeons, with his talk titled [...] "On the Mechanism of the Larynx".|$|E

The leaves and flowers which had appeared so very green and blooming by the artificial light were now seen to be faded and dusty.

60|$|As {{a change}} from {{thoughts}} not of a very cheerful kind, Knight attempted exertion. He stood up, and prepared to ascend to {{the summit of the}} ruinous heap of stones, from which a more extended outlook was obtainable than from the ground. He stretched out his arm to seize the projecting <b>arris</b> of a larger block than ordinary, and so help himself up, when his hand lighted plump upon a substance differing in the greatest possible degree from what he had expected to seize--hard stone. It was stringy and entangled, and trailed upon the stone. The deep shadow from the aisle wall prevented his seeing anything here distinctly, and he began guessing as a necessity. 'It is a tressy species of moss or lichen,' he said to himself.|$|E
6000|$|The {{burning of}} witches is, naturally, not an {{uncommon}} item in parish registers, and is {{set forth in}} a bold, business-like manner. On August 21 (1650) fifteen women and one man were executed for the imaginary crime of witchcraft. [...] "A grave, for a witch, sixpence," [...] is an item in the municipal accounts. And the grave was a cheap haven for the poor {{woman who had been}} committed to the tender mercies of a Scotch witch-trier. Cetewayo's medicine-men, who [...] "smelt out" [...] witches, were only some two centuries in the rear of our civilisation. Three hundred years ago Bishop Jewell, preaching before Elizabeth, was quite of the mind of Cetewayo and Saul, as to the wickedness of suffering a witch to live. As late as 1691, the register of Holy Island, Northumberland, mentions [...] "William Cleugh, bewitched to death," [...] and the superstition is almost as powerful as ever among the rural people. Between July 13 and July 24 (1699) the widow Comon, in Essex, was thrice swum for a witch. She was not drowned, but survived her immersion for only five months. A singular homicide is recorded at Newington Butts, 1689. [...] "John <b>Arris</b> and Derwick Farlin in one grave, being both Dutch soldiers; one killed the other drinking brandy." [...] But who slew the slayer? The register is silent; but [...] "often eating a shoulder of mutton or a peck of hasty pudding at a time caused the death of James Parsons," [...] at Teddington, in Middlesex, 1743. Parsons had resisted the effects of shoulders of mutton and hasty pudding till the age of thirty-six.|$|E
