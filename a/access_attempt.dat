2500|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} theories on lexical access for bilinguals, Language Selective Access and Language Non-Selective <b>Access,</b> <b>attempt</b> {{to explain the}} process and stages of lexical activation and selection. These hypotheses focus on determining whether lexical candidates from different languages that share similar lexical features are activated when a word is presented. For instance, when the Dutch word vork is activated, is the English word pork also activated? If the answer is [...] "no", it might suggest that language selection happens before the recognition of a word and only the lexical information of the target language is selectively activated, in which case lexical access is language selective. If the answer is [...] "yes", it might suggest the other possibility that the recognition of a word is processed in parallel for both languages and the lexical information of both languages are activated, in which case lexical access is language non-selective. Research pertaining to lexical access has indicated {{that it is not}} achievable to completely suppress a known language.|$|E

40|$|Randomized {{exponential}} backoff {{is a widely}} deployed technique for coordinating access to a shared resource. A good backoff protocol should, arguably, satisfy three natural properties: (i) it should provide constant throughput, wasting as little time as possible; (ii) it should require few failed <b>access</b> <b>attempts,</b> minimizing the amount of wasted effort; and (iii) it should be robust, continuing to work efficiently even {{if some of the}} <b>access</b> <b>attempts</b> fail for spurious reasons. Unfortunately, {{exponential backoff}} has some well-known limitations in two of these areas: it provides poor (sub-constant) throughput (in the worst case), and is not robust (to resource acquisition failures). The goal {{of this paper is to}} "fix" exponential backoff by making it scalable, particularly focusing on the case where processes arrive in an on-line, worst-case fashion. We present a relatively simple backoff protocol Re-Backoff that has, at its heart, a version of exponential backoff. It guarantees expected constant throughput with dynamic process arrivals and requires only an expected polylogarithmic number of <b>access</b> <b>attempts</b> per process. Re-Backoff is also robust to periods where the shared resource is unavailable for a period of time. If it is unavailable for D time slots, Re-Backoff provides the following guarantees. When the number of packets is a finite n, the average expected number of <b>access</b> <b>attempts</b> for successfully sending a packet is O(^ 2 (n + D)). In the infinite case, the average expected number of <b>access</b> <b>attempts</b> for successfully sending a packet is O(^ 2 (η) + ^ 2 (D)) where η is the maximum number of processes that are ever in the system concurrently...|$|R

On transmission failures, the 802. 11 DCF performs a binary exponential backoff mechanism to discourage channel <b>access</b> <b>attempts,</b> hoping to reduce congestion. When traditional link adaptation is applied, both rate reduction and binary backoff represent double penalties for this wireless link, which may cause overly conservative transmission attempts. On the other hand, once transmission succeeds, 802. 11 DCF resets the backoff contention window to the minimum value to encourage channel <b>access</b> <b>attempts.</b> At the same time, traditional link adaptation may also decide to increase the data rate, which leads to overly aggressive transmission attempts.

40|$|Abstract—The {{operation}} of widely-deployed random access to wireless networks {{is based on}} limited information on the result of each <b>access</b> <b>attempt.</b> When making a random <b>access</b> <b>attempt,</b> users usually {{do not know the}} exact amount of transmit power to make it successful. Also, upon failure of a transmission attempt, a user cannot tell whether the failure was caused by collision with other simultaneously-transmitting users or by his use of insufficient transmit power. To handle lack of information on the cause of failure, we propose an innovative Cause-of-Failure (CoF) resolution which increases the transmit power after a given number of consecutive unsuccessful access attempts when the probability that a given failure is caused by collision becomes sufficiently low. To exploit the thus-achieved transmit power for the next random <b>access</b> <b>attempt,</b> we also determine the Cause-of-Success (CoS) {{based on the number of}} consecutive successful attempts, i. e., whether to decrease or maintain the present transmit power probabilistically. This way, users can adjust their transmit power for random access, which we call Auto Power Fallback (APF). We evaluate APF by modeling analysis and numerical computation based on the slotted Aloha, showing that APF makes significant energy-savings for uplink random accesses while achieving good performance.

30|$|Figure 2 {{shows the}} virtual {{collision}} resolution among the ACs of 802.11 e EDCA. Immediate access can be granted for the transmission attempt of any AC[n] queue (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) {{only after the}} medium is idle longer than AIFS(AC[n]). In case of busy medium, a fixed time interval plus a random backoff time is needed before AC[n] can transmit a packet. AIFS(AC[n]) is the minimum time interval after which the QSTA detecting the idle channel can start a random backoff timer chosen from [0, CW(AC[n])] for collision avoidance among ACs. For each channel <b>access</b> <b>attempt,</b> CW(AC[n]) is initialized to CWmin(AC[n]) and the random backoff timer starts to count down in units of slot when the channel is free for one AIFS. The station starts to transmit when the backoff timer reaches zero and the channel is still idle. If unsuccessful, CW(AC[n]) is doubled for another channel <b>access</b> <b>attempt</b> until up to CWmax(AC[n]). TXOPlimit(AC[n]) is the maximum duration which allows the QSTA to transmit a burst of MAC frames without entering another channel contention period. Notably, {{as shown in the}} last column of Table 1, AC[2] (video) has a longer TXOPlimit than AC[3] (voice), whereas the zero values of TXOPlimit for both AC[1] and AC[0] represent that the QSTA can only transmit one MAC frame in a new contention period.|$|E
