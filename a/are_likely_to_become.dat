25|$|Preliminary Routing Indicators (PRIs) are {{installed}} on the approach to certain junctions. When the junction signal is displaying a 'proceed' aspect, the PRI will display an arrow. The arrow points up when the highest speed route is set. When a diverging route is set, the arrow points in the appropriate direction (mimicking the junction indicator on the junction signal). This advance indication gives the driver an opportunity to stop before the junction points, if wrongly routed. At the present time, PRIs are few in number, but they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> more common.|$|E
500|$|Mathijs and Sexton {{state that}} genre is an {{important}} part of cult films; cult films will often mix, mock, or exaggerate the tropes associated with traditional genres. [...] Science fiction, fantasy, and horror are known for their large and dedicated cult followings; as science fiction films become more popular, fans emphasize non-mainstream and less commercial aspects of it. B films, which are often conflated with exploitation, are as important to cult films as exploitation. [...] Teodor Reljic of Malta Today states that cult B films are a realistic goal for Malta's burgeoning film industry. [...] Genre films, B films that strictly adhere to genre limitations, can appeal to cult film fans: given their transgressive excesses, horror films <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> to cult films; films like Galaxy Quest (1999) highlight the importance of cult followings and fandom to science fiction; and authentic martial arts skills in Hong Kong action films can drive them to become cult favorites. [...] Cult musicals can range from the traditional, such as Singin' in the Rain (1952), which appeal to cult audiences through nostalgia, camp, and spectacle, to the more non-traditional, such as Cry-Baby (1990), which parodies musicals, and Rocky Horror, which uses a rock soundtrack. [...] Romantic fairy tale The Princess Bride (1987) failed to attract audiences in its original release, as the studio did not know how to market it. [...] The freedom and excitement associated with cars can be an important part of drawing cult film fans to genre films, and they can signify action and danger with more ambiguity than a gun. [...] Ad Week writes that cult B films, when released on home video, market themselves and need only enough advertising to raise curiosity or nostalgia.|$|E

2500|$|A counter-hypothesis is {{advanced}} in The Revenge of Gaia, {{the book by}} James Lovelock.

Under this scenario, deprived of nutrients, marine phytoplankton would decline, as would sulfate cloud condensation nuclei, and the high albedo associated with low clouds.

2500|$|The Future Surface Combatant may place {{importance}} on the Zumwalt-class destroyer's {{electric drive system}} that propels the ship while generating 58 megawatts of on-board electrical power, levels required to operate future directed energy weapons. [...] Laser weapon systems <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> more prominent to engage threats without using missiles that could potentially cost more than the target it is engaging. Less costly weapon systems may help keep the destroyer class from becoming too expensive.

[...] The ships also have to be modular to allow for inexpensive upgrades of weaponry, electronics, computing, and sensors over time as threats evolve.|$|E
2500|$|The {{health risks}} with {{conventional}} earlobe piercing are common but {{tend to be}} minor, particularly if proper technique and hygienic procedures are followed. One study found that up to 35 percent of persons with pierced ears had one or more complications, including minor infection (77 percent of pierced ear sites with complications), allergic reaction (43 percent), keloids (2.5 percent), and traumatic tearing (2.5 percent). Pierced ears are a significant risk factor for contact allergies to the nickel in jewelry. [...] Earlobe tearing, during the healing period or after healing is complete, can be minimized by not wearing earrings, especially wire-based dangle earrings, during activities in which they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> snagged, such as while playing sports.
