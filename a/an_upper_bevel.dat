Then the empty subset of P is a chain, as it satisfies the definition vacuously; so the hypothesis implies that this subset must have <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> bound in P, and this upper bound shows that P is in fact non-empty. Conversely, if P {{is assumed to be}} non-empty and satisfies the hypothesis that every non-empty chain has <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> bound in P, then P also satisfies the condition that every chain has <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> bound, as <b>an</b> arbitrary element of P serves as <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> bound for the empty chain (that is, the empty subset viewed as a chain).|$|R
