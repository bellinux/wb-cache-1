5|$|Because of the {{animation}} required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new lines of dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded {{the lines in}} an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart {{at that point in}} the X-Men timeline, which became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.|$|E
5|$|In {{the small}} town of Home, Pennsylvania, a woman gives birth to a {{deformed}} baby. Three similarly-deformed men bury it near their dilapidated house during a rainstorm. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to investigate after the corpse is found by children during a sandlot ball game. While talking to Home's sheriff Andy Taylor (Tucker Smallwood), Mulder <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> the Peacock brothers—the inhabitants of the house nearest to the crime scene—have been questioned about the baby. Taylor informs him that the house dates back to the American Civil War and is without electricity, running water, or heat. He also insinuates that the family has been inbreeding since the war. The three Peacock brothers watch the agents from their front porch.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> {{or not he}} should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues {{that he should not}} because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E

50|$|The Ontario {{amendments}} {{changed the}} test for summary judgment from <b>asking</b> <b>whether</b> the case presents “a genuine issue for trial” to <b>asking</b> <b>whether</b> there is a “genuine issue requiring a trial”. The new rule, with its enhanced fact‑finding powers, demonstrates that a trial is not the default procedure.|$|R
5000|$|The American {{physicist}} J. Robert Oppenheimer made {{an analogy}} to Buddhism when describing the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: If we <b>ask,</b> for instance, <b>whether</b> {{the position of}} the electron remains the same, we must say 'no;' if we <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> the electron's position changes with time, we must say 'no;' if we <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> the electron is at rest, we must say 'no;' if we <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> it is in motion, we must say 'no.' The Buddha has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of man's self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth-century science.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{shift to}} {{outsourcing}} raises issues about data integrity, regulatory oversight, language difficulties, {{the meaning of}} informed consent among a much poorer population, the standards of clinical care, {{the extent to which}} corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries, and the ethical problem of raising a population's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford. It also {{raises the question of whether}} the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> patients diagnosed with depression in China are really the same as patients diagnosed with depression in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Ritter soon {{discover}} that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, {{who has worked}} as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos of the dying young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but he pulls the knife out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's prints are on the knife. Ritter demands to know how Fellig always seems to be around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is in pain and <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} distinctiveness, {{relevance}} and plausibility (DRP) method for systematically evaluating potential experimental confounds. A claim {{is a statement}} being inferred {{on the basis of}} experimental data analysis. A potential confound is a statement providing a prima facie reason why the claim is not justified (other than internal weakness). In evaluating whether a potential confound is problematic, we can start by <b>asking</b> <b>whether</b> the potential confound is distinctive from the claim; we can then <b>ask</b> <b>whether</b> it is relevant for the claim; and we can conclude by <b>asking</b> <b>whether</b> it is plausible {{in the light of the}} evidence. © 2013 The Author...|$|R

5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} {{creature}} with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the creature is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> Wyman's death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{return to}} the {{homicide}} unit after a rotation in robbery, {{only to find the}} highest murder clearance rate in five years. A delighted Gee (Yaphet Kotto) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) and, particularly, Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne). Lewis (Clark Johnson) asks Gee for a different partner, but dodges questions about problems with his old partner Kellerman (Reed Diamond); Gee assigns him to Falsone (Jon Seda), one of the newer detectives, and Kellerman is partnered with Munch (Richard Belzer). That evening, Gee attends a black-tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson (James Earl Jones), a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist. In that same hotel, a woman is found beaten to death in the men's bathroom, and Pembleton and Bayliss are called to investigate. Felix and his wife Regina (Lynne Thigpen) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre, a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers. The Wilsons leave after only brief interviews, and Pembleton becomes agitated when Bayliss <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> Pembleton went easy on them because of his respect for Wilson's contributions to the African American community.|$|E
5|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{tasked with}} taking the cover {{photo of the}} summer catalog, and convinces Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider) to pose for photos at a {{community}} park. Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that she looks miserable and asks that the pictures not be used. Mark appears concerned that Ann's unhappiness {{is a reflection of}} their relationship. She insists everything is fine, but he is unconvinced. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy <b>asks</b> <b>whether</b> April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can go to another bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy. Later, the summer catalogs arrive, with a photo on the cover of April and Andy appearing happy together at the picnic.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of question wording and cognitive busyness on participant decisions to leave or stay in a hypothetical abusive relationship. Participants <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would leave were expected to make decisions closer to 2 ̆ 7 definitely leave 2 ̆ 7 than participants <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would stay, with the effect being more pronounced for cognitively busy participants. Participants read an abuse vignette and then half were instructed to memorize numbers to manipulate busyness. All participants imagined they were in the victim 2 ̆ 7 s position, tried to recall reasons from the vignette that were relevant to the decision, and indicated their decisions on a scale from 2 ̆ 7 definitely stay 2 ̆ 7 to 2 ̆ 7 definitely leave 2 ̆ 7. As predicted, male decisions were closer to 2 ̆ 7 definitely leave 2 ̆ 7 when <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would leave than when <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would stay. The opposite pattern, however, was found for female participants, with decisions being closest to 2 ̆ 7 definitely leave 2 ̆ 7 when <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would stay...|$|R
