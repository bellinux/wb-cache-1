40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} {{randomized}} controlled equivalence trial was to demonstrate that, in diabetic patients, dilating the pupils before as compared with after refraction and visual acuity assessment would not lead to different advice given to patients. Methods. Three hundred sixteen adult patients with diabetes mellitus were randomized. The experimental group was administered tropicamide 0. 5 % before refraction and visual acuity assessment and the control group after refraction and visual acuity assessment. Study outcomes were the advised time till next visit, the <b>advice</b> on <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> refractive correction, further diagnostics, treatment, duration of the eye examination, and patient satisfaction. Results. No difference was seen in advised time till next visit between the experimental group (12. 39 +/- 5. 01 months) and the control group (12. 84 +/- 4. 96 months) (p = 0. 425). In addition, the <b>advice</b> concerning <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> refractive correction (p = 0. 069), further diagnostics (p = 1. 000), and therapy (p = 0. 178) did not significantly differ. Waiting time was significantly shorter for the experimental group (22. 25 vs. 36. 18 minutes; p <. 001). People {{in the experimental group}} were relatively more often "very satisfied'' than "satisfied'' in comparison with participants in the control group for "attention being paid by the optometrist'' (p = 0. 025) and "advice on refractive correction'' (p = 0. 047). Conclusions. In diabetic patients, dilating pupils before refraction and visual acuity assessment does not lead to different advice given to patients compared with dilating pupils after refraction and visual acuity assessment, whereas waiting time significantly decreases and patient satisfaction is similar or even better. Increased efficiency is beneficial to both patients and clinicians. (Optom Vis Sci 2013; 90 : 249 - 256...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} contains three essays that {{explore the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> volatility and {{noise in the}} Indonesia Stock Exchange. The first essay explores the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the Indonesia Stock Exchange at daily interval from 2000 to 2004. The model employed is the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> with noise. Firstly, I work on the estimation of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The estimated speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> coefficient concludes that the large size leads the smaller size group to adjust to new information. Secondly, I analyse the component in the noise that contributes significantly to the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> level. It is confirmed that the factor determining the noise is bid-ask fluctuations. Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} infer the component in the noise from bid-ask component. The decomposition of bid-ask spread into transaction cost and asymmetric information reveals that the latter is found to be a significant component determining the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> level. The second essay analyses the fine grain dynamics of the speed <b>of</b> price <b>adjustment</b> to new information from 2000 to 2007. The exact time <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is estimated at intraday frequency instead of at daily frequency. In this work, as an alternative of first moment estimation, second moment model-free estimation using volatility signature plot to estimate of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> is proposed. Both first and second moment estimation of the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> provide consistent result <b>of</b> 30 minute <b>adjustment</b> period. Negative relation after 5 -minute return interval between speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> estimate and realized variance is found implying lower noise leads to smaller deviation between observed and equilibrium price. In the third essay, I concentrate the work on the second moment of continuously compounded returns from 2000 to 2007 in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The main purpose of the last essay is to estimate the noise and efficient variance in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The realized variance based estimator is employed in the third essay. During the period of the study, noise variance decreases indicating smaller deviation between the observed and equilibrium price, hence improving market quality in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The optimal frequency to estimate the efficient variance, on average, is nine minutes. The variance ratio of daily efficient variance to daily open-to-close reveals significant private information underlying price process in the Indonesia Stock Exchange...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Research {{has shown}} that {{individuals}} reporting a low level <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude, defined as having few possibilities to temporarily adjust work demands to illness, have {{a higher risk of}} sick leave. To what extent lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude influences the individual when making the decision to take sick leave is unknown. We hypothesize that ill individuals are more likely to take sick leave on days when they experience a lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude at work than on days with access to adjustment latitude. Methods: A case-crossover design was applied to 546 sick-leave spells, extracted from a cohort of 1 430 employees at six Swedish workplaces, with a 3 - 12 month follow-up of all new sick-leave spells. Exposure to lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on the first sick-leave day was compared with exposure during several types of control periods sampled from the previous two months for the same individual. Results: Only 35 % of the respondents reported variations in access to adjustment latitude, and 19 % reported a constant lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude during the two weeks prior to the sick-leave spell. Among those that did report variation, the risk of sick leave was lower on days with lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude, than on days with access (Odds Ratio 0. 36, 95 % Confidence Interval 0. 25 - 0. 52). Conclusions: This is the first study to show the influence <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on the decision to take sick leave. Among those with variations in exposure, lack <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude was a deterrent of sick leave, which is contrary to the a priori hypothesis. These results indicate that adjustment latitude may not only capture long-lasting effects of a flexible working environment, but also temporary possibilities to adjust work to being absent. Further studies are needed to disentangle the causal mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> latitude on sick-leave...|$|R
