In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating <b>a</b> <b>theme</b> <b>park,</b> or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E
