5000|$|Despite the {{implication}} of this commonly used name, the Irish flute is not an instrument indigenous to Ireland. The simple system, conical-bore flute is what people played {{before the advent of}} the modern, Boehm system, Western concert flute in the mid-19th century. Simple-system flutes are usually made of wood (cocus, grenadilla (<b>African</b> blackwood), rosewood, <b>ebony,</b> etc.). There were several manufacturers of this type of flute, among whom was English inventor and flautist Charles Nicholson Jr, who developed a radically improved version of the transverse wooden flute.|$|R
50|$|Ebony is a dense black wood {{taken from}} several {{species in the}} genus Diospyros, {{including}} Diospyros ebenum (Ceylon ebony, Indian ebony), Diospyros crassiflora (West <b>African</b> <b>ebony,</b> Benin ebony), and Diospyros celebica (Makassar ebony). Diospyros tesselaria (Mauritius ebony) was heavily exploited by the Dutch in the 17th century.|$|E
5000|$|Two main {{types of}} forest can be {{recognised}} grading from diverse moist evergreen forest with leguminous {{trees in the}} southern third to moist semi-evergreen forest in the north. Large numbers of epiphytes and lianes form an important element at the lower levels including Platycerium, Nephrolepis biserrata, Drymaria and Asplenium africanum. The Sassandrian moist evergreen forest on schistose soils in the south-west is dominated by species such as ebony (Diospyros gabunensis), Diospyros chevalieri, Mapania baldwinii, Mapania linderi and Tarrietia utilis, with numerous endemic species, especially in the lower Cavally Valley and the Meno and Hana depressions near Mont Niénokoué. The last stands of the large endemic tree Kantou guereensis are here. The poorer soils of the north and south-east support species such as palm Eremospatha macrocarpa, west <b>African</b> <b>ebony</b> Diospyros mannii, Diospyros kamerunensis, Parinarii chrysophylla, Chrysophyllum perpulchrum and [...] Species such as Gilbertiodendron splendidum, Symphonia globulifera and Raphia occur in the swamp forests of river backwaters and oxbows. The inselbergs are vegetated, according to their substrate, with savanna-like grassland and deciduous trees such as Spathodea campanulata. Plants {{once thought to be}} extinct, such as Amorphophallus staudtii, have been discovered in the area. Since commercial timber exploitation officially ceased in 1972, the forest has recovered well, although large areas are dominated by planted species.|$|E
40|$|Woodcarving is an {{important}} informal sector industry that is heavily dependent on tourism and yet sustains the livelihoods of many migrant communities in South Africa. In the Cape Town area, the trade appears {{to be dominated by}} sellers from neighbouring countries, including Zimbabwe, Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The most traded wood species are Dalbergia melanoxylon (<b>African</b> <b>ebony),</b> Brachylaena huillensis (silver oak or muhuhu) and Afzelia quanzensis (pod mahogany). This study found that the average gross income from the trade was R 6450 and R 2692 per month in the tourism peak and off seasons, respectively. However, while the woodcarving industry provides {{an important}} source of informal employment, it has contributed to the scarcity of highly prized hardwood species, especially in impoverished, underdeveloped areas. ...|$|E

He makes {{two different types of}} flute, Pratten (where the upper middle and lower middle are in one piece) and Rudell & Rose (where the upper middle and lower middle are separated by a joint). Marcus uses a few different types of timber in the making of his flutes, depending on what he has in stock, i.e. <b>African</b> Blackwood (Black <b>Ebony),</b> Rio Rosewood and Cooktown Ironwood. He {{also makes the}} cases for these flutes. the cases are made from Cherrywood.|$|R
5000|$|The Land of Punt, {{also called}} Pwenet, or Pwene {{by the ancient}} Egyptians, was a trading partner known for {{producing}} and exporting gold, aromatic resins, <b>African</b> blackwood, <b>ebony,</b> ivory, slaves and wild animals. Information about Punt {{has been found in}} ancient Egyptian records of trade missions to this region.The exact location of Punt remains a mystery. The mainstream view is that Punt was located to the south-east of Egypt, most likely on the coast of the Horn of Africa. The earliest recorded Egyptian expedition to Punt was organized by Pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth Dynasty (25th century BC) although gold from Punt is recorded as having been in Egypt in the time of king Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt. Subsequently, there were more expeditions to Punt in the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt, the Eleventh dynasty of Egypt, the Twelfth dynasty of Egypt and the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt. In the Twelfth dynasty of Egypt, trade with Punt was celebrated in popular literature in [...] "Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor".|$|R
40|$|There {{is a need}} of {{substitution}} {{woods for}} the use in musical instruments because of the limited availability of some commonly used tropical tonewoods. Before substitutions can be found, {{it is necessary to}} know about the required properties. Hence, in this paper acoustical, mechanical and physical properties of four common tropical hardwoods (Indian rosewood, ziricote, <b>African</b> blackwood and <b>ebony)</b> were determined because there are less literature values for some properties available, e. g. internal friction, hardness or swelling behaviour. The acoustic properties were determined by means of experimental modal analysis, the mechanical properties by means of static bending tests and tests of the Brinell hardness. For the swelling behaviour the volume swelling and also the differential swelling coefficients were determined. With the results it is possible to look for new âtonewoodsâ or to specifically modified woods, e. g. thermally treated wood, to substitute tropical wood species.

40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>ebony</b> (Diospyros crassiflora) is a well-sought {{commercial}} timber tree. As {{a result}} of intense harvesting pressure it ranks high on the IUCN' 1994 CITES list as endangered. Insufficient availability of seeds has limited the current efforts to propagate D. crassiflora from seedlings. Therefore, vegetative propagation through leafy stem cutting could be an alternative. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of four rooting media, length of cuttings and auxin (seradix- 2) application on the rooting ability of stem cuttings set up in a non-mist propagator. The rooting process was monitored over 14 weeks. Root development started after 9 weeks. At 14 weeks, the Seradix- 2 and rooting medium significantly improved the rooting ability. Decomposed sawdust was the best substrate. The combination of the three factors didn’t significantly influence rooting of cuttings. Stem cuttings of 5 cm length survive better in non-mist propagator. The results of the study suggest that D. crassiflora is amenable to vegetative propagation by leafy stem cutting...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMany {{objective}} and subjective experiments on brass instruments, organs, flutes and clarinets {{have shown that}} the influence of material was weak. Yet, the influence of wood on the sound of oboes is still to be determined. In this study, short musical recordings of ten French 16 ″ bagpipes made of 5 different woods (<b>African</b> <b>Ebony,</b> Santos Rosewood, Boxwood, African Blackwood and Service Tree) were presented to subjects (specialist and naïve), who had to give their feedback on several criteria (global quality, warmth, aggressiveness, brightness, volume and attack precision). The choice of a bagpipe rather than a simple oboe enables to minimize the influence of the musician, as he is not directly in contact with the reed. An influence of the reed material was found, but no influence of the wood. In a second experiment, a discrimination task allowed to confirm that the differences between chanters were not principally due to the wood. Several physical parameters calculated from recorded signals could also not reveal any large differences between woods...|$|E
40|$|Crassiflorone is {{a natural}} product with anti-mycobacterial and anti-gonorrhoeal properties, {{isolated}} from the stem bark of the <b>African</b> <b>ebony</b> tree Diospyros crassiflora. We noticed that its pentacyclic core possesses structural resemblance to the quinone-coumarin hybrid 3, which we reported to exhibit a dual-targeted inhibitory profile towards Trypanosoma brucei glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (TbGAPDH) and Trypanosoma cruzi trypanothione reductase (TcTR). Following this basic idea, we synthesized a small library of crassiflorone derivatives 15 - 23 and investigated their potential as anti-trypanosomatid agents. 19 is the only compound of the series showing a balanced dual profile at 10 μM (% inhibitionTbGAPDH = 64 % and % inhibitionTcTR = 65 %). In phenotypic assay, the most active compounds were 18 and 21, which at 5 μM inhibited Tb bloodstream-form growth by 29 % and 38 %, respectively. Notably, all the newly synthesized compounds at 10 μM did not affect viability {{and the status of}} mitochondria in human A 549 and 786 -O cell lines, respectively. However, further optimization that addresses metabolic liabilities including solubility, as well as cytochromes P 450 (CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19, and CYP 2 D 6) inhibition, is required before this class of natural product-derived compounds can be further progressed...|$|E
