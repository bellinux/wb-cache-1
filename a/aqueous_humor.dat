25|$|Dr. David M. Maurice (1922-2002), an eye {{specialist}} and semi-retired adjunct professor at Columbia University, proposed that REM sleep {{was associated with}} oxygen supply to the cornea, and that <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor,</b> the liquid between cornea and iris, was stagnant if not stirred. Among the supportive evidences, he calculated that if <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor</b> was stagnant, oxygen from iris had to reach cornea by diffusion through <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor,</b> which was not sufficient. According to the theory, when the animal is awake, eye movement (or cool environmental temperature) enables the <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor</b> to circulate. When the animal is sleeping, REM provides the much-needed stir to <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor.</b> This theory {{is consistent with the}} observation that fetuses, as well as eye-sealed newborn animals, spend much time in REM sleep, and that during a normal sleep, a person's REM sleep episodes become progressively longer deeper into the night. However, owls have REM sleep, but do not move their head more than in non-REM sleep and is well known that owls' eyes are nearly immobile.|$|E
25|$|In open/wide-angle glaucoma, flow {{is reduced}} through the trabecular meshwork, {{due to the}} {{degeneration}} and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, whose original function is to absorb the <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor.</b> Loss of <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor</b> absorption leads to increased resistance and thus a chronic, painless buildup of pressure in the eye.|$|E
25|$|Less-selective alpha agonists, such as epinephrine, {{decrease}} <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor</b> production through vasoconstriction of {{ciliary body}} blood vessels, useful only in open-angle glaucoma. Epinephrine's mydriatic effect, however, renders it unsuitable for closed-angle glaucoma due to further narrowing of the uveoscleral outflow (i.e. further closure of trabecular meshwork, {{which is responsible}} for absorption of <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor).</b>|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{develop a}} novel in vitro model {{to study the}} {{formation}} of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm on intraocular lenses (IOLs) from the primary-attachment phase to the biofilm-accumulation phase. The model was designed to replicate intraocular conditions especially by taking into account intraocular hydrodynamics. METHODS. The model consisted of Tygon tubing connected to a vial containing acrylic hydrophobic IOLs. Three septa, placed along the tubing, allowed, respectively, the artificial <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor’s</b> arrival and its elimination and the bacterial suspension’s inoculation. A first pump allowed the <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor’s</b> movement along the circuit, whereas a second one regulated the flow at which the nutritive environment was regenerated. The whole circuit {{was placed in a}} 34 °C water bath. Every 2 to 4 hours, lenses were taken from this environment. Boun...|$|R

40|$|Infl ammation {{results in}} the {{production}} of free radicals. We evaluated the anti-infl ammatory and antioxidant capacity of lipoic acid in an experimental uveitis model upon a subcutaneous injection of endotoxin into Lewis rats. The role of oxidative stress in the endotoxin-induced uveitis model is well-known. Besides, the Th 1 response classically performs a central part in the immunopathological process of experimental autoimmune uveitis. Exogenous sources of lipoic acid have been shown to exhibit antioxidant and anti-infl ammatory properties. Our results show that lipoic acid treatment plays a preventive role in endotoxin-induced oxidative stress at 24 h post-administration and reduced Th 1 lymphocytes-related cytokines by approximately 50 – 60 %. Simultaneously, lipoic acid treatment caused a signifi cant reduction in uveal histopathological grading and in the protein concentration in <b>aqueous</b> <b>humors,</b> but not in cellular infi ltration...|$|R

Serum samples were obtained 1 h after the end of linezolid administration to determine the maximum concentration of linezolid (Cmax); AHs and a second serum sample were taken simultaneously during the operation, and the concentrations of linezolid in AH (CAH) and serum (CS) were determined. The mean CAH 1 h after linezolid administration was 4. 94 μg/ml, and the mean ratio of CAH to CS (R = CAH/CS) was 0. 43.

40|$|Although {{composite}} {{data from}} separate subjects {{can be used}} to generate single-subject estimates, intersubject variation precludes rigorous ocular pharmacokinetic analysis. Therefore, a rabbit model in which sequential <b>aqueous</b> and vitreous <b>humor</b> samples were obtained following the administration of the quinolone fleroxacin was developed. Mean data from individual animals were used for pharmacokinetic analysis. Following direct intravitreal or systemic drug administration, sequential paracenteses did not alter pharmacokinetic constants or ocular penetration and were not associated with an increase in ocular protein; contamination of vitreous humor with blood was minimal (less than 0. 1 %). Following direct injection or intravenous administration, vitreous humor concentration-time data were best described by one- and two-compartment models, respectively. The maximum concentration and the penetration into the <b>aqueous</b> and vitreous <b>humors</b> were 1. 54 and 0. 5 micrograms/ml and 27 and 10 %, respectively. Elimination rates from <b>aqueous</b> and vitreous <b>humors</b> and serum were similar following parenteral drug administration. Drug elimination following direct injection was rapid, and the elimination rate from the vitreous humor was not prolonged by the coadministration of probenecid.

40|$|Purpose: Toxoplasmosis is {{the most}} common cause of {{posterior}} uveitis in immunocompetent subjects. Taking into account the opposing needs of limiting parasite multiplication and minimizing tissue destruction, the immune imbalance implies especially Th 17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells. Methods: In a prospective clinical study of acute ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), we evaluated the cytokine pattern in <b>aqueous</b> <b>humors</b> of 10 affected patients. To further study the immunological mechanisms, we evaluated the intraocular inflammation, the parasite load and the immunological response characterized on mRNA and protein level in a mouse model. To evaluate the role of IL- 17 A, anti IL- 17 A monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was administered concomitantly with the parasite. Results: We observed severe ocular inflammation and cytokine patterns comparable to human cases, including IL- 17 A production. Neutralizing IL- 17 A decreased intraocular inflammation and parasite load in mice. Detailed studies revealed upregulation of Treg and Th 1 pathways. When IFN-γ was neutralized concomitantly, the initial parasite multiplication rate was partially restored. Conclusions: Local IL- 17 A production plays a central role in pathology of OT. The balance of Th 17 and Th 1 responses (especially IFN-γ) is crucial for the outcome of infection. These data open new in vivo therapeutic approaches by repressing inflammatory pathways using intravitreal injection of IL- 17 A mAbs...|$|R
40|$|Background. Toxoplasmosis is {{the most}} common cause of {{posterior}} uveitis in immunocompetent subjects. The requirement of limiting both parasite multiplication and tissue destruction suggests that the balance between T-helper (Th) 17 and T-regulatory cells is an important factor in toxoplasmosis-induced retinal damage.

25|$|In close/narrow-angle, the iridocorneal {{angle is}} {{completely}} closed because of forward {{displacement of the}} final roll and root of the iris against the cornea, resulting in {{the inability of the}} aqueous fluid to flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber and then out of the trabecular network.

40|$|AbstractEndophthalmitis means {{bacterial}} or {{fungal infection}} inside the eye involving the vitreous and/or <b>aqueous</b> <b>humors.</b> Most cases are exogenous and occur after eye surgery, after penetrating ocular trauma, {{or as an}} extension of corneal infection. An increasing number of cases are occurring after intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications. Endophthalmitis may also be endogenous, arising from bacteraemic or fungaemic seeding of the eye. The infected eye never serves as a source of bacteraemia or fungaemia, however. The most common pathogens in endophthalmitis vary by category. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common causes of post-cataract endophthalmitis, and these bacteria and viridans streptococci cause most cases of post-intravitreal anti-VEGF injection endophthalmitis, Bacillus cereus is a major cause of post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci are important causes of endogenous endophthalmitis associated with endocarditis. In Taiwan and other East Asian nations, Klebsiella pneumoniae causes most cases of endogenous endophthalmitis, in association with liver abscess. Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in hospitalized patients is usually caused by Candida species, particularly Candida albicans. Acute endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. The most important component of treatment is the intravitreal injection of antibiotics, along with vitrectomy in severe cases. Systemic antibiotics should be used in cases of endogenous endophthalmitis and exogenous fungal endophthalmitis, but their role in exogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is uncertain. Repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics may be necessary if there is no response to the initial therapy. Many eyes that receive prompt and appropriate treatment will recover useful vision...|$|R

30|$|Patients with uveitis of {{infectious}} and non-infectious etiologies often share similar clinical {{signs and symptoms}} at presentation, representing diagnostic challenges, especially when serology is unable to establish the diagnosis [8]. Having an early definitive laboratory-proven diagnosis is very advantageous in starting timely appropriate effective treatment. So, we investigated the diagnostic utility of real-time and nested PCR samples obtained from the ocular fluid in clinically suspected infectious uveitis.

25|$|The ongoing {{scarring}} {{over the}} conjunctival dissipation {{segment of the}} shunt may become too thick for the <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor</b> to filter through. This may require preventive measures using antifibrotic medications, such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin-C (during the procedure), or other nonantifibrotic medication methods, such as collagen matrix implant, or biodegradable spacer, or later on create a necessity for revision surgery with the sole or combinative use of donor patch grafts or collagen matrix implant.

25|$|The optical {{component}} {{is concerned with}} producing a reduced inverted image on the retina. The eye's optical system consists of not only two but four surfaces—two on the cornea, two on the lens. Rays are refracted toward the midline. Distant rays, due to their parallel nature, converge to a point on the retina. The cornea admits light at the greatest angle. The aqueous and vitreous humors both have a refractive index of 1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has a refractive index of 1.376. Because the change in refractive index between cornea and <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor</b> is relatively small compared to the change at the air–cornea interface, it has a negligible refractive effect, typically -6 dioptres. The cornea {{is considered to be}} a positive meniscus lens.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} layers {{in the dog}} and cat cornea. The outer layer is the epithelium, which is 25 to 40 micrometers and five to seven cell layers thick. The epithelium holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it a cloudy appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The epithelium sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the epithelium from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of {{the thickness of the}} cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal endothelium. The endothelium is a single cell layer that separates the cornea from the <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{melatonin}} receptor agonists activate their receptors {{it causes}} numerous physiological processes. MT1 and MT2 receptors {{may be a}} target {{for the treatment of}} circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. The SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions. Melatonin receptors have been identified in the cardiovascular system. Evidence from animal studies points to a dual role of melatonin in the vasculature. Activation of MT1 receptors mediates vasoconstriction and the activation of MT2 receptors mediates vasodilation. Melatonin is involved in regulating immune responses in both human and animals through activation of both MT1 and MT2 receptors. MT1 and MT2 receptors are widespread in the eye and are involved in regulating <b>aqueous</b> <b>humor</b> secretion, which is important for glaucoma, and in phototransduction.

2500|$|The {{underlying}} cause of open-angle glaucoma remains unclear. Several theories exist on its exact etiology.

Its viscoelasticity also helps to push back the vitreous face and prevent formation of a postoperative flat chamber. In posterior segment surgery, sodium hyaluronate serves as a surgical aid to gently separate, maneuver, and hold tissues.
