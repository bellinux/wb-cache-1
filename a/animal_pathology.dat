The present study carried out in the Savannahs Region between 2 November 2012 to 28 January 2013 had evaluated the economic impact induce by <b>animal</b> <b>pathologies.</b> Socio-economic information were gathered through semi-structured, individual interviews of 35 breeders, coupled to field observations. A total of 210 informants, in majority men (78 %), pertaining to 8 ethnic groups were surveyed. Twenty seven (27) <b>animal</b> <b>pathologies</b> including 15 illness for the small ruminants, 15 for the bovines, 10 for chickens, and 8 for guinea fowls were identified. The annual losses induced by these pathologies to stockbreeder were estimated at 20 000 FCFA for the pigeons, 138 915 FCA for guinea fowls, 83 704 FCFA for chickens, 21 837 FCFA for the goats, 46 025 FCFA for the sheep, 49 140 FCFA for the pigs, and 490 000 FCFA for the cows. A better dealt of these pathologies would increase the incomes of the stockbreeders of 57 % for the pigeons, 52 % for guinea fowls and 25 % for chickens...|$|R

40|$|The {{earliest}} {{expression of}} truncated desmin in transfected PtK 2 cells {{results in the}} formation of dispersed microprecipitates containing not only the truncated desmin, but also endogenous vimentin and cytokeratin proteins. Desmin microprecipitates without vimentin or vimentin microprecipitates without desmin are not observed. The microprecipitates involving cytokeratin invariably are also positive for desmin and vimentin. Over time, the precipitates enlarge into 1 - to 2 -microns spheroids and then fuse into amorphous chimeric juxtanuclear masses that can occupy > 30 % of the cell volume. Concurrently, first the vimentin and then the cytokeratin networks are resorbed. The chimeric precipitates are not recognized or marked for degradation by the lysosomal system. Ultimately the cell nucleus fragments and the cell dies.

This work aimed to select and identify new culturable feather-degrading bacteria isolated from soils of Brazilian Amazon forest and Atlantic forest. Bacteria that were isolated from temperate soils and bacteria from Amazonian basin soil were tested for their capability to grow on feather meal agar (FMA). Proteolytic bacteria were tested for feather degradation and were further identified according to their morphological and biochemical characteristics. Also, molecular identification based on 165 rDNA gene sequencing was carried out. A total of 24 proteolytic and 20 feather-degrading isolates were selected; Most of the isolates were from the Bacillus genus (division Firmicutes), but one Aeromonas, two Serratia (gamma-Proteobacteria), and one Chryseobacterium (Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group).

40|$|Mistranslation in {{bacterial}} and mammalian cells {{leads to}} production of statistical proteins that are, in turn, associated with specific cell or <b>animal</b> <b>pathologies,</b> including death of bacterial cells, apoptosis of mammalian cells in culture, and neurodegeneration in the mouse. A {{major source of}} mistranslation comes from heritable defects in the editing activities of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These activities clear errors of aminoacylation by deacylation of mischarged tRNAs. We hypothesized that, in addition to previously reported phenotypes in bacterial and mammalian systems, errors of aminoacylation could be mutagenic and lead to disease. As {{a first step in}} testing this hypothesis, the effect of an editing defect in a single tRNA synthetase on the accumulation of mutations in aging bacteria was investigated. A striking, statistically significant, enhancement of the mutation rate in aging bacteria was found. This enhancement comes from an increase in error-prone DNA repair through induction of the bacterial SOS response. Thus, mistranslation, as caused by an editing-defective tRNA synthetase, can lead to heritable genetic changes that could, in principle, be linked to disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{superficial}} {{lymphatic system}} of the grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus is described. The description is based on dissections of 130 eastern grey kangaroos. The most significant difference found between the superficial lymphatic drainage pattern of kangaroos {{and that of the}} domestic species was the existence of large inguino-axillary lymphatic trunks in the kangaroo. Thus in the kangaroo, instead of lymph passing from the inguinal lymphocentre to the lumbar lymphatic trunks as is the situation in the domestic animals, lymph passes from the inguinal lymphocentre to the axillary lymphocentre. Apart from the lymph draining from the head and ventral neck (which passes to the superficial cervical lymphocentre) and lymph which may pass from the superficial lymphatic vessels to deeper lymphatic vessels, all the superficial lymphatic drainage of the kangaroo passes through the axillary lymphocentre. From the viewpoint of the meat inspection of the carcasses of kangaroos taken as game meat <b>animals,</b> <b>pathology</b> of the axillary lymphocentre may reflect disease in a much wider range of body regions than it would in a domestic animal...|$|R

In cardiology, owners who think that the <b>pathology</b> harms their <b>animal’s</b> quality of life decreased significantly over time.

40|$|AbstractAquaporins (AQPs) are {{ubiquitous}} membrane proteins whose identification, {{pioneered by}} Peter Agre's {{team in the}} early nineties, provided a molecular basis for transmembrane water transport, which was previously thought to occur only by free diffusion. AQPs {{are members of the}} Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) family and often referred to as water channels. In mammals and plants they are present in almost all organs and tissues and their function is mostly associated to water molecule movement. However, recent studies have pointed out a wider range of substrates for these proteins as well as complex regulation levels and pathways. Although their relative abundance in plants and mammals makes it difficult to investigate the role of a particular AQP, the use of knock-out and mutagenesis techniques is now bringing important clues regarding the direct implication of specific AQPs in <b>animal</b> <b>pathologies</b> or plant deficiencies. The present paper gives an overview about AQP structure, function and regulation in a broad range of living organisms. Emphasis will be given on plant AQPs where the high number and diversity of these transport proteins, together with some emerging aspects of their functionalities, make them behave more like multifunctional, highly adapted channels rather than simple water pores...|$|R
