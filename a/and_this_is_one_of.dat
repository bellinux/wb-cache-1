5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E
5|$|Our {{visual system}} is {{supposed}} to throw away information about the illuminant and extract information about the actual reflectance... but I've studied individual differences in colour vision for 30 years, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the biggest individual differences I've ever seen.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{germanium}} spontaneously extrudes {{very long}} screw dislocations, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the primary {{reasons for the}} failure of older diodes and transistors made from germanium; depending on what they eventually touch, they may lead to an electrical short.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the Breton {{language}} was little spoken {{in the eastern}} part of Brittany, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the first regions where the language disappeared such that Breton was not spoken for many centuries.|$|R
50|$|Carlos Lemos {{was a very}} {{prominent}} stage actor, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of his few film appearances. Aurora Bautista was by then the Spanish Queen of melodrama, while José Suárez <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the main heartthrobs of the Spanish screens.|$|R
50|$|According to Hosea Ballou, then Pierre Batiffol and George T. Knight (1914) Amalric was {{a believer}} {{that all people}} would {{eventually}} <b>be</b> saved <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the counts upon which he was declared a heretic by Pope Innocent III.|$|R
5|$|The {{hooded crow}} breeds in {{northern}} and eastern Europe, and closely allied forms inhabit southern Europe and western Asia. Where its range overlaps with carrion crow, as in northern Britain, Germany, Denmark, northern Italy, and Siberia, their hybrids are fertile. However, the hybrids are less well-adapted than purebred birds, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons this species was split from the carrion crow. Little or no interbreeding occurs in some areas, such as Iran and central Russia.|$|E
25|$|Although coram nobis is {{not usually}} {{available}} to a convict who is still serving a prison sentence, the alternative remedy of habeas corpus may be available in that case. New evidence sufficient to change the conviction’s outcome is rarely discovered after a person has completed a sentence; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the main reasons why {{there are so few}} successful petitions for the writ of coram nobis.|$|E
25|$|Condor Ridge {{displays}} endangered North American desert wildlife. The featured {{species are}} California condors (the Wild Animal Park {{was the key}} force in the recovery effort for these birds <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the only {{places in the world}} where the public can see them in captivity) and desert bighorn sheep. Other species displayed include aplomado falcons, thick-billed parrots, bald eagles, prairie dogs, black footed ferrets, magpies, ocelots, porcupines, and desert tortoises.|$|E
25|$|It {{was agreed}} at Potsdam that the leading {{members of the}} Nazi regime who had been {{captured}} should be put on trial accused of crimes against humanity, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the few points on which the four powers were able to agree.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, rural whites from Appalachia were known as hillbillies, and their music soon came to be called hillbilly music. Protestant churches like the Old Regular Baptists and Holiness Pentecostal used music in their services, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the biggest influences on hillbilly music.|$|R
50|$|Below {{the cape}} are the Caves of Hercules. These {{are open to}} the public and they are {{accessible}} from Robinson Plage. The caves have shown evidence of neolithic occupation. Before they were a tourist attraction they were brothels. Historically the rock <b>was</b> mined <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> important cause of the caves creation.|$|R
25|$|In some countries, {{immature}} nuts {{in their}} husks are preserved in vinegar. In the UK, these are called pickled walnuts <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the major uses for fresh nuts {{from the small}} scale plantings. In Armenian cuisine, unripe walnuts, including husks, are preserved in sugar syrup and eaten whole. In Italy, liqueurs called Nocino and Nocello are flavoured with walnuts, while Salsa di Noci (walnut sauce) is a pasta sauce originating from Liguria. In Georgia, walnuts are ground with other ingredients to make walnut sauce.|$|E
25|$|Unlike top-rope {{climbing}} {{where the}} climber is always supported by an anchor located above the climber, lead climbing often has scenarios where the climber will {{be attached to}} a point under him or her. In these cases, if the climber were to fall, the distance fallen would be much {{greater than that of}} top-rope <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the main reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The fall factor is the ratio of the height a climber falls and the length of rope available to absorb the fall. The higher the fall factor, the more force placed on the climber as the ropes decelerates them. The maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead climbing should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before actually lead climbing on their own.|$|E
500|$|In McKie's view, Wallace was {{a gifted}} writer with [...] "an eye for catchy observation", <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the finest of travel books.

50|$|As a rule, {{the larger}} the total sum of capital invested, the higher the return on {{investment}} will be. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow and reinvest {{at a higher rate}} of profit or interest. The inverse <b>is</b> also true, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.|$|R
50|$|APPETITE {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the fair Art Vilnius 09 http://www.artvilnius.com/en/artvilnius09/, that year Vilnius was named European Capital of Culture, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the main events organized.

50|$|As another variation, {{figure out}} every {{disaster}} that might occur due to {{failure of the}} biosphere, to lesser or greater degree, and calculate the price of insurance against all of it. The averted insurance payments are effectively a yield, <b>and,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> way to calculate the value of what Earth is doing for us, {{for as long as}} these averted failures do not occur.|$|R
500|$|In 2010 {{the church}} {{received}} on long-term loan a five-rank Tudor-style organ built by Hupalo and Repasky Pipe Organs. [...] It is a recreation {{based upon the}} work of Martin Goetze and Dominic Gwynn of Nottinghamshire, England and the finding in 1995 of {{a few pieces of}} a Tudor organ. Few English organ survives from the sixteenth century <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> only two five-rank Tudor-style organs in the world.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, captainSMRT, {{writing for}} Gamasutra, stated that DotA [...] "is likely {{the most popular}} and most-discussed free, non-supported game mod in the world". In {{pointing}} to the strong community built around the game, Walbridge stated that DotA shows it is much easier for a community game to be maintained by the community, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the maps' greatest strengths. Former game journalist Luke Smith called DotA [...] "the ultimate RTS".|$|E
500|$|Beagles are {{excellent}} with children <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the reasons they}} have become popular family pets, but they are pack animals, and are prone to separation anxiety, a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended. [...] Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as [...] "speaking", [...] "giving tongue", or [...] "opening") when they catch the scent of potential quarry. They also generally get along well with other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also {{do not need to}} be worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{musical score}} was {{composed}} by Giovanni Fusco, who had scored all of Antonioni's films {{up to that}} time. Antonioni usually only used diegetic music in his films <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the last times that he (briefly) included a musical score for scenes other than during the credits. For L'avventura, Antonioni asked Fusco to compose [...] "jazz {{as though it had}} been written in the Hellenic era." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1880, Shaykh Ubaydullah, a Kurdish leader, {{engaged in}} a series of revolts against the Iranian government. These revolts were {{successfully}} suppressed by the Qajar kings, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of Iran's few victories during the Qajar period. In the early 20th century, Ismail Agha Simko took advantage of the chaotic situation in the aftermath of World War I and rebelled against the Iranian government. He was finally defeated by Reza Shah Pahlavi.|$|R
50|$|Florø {{church is}} a big church built with a high nave. On either side wall there are five big windows with pointed gables. The chancel is {{pentagonal}} with three big windows. All the stained-glass windows are framed in lead. There <b>are</b> two vestries, <b>one</b> for the vicar and one reserved for babies to be christened. The church had an organ for the consecration ceremony in 1882, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the first organs {{in the region of}} Sunnfjord.|$|R
500|$|William Wong of Computer Shopper {{called it}} [...] "a great game that {{is backed by}} good {{graphics}} and sound, and will keep you going for hours"; he also praised its cutscenes. He concluded, [...] "If the [...] multiplayer pack {{is as good as}} the standalone version, Terra Nova could be a strike force to be reckoned with." [...] PC Gamer UKs James Flynn praised the game's graphics, sense of realism, and free-form missions; about the latter, he wrote, [...] "There's no right or wrong way to complete any of the missions in Terra Nova, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its strongest assets." [...] He noted that it was [...] "virtually impossible to recommend" [...] the game to those with lower-end computers, but he believed that it was also [...] "impossible to condemn Looking Glass for programming the game this way, because it feels so real, and its authenticity is what makes it so much fun". Daniel Jevons of Maximum approved of the graphics but disliked the focus on long-range combat {{and the use of the}} mouse to move a crosshair rather than the entire viewpoint. However, he concluded that the game [...] "has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack, the plot is strangely involving and despite the initial control difficulties, with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around the battlefields". Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine praised the game's artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality [...] "spectacular", but found its movement controls to be [...] "awkward". He concluded, [...] "Terra Nova is an exceptional game that combines frenetic, fast-paced action with real-time squad-level tactics. It doesn't get much better than this".|$|E

2500|$|There is an [...] "ulica Batuty" [...] (Batuta Street) in Warsaw; {{however, the}} {{name comes from}} the Polish word [...] "batuta", which means [...] "conductor's baton".

2500|$|The {{importance}} of these changes can be recognized by functional differences between males and females. For instance, males of most species prefer the odor and appearance of females over males, which is instrumental in stimulating male sexual behavior. [...] If the sexually dimorphic nucleus <b>is</b> lesioned, <b>this</b> preference for females by males diminishes. [...] Also, the pattern of secretion of growth hormone <b>is</b> sexually dimorphic, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> reason why in many species, adult males are much larger than females.|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} nine successful {{years with}} the 1-5, {{he was promoted to}} Captain and moved on to his next assignment, but his influence on Sipowicz continued to <b>be</b> great, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the major character-building aspects of the detective's career. When an extremely unpopular and ignorant lieutenant named Susan Dalto was transferred in as his replacement, Fancy called in one last favor for his detectives and had the boss-to-be transferred out. She was replaced by Lt. Tony Rodriguez.|$|R
50|$|As a reward, he {{was given}} 570,000 koku by Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara ended, and the Mogami fief became the fifth largest in Japan, {{excluding}} the lands held by the Tokugawa. Afterwards, Mogami Yoshiaki developed flood control of the Mogami River in his territory, which allowed for safer navigation {{of the river and}} also for irrigation to increase rice farming, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of his great successes. He also reconstructed and expanded Yamagata Castle and the surrounding castle town.|$|R

2500|$|In January, McIlroy was {{hit with}} a {{two-shot}} penalty for not taking proper and full relief after driving onto a spectator pathway in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship, his first event of the season. He was alerted to his mistake by Scottish caddie Dave Renwick after his round and, after signing for a 70 instead of a 68 to reflect the penalty, he told reporters: [...] "There are many stupid rules in golf <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them."

2500|$|Accepted on a {{national}} scale, Christianity was also successful among different social groups from the poor to the rich, peasants, traders, sailors, warriors, or courtesans. [...] Most of the daily activities of the Church were done by Japanese from the beginning, giving the Japanese Church a native face, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> {{of the reasons for}} its success.
