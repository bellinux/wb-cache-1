40|$|Two {{time domain}} methods for {{computing}} two dimensional steady-state <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances</b> propagating through internal subsonic viscous flow {{fields in the}} presence of variable area are investigated. The first method solves the Navier-Stokes equations for the combined steady and acoustic field together and subtracts the steady flow to obtain the acoustic field. The second method solves a system of perturbation equations to obtain the <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances,</b> making use of a separate steady flow computation as input to the system. In each case the periodic steady-state acoustic fluctuations are obtained numerically on a supercomputer using a second order unsplit explicit MacCormack predictor-corrector method. Results show that the first method is not very effective for computing <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances</b> of even moderate amplitude. It appears that more accurate steady flow algorithms are required for this method to succeed. On the other hand, linear and nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances</b> extracted from the perturbation approach are shown to exhibit expected behavior for the problems considered.

In order to detect such low visible targets {{it is necessary to}} explore other phenomenon that contributes to the scattering of incident electromagnetic wave. It is well known from the developments from the clear air scattering using RASS induced acoustic wave could be used to create dielectric constant fluctuation. The scattering from these fluctuations rather than from the aircraft have been observed to enhance the RCS of clear air, under the condition when the incident EM wave is half of the acoustic wave, the condition of Bragg scattering would be met and RCS would be enhanced. For detecting low visibility targets which are at significant distance away from the main radar, inducement of EM fluctuation from acoustic source collocated with the acoustic source is infeasible. However the flow past aircraft produces <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances</b> around the aircraft can be exploited to detect low visibility targets. In this paper numerical simulation for RCS enhancement due to <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances</b> is presented.

The receptivity of the boundary layer to slow <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances,</b> fast <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances,</b> and vortical disturbances is considered. The effects of three-dimensional isolated roughness on the receptivity and stability are also simulated. The results for the smooth cone show that the instability waves are generated in the leading edge region and that the boundary layer is much more receptive to slow acoustic waves than to the fast <b>acoustic</b> waves. Vortical <b>disturbances</b> also generate unstable second modes, however the receptivity coefficients are smaller {{than that of the}} slow acoustic wave. Distributed roughness elements located near the nose region decreased the receptivity of the second mode generated by the slow acoustic wave by a small amount. Roughness elements distributed across the continuous spectrum increased the receptivity of the second mode generated by the slow and fast acoustic waves and the vorticity wave. The largest increase occurred for the vorticity wave. Roughness elements distributed across the synchronization point did not change the receptivity of the second modes generated by the acoustic waves. The receptivity of the second mode generated by the vorticity wave increased in this case, but the increase is lower than that occurred with the roughness elements located across the continuous spectrum.

40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} {{response of}} a subsonic nozzle flow to small pressure and entropy disturbances is calculated. The response {{is expressed in}} terms of transmitted acoustic waves (which propagate from the nozzle {{in the same direction as}} the disturbance wave) and reflected acoustic waves (which propagate from the nozzle in the direction opposite to that of the disturbance wave) for three independent disturbances: a downstreampropagating acoustic wave impinging upon the nozzle inlet, an upstream-propagating wave impinging upon the nozzle exit, and an entropy wave convecting through the nozzle. The solution for high frequency disturbances is discussed and used with the compact (long wavelength disturbance) solution to normalize several numerical calculations. The normalization shows that the transmitted waves created by the two <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances</b> may be represented by the same function offrequency for a given inlet and exit nozzle Mach number.

The receptivity characteristics of boundary layer to freestream pulse <b>acoustic</b> <b>disturbances</b> are numerically investigated at Mach 6, {{and the frequency}} effects of freestream pulse wave on boundary layer receptivity are discussed. Results show that there are several main disturbance mode clusters in boundary layer under acoustic pulse wave, {{and the number of}} main disturbance clusters decreases along the streamwise. As disturbance wave propagates from upstream to downstream direction, the component of the modes below fundamental frequency decreases, and the component of the modes above second harmonic components increases quickly in general. There are competition and disturbance energy transfer between different boundary layer modes. The nose boundary layer is dominated by the nearby mode of fundamental frequency. The number of the main disturbance mode clusters decreases as the freestream disturbance frequency increases. The frequency range with larger growth narrows along the streamwise.
