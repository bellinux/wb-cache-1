50|$|In general, in the {{usability}} evaluation both retrospective and concurrent TAP {{could be}} used according to the aims and goals of the study. Nevertheless, when a usability evaluation is carried out with blind people several studies propose to use the retrospective TAP: indeed, using a screen reader {{and talking about the}} way of interacting with the computer implies a structural interference between action and verbalization. Undoubtedly, cognitive studies provided a lot of evidence supporting the idea that individuals can listen, verbalize, or manipulate, and rescue information in multiple task condition. As Colin Cherry showed, subjects, when listening to two different messages from a single loudspeaker, can separate sounds from background noise, recognize the gender of the speaker, the direction, and the pitch (cocktail party effect). At the same time, subjects that must verbalize the content of a message (attended message) listening to two different message simultaneously (attended and unattended message) have a reduced ability to report the content of the attended massage, while they are unable to report the content of the unattended message. Moreover, K. Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch showed that, in a multiple task condition, subjects' ability of rescuing information is not compromised by an interruption of the <b>action</b> <b>flow</b> (as it happens in the concurrent thinking aloud technique), thanks to the “Long Term Working Memory mechanism” of information retrieval (Working Memory section Ericsson and Kintsch). Even if users can listen, recognize, and verbalize multiple messages in a multiple task condition and they can stop and restart actions without losing any information, other cognitive studies underlined that the overlap of activities in a multiple task condition {{have an effect on the}} goal achievement: Kemper, Herman and Lian, analysing the users' abilities to verbalize actions in a multiple task condition, showed that the fluency of a user's conversation is influenced by the overlap of actions. Adults are likely to continue to talk as they navigate in a complex physical environment. However, the fluency of their conversation is likely to change: Older adults are likely to speak more slowly than they would if resting; Young adults continue to speak just as rapidly while walking as while resting, but they adopt a further set of speech accommodations, reducing sentence length, grammatical complexity, and propositional density. Just by reducing length, complexity, and propositional density adults free up working memory resources.We do not know how and how much the content of verbalizations could be influenced by the strategy of verbalization (i.e. the modification of fluency and the complexity in a multiple task condition). Anyway, we well know that users in the concurrent thinking aloud verbalize the problems in a more accurate and pertinent way (i.e. more focused on the problems directly perceived during the interaction) then in the retrospective one. The pertinence is granted to the user by the proximity of action-verbalization-next action; this multiple task proximity compels the subject to apply a strategy of verbalization that reduce the overload of the working memory. However, for blind users this time proximity between action and verbalization is lost: the use of the screen reader, in fact, increase the time for verbalization (i.e. in order to verbalize, blind users must first stop the reader and then restart it).|$|E

The adiabatic time-averaged Lagrangian density L is {{expressed in terms of}} the single-particle oscillation-center Hamiltonians; once those are found, the complete set of geometrical-optics equations is derived without referring to the Maxwell-Vlasov system. The number of trapped particles is assumed fixed; in particular, those may reside close {{to the bottom of the}} wave trapping potential, so they never become untrapped. Then their contributions to the wave momentum and the energy flux depend mainly on the trapped-particle density, as an independent parameter, and the phase velocity rather than on the wave amplitude a explicitly; hence, L acquires a-independent terms. Also, the wave action is generally not conserved, because it can be exchanged with resonant oscillations of the trapped-particle density. The corresponding modification of the wave envelope equation is found explicitly, and the new <b>action</b> <b>flow</b> velocity is derived.

Neither very low, nor maximum flow velocities were favourable for mussel beds. Very coarse sands or silty environments were not preferred. Sites close to the low water line showed lower mussel bed appearance; when emersion time was above 50 %, hardly any mussel beds could be found.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how to create adaptive and smooth sequences of actions and how to decide among skill options in a continuous manner without the necessity of recurrent planning. Motion generation is based on serial and parallel blending of movement primitives (MP). MPs are modeled as dynamical systems on task coordinates with attractor behavior and augmented with additional signals to ease their coordination. Sequences and transitions between skills are realized in a unified way as bifurcating dynamical systems based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks. The neural output is used as activation signal for MPs. Besides continuous feedback from the controlled MPs, the neural dynamics is influenced by a cost term from a future prediction to allow the inhibition of an <b>action</b> <b>flow</b> that is expected to fail. First results are shown in a physical simulation environment on a high-DoF robotic hand-arm system. The system is capable of creating smooth transients of MPs. Robustness to disturbances can be observed as local adaptations of individual lowlevel MPs, flexible sequencing of MPs, and global error recovery by changing the whole strategy of how to perform a movement skill.

Unfortunately, failure to effectively regulate health and safety conditions at the workplace may result in much higher accident costs.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: {{the aim was}} to {{investigate}} the effect of intermittent pneumatic foot compression (IPCfoot) on popliteal artery haemodynamics in normal individuals and in patients with intermittent claudication due to peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (Fontaine stage II). Material and methods: popliteal artery volume flow [vFl], pulsatility index [PI], mean velocity [mV], peak systolic [PSV] and end diastolic velocity [EDV], in 25 limbs of 20 normal subjects and 40 limbs of 32 stable claudicants were obtained in the sitting position before, during and within 30 seconds after the application of IPCfoot(applied pressure: 120 mmHg; inflation time: 3 seconds; deflation time: 17 seconds) using colour-flow duplex imaging (CFDI). The reproducibility of flow velocity estimations using CFDI in the horizontal [hor] (recovery) and sitting [sit] positions was evaluated in 20 limbs of normal controls and 20 limbs of claudicants. Results: popliteal artery vFl, mV, PSV and PI measurements were performed with a coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 14. 6 % among claudicants and of less than 13. 3 % in normal subjects. EDV is the least reproducible parameter with an overall CV range of 10. 2 – 21. 5 % in normal controls and 9. 1 – 18. 6 % in arteriopaths. On application of IPCfootpopliteal artery vFl increased by 111 % in the control group (p< 0. 001) and by 51 % in the claudicants (p< 0. 001). Within 30 seconds of the cessation of pump <b>action</b> <b>flow</b> decreased significantly in both groups (p< 0. 001), but maintained a significantly higher level than that at baseline (p< 0. 001, in both groups). The mV, PSV and EDV showed a similar pattern of significant changes. Both in normals and claudicants, the PI decreased with IPCfoot(p< 0. 001) and increased post-compression; however, it was significantly lower than baseline (p< 0. 005) within 30 seconds of impulse delivery. Conclusions: current CFDI technology enables a reproducible estimation of popliteal artery flow velocities. IPCfootcan significantly augment arterial calf inflow on an acute basis both in normals and claudicants. The increase of EDV and decrease of PI indicate that attenuation of peripheral resistance to flow is the main mechanism underlying the popliteal artery vFl enhancement on application of IPCfoot. Prospective trials on the long-term effect of IPCfootin the management of patients with PVD are indicated from the results of this study...|$|E

40|$|In common {{cases of}} goal {{directed}} motor behavior like grasping, pointing and throwing, humans navigate their own {{body in the}} external space to achieve desired physical effects. Hereby, the so-called internal models provide the basis of human motor control. They are based on mental representations of the movement kinematics and dynamics in a given environment, and fulfill two major functions: to translate targeted Euclidean positional codes into motor program, on the one hand, to estimate the current body state, and to predict the sensory consequence of the action by simulating the <b>action</b> <b>flow,</b> on the other. Hence, sufficient specification of the kinematic and dynamic movement parameters is essential. Context-related peculiarities need to be registered and countervailed to confer optimal motor control. The present work focuses on adaptation to sensorimotor transformations imposed by visuomotor rotations. The upcoming section gives {{a brief overview of}} the studies included in the present work. Study 1 investigates dual adaptation, i. e. concurrent adaptation to opposing visuomotor rotations. Particularly interesting was the effectiveness of different contextual cues, i. e. sensory information in the movement context differing between rotation conditions, which haven found to be crucial for dual adaptation. Consequently, visual and postural cues were compared with each other. Results were discussed in connection with previous studies indicating visual dominance in movement representation and control. In contrast to the aforementioned salient contextual cues, some sensory information in an action context could be more latent, for example, the spatial structure of a visual workspace, which has been addressed in Study 2. This study focused on a novel aspect of visuomotor adaptation, and more importantly, the subsequent generalization. It {{is based on the assumption}} that the spatial structure of the distal workspace is crucial for optimal motor learning. This approach was examined in three experiments by analyzing intra- and intermanual generalization of adaptation induced by visuomotor rotation. Rotation conditions that were concordant with the global structure of the visual workspace were found more advantageous compared to conditions discordant to the visual workspace. Results were discussed in the background of the general issue concerning the relevance of contextual similarity in motor learning. Hence, according to our approach, visuomotor rotations as well as other sensorimotor transformations are not isolated occurrences and must be understood as integrative part of the entire movement context. This approach was investigated more extensively in the study reported in Study 3. The study inspected the adaptation processes to opposing visuomotor rotations in a symmetrical workspace. Modular adaptation, use-dependent plasticity and spatial realignment theoretically were possible mechanisms to deal with the rotation scenario. Since these mechanisms lead to different predictions regarding generalization behavior, comparisons between predictions and empirical data were conducted. In spite of evidential advantages of modular structures in adaptive motor control, the current work could show a particular case of visuomotor transformation, in which modularity lacks efficiency. Empirical data indicate that the adaptive motor control employed the spatial realignment to accomplish adaptation more efficiently. Possible neurological processes underlying spatial realignment in this particular case was discussed. Generally, this work aimed to extent the previous research scope concerning sensorimotor adaptation by postulating new theoretical approaches, demonstrating related behavioral phenomena and disclosing novel topics for future works...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of the}} current work is to further understand the fundamental fluid and heat transport mechanisms in heat pipe wick materials and to thereby improve design, modeling, and performance capabilities. The investigations presented herein examine wicking properties and two-phase transport in capillary-fed porous structures. ^ Determination of porous wick properties is critical for development of heat pipe and microscale transport models. Experimental facilities are developed to measure the permeability and the capillary pressure of sintered wick materials and it is shown that analytical expressions alone cannot be relied upon for prediction of these properties. Additionally, the thermal resistance across the evaporator section of heat pipes plays a dominant role in governing overall performance. To quantify this resistance for common sintered copper powder wick surfaces, a novel test facility is developed which feeds fluid to the wick by capillary <b>action.</b> <b>Flow</b> visualization of the wick surfaces during evaporation and boiling allows the thermal performance to be correlated with the observed regimes. A significant reduction in the evaporator thermal resistance is observed corresponding to a transition from evaporation to boiling. ^ In order to extend heat pipe performance beyond state of the art, capillary-fed carbon nanotube (CNT) boiling surfaces are investigated. The wicking properties of CNT-based structures are not well understood; {{in order to be}} incorporated into heat pipe devices, their wetting properties, specifically with water, must be investigated. The effects of a novel copper functionalization technique on CNT wicking ability are studied and shown to decrease the wetting contact angle with water. Given these results, evaporators composed entirely of copper functionalized CNTs are evaluated. While these CNT evaporators are able to support high heat fluxes, the central portion of the CNT nanowick area may dry out due to the density of the array. A numerical model is developed and demonstrates that evaporator surfaces composed of nanostructured wicks fed by interspersed conventional wick materials can provide the required permeability for fluid flow while simultaneously decreasing the evaporator thermal resistance. Wicks of this type are fabricated and tested in the capillary-fed boiling facility to quantify the effects of patterning and CNT-coating of a sintered powder wick. The measured thermal performance enhancement is explained in terms of the observed vapor formation characteristics. ^ Identification of operating regimes and critical transitions along the boiling curve provides the first step toward developing performance prediction tools. The current research addresses all the relevant regimes by exploring empirical prediction of the evaporation regime performance, incipience superheat, boiling performance, and dryout heat flux. A detailed investigation is performed to quantify and predict the incipience superheat in nanostructured and bare sintered powder wicks. Also, available predictive methods for the surface superheat under evaporation and capillary-fed boiling are reviewed and compared to the current results. Lastly, the dryout heat flux, and its dependence on the heat input area, is identified for thin sintered powder wicks. ^ Plans for future work are outlined based on the current findings. The next required step is to develop generalized, analytical models {{that can be used to}} match the experimental predictions of performance and critical regime transitions in porous structures developed in this work and by others. The ultimate engineering objective is to develop a unified model for each of these regimes that is applicable over a wide range of operating parameters. ...|$|E
