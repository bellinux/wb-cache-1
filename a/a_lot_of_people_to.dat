500|$|Cox {{left his}} job as an {{insurance}} agent {{to work as a}} mortgage broker for a local company. While there he developed a reputation for unscrupulousness, which was heightened by his authorship of an unpublished 317-page manuscript entitled The Associates. The novel's protagonist, who shares many traits in common with Cox, travels the country committing mortgage fraud. Cox told co-workers about the book, and elaborated its details to them. [...] "He sent it to <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> see if they thought it worked" [...] said a former co-worker. After being fired from the company when he was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2002, Cox faked a good credit history, and used that to buy dozens of homes and properties. In one instance he used the social security number of a toddler, and all of his documents—references, bank letters, rent receipts, W-2s from nonexistent employees—were counterfeit. He used his skills as an artist to decorate the properties with elaborate art deco-style murals. Several of his future girlfriends said that his painting talents were part of his allure, though the St. Petersburg Times described his works as copies of murals by Tamara de Lempicka. Cox charmed Alison Arnold, a young local married woman, into believing he could give her a wealthy and luxurious life. While courting Arnold she said he took her to crime films such as The Italian Job and Catch Me if You Can—which he reportedly adored and watched several times—and detailed his criminal plans to her.|$|E
500|$|Michael Billington {{was charged}} in a Roanoke court with having knowingly {{solicited}} 131 loans {{that would never}} be repaid from 85 people, totaling $1.24million. Represented by a court-appointed lawyer, he rejected a plea bargain that would have limited his prison sentence to the three years he had already served in the federal case. The lawyer, Brian Gettings, doubted Billington's competence and told the court that he believed LaRouche was making the decisions in the case rather than his client. The court ordered two psychiatric tests. The first physician deemed him competent. Billington refused to cooperate with a second examination {{that was to be}} conducted by an expert on cults. Billington sought to fire Gettings, who had already tried to quit over competency question, but the judge refused to permit Billington to substitute a different attorney. A LaRouche spokesman said that Billington was prepared for trial. [...] Billington was convicted on nine counts of [...] "conspiracy to fail to register as a securities broker". Under Virginia's court system, the jury determines prison terms although a judge may override the jury's recommendation. The jury in this case recommended 77 years (out of a possible 90); the judge refused to lower it because Billington continued to insist upon his innocence (which the judge deemed lack of remorse) and because he had warned that he would accept the jury recommendation if Billington requested a jury trial. Billington served a total of ten years in prison before being released on parole. The lead prosecutor said the case involved [...] "willful and massive fraud that has caused <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> suffer".|$|E
500|$|Coe's {{interpretation}} {{was repeated}} by other scholars {{through the early}} 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while {{the end of the}} 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. [...] "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," [...] said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. [...] "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention." [...] In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya [...] "did not conceive this {{to be the end of}} creation, as many have suggested." [...] Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, [...] "We have no record or knowledge that [...] would think the world would come to an end" [...] in 2012. Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, [...] "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," [...] and, [...] "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> cash in." [...] "There will be another cycle," [...] said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. [...] "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this." [...] Commenting on the new calendar found at Xultún, one archaeologist said [...] "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{favourite}} red willow {{was also}} the chosen haunt of another being, a peregrine falcon, a large handsome female that used to spend some months each year with us, and would sit for hours {{every day in the}} tree. It was an ideal tree for the falcon, too, not only because it was a quiet spot where it could doze the hot hours away in safety, but also on account of the numbers of pigeons we used to keep. The pigeon- house, a round, tower-shaped building, whitewashed outside, with a small door always kept locked, was usually tenanted by four or five hundred birds. These cost us nothing to keep, and were never fed, as they picked up their own living on the plain, and being strong fliers and well used to the dangers of the open country abounding in hawks, they ranged far from home, going out in small parties of a dozen or more to their various distant feeding-grounds. When out riding we used to come on these flocks several miles from home, and knew they were our birds since no one else in that neighbourhood kept pigeons. They were highly valued, especially by my father, who preferred a broiled pigeon to mutton cutlets for breakfast, and was also fond of pigeon- pies. Once or twice every week, according to the season, eighteen or twenty young birds, just ready to leave the nest, were taken from the dovecote to be put into a pie of gigantic size, and this was usually the grandest dish on the table when we had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> dinner or supper.|$|E
