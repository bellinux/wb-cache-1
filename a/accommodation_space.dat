5|$|By 1914, Hydra and Psara {{had been}} reduced to {{secondary}} duties: Hydra became a gunnery training ship while Psara was used to train engine-room personnel. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war {{on the side of the}} Triple Entente and the Hydra-class ships served as coastal defense. They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as naval training facilities and <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> for a decade. All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In March 1921, on the {{creation}} of the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, Philomel was recommissioned as a training base. She steamed from her berth at Wellington to the dockyard at the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland. Moored alongside the training jetty, she was operated as a training facility for new recruits to the naval service, under the command of a series of officers from the Royal Navy including, for nearly six months in 1923, Commander Augustus Agar VC. Training armament was installed and in 1925, her boilers and engines were removed to create more <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> Further accommodation, in the form of wooden cabins, was later constructed on her deck. In October 1941, on {{the creation}} of the Royal New Zealand Navy, Philomel was recommissioned as the training base HMNZS Philomel.|$|E
25|$|Places where {{large-scale}} sedimentation {{takes place}} are called sedimentary basins. The amount of sediment {{that can be}} deposited in a basin depends on {{the depth of the}} basin, the so-called <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> The depth, shape and size of a basin depend on tectonics, movements within the Earth's lithosphere. Where the lithosphere moves upward (tectonic uplift), land eventually rises above sea level, so that and erosion removes material, and the area becomes a source for new sediment. Where the lithosphere moves downward (tectonic subsidence), a basin forms and sedimentation can take place. When the lithosphere keeps subsiding, new <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> keeps being created.|$|E
50|$|The alarm {{shall be}} audible in all <b>accommodation</b> <b>spaces,</b> all normal working {{spaces of the}} crew and on all open decks, and its sound {{pressure}} level shall be at least 75 dB(A) or 10 dB(A) above the ambient noise level (see LSA-Code App.7.2 and IMO Alarm Code, No. 4.11). The <b>accommodation</b> <b>spaces</b> also include the cabins and living areas {{as well as the}} public spaces of the passengers.|$|R

25|$|The general {{arrangements}} of Yulius Fuchik were largely {{dictated by the}} cargo handling system. The superstructure, spanning across the weather deck, housed {{only part of the}} ship's <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> The entire crew of 50 was housed in single cabins, most of them located within the narrow side compartments {{on both sides of the}} cargo decks. In addition to normal messes and saloons, the amenities of the ship also included sports and hobby rooms, library, sauna, photographic laboratory and even a swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|Relatively {{small changes}} in the {{orientation}} of the Earth's axis or length of the seasons can be a major influence on the Earth's climate. An example are the ice ages of the past 2.6 million years (the Quaternary period), which are assumed to have been caused by astronomic cycles. Climate change can influence the global sea level (and thus the amount of <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> in sedimentary basins) and sediment supply from a certain region. Eventually, {{small changes in}} astronomic parameters can cause large changes in sedimentary environment and sedimentation.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. Faulting and other deformational processes {{result in the}} creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighters}} {{were capable}} of carrying up to 1,204 tons of oil fuel, which was transferred to other vessels using four pumps. The lighters were also fitted with <b>accommodation</b> <b>spaces</b> and a galley on their upper deck, and carried a 15 ft dinghy.|$|R

25|$|The {{efficiency}} of Holt's package of boiler pressure, compound engine and hull design gave {{a ship that}} could steam at 10 knots on 20 long tons of coal a day. This fuel consumption was a saving from between 23 and 14 long tons a day, compared to other contemporary steamers. Not only did less coal need to be carried to travel a given distance, but fewer firemen were needed to fuel the boilers, so crew costs and their <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> were reduced. Agamemnon was able to sail from London to China with a coaling stop at Mauritius on the outward and return journey, with a time on passage substantially less than the competing sailing vessels. Holt had already ordered two sister ships to Agamemnon {{by the time she}} had returned from her first trip to China in 1866, operating these ships in the newly formed Blue Funnel Line. His competitors rapidly copied his ideas for their own new ships.|$|E
25|$|Crustal {{extension}} {{controls the}} tectonic <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> available for sediments in rift settings {{and may be}} defined by the structural and depositional geometry of sedimentary successions observed on seismic data {{and the rate of}} subsidence through time as represented by the accommodation of sediment. The characteristic features of each are dependent on three variables: the time taken for deposition; the interplay between tectonics and eustasy and the lithology (thus facies) of the succession observed. The Sherwood Sandstone Group has been considered to represent a syn-rift phase of fluvial deposition throughout Europe, with the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group interpreted as the succeeding phase of deposition in an evaporitic seaway during post-rift thermal subsidence. More recently, however, there has been the recognition that it is the Mercia Mudstone Group which is seen to thicken markedly into faults imaged on seismic data rather than the Sherwood Sandstone Group. This work demonstrates the Mercia Mudstone Group to be a syn-rift phase of deposition, with the fine grained nature of the sedimentary record at this time controlled by the prevailing arid climate. Such conditions were not conducive to the large-scale and rapid movement of sediments from the hinterlands raised by relative footwall uplift, thus the sediments are fine grained. The minor thickening of the Sherwood Sandstone Group into faults is interpreted to be a combination of minor extension in the early Triassic superimposed on thermal subsidence inherited from the important regional phase of extension in the early Permian. Analysis of the timing of fault growth indicates a larger proportion of fault-controlled, synsedimentary movement occurred during the mid-to-late Triassic (Mercia Mudstones) rather than the early Triassic (Sherwood).|$|E
500|$|In 1936–1937, Vindictive was demilitarised in {{accordance}} with the terms of the London Naval Treaty and converted to a training ship for cadets. Her two inboard propellers were removed as were the inboard turbines; half of her boilers were removed and their compartments were converted into accommodations. The aft funnel was removed, the aft superstructure remodelled and enlarged and her hangar converted into more <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> Her armament, including the above-water torpedo tubes, was replaced by a pair of [...] guns forward and a quadruple QF 2-pounder ("pom-pom") AA mount aft.

50|$|The {{park has}} {{a total of}} 150 <b>accommodation</b> <b>spaces</b> that will {{eventually}} rise to 400. The <b>accommodation</b> <b>spaces</b> are divided depending on military rank. The soldiers are bunked in bunkers, tank guns and TAB shells. The officers have 40 separate rooms located on the main alley. The colonels have separate apartments located in duplex villas named after four famous colonels: Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, T. E. Lawrence and William P. Sanders. The generals are accommodated in large villas named after three famous generals: Douglas MacArthur, Julius Caesar and Eremia Grigorescu. The park is developed like an open-air museum {{with a number of}} 70 exhibits which include cannons, armoured personnel carriers, rocket launchers, military gun trucks and the most important piece an IAR-93 twin-engine, subsonic, close support, ground attack and tactical reconnaissance aircraft with secondary capability as low level interceptor.|$|R
50|$|The adding {{of weight}} by {{sedimentation}} from erosion or orogenic processes, or loading, causes crustal depression and subsidence. Sediments accumulate {{at the lowest}} elevation possible, in <b>accommodation</b> <b>spaces.</b> The rate and magnitude of sedimentation controls {{the rate at which}} subsidence occurs. By contrast, in orogenic processes, mountain building creates a large load on the Earth's crust, causing flexural depressions in adjacent lithospheric crust.|$|R
500|$|Glory was recommissioned on 1 August 1916 {{to serve}} as the {{flagship}} for Rear-Admiral Thomas Kemp, British North Russia Squadron, along with the protected cruiser [...] and six minesweepers. She had some of her guns removed to increase <b>accommodation</b> <b>space</b> for more Royal Marines. In this duty, she was based at Archangel to protect supplies that arrived there for the Russian Army. The squadron's mission evolved after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 into preventing the supplies that had been delivered from falling {{into the hands of the}} Red Army. Nevertheless, Kemp maintained good relations with the local communist leadership; on 6 March 1918, Kemp reached an agreement with the authorities in Murmansk to send ashore a party of 130 marines from Glory to help defend the city from a feared invasion by neighboring Finland. She sent further men to reinforce the marines, along with Lewis guns and a 12-pounder gun, the latter from the armoured cruiser [...] Finnish forces attempted to seize nearby Pechenga as a first step toward advancing on Murmansk, but the attack broke down after Cochrane contributed marines and gunfire support to its defence. Finnish forces no longer threatened Murmansk.|$|E
2500|$|Gladstone {{paid off}} from {{military}} service on 16 July 1956, having sailed [...] since commissioning. The ship {{was sold to}} the Port Phillip Sea Pilots Association {{for use as a}} relief and accommodation ship. In this role, she was renamed Akuna (sometimes referred to as Akuna II, as the association had previously operated the former [...] under this name from 1925 to 1957) and registered with Melbourne as her home port. Each of the over 40 maritime pilots in the association owned shares in the vessel, and they took weekly turns as Master and Pilot in Charge. A raised poop deck was installed to add <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> Akuna began operations in mid-1958. By the 1970s, the Port Phillip Sea Pilots Association had made the decision to use high-powered launches and Akuna was no longer needed.|$|E

50|$|Tectonic {{subsidence}} is {{the sinking}} of the Earth's crust on a large scale, relative to crustal-scale features or the geoid. The movement of crustal plates and <b>accommodation</b> <b>spaces</b> created by faulting create subsidence on a large scale in a variety of environments, including passive margins, aulacogens, fore-arc basins, foreland basins, intercontinental basins and pull-apart basins. Three mechanisms are common in the tectonic environments in which subsidence occurs: extension, cooling and loading.|$|R

50|$|Successful rifting {{creates a}} {{spreading}} center like a mid-ocean ridge, which moves progressively further from coastlines as oceanic lithosphere is produced. Due to this initial phase of rifting, the crust in a passive margin is thinner than adjacent crust and subsides {{to create an}} <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> Accumulation of non-marine sediment forms alluvial fans in the <b>accommodation</b> <b>space.</b> As rifting proceeds, listric fault systems form and further subsidence occurs, resulting {{in the creation of}} an ocean basin. After the cessation of rifting, cooling causes the crust to further subside, and loading with sediment will cause further tectonic subsidence.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{mechanism}} for sedimentation was originally subsidence creating <b>accommodation</b> (<b>space</b> for sediments to accumulate), followed by fault extension and more recently, sediment loading, i.e. the basin continuing to subside {{because of the}} weight of sediments within it.|$|E
