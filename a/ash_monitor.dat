This technique of analyzing unburned carbon in fly ash could be a less tedious and time consuming method as compared to the traditional LOI manual procedure. Phase 1 of the research focused on off-line single-frequency thermal-acoustic measurements where an off-line fly <b>ash</b> <b>monitor</b> was constructed that could operate as analytical tool to explore instrument and methodology parameters for quantifying the microwave-excited thermal-acoustic effect of carbon in fly ash, and it was determined that the off-line thermal-acoustic technique could predict the carbon content of a random collection of fly ashes with a linear correlation constant of R{sup 2 } = 0. 778. Much higher correlations are expected for fly ashes generated from a single boiler. Phase 2 of the research developing a methodology to generate microwave spectra of various powders, including fly ash, coal, and inorganic minerals, and to determine if these microwave spectra could be used for chemical analyses. Although different minerals produced different responses, higher resolution microwave spectra would be required to be able to distinguish among minerals.

40|$|International audienceMt Merapi (Central Java, Indonesia) is a {{very active}} andesitic volcano, with {{recurrent}} eruptions every 4 to 6 years, which threatens a highly populated area including the large city of Yogyakarta. Its last eruption in October- November 2010 represents the largest crisis of Merapi over the past century, with an exceptionally high level of released seismic energy, erupted magma volume and emitted sulphur dioxide. Very harsh environmental conditions were met to remotely monitor the degassing of Merapi during the crisis, with frequent strong rainfalls and a high humidity at low altitude accompanying {{the start of the}} rainy season, a high content of ash both in the plume but also scattered in the atmosphere around the volcano, and a large evacuated area (20 km radius after 4 Nov) of forbidden access.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{the similar}} {{spectral}} signatures of ash and desert dust, relatively {{little has been}} done to explore the application of dust detection techniques to the problem of volcanic ash detection. The Saharan dust index (SDI) is routinely implemented for dust monitoring at some centres and could be utilised for volcanic ash detection with little computational expense, thereby providing a product that forecasters already have some familiarity with to complement the suite of existing ash detection tools. We illustrate one way in which the index could be implemented for the purpose of ash detection by applying it to three scenes containing volcanic ash from the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, Iceland and the 2011 eruption of Puyehue, Chile. It was also applied to an image acquired over Etna in January 2011, where a volcanic plume is clearly visible but is unlikely to contain any ash. These examples demonstrate the potential of the SDI as a tool for <b>ash</b> <b>monitoring</b> under different environmental and atmospheric conditions. In addition to presenting a valuable qualitative product to aid monitoring, this work includes a quantitative assessment of the detection skill using a manually constructed expert ash mask. The optimum implementation of any technique is likely to be dependent on both atmospheric conditions and on the properties of the imaged ash (which is often unknown in a real-time situation). Here we take advantage of access to a ‘truth’ rarely available in a real-time situation and calculate an ash mask based on the optimum threshold for the specific scene, which is then used to demonstrate the potential of the SDI. The SDI mask is compared to masks calculated from a simplistic implementation of the more traditional split window method, again exploiting our access to the ‘truth’ to set the most appropriate threshold for each scene, and to a probabilistic method that is implemented without reference to the ‘truth’ and which provides useful insights into the likely cloud-/ash-contamination of each pixel. Since the sensitivity of the SDI and split window methods to the tailored thresholds was not tested (such tailoring is unlikely to be possible in a real situation), this study presents the maximum anticipated skill for the SDI {{in the context of the}} maximum skill anticipated for the split window method, although both are likely to be lower in a real-time situation. The results for the SDI are comparable to those of the other methods, with a true skill score of 80. 02 % for the Eyjafjallajökull night-time scene (compared to 88. 81 % and 46. 63 % for the split window and probabilistic method respectively) and 90. 06 % for the Eyjafjallajökull day-time scene (compared to 97. 61 % and 56. 96 %). For the Puyehue image, the SDI resulted in a true skill score of 74. 85 %, while the split window approach achieved 99. 62 %. These results imply that the SDI, which is already implemented operationally at some centres for dust detection, could be a useful complement to existing <b>ash</b> <b>monitoring</b> techniques...|$|R

Appenidx: A successful Falcon measurement flight was performed on 19 April 2010 for probing plumes over Germany from the Iceland Eyjafjoll volcano eruption. Layers of volcanic ash were detected by Lidar and probed in-situ with aerosol instruments. Under suitable viewing conditions, the ash layer was visible as a brownish layer to the observer. The horizontal and vertical distributions of the volcano layers were variable. In the plume layers particles larger than 3 μm were detected at concentrations, not present in the free troposphere during unpolluted conditions. The concentrations of large particles measured in the volcano layers are comparable to concentrations measured typically in Saharan dust plumes but smaller compared to particle concentrations in the polluted boundary layer.

Routine monitoring carried out by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione di Catania, for surveillance purposes permits following the evolution of volcanic events. In this paper, a description of the <b>ash</b> <b>monitoring</b> system as occurred during the August-December 2006 summit eruption at the Southeast Crater (SEC) is shown. This eruption was characterized by lava flow effusions and vigorous Strombolian activity. Eighteen paroxysmal episodes occurred up to the end of November, forming weak ash plumes accompanied by moderate tephra fallout over Etna’s slopes. During these events, we applied a multidisciplinary approach to promptly monitor the paroxysmal activity and the associated tephra fallout, through analysis from seismic tremor and observation from live-cameras, sampling operations, mapping and analysis of the deposit. During the most significant episodes, we carried out textural and grain-size analysis on tephra samples and evaluated the whole grain-size deposit and the erupted volume, while numerical simulations of tephra dispersal allowed better understanding eruptive dynamics. An example of this methodology is applied to the 16 November episode, during which seismic tremor furnished important constraints on the chronology. This paroxysmal eruption produced light fallout on the north-east sector of the volcano for about ten hours and a number of debris-avalanches over the slopes of the SEC cone. The erupted deposit was composed for the most part of lithic components and characterized by a whole grain-size distribution centered on 2. 2 , while its total mass was evaluated 7 x 106 kg. On the whole, such integrated studies help to obtain information on magma fragmentation and eruptive mechanisms, to characterize the explosive styles shown by Etna and finally, to better approach the monitoring of imminent eruptions...|$|R

Whereas the ash was significantly contaminated with PAHs, the levels of PAHs in the underlying burnt soil were similar to those of the control soil.

Instead, significant amounts of PAHs in the ash bed were likely removed by surface runoff. Light PAHs were dominantly emitted from the forest fire, but they showed higher decreasing rates with total precipitation.

We performed simulations of airflow trajectories to explain the arrival of the air masses containing volcanic ash to Slovenia...|$|R
40|$|Thermogravimetric {{analysis}} (TGA) of {{coal and}} resid liquids and coal and resid solid residues, produced in coal liquefaction and coal- derived resid hydroprocessing in SCTBR (short contact time batch reactor), provides a sensitive, rapid, reproducible means of studying kinetics and mechanisms of fossil fuel conversion processes. SimDis TGA and custom built TGA system for distillation provide unique means to characterize liquid fuels for boiling point distribution. TGA provides information about various weight loss processes {{that can be}} a reflection of physical and chemical structure of fossil fuel samples. This technique can also yield TG scanning parameters, such as volatile matter, fixed carbon, <b>ash,</b> etc., for <b>monitoring</b> the conversion processes. One example is onset and rate of retrograde reactions during coal liquefaction...|$|R
40|$|Performances of the {{recently}} proposed RAT (Robust AVHRR Techniques) approach in detecting and <b>monitoring</b> eruptive <b>ash</b> clouds by satellite have been assessed. The Mt. Etna (Sicily, Italy) eruption of 2002, producing intense ash emissions {{has been used as}} a study case. Potentialities and limitations of two different RAT configuration schemes (i. e. two and three channel based) have been investigated, both in terms of reliability (i. e. accurate detection) and sensitivity (detailed ash cloud properties description) and tested for several days after the eruption onset, also in different observational conditions. The main outcomes of this assessment study are: i) the more complete, three-channel scheme seems to offer accurate ash detection and discrimination from meteorological clouds with a high level of reliability, better than traditional satellite schemes; ii) on the other hand, the simplified RAT configuration performs well in <b>ash</b> cloud <b>monitoring</b> and tracking, providing a better description of cloud characteristics and properties (e. g. size, shape, direction, etc.). Consequently, a specific protocol has been suggested and experimented, with both the two configuration schemes applied in cascade; it provides a first, accurate and reliable ash detection and discrimination and, afterwards, a more detailed description of the previously identified eruptive cloud, also in terms of its internal structure and density. Preliminary, qualitative validations of the derived ash cloud ‘structure’, performed by comparison with some independent satellite observations, have also been briefly presented...|$|R
40|$|Past {{land use}} change has {{converted}} vast areas of Northern peatland by drainage to agricultural or forested land. This change often reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) sink strength of peatlands or turns them even from sinks to sources, which affects the global climate. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for suitable mitigation options for GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Addition of wood ash to peatland forests has been suggested as such a measure, but the overall effect on the global warming potential (GWP) of these ecosystems is still unclear. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we investigated three drained peatland forests in Sweden that had been fertilized with wood <b>ash</b> and <b>monitored</b> stand growth as well as the GHG emissions from soil, i. e. net effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Our results show that over the first five to eight years after wood ash application, tree growth was enhanced at all sites. This was accompanied by generally little changes in the GHG emissions. Overall, we found that wood ash application reduced the GWP of drained peatland forests. Even though that our study was limited to eight years after wood ash application, we can conclude that in the short term wood ash application may be a suitable mitigation option for GHG emissions from Northern drained peatland forests...|$|R
40|$|The Eyjafjallajökull eruption, which {{occurred}} during May 2010, {{is used as}} a case study to evaluate the consistency of the detection and characterization of volcanic ash plumes from different thermal infrared instruments. In this study, the well-known split window technique is used to retrieve the optical thickness and the effective particle size, and to estimate the mass concentration of volcanic particles from brightness temperatures measured in the infrared atmospheric window (8 – 12 μm). Retrievals are obtained for several mineral compositions whose optical properties are computed using Mie theory accounting for spectral variations of the refractive index. The impacts of errors in atmospheric parameters on the a posteriori uncertainties have been analysed. This analysis confirmed that major sources of errors are the layer altitude, the particle composition and, most of all, the size distribution for which uncertainties in retrievals can reach 50 % in mass loading estimates. This retrieval algorithm is then applied to measurements acquired near-simultaneously from MODIS, SEVIRI and IASI space-borne instruments, using two channels around 11 μm and 12 μm. The retrievals are in close agreement when taking into account the different spatial and spectral configurations, and deviations between retrievals remain less than the uncertainties due to errors in atmospheric parameters. This analysis demonstrates the robustness of the retrieval method and the consistency of observations from these instruments for volcanic <b>ash</b> plume <b>monitoring...</b>|$|R
