25|$|In 2011, it was {{reported}} that none of Pennsylvania's 22 <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> had been inspected by the government for more than 15 years.

The District Court, after a three-day bench trial, held that all the provisions were unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them.|$|E

25|$|When {{surveyed}} in 1999 on his political positions by Project Vote Smart, Griffith {{indicated that he}} supports legalized abortion in the first trimester and {{to save the life}} of the mother, while favoring the restriction of abortion through parental notification laws and prohibition of partial-birth abortion. Griffith's voting record has generally been consistent with his 1999 survey, voting in favor of restrictions on late term abortions such as parental-notification and parental-consent, while voting against bills that would restrict first-term abortions. In 2010 Griffith voted to restrict state funding of abortions, and to require <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> to meet the same licensing requirements as surgical centers. In 2006 Griffith voted to restrict state funding for fetal stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|Mifepristone {{was banned}} in Australia in 1996. In late 2005, a private member's bill was {{introduced}} to the Australian Senate to lift the ban and transfer the power of approval to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The move caused much debate in the Australian media and amongst politicians. The bill passed the Senate on 10 February 2006, and mifepristone is now legal in Australia. It is provided regularly at several specialized <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> per state. Mifepristone 200mg tablets have marketing authorizations in Australia from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TPA) for early first trimester medical abortion when followed by the prostaglandin analog misoprostol through 63 days gestational age and second trimester medical abortion when followed by a prostaglandin analog.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, {{discussing}} abortion in any way, including {{the provision of}} impartial information, was disallowed, and any publication providing information on the medical treatment would be confiscated. In the 1980s, the Irish Family Planning Association and the Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin students' unions were successfully sued by the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children for publishing telephone numbers for <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> in the United Kingdom. On one occasion British newspaper The Guardian was withdrawn by its Irish distributors for a day to preempt a threatened ban due to the inclusion of an advertisement for a UK abortion clinic in that day's issue (despite the advert having appeared {{on a number of}} prior occasions without incident).|$|E

25|$|While still a Democrat, {{she and her}} then-fiancé Marcus were {{inspired}} to join the pro-life movement by Francis Schaeffer's 1976 Christian documentary film How Should We Then Live? They prayed outside of clinics and engaged in sidewalk counseling, a pro-life protest activity in which activists approach people entering <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> {{in an attempt to}} dissuade women from obtaining abortions. Since then, Bachmann has made statements supportive of sidewalk counseling. Bachmann was a supporter of Jimmy Carter in 1976, and she and her husband worked on his campaign. During Carter's presidency, Bachmann became disappointed with his liberal approach to public policy, support for legalized abortion and economic decisions she held responsible for increased gas prices. In the 1980 presidential election, she voted for Ronald Reagan and worked for his campaign.|$|E
25|$|The National Organization for Women ("NOW") as {{plaintiff}} {{filed the}} suit {{as a civil}} class-action in 1986 in federal district court on behalf of women seeking abortions and on behalf of various <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> and providers. Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and injunctions under the RICO, Hobbs, and the Travel Acts, alleging that the defendants against whom the suit was filed are racketeering organizations engaging in a conspiracy to prevent {{access to health care}} facilities providing abortion services. The suit's named defendants were Joseph Scheidler and other pro-life/anti-abortion protesters and organizations who were members of the Pro-Life Action League (PLAL), and specifically the Oklahoma Pro-Life Action Network (PLAN). The underlying issues in the case concerning access to abortion and the coercive and violent tactics used by some to prevent such access formed a central rallying point for both sides of the national abortion debate.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Representative Callegari {{supported}} {{the ban on}} abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a move which opponents said {{could lead to the}} closure of many <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> in the state. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor against the Republican Greg Abbott. In 2011, Callegari did not vote on two other anti-abortion measures. One forbids state funding of agencies which perform abortions. The other requires that a woman undergo a sonogram before procuring an abortion. This legislation is based on the view that a woman could change her mind about an abortion once she witnesses the development of the unborn child through the latest technology. The Texas Right to Life Committee, according to Project Vote Smart, rated Callegari 41 percent favorable in 2013, 72 percent in 2011, and 100 percent in 2005. The National Abortion Rights Action League rated him 9 percent in 2005.|$|E

[...] John Kindley, {{one of the lawyers}} representing Kjolsrud stated: [...] "I think most citizens, whether they are pro-choice or anti-abortion, believe in an individual's right to self-determination. They believe people shouldn't be misled and should be told about [...] risks, even if there is controversy over those risks."

She further explains that the Bounty Hunter can only be killed by piercing {{the base of his}} neck, and that his toxic alien blood is deadly to humans. Finally, Samantha reveals that the clones are the progeny of two original aliens, and worked at <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> to gain access to fetal tissue. Their objective was to set up an extraterrestrial colony on Earth, an effort that has gone {{as far back as the}} 1940s. However, because the clones' experiments were considered to have tainted their alien race, the Bounty Hunter was sent to kill them.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Yeomans championed a {{municipal}} by-law to restrict <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics,</b> strip clubs, erotica shops, and tanning studios {{to a remote}} corner of the city.

Several feminist groups criticized the by-law for placing access to abortion {{on the same level}} as the purchasing of pornography. Yeomans responded that the legislation was not intended to pass any judgement on the subject of abortion, but rather to ensure that any confrontations or disruptions near <b>abortion</b> <b>clinics</b> would be kept away from residential areas. The by-laws were approved by Dorval city council in January 1985 and came into effect two months later.|$|E
