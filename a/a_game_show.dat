5|$|In the United States, <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>show</b> {{is a type}} of radio, television, or {{internet}} {{program in}} which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering trivia questions and/or solving puzzles, usually for money and/or prizes. Game shows are usually distinguishable from reality television competition shows, in which the competition consumes an entire season of episodes; in <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>show,</b> prizes can typically be won in a single match (in some cases, particularly in the ones that offer record-setting prizes, contestants can play multiple matches and accumulate a larger total).|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was {{approached}} by production and consulting groups {{with the idea of}} doing <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>show</b> for children, a first for the network.

Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986.|$|E
