5|$|Some <b>angler</b> <b>fish</b> of {{the deep}} sea, where it is too dark to hunt by sight, contain {{symbiotic}} bacteria in the 'bait' on their 'fishing rods'. These emit light to attract prey.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and <b>angler</b> <b>fish</b> are detailed, {{as is his}} writing on cephalopods including the octopus, cuttlefish and the paper nautilus. His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays {{were part of the}} group he called Selachē (roughly, the modern zoologist's selachians).|$|E
5|$|Just as predators such as <b>angler</b> <b>fish</b> have a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the parasite gets eaten by the host. This deception provides the parasite easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. Researchers {{may be able to}} predict the host of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Gaga in a similar choreography at the thirty-fifth season of NBC's late night comedy show Saturday Night Live. It was also present on the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. She wore multiple donned braided extensions and was perched atop a railing. From each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical <b>Angler</b> <b>fish.</b> Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E
25|$|The British {{record for}} the largest shore-caught <b>angler</b> <b>fish</b> (Lophius piscatorius) is from Canvey Island, caught by H.Legerton in 1967. During 1953 and 1954 two unusual fish were washed up the {{shoreline}} and are known as Canvey Island Monster.|$|E
25|$|Typically, predators {{attempt to}} reduce {{communication}} to prey as this will generally reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} hunting. However, some forms of predator to prey communication occur in ways that change the behaviour of the prey and make their capture easier, i.e. deception by the predator. A well-known example is the <b>angler</b> <b>fish,</b> an ambush predator which waits for its prey to come to it. It has a fleshy bioluminescent growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws. Smaller fish attempt to take the lure, placing themselves in a better position for the <b>angler</b> <b>fish</b> to catch them. Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders (Myrmarachne). These spiders are commonly referred to as “antmimicking spiders” {{because of the way they}} wave their front legs in the air to simulate antennae.|$|E

500|$|The third segment {{begins with}} Gaga {{returning}} {{on the stage}} and singing [...] "Monster", inside a forest with black, thorn-like trees. Her dancers conglomerate around her near the end and Gaga reveals herself to be covered with blood. She then states that the thing she hates more than money is the truth and performs [...] "Teeth", while introducing her band. Gaga and her friends then find the Eternal Fountain, which pours out red colored liquid and Gaga explains that it bleeds for anyone. She starts singing [...] "Alejandro" [...] while jumping into the fountain and singing, as blood pours over her. Gaga then returns and sings [...] "Poker Face" [...] on the cat-walk. After the performance, she and her friends find themselves in a dark place, and after some dialogue, Gaga's friends run off, leaving her alone to deal with the Fame Monster, a giant <b>angler</b> <b>fish.</b> Gaga starts singing [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and eventually kills the Fame Monster by shooting sparks from her pyrotechnic bra and underwear. She then leaves for the Monster Ball and after appearing there, meanwhile fans assume the show is over, suddenly Gaga appears on stage and [...] performs the final song, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] while standing inside a giant gyroscope.|$|E
2500|$|Bioluminescent communication: Communication by the {{production}} of light occurs commonly in vertebrates and invertebrates in the oceans, particularly at depths (e.g. <b>angler</b> <b>fish).</b> [...] Two well known forms of land bioluminescence occur in fireflies and glow worms. Other insects, insect larvae, annelids, arachnids and even species of fungi possess bioluminescent abilities. [...] Some bioluminescent animals produce the light themselves whereas others have a symbiotic relationship with bioluminescent bacteria. (See also: List of bioluminescent organisms) ...|$|E
