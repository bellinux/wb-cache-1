In their article [...] "From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation," [...] scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)"facilitating reading and later writing tasks," [...] which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)"eavesdropping on the insights of other readers," [...] which involves sharing of annotations; (3)"providing feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators," [...] which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)"calling attention to topics and important passages," [...] for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function. Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, motivation, and context of reading. Readers may <b>annotate</b> <b>to</b> help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support memory and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.|$|E

However, their functional relevance is often unclear and better tools are required for their functional annotation. In sub-nanometer pores such as ion channels, hydrophobic gating has been shown to promote dewetting to produce a functionally closed (i. e. non-conductive) state. Using the serotonin receptor (5 -HT 3 R) structure as an example, we demonstrate the use of molecular dynamics to aid the functional annotation of channel structures via simulation of the behavior of water within the pore. Three increasingly complex simulation analyses are described: water equilibrium densities; single ion free energy profiles; and computational electrophysiology. All 3 approaches correctly predict the 5 -HT 3 R crystal structure to represent a functionally closed (i. e. non-conductive) state. We also illustrate application of water equilibrium density simulations to <b>annotate</b> <b>to</b> different conformational states of a glycine receptor...|$|E

40|$|A {{human brain}} is {{estimated}} to have roughly 100 billion neurons connected through more than 100 thousand miles of axons and hundreds of trillions of synaptic connections. The full neural circuit within a brain is called its connectome, and understanding how it works and enables cognition, consciousness, or intelligence are important open questions in science. Recent developments in high-throughput electron microscopy imaging have enabled biologists to visually inspect brain tissue at resolutions of a few nanometers per voxel, enough to enable the analysis of neural circuits. However, the amount of data one would need to <b>annotate</b> <b>to</b> identify and reconstruct even a small circuit makes manual reconstruction efforts prohibitive. In this thesis, we explore several computational strategies to facilitate the semi-automatic and automatic reconstruction of neurons from 3 D stacks of connectomic images.

Unfortunately, general-purpose modeling tools are not suited to modeling 3 D objects composed of developable parts. We propose an interactive tool to model such objects from a photograph. Users of our system load a single picture of the object they wish to model, which they <b>annotate</b> <b>to</b> indicate silhouettes and part boundaries. Assuming that the object is symmetric, we also ask users to provide a few annotations of symmetric correspondences. The object is then automatically reconstructed in 3 D. At {{the core of our}} method is an algorithm to infer the 2 D projection of rulings of a developable surface from the traced silhouettes and boundaries. We impose that the surface normal is constant along each ruling, which is a necessary property for the surface to be developable. We complement these developability constraints with symmetry constraints to lift the curve network in 3 D. In addition to a 3 D model, we output 2 D patterns enabling to fabricate real prototypes of the object on the photo. This makes our method well suited for reverse engineering products made of leather, bent cardboard or metal sheets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Manual {{document}} annotation is {{an essential}} technique for knowledge acquisition and capture. Creating high-quality annotations is a difficult task due to inter-annotator discrepancy, the problem that annotators can never agree completely on what and exactly how to <b>annotate.</b> <b>To</b> address this, traditional document annotation involves multiple domain experts working on the same annotation task in an iterative and collaborative manner to identify and resolve discrepancies progressively. However, such a detailed process is often ineffective despite taking significant time and effort; unfortunately, discrepancies remain high in many cases. This paper proposes an alternative approach to document annotation. The approach tackles the problem by firstly studying annotators ’ suitability based on the types of information to be annotated; then identifying and isolating the most inconsistent annotators who tend to cause the majority of discrepancies in a task; finally distributing annotation workload among the most suitable annotators. Tested in a named entity annotation task {{in the domain of}} archaeology, we show that compared to the traditional approach to document annotation, it produces larger amounts of better quality annotations that result in higher machine learning accuracy while requires significantly less time and effort...|$|E

40|$|Automating the {{extraction}} and quantification of features from three-dimensional (3 -D) image stacks {{is a critical}} task for advancing computer vision research. The union of 3 -D image acquisition and analysis enables the quantification of biological resistance of a plant tissue to fungal infection through the analysis of attributes such as fungal penetration depth, fungal mass, and branching of the fungal network of connected cells. From an image processing perspective, these tasks reduce to segmentation of vessel-like structures and {{the extraction}} of features from their skeletonization. In order to sample multiple infection events for analysis, we have developed an approach we refer to as macroscopic microscopy. However, macroscopic microscopy produces high-resolution image stacks that pose challenges to routine approaches and are difficult for a human to <b>annotate</b> <b>to</b> obtain ground truth data. We present a synthetic hyphal network generator, a comparison of several vessel segmentation methods, and a minimum spanning tree method for connecting small gaps resulting from imperfections in imaging or incomplete skeletonization of hyphal networks. Qualitative results are shown for real microscopic data. We believe the comparison of vessel detectors on macroscopic microscopy data, the synthetic vessel generator, and the gap closing technique are beneficial to the image processing community.

In this thesis project, Development of Hardware Platform for Mobile Adaptable Surveillance System for Critical Areas, the design and development of the hardware platform for the system is built. The project deals with building the smart system comprising of radio frequency (RF) radio, global positioning system (GPS) sensor module, Accelerometer, Temperature sensor, and Ultrasonic sensor.  The design focuses on designing the power supply stage from a single AA battery in such a way that the entire connected components and sensors get a required supply source with best possible extended battery life. The design of power supply stage includes EMC, signal integrity, thermal and efficiency design considerations, and prototyping and testing of the power supply stage.  First the sensors and the necessary design components are selected with more emphasis on their power/energy consumption, size of footprint and signal output (I 2 C-bus protocol interface capability).

40|$|Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) plays a {{key role}} in the {{completion}} of several fermentations including those used for beverage and bioethanol production. In the wine industry, slow or incomplete alcoholic fermentation is still a challenging problem and often results in increased costs of production and decreased wine quality. One of the reasons for the persistence of this problem could be the trend towards rising sugar concentrations in grape musts. What is already a high sugar concentration fermentation (~ 200 g L⁻¹ or more) has increased by some 20 – 40 g L⁻¹ due to climate warming and winemaker pursuit of ripeness. In this project we aim to gain a better understanding of how wine yeast cope in high sugar fermentations (HSF) to help develop strategies for managing these types of grape musts. With the availability of collections of laboratory yeast including gene deletion and overexpression libraries and the development of techniques used for whole genome analysis, it is now possible to investigate yeast biology under oenological conditions with a systems biology approach. A number of genome-wide studies of yeast have previously been conducted to identify yeast genes involved in sensitivity to individual stresses present during fermentation. However, in reality many of these stresses are often present at the same time, or sequentially throughout the phases of fermentation. This highlights an important gap in current research, that being identification of those genes important for maintenance of fermentation efficiency throughout a complete cycle of fermentation, and in particular an environment which has high initial sugar content such as that found in grapes used to make quality wines. We expected these genes to be related to wine yeast adaption, survival and maintenance of fermentative metabolism. In this study 93 genes were identified as important for the successful completion of high sugar fermentation as deletants of these resulted in either protracted or incomplete fermentation. We have named this gene set the Fermentation Essential Genes (FEGs). A gene ontology (GO) analysis of these revealed that vacuolar acidification (VA) is an important biological process required for efficient completion of a high sugar fermentation: 20 of the 93 FEGs <b>annotate</b> <b>to</b> this GO term (vacuolar acidification). Also, this gene set is highly represented in the FEGs since these 20 FEGs represent 77 % of all genes annotated to this same GO term. In this study we also report 18 genes (also all FEGs), not previously associated with VA, of which deletants have VA defects. This was achieved through examination of the VA of 93 FEGs using the vacuolar specific probe 6 -carboxyfluorescein diacetate (6 -CFDA), microscopic and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis. It was shown that, nine FEGs were seen to be particular critically to fermentation progression and completion. Their deletion result in the extreme phenotype of arrested or ‘stuck’ fermentation. Amongst these, featured two genes involved in trehalose biosynthesis. The disaccharide trehalose is an enigmatic compound accumulated in Saccharomyces and known to be associated with survival under environmental stress conditions. Deletion of either TPS 1 or TPS 2, encoding enzymes involved in trehalose biosynthesis, resulted in incomplete fermentation. This phenotype could be reversed by the over-expression of HXK 2 (a paralog of HXK 1 encoding hexokinase isomer 2) in Δtps 1 and introduction of the phosphotrehalase gene (TreA), from Bacillus subtilis, in Δtps 2. HXK 2 over-expression increased the fermentation rate of Δtps 1 and the parent BY 4743 which actually demonstrated a shorter fermentation duration than the parent having blank plasmid. To further investigate fermentation of yeast in HSF we sought to examine the fermentation performance of a gene overexpression library, which was constructed in this study by transformation of a Yeast Genomic Tiling Collection into a haploid wine yeast strain; ISOC 9 dΔleu 2. The construction of this library was performed in collaboration with two other PhD students (Mrs Jade Haggerty and Ms Jin Zhang). The clonal identity, degree of plasmid retention and development of methodologies to allow fermentation in high sugar chemically defined grape juice medium (CDGJM) were achieved. However, due to time constraints further evaluation of this library was not possible within the current project. The collective findings from this project have provided greater insight into the mechanism by which yeast cope with HSF as well as providing direction if not specific gene targets for exploitation in strain improvement programs.
