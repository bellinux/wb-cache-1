50|$|Bloating from {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) is {{of unknown}} origin but often results from {{an insult to the}} gut, and as such can overlap with infective diarrhea, celiac, and inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). IBS is a brain-gut dysfunction that causes visceral hypersensitivity and results in bloating in association with recurrent diarrhea (or constipation) and abdominal pain. While there is no direct treatment for the underlying pathology of IBS, the symptom of bloating can be well managed through dietary changes that prevent the over-reaction of the gastrocolic reflex. Having soluble fiber foods and supplements, substituting dairy with soy or rice products, being careful with fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in insoluble fiber, and eating regular small amounts can all help to lessen the symptoms of IBS (Van Vorous 2000). Foods and beverages to be avoided or minimized include red meat, oily, fatty and fried products, dairy (even when there is no lactose intolerance), solid chocolate, coffee (regular and decaffeinated), alcohol, carbonated beverages, especially those also containing sorbitol, and artificial sweeteners (Van Vorous 2000). IBS is most commonly found in patients around the age of 20 and is found more often in women than men. In people with IBS, the intestines squeeze too hard or not hard enough and cause food to move too quickly or too slowly through the intestines. Other terms used to describe this condition include spastic bowel, spastic colon, and irritable colon. Symptoms of the condition will worsen as a person is placed under stress, during travel, and at other times when the daily routine is tampered with. Common symptoms include bloating, constipation, <b>abdominal</b> <b>cramp</b> or pain after bowel movement, or feeling like a movement is required even after one has been completed.|$|E

The reduction in {{the incidence of}} cervical laceration after misoprostol was also confirmed by Preutthipan and Herabutya [20]. Also, some authors believed that the severity of the adverse effect after misoprostol varies considerably and are often not correlated with dosage, interval of use or route of administration [27].

40|$|Introduction: in Mexico, {{approximately}} 1 000 children {{each year}} are born with anorectal malformation (ARM). Despite surgical correction, those children present fecal function problems (60 - 70 % have difficult to manage constipation). A Bowel Management Program (BMP) was implemented, which consists of initial rectal disimpaction, followed by administration of a stimulant laxative (sennosides), with favorable results. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the effectiveness of the BMP in children with constipation secondary to ARM. Material and methods: A descriptive, retrospective, transverse study to answer the question: how effective is the BMP in children with constipation secondary to ARM? Efficacy was evaluated by means of a construct with three variables (daily fecal evacuations, absence of fecal staining, and simple abdominal x-ray without fecal residue in rectum and left colon after evacuation). All children with surgically corrected ARM and constipation from two national referral centers for children with the condition were included. Results: of 151 children with ARM monitored in outpatient service, only 67. 33 % had constipation. Of this group, 88. 1 % showed good response to the BMP. The average dose of sennoside was 8. 45 mg/kg, 95 % CI: 5. 94 - 11. 12 mg/kg (199. 5 mg total dose; 95 % CI: 139. 50 - 259. 50 mg). <b>Abdominal</b> <b>cramp</b> was the primary adverse effect reported (5. 8 %).

40|$|Background In {{developing}} countries, {{the prevalence}} of giardia- sis in daycare centers is considerably high. There had been inad- equate report of giardiasis in Indonesia. Objective To know {{the prevalence of}} giardiasis in children {{and the number of}} children with symptomatic and asymptomatic giar- diasis who attended daycare centers at Rancabali tea plantation, Bandung district. Methods This descriptive study was conducted in daycare cen- ters between August to October 2002. Giardiasis was defined as the occurrence of G. lamblia cyst in stool specimen independent from {{the presence or absence of}} symptoms. Four of 12 daycare centers were chosen by cluster random sampling. All children aged 1 to 60 months attending daycare and staying for at least 2 weeks were included in this study. Three consecutive stool specimen pre- served by 10 % formalin, concentrated by formalin ether, were ex- amined microscopically to find the G. lamblia cyst. Results Giardia lamblia cysts were found in 27 (29 %) of the 92 children attending the daycare centers at Rancabali tea plantation (95 %CI 20; 38. 6 %). Of these children, 15 showed symptoms such as diarrhea episodes (8 children), diarrhea (5 children), bloating (5 children), <b>abdominal</b> <b>cramp</b> (5 children), and vomiting (3 children). Three children showed mild to moderate malnutrition. Ten children aged 13 to 36 month-old with G. lamblia-positive stool showed such symptoms. Conclusion The prevalence of G. lamblia infection in children at- tending daycare centers at Rancabali tea plantation was almost similar with other place in developing countries.

40|$|Background & aim: Early feeding after cesarean section {{can have}} {{beneficial}} effects, however, no sufficient {{study has been}} conducted in this area. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of early feeding on the gastrointestinal complications in women after cesarean section and comparing it with a regular diet.   Methods: The present randomized-clinical-trial study was conducted on 160 women who admitted to Shohada hospital and underwent cesarean section in 2011 - 2012. The inclusion criteria included women with gestational age more than 37 weeks, singleton pregnancy, having at least 8 hours of fasting, and regional anesthesia (spinal cord), respectively. After registration of demographic characteristics and pregnancy, women were randomly divided into two groups: Early feeding (2 hours after completion of the operation, 250 ml filtered juice, tea and biscuits style regime in the next 2 hours and 2 hours after the usual diet) and the usual power (8 hours of operation clear liquid diet the day after the usual diet) groups. Presence of gastrointestinal symptoms in 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after surgery, time to the bowel sounds auscultation, passage of flatus and stool were recorded. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 13. The significance level of p-value was considered < 0. 05.   Results: The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal distension, feeling of flatulence and <b>abdominal</b> <b>cramp)</b> was significantly higher at 2 and 4 hours after operation and in early feeding group and after 8 hrs. in surgery of normal diet respectively(P 0. 05).   Conclusion: Early feeding caused the acceleration of gastrointestinal symptoms, earlier bowel sounds auscultation and earlier utilization of gas. It is recommended to investigate the different diets and examined the level of compliance and satisfaction.  ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Exogenous {{carbohydrate}} improves {{performance during}} prolonged high-intensity exercise. When ingested together, fructose and glucose polymers are oxidised at rates 1. 5 - 1. 7 higher than isocaloric glucose solutions. As fructose and glucose are transported across the intestine via different mechanisms, {{the capacity for}} exogenous-carbohydrate absorption is greater with composite carbohydrate mixtures. Therefore, since the effect of ingesting multi-transportable carbohydrate on field-based performance has to our knowledge not been investigated, we examined their effect on mountain bike race performance. Finishing time {{was expected to be}} substantially reduced when multi-transportable carbohydrates were ingested. Method: Ten; male (7) and female (3), mountain bikers aged 32. 9 ± 8. 7 years, weighing 68. 8 ± 9. 4 kg and training for at least 8 hours per week and racing regularly participated in a double-blind crossover study. Following a standardised training and diet regimen cyclists completed two Olympic-distance (target winning time of 2 h 15 m), cross-country mountain bike races during which they ingested either a 11. 25 % maltodextrin and fructose solution (MF) or an isocaloric, equi-volumetric, isosmotic control solution containing maltodextrin and glucose (MG). Performance times, ratings of perceived exertion, gastrointestinal discomfort and measurements of hydration status were recorded and compared. Data was analysed using appropriate mixed models in SAS. Results: Cyclists were 1. 8 % (2 mins 31 s) faster in MF compared to MG (90 % confidence interval:± 1. 8 %; 72 % likelihood of a substantial benefit) The effect solution composition on the increase in time from the first the final lap (fatigue) was 9. 7 % (± 2. 8 %) in MF and 10. 7 % (± 2. 8 %) in MG; which corresponded to a 0. 9 % reduction (± 3. 5 %; unclear) in the fatigue in MF. Abdominal cramps were reduced by 8. 1 % in MF relative to MG (± 6. 6 %; likely benefit) and for every 1 % change in <b>abdominal</b> <b>cramp</b> rating, lap time increased by 0. 14 % (± 0. 10 %). There were no clear effects of MF on ratings of perceived exertion and hydration status compared with MG. Conclusion: Cross-country mountain bike race performance was substantially enhanced following ingestion of a maltodextrin and fructose solution. This outcome was related to reduced gastro-intestinal distress supporting the theory that solutions containing multiple-transportable carbohydrates increase the availability of carbohydrate for metabolism. Further investigation with a larger sample size is recommended to establish whether the performance effect is genuinely beneficial or trivial...|$|E
30|$|UC is {{a chronic}} {{disease of the}} colon (also known as the large intestine) {{associated}} with inflammation of the lining of colon and development of tiny open sores, or ulcers, which produce mucous and pus. The combination of ulceration and inflammation can cause abdominal discomfort and also frequent emptying of the colon. The disease {{is the result of}} an abnormal response by the immune system of the body. The cells and proteins which make up the immune system, normally protect the individual from infections. However, in people with IBD, food, bacteria and other materials are mistaken for antigen by the immune system. Hence, the body sends white blood cells into the lining of the intestines and cause chronic inflammation and ulcerations. The present study was conducted to assess the clinic-epidemiological characteristics and colonoscopic findings of UC in Khorramabad city from May 2014 to August 2015. UC most commonly begins between the ages of 15 and 25. Also, another usual age of the onset is in the 6 th decade of life. Females {{are more likely to be}} affected than males (Büsch et al. 2014). In this study, the mean age of the patients was 33.7  ±  12.5  years with an age range of 17 to 98  years. The percentage of affected women with a shade was higher than men, and this is in line with the results of several studies conducted in Iran and across the globe (male/female ratio =  1.27). In a study on the demographic and clinical features of UC patients in Kerman, the mean age of the patients was reported as 33.3  years and the sexual proportion of males to females was 0.8 – 1 (Zahedi et al. 2009). In another study, the mean age of the patients was 32  years and the percentage of affected women with a shade was higher than men (Abdul-Baki et al. 2007 a, b). Keshavarz and Izadi (2008) found the mean age of the patients to be 34  years and the sexual proportion of males to females as 1.08, indicating that the percentage of the men with a shade was higher than women in this study. The disparity in findings between the present study and other studies can be attributed to the difference in sample content of the studies and number of patients used. The mean age at onset of the disease in this study was 29.4  years and the mean duration from the first symptom of the disease to the definite diagnosis was 18.9  months. The long duration from symptomatic to definite diagnosis in the present study may be attributed to lack of gastroenterologists in the province, and the referring of patients to general physicians’ clinics and delay in diagnosis. In the present study, relapse occurred in 33.3  % of the patients. In most cases, improper attention to the given orders and irregular drug use by the patients were the reasons for the frequent disease relapse. The most and least common site of colon involvement in this study were rectosigmoid and pan colon, respectively. This finding is consistent with the results of previous studies (Aghazadeh et al. 2005 b; Farmer et al. 1993; Keshavarz and Izadi 2008). In a study Portela et al. (2010) in southern European countries, it was reported that the most common site of involvement was the left colon. Pan colon involvement was seen in 28  % of cases in this study. With regards to the site of colon involvement, there is a relative similarity between the results of the present study and other studies. The reason for the difference in site of colon involvement may be due to the difference in disease pathogenesis in different places in the world or could be attributed to the fact that colonoscopy is performed by different persons in world and that sometimes, the gastroenterologist may not have performed this test to determine the exact length of the involved colon. In a study conducted in China on 389 patients with UC, the disease severity was recorded as moderate and severe in 52.4 and 13.4  % of the patients, respectively (Jiang et al. 2006), and this is consistent with the results of the present study, as the disease severity of 49.3  % of patients was considered as moderate. In the present study, the most common clinical manifestations seen in patients were dysentery and rectorrhagia. In a study conducted on Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of IBD in patients from northwestern Iran, it was shown that the most common clinical manifestations of patients with UC were <b>abdominal</b> <b>cramp</b> and rectorrhagia (Shirazi et al. 2013 b), whereas in the present study, the most common clinical manifestations were dysentery and rectorrhagia. The most common extra intestinal manifestations in the present study were aphthous ulcers, but in general, hepatobiliary manifestations were the most common form of extra intestinal involvement in this study. Notably, 14.3  % of our patients had extra intestinal manifestations. Aghazadeh et al. (2005 b) and Vahedi et al. (2009 a) reported that 31.4 and 62.4  % of their patients had extra intestinal manifestations, respectively. While in a study by Jiang and Cui (2002), the frequency of extra intestinal manifestations was determined as 6.1  %. The disparity in findings between the present study and other studies can be attributed to fewer number of sample content in the present study and the inability to evaluate all the extra intestinal manifestations in the patients. With regards to family history, in the present study, the family history of IBD in the first degree kinfolks of the patients was 7.8  %. In a study conducted by Bahari et al. (2004), 6.5  % of the patients had a positive history of smoking, which is consistent with the results of the present study. In study byYazdanbod et al. (2011), the family history of IBD in the first degree kinfolks of the patients were 10.9 and 5.4  %, respectively. De Saussure et al. (2007), in their study, reported a prevalence of appendectomy in patients with UC and control group as 12 and 46  %, respectively demonstrating that appendectomy is a protective factor against UC. Whereas, in the present study, only 2.7  % of patients had a history of appendectomy.|$|E
