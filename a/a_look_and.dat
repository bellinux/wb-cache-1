5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover {{they are unable to}} speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role as an agent of The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E
25|$|However, Samuel Richardson and Samuel Johnson both {{reviewed}} and helped out with Lennox's second and most successful novel, The Female Quixote, or, The Adventures of Arabella, and Henry Fielding praised the novel in his Covent Garden Journal. The Female Quixote was quite popular. It was reprinted and packaged {{in a series}} of great novels in 1783, 1799, and 1810. It was translated into German in 1754, French in 1773 and 1801, and Spanish in 1808. The novel formally inverts Don Quixote: as the don mistakes himself for the knightly hero of a Romance, so Arabella mistakes herself for the maiden love of a Romance. While the don thinks it his duty to praise the Platonically pure damsels he meets (such as the farm girl he loves), so Arabella believes it is in her power to kill with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> it is the duty of her lovers to suffer ordeals on her behalf.|$|E
25|$|One {{day after}} {{football}} practice, he approached ASU baseball coach Bobby Winkles {{and asked if}} he could join the team. Winkles said he would give Jackson <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> the next day while still in his football gear, he hit a home run on the second pitch he saw; in five at bats he hit three home runs. He was allowed to practice with the team, but could not join the squad because the NCAA had a rule forbidding the use of freshman players. Jackson switched permanently to baseball following his freshman year, as {{he did not want to}} become a defensive back. To hone his skills, Winkles assigned him to a Baltimore Orioles-affiliated amateur team. He broke numerous team records for the squad, and the Orioles offered him a $50,000 signing bonus if he joined the team. Jackson declined the offer stating that he did not want to forfeit his college scholarship.|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, it was {{announced}} that it would reopen in October under a new chef-owner, Chris Harrod. Harrod had previously worked under Raymond Blanc at two Michelin starred restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons. He had been looking for a restaurant with rooms to purchase, having originally thought to look for one in the Chiltern Hills where they could be added. Harrod said that [...] "I went and had <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> was amazed to find that the Crown at Whitebrook ticked all the boxes for what I was looking for. It had the location, the quality suppliers and I knew straight away that I had been looking in the wrong place." [...] The Crown at Whitebrook reopened the following October, and gained a new Michelin star under the new team in the 2014 list. In February 2015, the restaurant was renamed to The Whitebrook.|$|E
500|$|In late March, VIII Corps {{advanced}} eastward through Eisenach {{and then}} across the Fulda River. Here some of Middleton's infantrymen {{came across the}} concentration camp at Ohrdruf, discovering the sickening evidence of what had transpired there. Middleton called Patton to come take <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> Patton was joined by Bradley and Eisenhower. [...] In his diary, Patton described the place as [...] "one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen." [...] This was the first Nazi concentration camp to be discovered by the United States Army, and Eisenhower cabled Marshall to get a delegation from congress over to witness and communicate what took place there. Middleton later had officials from the town come in to witness {{what was going on}} in their midst. While every one of them denied knowing what was happening, the mayor and his wife both committed suicide that night.|$|E
500|$|The game's humour {{and style}} {{was shaped by}} {{hardware}} limitations; when the hardware rendered the character models in soft focus, the team noted that they resembled Plasticine models, and continued to create the game with <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> style akin to Wallace and Gromit. The game was presented with [...] "distinctive 'British' humour" [...] to distinguish from other games; lead programmer Leslie Benzies and artist Aaron Garbut often presented the team with other Nintendo 64 games, such as Super Mario 64 (1996), to identify the differences. The team ensured that each level felt distinct, while maintaining a coherent style. This diversity was achieved using the development tools, which allowed {{various members of the}} team to experiment in creating designs. Manual text writer Brian Baglow said that the game's music provided freedom to the team, as it [...] "doesn't necessarily have to fit the action on the screen". He explained that the audio was designed to fit with the [...] "cheesy, slightly twisted B-movies animation kind of feel". Baglow found that creating the music on a cartridge instead of a CD prompted the team to discover new techniques of working within the boundaries of the former, stating that [...] "people who are doing music for CD-based systems get very, very lazy".|$|E

500|$|... "The Door" [...] {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of Kristian Nairn as Hodor, a role Nairn has played since the series pilot. Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script â€“ which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sandwich}} {{that would}} eventually become the Big King was preceded by a similar sandwich called the Double Supreme cheeseburger. Burger King's take on rival McDonald's well-known Big Mac sandwich was released as a test product in January 1996 when McDonald's was having difficulties within the American market. Hoping to build on improving sales of Burger King {{and take advantage of}} perceived market weakness of McDonald's, the chain introduced the Double Supreme as part of an advertising blitz against its competitor. Originally, the burger had <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> composition that resembled the Big Mac: it had two beef patties, [...] "King" [...] sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a three-part sesame seed bun. Because its patties are flame-broiled and larger than McDonald's grill fried and seasoned patties, and the formulation of the [...] "King Sauce" [...] was different from McDonald's [...] "Special sauce", the sandwich had a similar, but not exact, taste and different caloric content. The sandwich was reformulated after the initial test run, removing the center roll. The Double Supreme was advertised with a direct attack on the Big Mac, using the claims that it had 75% more beef and less bread than the McDonald's sandwich. A review of the Burger King sandwich by the Chicago Tribune verified these claims and also stated that the ingredients of the newer sandwich were of better quality than those of the McDonald's product.|$|E
500|$|Time {{magazine}} writer James Poniewozik {{said the}} episode continued {{the development of}} the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons Springfield. Poniewozik said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche" [...] interview [...] "maybe the most perfect scene P has put together yet". Likewise, Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley [...] "one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, [...] "then took it way over-the-top". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution. Zap2it writer Rick Porter, called the episode a [...] "great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts" [...] and wrote, [...] "This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season." [...] Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, [...] "If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott, calling him a [...] "current-generation Bob Newhart" [...] and [...] "one of those actors who can just give someone <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> it conveys {{everything you need to know}} about what his character is thinking". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, [...] "it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself".|$|E

2500|$|Paltrow starred with Joaquin Phoenix in {{the romantic}} drama Two Lovers (2008), playing the {{beautiful}} but volatile new neighbor of a depressed bachelor.

She is one of those actresses who understands the power of <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> <b>and</b> the one of regret and then resignation that overtakes her when Leonard professes his love is steeped in sadness".

2500|$|Pilot: Brandon Tartikoff {{commissioned}} a series from MTM Productions, which assigned Bochco and Kozoll to the project. The pilot {{was produced in}} 1980, but was held back as a mid-season replacement {{so as not to}} get lost among the other programs debuting in the fall of 1980. Barbara Bosson, who was married to Bochco, had the idea to fashion the series into four- or five-episode story [...] "arcs". Robert Butler directed the pilot, developing <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> style inspired by the 1977 documentary The Police Tapes, in which filmmakers used handheld cameras to follow police officers in the South Bronx. Butler went on to direct the first four episodes of the series, and Bosson had hoped he would stay on permanently. However, he felt he was not being amply recognized for his contributions to the show's look and style and left to pursue other projects. He would return to direct just one further episode, [...] "The Second Oldest Profession" [...] in season two.|$|E
2500|$|In October and November 2014 England {{travelled}} down-under {{to play in}} the 2014 Four Nations. In {{the opening}} game, England took on Samoa in an affair which saw the lead change several times. In the end England survived a shock result occurring after winning by 6 points. In the second game against Australia controversy occurred. Australia led 16â€“12 with one minute left on the clock. England player Liam Farrell put a grubber-kick in the in-goal area which forced Australian fullback Greg Inglis to force the ball dead however the video referees decided to have <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> see whether or not Inglis or the incoming Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules. It was eventually given a no-try to the anger of English players and fans. Ryan complained on Twitter saying [...] "Looking at the video, Iâ€™d say it was a try if weâ€™re playing Super League rules..." [...] Had Hall scored and England converted it would have been England's first win over Australia since 1995, the first time Australia suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time Australia didn't qualify for a tournament final since the 1954 World Cup final. England lost their final game against New Zealand and in the process ending any chance of qualifying for their first Four Nations final in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{dispensed}} with the experiment of having Hutton bat down {{the order and}} the old Roses opening partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook went to the crease. Hutton was full of confidence, 19 runs came off the first three overs and Keith Miller asked for a new ball in the fourth. Umpire Elphinstone examined the ball and changed it for a new one, which he ground into the dust to take the shine off. Hutton insisted on <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>and</b> bounced on the grass a few times {{so that it would}} lose its shape. It made no difference as another 8 runs came of the next two overs and Miller was taken off, only to take a diving catch off Ian Johnson (3/94) to dismiss Washbrook. Miller said this was the finest catch of his career; [...] "He played the perfect cut, but, fielding in the gully, I had anticipated the shot. I ran across before he played it, flung out my hand and held the ball. I was just as astonished as Cyril". Hutton (62) and Simpson (49) took the score to 128/1 when Miller was brought back on to bowl one of his most famous overs. He bowled a [...] "super ball" [...] to dismiss Hutton lbw and bowled Denis Compton for a duck when the ball clipped the edge of the bat and ricocheted into the stumps. Gilbert Parkhouse survived until tea, but Reg Simpson guided another ball from Miller to Sam Loxton at short-fine-leg and England were 137/4. The popular Freddie Brown strode out to the applause of the crowd hoping for some more Melbourne-style big-hitting and they were not disappointed. Hassett took the new ball, but Brown hit Bill Johnston to the fence, lofted Lindwall into the deep and cracked a straight-drive onto Umpire Barlow's foot. He added 50 with Parkhouse (25) before the Welshman pulled Ian Johnson to Arthur Morris at mid-on at 187/5. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who held up one end while Brown scattered the in-field and clouted the Australian bowling round the ground. When he was finally out the next day, playing over a yorker from Ray Lindwall for 79, he had made his highest Test score, the highest for England so far in the series, and received a royal reception from the crowd. England was now 258/6, their highest innings of a low scoring series, but without their fiery captain they collapsed to 290 all out. Bailey had his thumb broken by a Lindwall bouncer at 263/6 and was taken to St Vincent's Hospital. Godfrey Evans struck 3 fours in his 23 not out, but Alec Bedser was bowled by Lindwall (2/60) and John Warr by Miller (4/37). Bailey returned at 281/8 and tried to bat one-handed before he was caught by Don Tallon of Ian Johnson. Doug Wright joined Evans, but was run out for a duck by his Kent team-mate, tripping over his bat and pulling a muscle as he rushed home and England were all out for 290.|$|E
