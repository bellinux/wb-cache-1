50|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of ILS localizer and glide <b>slope</b> <b>systems,</b> there are some limitations. Localizer systems are sensitive to obstructions in the signal broadcast area, such as large buildings or hangars. Glide <b>slope</b> <b>systems</b> are also limited by the terrain in front of the glide slope antennas. If terrain is sloping or uneven, reflections can create an uneven glidepath, causing unwanted needle deflections. Additionally, since the ILS signals are pointed in one direction by the positioning of the arrays, glide slope supports only straight-line approaches with a constant angle of descent. Installation of an ILS can be costly because of siting criteria and {{the complexity}} of the antenna system.|$|R
40|$|In arctic and alpine {{high relief}} landscapes snow {{avalanches}} are traditionally ranked behind rockfall {{in terms of}} their significance for mass wasting processes of rock slopes. Cornice fall avalanches are at present the most dominant snow avalanche type at two <b>slope</b> <b>systems,</b> called Nybyen and Larsbreen, in the valley Longyeardalen in Central Svalbard. Both <b>slope</b> <b>systems</b> are situated on NW-facing lee slopes underneath large summit plateau, where cornices form annually, and high frequency and magnitude cornice fall avalanching is observed by daily automatic time-lapse photography. In addition, rock debris sedimentation by these cornice fall avalanches was measured directly in either permanent sediment traps or by snow inventories. The results from a maximum of 7 yr of measurements in a total of 13 catchments show maximum avalanche sedimentation rates ranging from 8. 2 to 38. 7 kg m&minus; 2 at Nybyen and from 0. 8 to 55. 4 kg m&minus; 2 at Larsbreen.

This comparably efficient rock slope mass wasting is due to collapsing cornices producing cornice fall avalanche with high rock debris content throughout the entire winter. The rock debris of different origin stems from the plateau crests, the adjacent free rock face and the transport pathway, accumulating distinct avalanche fans at both <b>slope</b> <b>systems</b> and contributing {{to the development of a}} rock glacier at the Larsbreen <b>slope</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

This study proposes a computationally efficient framework for fully probabilistic seismic displacement analysis of spatially distributed <b>slope</b> <b>systems</b> using spatially correlated vector intensity measures (IMs). First, a spatial cross-correlation model for three key ground motion IMs, that is, peak ground acceleration (PGA), Arias intensity, and peak ground velocity, is developed using 2686 ground motion recordings from 11 recent earthquakes. To reduce the computational cost, Monte Carlo simulation and data reduction techniques are utilized to generate spatially correlated random fields for the vector IMs. The slope displacement hazards over the region are further quantified using empirical predictive equations. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to highlight the importance of the spatial correlation and the advantage of using spatially correlated vector IMs in seismic hazard analysis of spatially distributed slopes.

Only a few field studies, and particularly few in the High Arctic, have quantified avalanche sedimentation. Snow avalanches are traditionally ranked behind rockfall {{in terms of their}} significance for mass-wasting processes of rockslopes. Cornice fall avalanches are at present the most dominant snow avalanche type at two <b>slope</b> <b>systems,</b> called Nybyen and Larsbreen, in the valley Longyeardalen in central Svalbard.

The results from a maximum of seven years of measurements in a total of 13 catchments show maximum mean rock debris sedimentation rates ranging from 8. 2 to 38. 7 kg m − 2 at Nybyen, and from 0. 8 to 55. 4 kg m − 2 at Larsbreen. Correspondingly, avalanche fan surfaces accreted from 2. 6 to 8. 8 mm yr − 1 at Nybyen, and from 0. 2 to 13. 9 mm yr − 1 at Larsbreen. This comparably efficient rockslope mass wasting is due to collapsing cornices producing cornice fall avalanches containing large amounts of rock debris throughout the entire winter.

Outcrops of both levee-confined (Unit C) and entrenched (Unit D) channel systems are exposed in the Permian Fort Brown Formation, Karoo Basin, South Africa and have been extensively studied and interpreted. Full coring and logging of six research boreholes behind the outcrop surface has produced a comprehensive dataset including oriented borehole images. Directional features from FMS borehole image logs can be subdivided into direct (cross-bedding and climbing ripples) and indirect (erosion- and amalgamation surfaces and syn-sedimentary faults) palaeoflow indicators. The distribution of these indicators is analysed qualitatively and statistically per well and per (sub) unit {{to arrive at a}} solid palaeoflow reconstruction. Distributions of features in unconfined external levee deposits yield the most unambiguous results, whereas levee- or valley-confined features display a higher level of scattering. A borehole-confined, pseudo- 2 D and a well- and outcrop-confined 3 D facies model are built to test the incorporation of the palaeoflow reconstruction. Erosion surface dip azimuths help to locally constrain (sub) unit bounding surfaces. The palaeoflow reconstruction serves to constrain the orientation of data analysis on conceptual facies models and to assign realistic orientations to the representation of multi-point facies patterns.
