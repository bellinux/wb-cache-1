25|$|For over a {{thousand}} years {{the basis of the}} economy in the North York Moors was agriculture. The rural scene, which attracts millions of visitors to the park each year, has been formed and maintained by generations of farmers. The 1996 <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Census</b> recorded a total workforce of 2,913 employed on 1,342 working farms. Sheep and cattle provide the prime source of farm income. The dale farms have rights to graze sheep on the open moor. The rights to moorland grazing are often essential to the economic viability of a farm. In recent years agriculture in Britain has suffered economic setbacks and the viability of hill farming has become questionable. A number of environmental schemes to improve farm incomes have been devised but the industry continues to decline.|$|E

25|$|Extremely unequal land {{ownership}} {{is both a}} cause and {{a consequence of the}} Colombian armed conflict. In 1960, 0.4% of landowners held 30% of all farmland. By 1997, the concentration of {{land ownership}} was further accentuated, with 0.35% of landowners holding 45% of all farmland with 86% owning just 13%. In 2012, 1% of landowners (those owning large properties over 200 hectares) held 43% of the land, and an additional 13% of landowners (those owning medium-sized properties over 20 hectares) held 39% of the land. 79% of landowners had properties of less than 10 hectares (considered microfundio and minifundio), which accounted for just 11% of private rural land. The 2014 <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Census</b> reported that 0.4% of agricultural production units (over 500 hectares) occupy 77.6% of the country's rural area, while 71% of agricultural production units (less than 5 hectares) occupy just 2% of rural land area. On the largest landholdings (over 1,000 hectares), an average of only 28% of the land is used for agricultural purposes with the remainder of the land covered by natural vegetation, confirming common accusations that the land is underutilized. The 2014 census also showed that, since 1960, the fragmentation of smallholdings had increased - production units of less than 5 hectares increased from 63% of 71% {{of the total number of}} such units - while the weight of large landholdings (over 500 hectares) in the total rural land area had increased significantly from 40% to 77.6%. The inequitable land distribution has increased since 2000, as measured by the Gini coefficient for land ownership - 0.885 in 2009, compared to 0.877 in 2000. Colombia is one of the countries with the highest inequality in rural property in Latin America and the world.|$|E

In addition to providing information for building improved sampling frames and better sample design, linking the two Censuses offers many advantages. The agriculture module of the Census of Population provides complete enumeration of agricultural households (and sometimes information on rural communities) which allows presentation of data for small geographical/administrative units, increasing considerably the value and relevance of the whole census operation. Also as the same identification of households is used for both censuses there is scope for in-depth analysis using cross-tabulations of agricultural data with the socio-economic and demographic data from the Census of Population.

2500|$|Although women play {{an active}} role in Pakistan's economy, their {{contribution}} has been grossly underreported in some censuses and surveys. [...] Part of the understimation of women's economic role is that Pakistan, like many other countries, has a very large informal sector.

According to World Bank, in 2014, women made up 22.3% of the labor force in Pakistan. According to the 1999 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, only two percent of Pakistani women participate in the formal sector of employment. However, the 1980 <b>agricultural</b> <b>census</b> stated that the women's participation rate in agriculture was 73%.

40|$|The {{practice}} of applying {{large amounts of}} P to agricultural land over several previous decades, particularly in regions with intensive livestock production, has resulted in P accumulation in soils with {{an increased risk of}} P losses into water bodies and thus of eutrophication. This work is aimed at analyzing the spatiotemporal changes in extractable soil P content at the regional level by means of a soil test database and then comparing results with independent data from <b>agricultural</b> <b>censuses.</b> A total of 228 079 soil P-test values [Dyer method: 1 : 5 soil-citric acid solution (20 g/L) ratio] generated between 1980 and 2003 by certified commercial laboratories in Brittany (northwestern France) were integrated into a database. Changes in P were analysed by considering four 4 - 6 year periods between 1980 and 2003 using cumulative frequencies and summary statistics performed on raw soil test values. Then data were aggregated into discrete entities (canton: administrative entities) and summary statistics, linear regression and spatial distribution were carried out. P balances were measured for the same entities taken from the <b>agricultural</b> <b>censuses</b> of 1979, 1988 and 2000. Over the entire study period, a marked spatial variability was observed with higher P content {{in the western part of}} Brittany, as well as a systematic increase in median P content with lower amplitude over the past decade. The mean cantonal soil P surplus accumulated over 24 years amounted to 763 kg P/ha of usable agricultural land. Similar P balances sometimes gave rise to widely different increases in P.
