5|$|A Han kingdom {{was much}} like a commandery in size <b>and</b> <b>administration,</b> except it was officially, and after 145 BC, nominally, the fief of a {{relative}} to the emperor, including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons—excluding the heir apparent. The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually adopted by the founder Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC), {{as many of the}} early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the Chu-Han contention (206–202 BC). Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his queen.|$|E

5|$|According to Anne Feldhaus, the Morgaon temple {{does not}} pre-date the seventeenth century, when Morya Gosavi popularized it. However, even the dating of Morya Gosavi is disputed and varies from the 13th–14th {{century to the}} 17th century. The {{descendants}} of Morya Gosavi – who were worshipped as Ganesha incarnates at the Chinchwad temple – often visited the Morgaon temple and controlled the finances <b>and</b> <b>administration</b> of many Ashthavinayak temples. The 17th-century saint Samarth Ramdas composed the popular arati song Sukhakarta Dukhaharta, seeing the Morgaon icon.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} he {{returned}} to Dorothea's Courland court, where {{he served as a}} tutor for her daughter. Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service <b>and</b> <b>administration</b> of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E

The Royal College of Surgeons is located in London, and from 1939 to 1941 he was President of its Listerian Society.|$|E

5|$|Borders <b>and</b> <b>administration</b> of {{the colony}} {{similarly}} changed a number of times. Originally, and for the initial period, the colony vacillated between military administration and civilian administration from Senegal. In 1893, French Sudan formally came under civilian administration, which lasted until 1899. At that point, a reorganization {{of the colony}} split 11 southern provinces to other French colonies like French Guinea, the Ivory Coast and Dahomey.|$|E
5|$|Born into a Fang family, Aubame was {{orphaned}} {{at a young}} age. He {{was raised}} by the stepbrother of Léon M'ba, who became Aubame's chief political rival. Encouraged by his colleagues, Aubame entered politics, serving as Gabon's first representative in the National Assembly of France from 1946 to 1958. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. Aubame's quick rise in Gabonese politics was spurred by {{the support of the}} missions <b>and</b> <b>administration,</b> whereas much of M'ba's strength came from the colonists.|$|E

5|$|Brown's main {{contribution}} to the game, however, was not {{to the development of}} new plays but to the organization <b>and</b> <b>administration</b> of teams. Before Brown, football was seen as a chaotic affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy and preparation seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get an edge on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E
