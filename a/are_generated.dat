5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs <b>are</b> <b>generated,</b> although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E

Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils {{as part of the}} immune response against bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> by differences in temperature.

When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field.|$|E
5|$|Turning forces <b>are</b> <b>generated</b> during {{maneuvers}} for balancing {{in addition}} to just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the FAA {{mandates}} {{the taking}} of weather observations at larger airports for safety reasons.

The airport observations are then transmitted worldwide using the METAR observing code. METAR reports typically come from airports or permanent weather observation stations.
