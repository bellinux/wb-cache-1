40|$|About 673 {{small-scale}} asbestos {{mining and}} milling facilities and 33 large - scale asbestos manufacturing plants, (17 <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>product</b> manufacturing plants and 16 other than <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>product</b> plants) are situated in India. The present study reveals {{the exposure of}} commercial asbestos (chrysotile) in the occupational as well as ambient air environment of the asbestos-cement (AC) sheets industry using membrane filter method of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The fibre concentrations in 15 samples collected in the occupational environment at ingredient feeding site, sheet-producing site, fibre godown were 0. 079, 0. 057 and 0. 078 f/cc, respectively and in five samples from surrounding ambient air at factory gate resulted fibre concentration of 0. 071 f/cc. All the samples have shown fibre concentration lower than the threshold limit values (TLVs) prescribed by BIS. Morphological analysis of samples, further under phase contrast and polarized microscopy indicates the presence of chrysotile asbestos, which acts as carcinogen as well as co-carcinogen. A clinical examination of exposed subjects reveals {{that there was no}} case of clubbing, crepitation, ronchi and dyspnea on exertion; however, obstruction and restriction were 10. 9 per cent and 25 per cent in exposed subjects, respectively while in control there were 12 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively. The study revealed that chrysotile asbestos is emitted in the occupational as well as ambient environment that may cause adverse health impact...|$|E
50|$|Transite {{originated}} as a {{brand that}} Johns-Manville created in 1929 for {{a line of}} <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>products,</b> including boards and pipes. In time it became a generic term for other companies' similar <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>products,</b> and later an even more generic term for a hard, fireproof composite material, fibre cement boards, typically used in wall construction. It {{can also be found}} in insulation, siding, roof gutters, and cement wallboard.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{companies}} that produced <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>products</b> that were reinforced with asbestos fibers have developed products incorporating organic fibers. One such product {{was known as}} [...] "Eternit" [...] and another [...] "Everite" [...] now use [...] "Nutec" [...] fibers which consist of organic fibers, portland cement and silica. Cement-bonded wood fiber is another substitute. Stone fibers are used in gaskets and friction materials.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Total dust samples {{produced}} by machining three commercial <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>products</b> (autoclaved sheet, non-autoclaved sheet, pipe) were examined for their dimensional, surface, and physicochemical characteristics. Microscopic inspection of dust fractions with different settling characteristics in air allowed {{determination of the}} simple dimensional features that apply to respirable fibres—that is, the true diameter, length, and aspect ratio and the coil diameter, coil length, and coil aspect ratio. The respirable fraction {{as a percentage of}} the total dust varied with the type of machined product: 8 · 5 % for non-autoclaved sheet, 10 · 5 % for autoclaved sheet, and 35 % for pipe...|$|R
40|$|The {{risks of}} the {{morbidity}} of the asbestos-related lung cancer was estimated {{in the general population}} of Poles as the result of increased exposure to asbestos fibers during the removal of <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>products</b> and the possibility of the valuation of the social costs related to this risk. The prediction of the new incidences was made using linear regression model. The forecast shows that to the end of 2030 about 3, 500 new cases of lung cancer can be expected as a result of occupational exposure to asbestos in the past which makes together with paraoccupational exposure about 14. 000 new cases. The forecast shows the increasing number of asbestos-related lung cancer in Poland and indicates the priority areas where preventive action should be implemented...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the use of}} {{amphibole}} asbestos (crocidolite and amosite) has been banned in most European countries because of its known effects on the lung and pleura, chrysotile asbestos remains in use {{in a number of}} widely used products, notably asbestos cement and friction linings in vehicle brakes and clutches. A ban on chrysotile throughout the European Union for these remaining applications is currently under consideration, but this requires confidence in the safety of substitute materials. The main substitutes for the residual uses of chrysotile are p-aramid, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and cellulose fibers, and it is these materials that are evaluated here. Because it critically affects both exposure concentrations and deposition in the lung, diameter is a key determinant of the intrinsic hazard of a fiber; the propensity of a material to release fibers into the air is also important. It is generally accepted that to be pathogenic to the lung or pleura, fibers must be long, thin, and durable; fiber chemistry may also be significant. These basic principles are used in a pragmatic way to form a judgement on the relative safety of the substitute materials, taking into account what is known about their hazardous properties and also the potential for uncontrolled exposures during a lifetime of use (including disposal). We conclude that chrysotile asbestos is intrinsically more hazardous than p-aramid, PVA, or cellulose fibers and that its continued use in <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>products</b> and friction materials is not justifiable in the face of available technically adequate substitutes. 9099...|$|R
5000|$|Stock {{was born}} in Split on 3 August 1868 to Abramo and Gentile (née Valenzin) Stock, as one of 12 children. Stock's {{paternal}} Ashkenazi Jewish family originated from Frankfurt am Main, German Empire, while his maternal Sephardi Jewish family arrived in Split during Napoleonic era. His father moved to Split in 1844 from Trieste, Italy. Stock graduated from university with a civil engineering degree. After graduation he built a cement factory near Solin, and also a factory of <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>products.</b> At {{the beginning of the}} 1900s Stock became involved in the production of alcoholic beverages. In 1905 Stock , along with Vid Morpurgo, another Croatian Jewish industrialist, founded the alcoholic beverages company [...] "Morpurgo, Stock e Comp." [...] Stock 84 was being produced in the Split-based old Morpurgo factory. The new company obtained the franchise to construct a new liquor factory on the outskirts of Split (today part of the city). The factory concession was subsequently challenged by the municipal prefect Vicko Mihaljević , ostensibly due to environmental issues, while some attributed the problem to a political conflict between the owners and the municipal authorities. Disappointed by the withdrawal of the concession, Stock and Morpurgo went on to build the factory in Rovinj, Croatia. The business was prosperous so Stock and his partner decided to build a second plant in Trieste, where Stock's brother Lionel already owned the steam wine distillery [...] "Distilleria a vapore Camis & Stock" [...] (now Fernet Stock) which produced cognac [...] "Medicinal". Stock died in Trieste in 1951.|$|R
