5|$|The term titanates usually {{refers to}} titanium(IV) compounds, as {{represented}} by barium titanate (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material exhibits piezoelectric properties and {{is used as a}} transducer in the interconversion of sound <b>and</b> <b>electricity.</b> Many minerals are titanates, e.g. ilmenite (FeTiO3).

5|$|Throughout history, clocks {{have had}} a variety of power sources, {{including}} gravity, springs, <b>and</b> <b>electricity.</b> Mechanical clocks became widespread in the 14th century, when they were used in medieval monasteries to keep the regulated schedule of prayers.

5|$|Titanium {{is not as}} hard as some {{grades of}} {{heat-treated}} steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat <b>and</b> <b>electricity.</b> Machining requires precautions, because the material can gall unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a fatigue limit that guarantees longevity in some applications.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, media {{attention}} {{shifted away from}} {{the company and its}} troubles; a little less than a month later Enron announced its intention {{to begin the process of}} selling its lower-margin assets in favor of its core businesses of gas <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> trading.

40|$|This paper {{looks for}} the {{possible}} outcomes of the determinants of demand for electricity in Turkey. All variables are in per capita. Determinants are electricity production, price index of <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> income, respectively. <b>Electricity</b> consumption is classified into residential <b>and</b> commercial <b>electricity</b> consumption <b>and</b> industrial <b>electricity</b> consumption. By employing Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) <b>and</b> impulse-responses for <b>electricity</b> consumptions, this paper results in a reduced form indicating that electricity consumption is affected by only electricity production {{in the long run}} for the annual period of 1954 - 2003. ...|$|R

5|$|As 241Am has {{a roughly}} similar {{half-life}} to 238Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), {{it has been}} proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft.

5|$|In Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, {{the storm}} surge {{surrounded}} many of the buildings at the United States Naval Academy, resulting in about $116million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD) The Annapolis Maritime Museum suffered severe damage as well, though volunteers moved artifacts to a safer location. There, {{the storm surge}} flooded the building in 6feet (1.8m) of water, causing great damage to the floor, drywall, <b>and</b> <b>electricity.</b> About 93% of the 211,000 power customers in the county were left without electricity after the storm.

5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, water <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused}} of corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues, and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, lithium {{has a single}} valence {{electron}} that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, lithium is a good conductor of heat <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> {{as well as a}} highly reactive element, though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).|$|E
5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> taxes.|$|E
