40|$|Abstract: Despite {{innovative}} therapeutic strategies, the expectative of life {{in patients}} affected by cerebral gliomas remain dismal. Malignant gliomas represent a class of infiltrative and aggressive neoplasms that are generally resistant to multimodal approach. The efficacy of classical anti-cancer strategies is seriously limited by lack of specific therapies against malignant cells. Glial tumors {{seem to be able}} to create a favorable environment for the invasion of glioma cells in cerebral parenchyma when they combine with the extracellular matrix via cell surface receptors. Recent advances in molecular and tumor biology have lead to a new class of modern antitumoral agents. Antisense oligonucleotides are synthetic stretches of DNA which hybridize with specific mRNA strands. The specificity of hybridization makes <b>antisense</b> <b>method</b> an interesting strategy to selectively modulate the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis.

40|$|Abstract: A {{problem with}} the use of Escherichia coli to produce foreign {{proteins}} is that although endogenously produced acetate is physiologically indispensable, it in-hibits protein expression. Here we firstly employed an antisense RNA strategy as an elaborate metabolic engi-neering tool to partially block biosynthesis of two major acetate pathway enzymes, phosphotransacetylase (PTA) and acetate kinase (ACK). Three recombinant plasmids containing antisense genes targeting either or both of pta and ackA were constructed, and their effects on the acetate pathway and foreign protein productivity com-pared to control plasmid without any antisense genes were determined in E. coli BL 21. Green fluorescent pro-tein (GFP) was employed as a model foreign protein, and timing of antisense expression was controlled by using the intrinsic ackA promoter. We found that the <b>antisense</b> <b>method</b> partially reduced mRNA levels of target enzyme genes and, over time, lowered the concentration of ac-etate in culture media in all antisense-regulated strains. Notably, total production of GFP was enhanced 1. 6 - to 2. 1 -fold in antisense-regulated strains, even though the degree of acetate reduction was not significantly large. It was revealed that the acetate pathway has more critical roles in cellular physiology than expected in the previous reports. When the scale of culture was increased, en-hancement of protein production became larger, demon-strating that this antisense strategy can be successfully applied to practical large-scale protein production pro...|$|E

Its critical role in neoplastic transformation and tumor invasion renders PKC a potential target for anticancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the effect of targeting individual PKCs on gastric carcinogenesis. We established gastric cancer cell lines stably expressing antisense PKCα, PKCβ 1, and PKCβ 2 cDNA. These stable transfectants were characterized by cell morphology, cell growth, apoptosis, and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. PKCα-AS and PKCβ 1 -AS transfectants showed a different morphology with flattened, long processes and decreased nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio compared with the control cells. Cell growth was markedly inhibited in PKCα-AS and PKCβ 1 -AS transfectants. PKCα-AS and PKCβ 1 -AS cells were more responsive to mitomycin C- or 5 -fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. However, antisense targeting of PKCβ 2 {{did not have any}} significant effect on cell morphology, cell growth, or apoptosis. Furthermore, antisense inhibition of PKCα and PKCβ 1 markedly suppressed colony-forming efficiency in soft agar and in nude mice xenografts. Inhibition of PKCα or PKCβ 1 significantly suppressed transcriptional and DNA binding activity of activator protein in gastric cancer cells, suggesting that PKCα or PKCβ 1 exerts their effects on cell growth through regulation of activator protein activity. These data provide evidence that targeting PKCα and PKCβ 1 by <b>antisense</b> <b>method</b> is a promising therapy for gastric cancer. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

However, construction of such expression vectors is technically time consuming and low amount of antisense RNA can be expressed is still problematic. The advantages of our proposed gene silencing technique, which involves antisense DNA oligonucleotides, are that specially prepared equipment and special techniques are not required and that many genes can be targeted.

Using an expressed sequence tag (EST) library-based <b>antisense</b> <b>method</b> of random gene inactivation and a phenotypic screen for limitation of ASFV replication in cultured human cells, we identified six host genes whose cellular functions are required by ASFV. These included three loci, BAT 3 (HLA-B-associated transcript 3), C 1 qTNF (C 1 q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 6), and TOM 40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40), for which antisense expression from a tetracycline-regulated promoter resulted in reversible inhibition of ASFV production by > 99 %. The effects of antisense transcription of the BAT 3 EST and also of expression in the sense orientation of this EST, which encodes amino acid residues 450 to 518 of the mature BAT 3 protein, were investigated more extensively. Sense expression of the BAT 3 peptide, which appears to reversibly interfere with BAT 3 function by a dominant negative mechanism, resulted in decreased synthesis of viral DNA and proteins early after ASFV infection, altered transcription of apoptosis-related genes as determined by cDNA microarray analysis, and increased cellular sensitivity to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Antisense transcription of BAT 3 reduced ASFV production without affecting abundance of the virus macromolecules we assayed.

This study employs a novel <b>antisense</b> rescue <b>method</b> to determine whether antisense-resistant genes (constructed by deletion of antisense RNA target sequences) can replace c-fos expression during serum-induced DNA synthesis.

The results of nuclear-labelling and cellular-proliferation studies indicated that C terminally truncated Fos mutants, including FBR v-fos, could not rescue endogenous Fos, although full-length and minimally truncated c-fos expression vectors could restore serum-induced DNA synthesis in cells expressing anti-fos RNA.

40|$|The general {{principle}} for tumor cells {{to escape from}} immune surveillance is to prevent tumor antigens from being recognized by the immune system.

Simultaneous presentation of tumor antigens by both MHC class I and II molecules generates a robust and long-lasting anti-tumor immune response.

40|$|The calcium-binding protein calretinin {{has emerged}} as a useful marker for the {{identification}} of mesotheliomas of the epithelioid and mixed types, but its putative role in tumor development has not been addressed previously. Although exposure to asbestos fibers is considered the main cause of mesothelioma, undoubtedly, not all mesothelioma patients have a history of asbestos exposure. The question as to whether the SV 40 virus is involved as a possible co-factor is still highly debated. Here we show that increased expression of SV 40 early gene products in the mesothelial cell line MeT- 5 A induces the expression of calretinin and that elevated calretinin levels strongly correlate with increased resistance to asbestos cytotoxicity. Calretinin alone mediates a significant part of this protective effect because cells stably transfected with calretinin cDNA were clearly more resistant to the toxic effects of crocidolite than mock-transfected control cells. Down-regulation of calretinin by <b>antisense</b> <b>methods</b> restored the sensitivity to asbestos toxicity to a large degree. The protective effect observed in clones with higher calretinin expression levels could be eliminated by phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) inhibitors, implying an important role for the PI 3 K/AKT signaling (survival) pathway in mediating the protective effect. Up-regulation of calretinin, resulting from either asbestos exposure or SV 40 oncoproteins, may be a common denominator that leads to increased resistance to asbestos cytotoxicity and thereby contributes to mesothelioma carcinogenesis...|$|R

Using antisense approaches and in situ recordings from Xenopus embryo spinal cord neurons, we tested the in vivo roles of Kvβ 2 subunits in modulation of voltage-dependent potassium current (IKv). We focused on 1) two different populations of dorsal spinal neurons that express both Kvβ 2 and Kv 1 α-subunit genes and 2) the 24 - and 48 -h developmental period, during which IKv undergoes developmental regulation. At both 24 and 48 h, <b>antisense</b> <b>methods</b> produced efficient knock-down of both Kvβ 2 protein and IKv. At both times, dominant negative suppression of Kv 1 channels also eliminated IKv, indicating that Kv 1 channels require Kvβ 2 subunits to function in dorsal spinal neurons. Even though Kv 1 channels determined the IKv values of both dorsal neuron types, comparisons of their IKv properties revealed important differences at both developmental stages. The latter results support the notion that different Kv 1 α-subunits and/or posttranslational modifications underlie the IKv values of the two dorsal neuron types.

40|$|Abstract Background Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disease with few treatment options other than renal replacement therapy. p 21, a cyclin kinase inhibitor which has pleiotropic effects on the cell cycle, in many cases acts to suppress cell cycle progression and to prevent apoptosis. Because defects in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells occur in PKD, and in light of earlier reports that polycystin- 1 upregulates p 21 and that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine arrests progression in a mouse model, we asked whether (1) p 21 deficiency might underlie ADPKD and (2) the mechanism of the salutary roscovitine effect on PKD involves p 21. Methods p 21 levels in human and animal tissue samples as well as cell lines were examined by immunoblotting and/or immunohistochemisty. Apoptosis was assessed by PARP cleavage. p 21 expression was attenuated in a renal tubular epithelial cell line by <b>antisense</b> <b>methods,</b> and proliferation in response to p 21 attenuation and to roscovitine was assessed by the MTT assay. Results We show that p 21 is decreased in human {{as well as a}} non-transgenic rat model of ADPKD. In addition, hepatocyte growth factor, which induces transition from a cystic to a tubular phenotype, increases p 21 levels. Furthermore, attenuation of p 21 results in augmentation of cell cycle transit in vitro. Thus, levels of p 21 are inversely correlated with renal tubular epithelial cell proliferation. Roscovitine, which has been shown to arrest progression in a murine model of PKD, increases p 21 levels and decreases renal tubular epithelial cell proliferation, with no affect on apoptosis. Conclusion The novelty of our study is the demonstration in vivo in humans and rat models of a decrement of p 21 in cystic kidneys as compared to non-cystic kidneys. Validation of a potential pathogenetic model of increased cyst formation due to enhanced epithelial proliferation and apoptosis mediated by p 21 suggests a mechanism for the salutary effect of roscovitine in ADPKD and supports further investigation of p 21 as a target for future therapy. </p...|$|R

The effect of FHL 2 suppression by both <b>antisense</b> and siRNA <b>methods</b> on cell differentiation and growth were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: FHL 2 expression was up-regulated in gastrointestinal cancer, compared with matched normal tissues. Stable transfection of gastric cancer cell line, AGS, and colon cancer cell line, Lovo, with antisense FHL 2 induced lengthened or shuttle-shape morphologic changes with long or dendritic-like cytoplasmic processes and decreased the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. FHL 2 antisense induced expressions of carinoembryonic antigen and E-cadherin and the maturation of F-actin. Furthermore, FHL 2 antisense inhibited the transcriptions of some oncogenes including cox- 2, survivin, c-jun, and hTERT, and suppressed the promoter activity of activator protein- 1 and hTERT.

Cell-free translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate revealed that 10 mer or longer antisense effectively halted protein synthesis. This required the presence of RNase H, and was achieved without prior heat-denaturation of the RNA templates. Then, subpools of the 10 mer repertoire were administered to human microvascular endothelial cells in culture, and screened for anti-angiogenic activities. A single species having the sequence 5 [prime]-GGCTCATGGT- 3 [prime] consistently inhibited the endothelial cell growth under hypoxia.

Principle among genetic changes found in tumor cells are chromosomal translocations which give rise to fusion genes or enforced oncogene expression.

Also, in acute leukemias, many of these molecules are transcription regulators which involve cell-type-specific complexes, offering an alternative therapy via interfering with protein-protein interaction. We are studying these various features of tumor cells to evaluate new therapeutic methods.

They still showed that Platensimycin has potent, broad-spectrum Gram-positive activity in vitro (Table below) and exhibits no cross-resistance to other key antibiotic-resistant bacteria including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and linezolid-resistant and macrolide-resistant pathogens.1A first total synthesis of racemic platensimycin has been published.7 Its structure consists of a 3-amino-2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid polar part linked through an amide bond to a lipophilic pentacyclic ketolide.|$|R
40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{have indicated that}} the establishment of long-term memory requires protein synthesis, including the synthesis of immediate-early gene products. Although the anatomical expression patterns of the c-fos gene, a transcription factor-encoding immediate-early gene, in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) are well documented, the functional roles of c-fos gene expression and Fos-mediated transcription remain to be clarified. Using the <b>antisense</b> oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) <b>method</b> in rats and gene-targeting knockout techniques in mice (c-fos−/− mice), we examined the roles of c-fos gene expression in the acquisition, retrieval, and retention of CTA. Preconditioning microinfusion of AS-ODN directed against c-fos mRNA (c-fos AS-ODN) into the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) impaired the acquisition, whereas infusion of control ODNs consisting of a randomized or inverted base order had no effect. Microinfusion of c-fos AS-ODN into either the amygdala or insular cortex did not impair the acquisition, whereas it attenuated the retention. Retrieval and subsequent retention of an acquired CTA were not disrupted by c-fos AS-ODN infusion into the PBN or amygdala. Microinfusion of another AS-ODN directed against zif 268 (egr- 1, krox- 24, NGFI-A) mRNA into the PBN or amygdala {{did not affect the}} acquisition and retention. The genetic deficiency in c-fos−/− mice caused normal acquisition and retention. The present results suggest that the Fos-mediated gene transcription in the PBN, amygdala, or insular cortex plays critical roles in the acquisition and/or consolidation, but not the retrieval, of long-term taste memory; nevertheless, some other factors could compensate CTA mechanism when Fos-mediated transcription is not available...|$|R
40|$|Background Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is an X-linked recessive muscle wasting disorder characterised {{by the absence}} of the protein dystrophin. Antisense oligonucleotides have been used to re-direct dystrophin pre-mRNA processing by blocking sequences crucial to pre-mRNA splicing, thereby inducing skipping of specific exons. We wished to determine which splicing motifs are most amenable as targets for antisense oligonucleotide induction of efficient and specific skipping of selected exons. <b>Methods</b> <b>Antisense</b> oligonucleotides were directed at regions of dystrophin exon 19 involved in pre-mRNA splicing, including the donor and acceptor splice sites and the exon splicing enhancer (ESE). Cultured myotubes were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides at various concentrations and studies undertaken to determine both specificity and efficiency of induced exon 19 skipping. Results Antisense oligonucleotides as small as 12 nucleotides targeting the ESE induced consistent and specific skipping of only exon 19 in both human and normal and mdx mouse myotubes. Antisense oligonucleotides directed at the donor and acceptor splice sites also induced specific exon 19 skipping while mismatched antisense oligonucleotides could only induce skipping when delivered at higher concentrations. No other dystrophin exons were removed from the mature mRNA as a consequence of these antisense oligonucleotides treatments. Conclusions Antisense oligonucleotides directed at the ESE tended to be marginally more efficient than those which targeted the donor or acceptor splice sites, based on their ability to induce specific skipping at lower concentrations. The specificity of exon removal {{does not appear to be}} a function of target selection, but may reflect the combination of the splicing motifs and position of that exon in the pre-mRNA...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGap {{junctional}} communication (GJC) {{is regulated}} in the earlyXenopusembryo and quantitative differences in junctional communication correlate with the specification of the dorsal–ventral axis. To address the mechanism {{that is responsible}} for regulating this differential communication, we investigated the function of β-catenin during the formation of the dorsal–ventral axis inXenopusembryos by blocking its synthesis with <b>antisense</b> oligodeoxynucleotides. This <b>method</b> has previously been shown to reduce the level of β-catenin in the early embryo, prior to zygotic transcription, and to inhibit the formation of the dorsal axis (Heasmanet al., 1994,Cell 79, 791 – 803). We show here that antisense inhibition of β-catenin synthesis also reduces GJC among cells in the dorsal hemisphere of 32 -cell embryos to levels similar to those observed among ventral cells. Full-length β-catenin mRNA can restore elevated levels of dorsal GJC when injected into β-catenin-deficient oocytes, demonstrating the specificity of the β-catenin depletion with the antisense oligonucleotides. Thus, endogenous β-catenin is required for the observed differential GJC. This regulation of GJC is the earliest known action of the dorsal regulator, β-catenin, inXenopusdevelopment. Two lines of evidence, presented here, indicate that β-catenin acts within the cytoplasm to regulate GJC, rather than through an effect on cell adhesion. First, when EP-cadherin is overexpressed and increased adhesion is observed, embryos display both a ventralized phenotype and reduced dye transfer. Second, a truncated form of β-catenin (i. e., the ARM region), that lacks the cadherin-binding domain, restores dorsal GJC to β-catenin-depleted embryos. Thus, β-catenin appears to regulate GJC independent of its role in cell–cell adhesion, by acting within the cytoplasm through a signaling mechanism...|$|R

PCS and AFM results revealed that, in contrast to larger molecules of DNA, smaller molecules produce more heterodisperse and large nanoparticles when they are condensed with a cationic dendrimer. AFM images also showed that such nanoparticles were spherical. The stability of the antisense content of the nanoparticles was investigated over different charge ratios using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was clear from such analyses that much more than charge neutrality point was required to obtain stable nanoparticles. For cell uptake, self-assembled nanoparticles were prepared with PAMAM G 5 and 5 &rsquo;-FITC labeled antisense and the uptake experiment was carried out in T 47 D cell culture. This investigation also shows that the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was dependent upon the generation and charge ratio of the PAMAM dendrimer, and the antisense concentration had no significant effect on the cytotoxicity.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{majority}} of bacterial genes belong to tight clusters and operons, which complicates gene functional studies using conventional knock-out <b>methods.</b> <b>Antisense</b> agents can down-regulate {{the expression of}} genes without disrupting the genome because they bind mRNA and block its expression. However, {{it is unclear how}} antisense inhibition affects expression from genes that are cotranscribed with the target. Results To examine the effects of antisense inhibition on cotranscribed genes, we constructed a plasmid expressing the two reporter genes gfp and DsRed as one transcriptional unit. Incubation with antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) targeted to the mRNA start codon region of either the upstream gfp or the downstream DsRed gene resulted in a complete expression discoordination from this artificial construct. The same approach was applied to the three cotranscribed genes in the endogenously expressed lac -operon (lacZ, Y and A) and partial downstream expression coordination was seen when the lacZ start codon was targeted with antisense PNA. Targeting the lacY mRNA start codon region showed no effect on the upstream lacZ gene expression whereas expression from the downstream lacA gene was affected as strongly as the lacY gene. Determination of lacZ and lacY mRNA levels revealed a pattern of reduction that was similar to the Lac-proteins, indicating a relation between translation inhibition and mRNA degradation as a response to antisense PNA treatment. Conclusion The results show that antisense mediated repression of genes within operons affect cotranscribed genes to a variable degree. Target transcript stability appears to be closely related to inhibition of translation and presumably depends on translating ribosomes protecting the mRNA from intrinsic decay mechanisms. Therefore, for genes within operons and clusters {{it is likely that the}} nature of the target transcript will determine the inhibitory effects on cotranscribed genes. Consequently, no simple and specific methods for expression control of a single gene within polycistronic operons are available, and a thorough understanding of mRNA regulation and stability is required to understand the results from both knock-down and knock-out methods used in bacteria. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two popular gene {{knockdown}} <b>methods,</b> <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotides (AOs) {{and short}} interfering RNAs (siRNAs) {{are commonly used}} to selectively inhibit gene expression (gene knockdown). This is an extremely valuable tool for functional genomics, however the selection of effective molecules using either method is non trivial. Here we present a number of computational solutions including predictive methods for AO and siRNA molecules, a database of siRNAs of known efficacy and a visualization tool for viewing complex sequence analysis scenarios. Prediction models for AOs based on the machine learning methods Artificial Neural Networks (AOpredict, paper I) and Support Vector Machines (SVMPredict, paper II) {{address the problem of}} AO design by applying computational methods to a database of AOs mined from the literature. These models predict AO efficacy at high accuracy according to cross-validation results. A database of siRNAs was created from the literature and contains 1276 siRNAs targeting 116 genes; this database is available through a web interface (siRNAdb, paper III). The properties of functional and non-functional siRNAs were examined, current siRNA design rules were evaluated and a new prediction method was developed (siSearch, paper IV). The issue of off-target effects was examined in detail and a scoring scheme was developed based on the available experimental data (SpecificityServer, paper V). We identified that 14 - 23 % of siRNAs in the database are likely to elicit off-target effects. A tool for viewing multiple series of biological information and computational predictions was developed to view data from SFS and GFF formats, simplifying the analysis process (Sfixem, paper U). In an independent validation of 63 siRNAs designed by siSearch to target 31 Rat genes, 19 (30 %) had a silencing activity of 90 % or higher and 3 3 (52 %) silenced to a level of 70 % or more. For 25 of the 31 genes siSearch was successful in predicting siRNAs that silence the gene by more than 80 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Insulin-like-growth factor II (IGF II) {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of neoplasm of different tissues, including liver of rats and men. This growth factor is believed to exert its effect during cellular proliferation. During the process of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), different hepatic altered foci appear. They {{are believed to be}} the putative precursors of HCC in rats and in men. Thus, to study the role of the gene in a defined model of hepatocarcinogenesis was the target to elucidate its role in various cancer phenotypes during the entire development stage of cancer, right from earlier preneoplastic lesions to HCC <b>Methods</b> <b>Antisense</b> in situ hybridization technique was used here to characterize the type(s) of foci in which IGF II mRNA had expressed during the development of hepatocarcinogenesis-induced by diethylnitrosamine and promoted by phenobarbital in rats. Various focal lesions have been categorized depending on the stages and sizes along with IGF II expression patterns in them. Immunohistochemical detection for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was made to detect the role of the gene in preneoplastic and neoplastic cellular proliferation. Results IGF II expression was located in the glycogen-storage acidophilic cell foci maximally followed by mixed cell lesions and the least in basophilic lesions. The expression of IGF II was found to be predominant in the HCC. The expression of gene was also located at the peripheral cells of spongiosis hepatis which are believed to be the precursor of ito cell carcinoma. It was noted that there is a direct correlation between IGF II expression and Immunohistochemical detection for PCNA. Conclusion It may be concluded that IGF II gene expression plays an important role during the development of neoplasia and the gene expresses in the sequence of events leading from glycogen-rich-acidophilic lesions to glycogen poor basophilic lesions to HCC with an expression pattern of “high-low-high” in terms of degree of expression. Moreover, the essential role of the gene at the immediate initiation stage of carcinogenesis (first few weeks) and during HCC development cannot be ignored. Thus this expression {{can be used as a}} suitable marker for very early detection of the cancerous process and can save numbers of future cancer victims by very early detection of this disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Intact viruses, {{containing}} no {{viral genome}} but which {{are loaded with}} a therapeutic drug or virus like particles loaded with antiviral drugs are potentially selective drug carriers for the intracellular delivery of therapeutics. These virus constructs {{could be used as}} therapeutics for the therapy of viral infections. For example HI-viruses could be designed, that are loaded with antisense oligonucleotides that avoid replication of the wild type HI virus. The advantage of such antisense oligonucleotide loaded viruses could be the fact that they enter cells and deliver the therapeutics to the host cells of the wild type HI virus. It should be possible to treat all viral infections with this method. Wild type viruses are therapied by a modified virus of the same type or a virus like particle containing a antiviral drug – e. g. an <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotide. This <b>method</b> should work for all viruses. Additionally, a new method is described how intact viruses, containing no viral genome but which are loaded with a therapeutic drug could be obtained. The major obstacle is that the viral genome and viral proteins must be present for virus assembly on the one hand, on the other hand it must be removed subsequent to virus assembly in order to obtain a safe drug carrier. The idea is: Virus assembly takes place {{in the presence of the}} viral genome with subsequent removal of the viral genome. Firstly the viral genome is immobilized on a solid support – comparable to DNA chips. Virus assembly proceeds at the solid support. After virus assembly and drug loading the immobilized viral genome is removed. Viral proteins could be obtained from a packaging cell line. The lysate of such a packaging cell line containing the viral proteins is incubated with the immobilized viral genome to allow virus assembly. The lysate is removed after succesful assembly. The next step would be the loading of the virus with a therapeutic drug. As the viral proteins contain amino and carboxy groups they can be chemically modified by a therapeutic drug. Finally the drug loaded virus is removed from the solid support and with it from the viral genome. This could be a strategy to obtain drug loaded, intact viruses lacking the viral genome...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} gene therapy, {{initially}} {{attributed to a}} technology {{that would allow the}} correction of inherited genetic disease, has evolved over the years. The realization of the immense technical hurdles to achieve genetic correction led to a broadening of the concept now including the transfer of genetic material whose expression will counteract, mitigate or revert a disease phenotype. This capacity to mitigate or revert the disease phenotype has also been achieved by gene expression regulation, {{at the level of the}} DNA or RNA, by the use of antisense or anti-gene technologies. Therefore, at present, gene therapy encompasses not only the introduction and expression of therapeutic genes but also the regulation of gene expression itself which, when mediated by short oligonucleotides, gave rise to the concept of oligonucleotide-mediated gene therapy. The evolution of gene therapy has been in straight connection with developments on gene delivery mechanisms and new nucleic-acid based chemistries, which have allowed progress in oligonucleotide based <b>antisense</b> / anti-gene <b>methods.</b> Gene delivery mechanisms have relied mostly on viral-vehicles due to their known ability to carry and efficiently deliver their own genetic information to cells, a capacity perfected over the period of millions of years. However, production complexity and safety concerns have turned the attention to the possibility to use synthetically derived vehicles to achieve the same goal. These non-viral gene delivery methods, although regarded as safe, have not yet reached the efficiency of viral methods. Increasing efficiency of non-viral vectors is a process involving mechanisms for protection and stabilization of the nucleic acid cargo (DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides) in extracellular biological fluids, as well as the intracellular release of the cargo. The cell itself presents several barriers for nucleic-acids cargo delivery such as the cellular membrane, endocytic vesicle release and the nuclear envelope. In this thesis, in paper I, is presented a novel way to deal with nuclear membrane translocation when the nucleic-acid cargo needs to access the nuclear interior to exert its action. The developed method uses the cells own nuclear import machinery through the use of a synthetic nucleic-acid that acts itself as the nuclear localization signal. In paper II, we tackle the barriers formed by the cell membrane and endosomal vesicle release. In this paper a new type of cell-penetrating-peptide was developed for delivery of a splice-correction oligonucletide (single-stranded oligonucleotide). The CPP efficiently formed complexes with the oligonucleotide through non-covalent interactions, and these complexes were shown to have the capacity to efficiently be taken up by cells and be released from endocytic vesicles thus delivering the oligo to the intracellular environment. We then turn to oligonucleotide-mediated gene regulation. In paper III we explore the use of oligonucleotides to correct an aberrant splicing of the BTK gene leading to loss of BTK protein production. The lack of BTK correlates with the absence of circulating B-cells thus causing the disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia. In paper IV we explore a new LNA (locked nucleic acid) -based oligonucleotide for double stranded DNA targeting and duplex invasion in order to develop a new tool for the anti-gene field...|$|R
