In this way, we have supposed certain parallels between learning difficulties in these concepts and the problems in their formation throughout history. We have carried out a short description of principal epistemological problems, and a design based on a questionnaire containing open questions and personal interviews of secondary and University students. The results obtained seem to indicate that the students have problems to interpret electrification phenomena, which are not easy to explain by a hydrostatic model of electric charge. Likewise, we have verified that few students significantly use the concept of electric field...|$|E

Especially Keith Sawyer's use of emergence in his defence of social explanation will be scrutinized. Therefore, it will be important to distinguish ontological from epistemological emergence. Where Sawyer focuses on ontological emergence, I will argue that social explanation might better be defended by putting emphasis on pragmatic aspects of explanation and considering emergence as an epistemological category...|$|E

In the end, conclusions can be drawn about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> effects of gamification would be as a method of teaching.

The causes of the Irish credit bubble and bust have been exhaustively examined; see for example Connor et al.

Over the next six years, from late 2008 to 2014, the Irish financial sector went through a painful restructuring and slow, modestly successful, recovery. This paper provides an economic analysis of the Irish financial sector’s restructuring and recovery period. The paper considers both domestic and foreign banks operating in Ireland, household and corporate debt, property and other asset markets, and business investment. We <b>analyse</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Irish experience tells us about the economic theory of post-crisis financial sector restructuring and recovery strategies...|$|E
40|$|Although {{conversations in}} {{television}} shows {{are supposed to}} mimic and represent everyday natural speech, they are written for a specific purpose. The aim {{of this paper is}} to find out what maxims are flouted the most in the television series Firefly and <b>analyse</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> effects of these flouts are. Presented here is an analysis of how scripted conversation in the aforementioned television show is constructed. By applying Grice's cooperative principle and his theories on flouting and implicatures, certain patterns emerge that show recurring uses of flouts for specific effects. The results are based on a study of three episodes of the television series Firefly. The results show that the maxim of quality is flouted the most and that the distribution of flouts between characters is somewhat uneven. This suggests that the use of flouts has to do with the personalities of the different characters...|$|E
