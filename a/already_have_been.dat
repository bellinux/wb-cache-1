5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{is most likely}} extinct, and may <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> close to {{extinction}} by the time Europeans arrived in its native area.

I {{would like to}} draw attention to the number of reported orbital hemangiopericytomas and a possible risk factor for this tumor. Accordingly, in the discussion and conclusion section, the authors claimed that thirty-three cases of orbital hemangiopericytomas <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> published. However, with regard to the literature, at least 50 cases of this tumor <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> published. Moreover, the authors affirm that no specific risk factor <b>already</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recognized for this tumor.

Having studied civil law for the highest qualification available, de Coventre moved on to canon law. By 28 March 1351, he possessed a Bachelorate in Decrees (canon law). This was perhaps why on 16 April 1353, he obtained from Pope Innocent VI another grace for himself. Precisely when he obtained his doctorate is unclear, but he was D. U. J. (doctor utriusque juris), Doctor of Both Laws, by 4 September 1359.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The helmet {{appears to}} have been {{deliberately}} folded up and deposited in an artificial stone structure. It is thought to have been used for ceremonial occasions rather than for combat, and may <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an antique {{by the time it was}} buried. It is of the same type as the Newstead Helmet (found in 1905) and its design also has similarities with the Ribchester Helmet (found in 1796) and the Hallaton Helmet (found in 2000), though its facial features are more akin to those of helmets found in southern Europe. Its design may allude to the Trojans, whose exploits the Romans re-enacted in cavalry tournaments.|$|E

5|$|The name Frome {{comes from}} the Brythonic word *frāmā (Modern Welsh ffraw) meaning fair, fine or brisk and {{describing}} {{the flow of the}} river. A monastery built by St. Aldhelm in 685 is the earliest evidence of Saxon occupation of Frome. The Saxon kings appear to have used Frome as a base from which to hunt in Selwood Forest and in 934 a witenagemot was held there, indicating that Frome must <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a significant settlement. One of the first English Kings, Eadred (son of Edward the Elder), died in Frome on 23 November 955.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{wrote that}} UA 8699 {{was the first}} {{marsupial}} to be identified from Madagascar and the first from the Mesozoic of any part of Gondwana. Marsupials {{date back to the}} Eocene in Australia and Africa and to the Paleocene in South America; although Cretaceous marsupials have been recorded there, none of the records are unambiguous. Marsupials were certainly present in the Northern Hemisphere during the late Cretaceous. He interpreted UA 8699 as evidence that marsupials must already have colonized the southern continents by the late Cretaceous, presumably having reached Madagascar through South America and Antarctica. By the late Cretaceous, boreosphenidans must <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the process of replacing archaic mammals like gondwanatheres on the southern continents, as suggested by the presence of Deccanolestes, a placental, in the Cretaceous of India.|$|E
5|$|Baibars {{ventured into}} the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle. When he {{received}} news that year of the Eighth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France, Baibars left for Cairo to avoid a confrontation. After Louis died in 1271 Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers. Before he marched on the castle the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area, including Chastel Blanc. On 3March, Baibars' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers. By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene, the castle may <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> blockaded by Mamluk forces for several days. Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege only one was contemporary, that of Ibn Shaddad, although he was not present at the siege. Peasants {{who lived in the}} area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived he erected mangonels, powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle. In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance, Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers.|$|E

5|$|The River Parrett, the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary are {{believed}} to have been used for riverine bulk transportation of people and supplies in Somerset under Roman and later Anglo-Saxon and Norman occupation. Roman Somerset, which lasted for over 250years until around the beginning of the 5th century, had various settlements, including Bath (Aquae Sulis), Ilchester (Lindinis) and lead mines at Charterhouse; and four roads surrounding the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of two Roman ports on the Parrett. The port at Combwich, on the west bank, was ill-recorded before its destruction by quarrying and erosion. The other at Crandon Bridge on the east bank near where the current King's Sedgemoor Drain enters the Parrett, was in use between the first and the fourth centuries. Evidence of an extensive site with storehouses was found in the mid-1970s, during motorway construction works. The Crandon Bridge site may have been linked by a probable Roman road over the Polden Hills to the Fosse Way, at Ilchester. Ilchester, the largest Roman town in Somerset, was a port with large granaries, sited where the Fosse Way crossed the Ilchester Yeo by means of a paved ford. The Yeo was navigable by small craft {{all the way to the}} Parrett allowing military supplies to be brought by boat directly to Ilchester; however, disembarkation at Crandon Bridge and use of the Polden Hills roadway allowed more rapid movement to Ilchester. The Yeo may <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> straightened and canalised before Roman occupation.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the Crosby Garret helmet was buried are still unclear, but the discoveries made by the post-discovery Tullie House/PAS excavations have provided much more detail about its context. It was clearly deposited within an artificial feature that had been specially constructed; Stuart Noon of the Museum of Lancashire suggests that the feature may have been intended as a memorial of some sort. It was not buried in an isolated spot but within a long-occupied Romano-British farming settlement that had clearly adopted aspects of Roman culture. Given the settlement's proximity to Roman military locations, it is very possible that some of its inhabitants served with the Roman army, which often recruited mounted auxiliaries from among native peoples. The helmet may well <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a valuable antique {{at the time of}} its burial; if the coins found nearby reflect when it was buried, it could have been over a century old by the time it was deposited. It was deliberately broken before being buried in what may have been intended as a ritual sacrifice. The identity of its owner will never be known, but it could have been that a local inhabitant who had formerly served with the Roman cavalry was responsible for the helmet's deposition.|$|E
