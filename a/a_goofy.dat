5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) {{was responsible for the}} rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into <b>a</b> <b>goofy,</b> thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E
5|$|Aladdin and The Lion King {{had been}} the highest-grossing films {{worldwide}} in each of their respective release years. Between these in-house productions, Disney diversified in animation methods and produced The Nightmare Before Christmas with former Disney animator Tim Burton. With animation becoming again an increasingly important and lucrative part of Disney's business, the company began to expand its operations. The flagship California studio was split into two units and expanded, and ground was broken on a new Disney Feature Animation building adjacent to the main Disney lot in Burbank, which was dedicated in 1995. The Florida satellite, officially incorporated in 1992, was expanded as well, and one of Disney's television animation studios in the Paris, France suburb of Montreuil– the former Brizzi Brothers studio– became Walt Disney Feature Animation Paris, where <b>A</b> <b>Goofy</b> Movie (1995) and significant parts of later Disney films were produced. Also, Disney began producing lower cost direct to video sequels for its successful animated films using the services of its television animation studios under the name Disney MovieToons. The Return of Jafar (1994), a sequel to Aladdin and a pilot for the Aladdin television show spin-off, {{was the first of}} these productions. Walt Disney Feature Animation was also heavily involved in the adaptations of both Beauty and the Beast in 1994 and The Lion King in 1997 into Broadway musicals.|$|E
50|$|Though Muir's {{sense of}} humor was often obvious with Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves often brought out <b>a</b> <b>goofier</b> type of humor: their albums contain comedy skits by a reptilian lover named Aladdin Sarsippius Sulemenagic Jackson the third.|$|R
5000|$|An {{excerpt of}} the lyrics is sung by Goofy in the 1937 American {{animated}} short film Clock Cleaners produced by Walt Disney. <b>As</b> <b>Goofy</b> is washing the bell of the clocktower, he repeatedly sings [...] "Loudly the bell in the old tower rings".|$|R
50|$|In 1989, {{not long}} after Robert Trujillo joined Suicidal Tendencies, Muir and Trujillo formed Infectious Grooves, a funk metal band that often brought out <b>a</b> <b>goofier</b> type of humor: their albums contain comedy skits by a reptilian lover named Aladdin Sarsippius Sulemenagic Jackson The Third. To date, the Infectious Grooves have {{released}} four albums.|$|R

25|$|Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer, <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> and dim-witted but lovable slacker and Ann's ex-boyfriend. Pratt was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} guest star and the character Andy was initially meant to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make him a regular cast member starting with season two.|$|E
25|$|His next roles {{included}} voicing Goofy's son Max Goof in Disney's <b>A</b> <b>Goofy</b> Movie (1995), {{as well as}} in {{the sequel}} An Extremely Goofy Movie (2000) and also had a role in White Squall (1996). Marsden also did the voice of Garrett Miller on Extreme Ghostbusters and the younger versions of Shere Khan and King Louie on Jungle Cubs, which was a babyfication of Disney's hit film Jungle Book and also reprised Max Goof on Disney's House of Mouse.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{landing on}} the island and {{defeating}} a group of pirates, Goofy and Max learn that the pirates have mistaken Pete for their captain, Keelhaul Pete, who had been swallowed by a whale a long time ago. <b>As</b> <b>Goofy</b> and Max explore of the island and fighting more pirates, Pete and PJ keep up the misconception, as Pete enjoys being the pirate king.|$|R

25|$|Mickey Dugan, {{better known}} as The Yellow Kid, was a bald, snaggle-toothed barefoot boy who wore an {{oversized}} yellow nightshirt and hung around in a slum alley typical of certain areas of squalor that existed in late 19th-century New York City. Hogan's Alley was filled with equally odd characters, mostly other children. With <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> grin, the Kid habitually spoke in a ragged, peculiar slang, which was printed on his shirt, a device meant to lampoon advertising billboards.|$|E
25|$|Although {{conventional}} wisdom {{holds that the}} Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match. Following a summer where he teamed with Kane to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of <b>a</b> <b>goofy,</b> broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following SummerSlam in 1998, after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.|$|E
25|$|At {{the annual}} {{masquerade}} ball, Fausto is bedazzled by the mature beauty of Giulia Curti (Lída Baarová), his employer’s wife. Alberto, in drag and half-drunk, executes a surrealistic dance across the ballroom floor with <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> carnival head made of papier-mâché. Returning home at dawn, Alberto is devastated {{to find his}} sister running off for good with her married lover. Fausto’s naive attempt to seduce Giulia results in his being humiliated and then fired by her husband. In revenge, he steals the statue of an angel in gold paint from his former employer, enlisting the loyal Moraldo to help him sell it to a monk. Suspicious, the monk turns down the offer. Fausto ends up giving the statue to a simple-minded peasant (Silvio Bagolini) who sets the angel on a mound outside his hovel, caressing it.|$|E

5000|$|Alternative Press {{called the}} {{finalized}} cover [...] "the pop-punk Abbey Road," [...] calling it [...] "instantly recognizable, extremely identifiable and absolutely iconic in certain circles". Wentz elaborated on {{the selection of}} that particular image and not the record's original cover: [...] "It makes me wonder: How many {{of these things are}} just accidental moments? ... If we had a bigger budget, we probably would have ended up with <b>a</b> <b>goofier</b> cover that no one would have cared about." ...|$|R
25|$|In 2010, Baillie {{teamed up}} with singer Adam Ant (whose drummer Hayley Leggs had been a member, {{alongside}} Baillie, of burlesque troupe The Satanic Sluts) to compose the song Gun in Your Pocket, about Ross, Brand and the entire affair. He intended to release the song as the lead single for his ninth album Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter (with a rerecording of early 1980s outtake Who's <b>A</b> <b>Goofy</b> Bunny Then? as the B-side in tribute to the recently deceased Malcolm McLaren). Gun in Your Pocket was performed live {{on at least one}} occasion, at a guerilla gig (one of several he played around this time) at London's Troubadour Café on 2 April 2010, and was setlisted, (but not performed) at Adam's Pirate Metal Extravanganza concert at the Scala on 30 April 2010, while the recording received a club play when Adam DJ'd at the Family Affair clubnight in Shoreditch, London on 24 April.|$|E

500|$|A {{writer from}} Rolling Stone gave a mixed review for the video saying that [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> and fun clip, though the faceless cheerleaders in the {{background}} are more creepy than amusing." [...] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from Attitude believed that the last scene showing Madonna throwing off a baby doll implied that she was moving away from domestic life and embracing a party attitude. Amanda Dobbins from New York found some [...] "attempted weirdness" [...] in the video with the scenes of the triple Marilyns and the baby on Madonna's lap, but added that [...] "Madonna still looks crazy bonkers good".|$|E

500|$|A lot of {{the special}} was more [...] "edgy" [...] and dark than {{what had been done}} {{previously}} on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. A major reason behind this was the peril, danger, and conflict that constructed the plot so heavily. McCracken explains, [...] "When we start a show {{one of the first things}} we think about is tone, is this <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> one, is it a serious one, whatever it may be we stay true to that tone. This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way. This was the first show/special on Cartoon Network to receive a TV-PG rating." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Thompson {{made her}} Hollywood debut playing <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> doctor {{alongside}} Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in the blockbuster Junior. Although the male pregnancy storyline was poorly received by most critics and flopped {{at the box}} office, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the lead trio. She returned to independent cinema for a lead role in Carrington, which studied the platonic relationship between artist Dora Carrington and writer Lytton Strachey (played by Jonathan Price). Roger Ebert remarked that Thompson had [...] "developed a specialty in unrequited love", and the TV Guide Film & Video Companion commented that her [...] "neurasthenic mannerisms, which usually drive us batty, are appropriate here".|$|E

[...] She also said the episode has [...] "the ideal balance of cuteness and sheer terror – like SpongeBob running from a mysterious character, saying, 'Well, that place will be there tomorrow. I guess I'd better keep walking. Running. Better start running. Running. Sprinting! Yes, I just gotta keep sprinting!' (Before he hits a wall; 'Sitting, sitting, bleeding.')"

500|$|Castellaneta {{thought of}} the idea of Barney sobering up early in the series. He wrote a script {{together}} with his wife Deb Lacusta. They offered their script to showrunner Al Jean. Jean liked the story, but felt that it was too similar to a script the writers were already working on, [...] "Duffless", so he turned it down. Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes. Their script became the eleventh season episode [...] "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses", which first aired April 9, 2000. The episode was directed by Neil Affleck, who said that he had [...] "a vested interest in getting Barney sober." [...] However, some of the writing staff was opposed to the episode as they felt Barney sober would not be funny. Castellaneta commented, [...] "He's still <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> man-child...he's still got 15 years of booze left in his veins." ...|$|E

His line [...] "I'm a doctor, not a door stop", is an allusion to the Star Trek original series character Dr. Leonard McCoy. Picardo's fellow Voyager actor Ethan Phillips, who played Neelix, cameos as a nightclub Maitre d' in the holodeck scene. Phillips recalled that the producers wanted the fans to be left guessing whether he was the person who played Neelix or not, as he did {{not appear in the}} credits; [...] "It was just kind of <b>a</b> <b>goofy</b> thing to do."
