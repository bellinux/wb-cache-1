The factory was located {{on the third floor of}} a four-story building, which also featured residential units. Investigators determined that the first and second floors of the structure housed additional illegal factories. The factory destroyed in the fire was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and all of the people who were killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not considered unusual in India. There was had just one emergency exit, and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away with leather goods. The building was located in the Tannix International, Topsia, in the South 24 Parganas district of Greater Kolkata region.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} of Western Orthodox parishes {{has been compared}} with {{the status of the}} autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches (often called Uniate by Orthodox Christians) in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. For centuries, there have been hierarchical churches in full communion with Rome. Eastern Catholics, despite usages in continuity with, and closely resembling, those of the Orthodox, largely share a common dogma with Latin Catholics, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> called uniatism. Analogously, the Western Rite Orthodox share the same faith as their Byzantine Rite Orthodox brethren despite a different liturgical rite.|$|E

Women graduates are consistently highly {{represented in the}} life sciences, often at over 50%. However, their representation in the other fields is inconsistent. In North America and much of Europe, few women graduate in physics, mathematics and computer science but, in other regions, the proportion of women may be close to parity in physics or mathematics.

25|$|Nevertheless, {{there is}} a range of ulterior motives for Israel's denial of Palestinian statehood. If Palestine were {{declared}} a state, then immediately, Israel, by its present occupation of the West Bank will be in breach of the United Nations Charter. Palestine, as a state, could legitimately call upon the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter to remove Israel from the occupied territories. Palestine, as a state, {{would be able to}} accede to international conventions and bring legal action against Israel on various matters. Palestine could accede to various international human rights instruments, such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It could even join the International Criminal Court and file cases against Israel for war crimes. It would be a tinderbox of <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> highly likely to precipitate conflict in the Middle East.|$|E

500|$|Well-known {{newspapers}} include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and USA Today. Although {{the cost}} of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have [...] "alternative weeklies" [...] to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon. Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.|$|E
500|$|... "Roadrunners" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of the show's eighth season. Harrisson praised the character development in [...] "Roadrunners" [...] {{and noted that}} the episode [...] "effectively brings [...] together as partners." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two note that, [...] "for the first half-hour, this works as a slow burn horror story... It's the transition of Gillian Anderson's performance from wry exasperation to outright paranoia... which makes this so effective." [...] Shearman and Pearson did, however, slightly criticize the cutting of John Doggett's role to a minimum. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that it [...] "is an episode that’s dedicated to helping us move past the Mulder era." [...] He praised the creepiness of Gilligan's script, {{as well as the}} characterization of Scully, writing that even though she is in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> over her head, she is still smart in her attempts to escape; he also praised Anderson's acting. However, VanDerWerff was more critical of the final scene, noting that it made Doggett come across as [...] "kind of an asshole". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, saying it features a [...] "return to the body horror stories that had worked so well in the early seasons". Spragg added that [...] "Roadrunners" [...] is [...] "certainly close" [...] to the highly acclaimed first-season episode [...] "Ice".|$|E

Arthur Mathews has described Seinfeld as a major influence on the comedy of Father Ted, with himself and Linehan being [...] "big fans" [...] of the show. Father Ted also contains references to pop culture, and some film parodies, such as the episode [...] "Speed 3".|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} a personality variable in motivation losses in group performance. Differences in {{the endorsement of the}} ‘Protestant Work Ethic’ can account for variance in motivation losses in group work. Male student scores on the Mirels- Garrett Protestant Work Ethic Scale and Ho’s Australian Work Ethic Scale as well as different preferences for reward distributions were used as moderator variables. The study tested motivation losses in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> designed to provoke the free-rider effect and in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> designed to provoke the sucker-effect. Results showed that different facets of the Protestant Work Ethic have different effects on behavior in group work situations: Whereas approval of the equity principle moderates the sucker-effect, belief in work as a value moderates the free-rider effect...|$|R

2500|$|Anxiety is {{an emotion}} {{characterized}} by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death. Anxiety {{is not the same}} as fear, which is a response to a [...] real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat. Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration. Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Emergent-Norm Theory - {{according}} to Ralph Turner and Lewis Killian (1957), crowds begin as collectivities composed {{of people with}} mixed interests and motives. Especially {{in the case of}} less stable crowds—expressive, acting and protest crowds—norms may be vague and changing, as when one person decides to break the glass windows of a store and others join in and begin looting merchandise. When people find themselves in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> vague, ambiguous, or confusing new norms [...] "emerge" [...] on the spot and people follow those emergent norms, which may be at odds with normal social behavior. Turner and Killian further argue that there are several different categories of participants, all of whom follow different patterns of behavior due to their differing motivations.|$|E
2500|$|This {{can make}} a {{considerable}} difference, depending on the details; for example, an object in free fall exerts little if any force on its support, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly referred to as}} weightlessness. However, being in free fall does not affect the weight according to the gravitational definition. Therefore, the operational definition is sometimes refined by requiring that the object be at rest. However, this raises the issue of defining [...] "at rest" [...] (usually being at rest with respect to the Earth is implied by using standard gravity). In the operational definition, the weight of an object at rest {{on the surface of the}} Earth is lessened by the effect of the centrifugal force from the Earth's rotation.|$|E

Diderot, from the very beginning of his career, had turned his thoughts to this intricate subject. In his letter on Deaf Mutes (1751) he had stated the problem--to collect the common beauties of poetry, painting, and music; to show their analogies; to explain how the poet, the painter, and the musician render the same image; to seize the fugitive emblems of their expression.

That's how we come to have delayed until this Spanish fleet is fetched round from La Guayra by a guarda-costa; and if ye hadn't lost La Foudre, and so reduced our fleet from three ships to two, we should even now be able to fight our way through with a reasonable hope of succeeding.
