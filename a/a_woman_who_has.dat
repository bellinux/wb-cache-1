5|$|<b>A</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{elevated}} {{blood lead}} levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk}} of a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|Guillory {{was to be}} a lead in the {{television}} series The Oaks, expected to begin airing in 2008. She joined Bahar Soomekh, Matt Lanter, Romy Rosemont, Jeremy Renner, Michael Rispoli and Shannon Lucio in the series, which follows the intertwining stories of three families—a young couple in 1968 who have lost a child, a family of four in 1998, and a pregnant couple in 2008—who are haunted by the same spirit in their house. The television series began filming on 5 November 2007 on location in Pasadena, California. Guillory will play Jessica, the 2008 couple's neighbour, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> Asperger syndrome who went to school with the husband (and father-to-be) and shares a secret with him.|$|E
5|$|Woo {{had over}} 90 days to shoot The Killer which was {{nearly double the}} amount of time that the average Hong Kong film was shot in the late 1980s. Woo went into filming with only a short {{treatment}} for the film and wrote the details of the script while filming. During promotion periods for the film, Woo described the film as a tribute to Martin Scorsese and French director Jean-Pierre Melville. Woo cites Melville's Le Samouraï as an influence on the story. Woo borrows plot elements for the film, including the set-up where Jef enters a nightclub and looks at the female singer. Woo also described the influence of a Japanese film, Narazumono, about a killer (Ken Takakura) who only kills delinquents. When a mob tricks him into killing an innocent person, he swears revenge but then meets <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> tuberculosis and wants to go home. The killer promises the woman that he will take her home after getting his revenge.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she {{can not find a}} job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E

25|$|When being {{discharged}} from emergency care, clinicians {{provide information about}} pregnancy {{as well as other}} complications such as infection and emotional trauma. While <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> become pregnant during the past 48 hours will test negative for pregnancy in an HCG pregnancy test (unless she was already pregnant before the rape), pregnancy resulting from the rape can be detected at the two-week follow-up visit.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{also argues}} that {{contradictory}} beliefs {{show that there is}} a connection between beliefs and knowledge. He gives the example of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> learned her husband is dead but cannot bring herself to believe her husband is dead. She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|E

25|$|Considering {{the events}} of her life, {{literary}} allusions to Wu Zetian may carry several connotations: <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> inappropriately overstepped her bounds, the hypocrisy of preaching compassion while simultaneously engaging in a pattern of political corruption and vicious behavior and ruling by pulling strings in the background. For many centuries, Wu {{was used by the}} establishment as an example of what can go wrong when a woman is placed in charge.|$|E
25|$|Abortion is {{sometimes}} attempted by causing {{trauma to the}} abdomen. The degree of force, if severe, can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage. In Southeast Asia, there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage. One of the bas reliefs decorating the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{been sent to the}} underworld.|$|E
25|$|An 8th-century Sanskrit text instructs women {{wishing to}} induce an {{abortion}} to sit over {{a pot of}} steam or stewed onions.

25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychological {{explanation of}} domestic violence is that it represents male attempts to control female reproduction and ensure sexual exclusivity. Violence related to extramarital relations is seen as justified {{in certain parts of}} the world. For instance, a survey in Diyarbakir, Turkey, found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off. Similar feelings may at times be generated in a situations where one partner is more financially successful.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Purge {{focuses on}} two main females, {{both of whom}} reviewers have commented on as complex and are {{integral}} to understanding the themes of the book. The novel begins with Aliide Truu, an elderly woman who has survived many of {{the horrors of the}} Soviet occupation of Estonia. The Aliide who the reader first meets has alienated herself from the local people, though strongly self-reliant. Though cloaked in a rough exterior, she represents <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> weathered considerable hardship. She has hardly anything in the way of motherly instinct, especially in regards to the other main character, Zara.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{may be used}} where <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> eggs but no uterus {{and wants}} to have a biological baby; she would require the help of a gestational carrier or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> no eggs but a uterus may utilize egg donor IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called embryo donation). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though neither she nor the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational surrogacy arrangements must make sense of an entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations. Surrogates have the experience of carrying a baby that they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new conceptualizations of body and self.|$|E
