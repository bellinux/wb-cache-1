Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

25|$|In his 2009 book The Keynes Solution, post-Keynesian {{economist}} Paul Davidson makes another historical {{case for}} the effectiveness of Keynesian policy, referring {{to the experience of}} the United States during the Great Depression. He notes how economic growth and employment levels increased for four successive years as the New Deal policies were pursued by President Roosevelt. When government spending was cut back in 1937 due to concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> deficit, all the gains were lost in one year, and growth only resumed after spending increased again from 1938, as a response to growing acceptance of deficit spending in a recession and later due to World War II. For Davidson, this experience validates the view that Keynesian policy has the power to deliver full employment and prosperity for a government's entire labor force. Davidson also wrote that both price stability and employment in the Keynesian age were superior even to the classical gold standard era that was terminated by World War I.|$|E

500|$|The {{script was}} {{finished}} by October 1990, {{five months after}} Nimoy was approached to write the story. Several months were spent working out the budget; because of the disappointing box office returns of The Final Frontier, Paramount {{wanted to keep the}} sixth film's budget approximately the same as the previous installment, although the script called for space battles and new aliens. Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley's salaries were cut with the understanding that they would share in box office profits. Meyer estimated that almost two months were spent fighting with the studio <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> [...] "To some degree, almost every area of the production was affected by the cuts—but the script was the one thing that did not become a casualty," [...] Meyer said. The original budget hovered around $41million. While not expensive for a Hollywood production, this would have presented a risk due to Star Trek films' niche audience and lower international appeal. The final budget came in at $27million.|$|E
500|$|Johar, {{who is also}} {{a costume}} designer, wanted to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema with this film. He and his friend Manish Malhotra, the film's costume designer, made trips to London for costumes, much to the chagrin of his father and {{producer}} Yash Johar, who was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> Many of the costumes in the film prominently displayed logos from designers such as DKNY and Polo. In addition to the designer fashions, Johar also created a somewhat fantastical world where the students speak Hinglish and enjoy a pristine college campus, where there is no crime or hate, and traditional Hindu values are pervasive. Johar admitted that {{the look and feel of}} the college scenes in the film were patterned after Beverly Hills 90210, saying, [...] "The art, the costumes, tilt toward the West, but the soul of the film is Indian." [...] He hired Sharmishta Roy as art director, and told her to produce something similar to Riverdale High School of the Archie Comics, with some 90210 influence as well. Johar said of the outcome, [...] "If you see KKHH, Shahrukh plays Archie, Rani Mukherji plays Veronica, and Kajol played Betty. It was exactly that. And the principal looked like Weatherbee, and Ms. Grundy was Archana Puran Singh." [...] Johar also hired Farah Khan to do the choreography, Jatin-Lalit to provide the music, Santosh Thundiyil as cinematographer, and Nikhil Advani as his associate director. Shabina Khan assisted Manish Malhotra with costume design.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>The</b> debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgets</b> {{being and}} not being {{has been going on}} for 40 years. On one hand advocates for abolishing <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> have been criticising <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> arguing for example that it is a waste of {{resources}} that only provides an illusion of control. Whereas on the other hand, business students are still taught to use <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> and previous studies show that companies are still holding on to it. Hence, there seems to exist a budget paradox.   Purpose The purpose of this thesis is to examine the use and perception of fixed budgets within larger companies of today and to clarify the reality behind <b>the</b> debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> usefulness of <b>budgets.</b> Further, to get an understanding of what purposes are deemed as important when using different control measures, and how well these are fulfilled.     Method This study is predominantly quantitative with a deductive approach, as it via a self-administrative web survey has collected data from 58 publicly traded companies in Sweden. The questionnaire has consisted of open- and close-ended questions, to provide a deeper understanding of the role <b>the</b> fixed <b>budget.</b>   Conclusion <b>The</b> overall percentage of companies that have abolished <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> has increased when compared to previous studies, but the majority of 81 % still use <b>the</b> fixed <b>budget</b> in one way or another. Out of the participating companies, 67 % stated that they supplement <b>the</b> fixed <b>budget</b> with other control measures, and as the percentage of those considering abolishing <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> have decreased, <b>the</b> overall perception of <b>the</b> fixed <b>budget</b> has improved. ...|$|R
