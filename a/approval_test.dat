50|$|Engineers don’t always {{follow a}} smooth flow from step to step even in {{ordinary}} manufacturing. Most manufacturing design decisions {{tends to be}} highly iterative (http://www.instructionaldesign.org/models/iterative_design.html). It’s common to create a design that meets customer <b>approval,</b> <b>test</b> it, make changes to meet specifications, and resubmit at certain stages or milestones in order for approval to proceed to the next stage. Engineer to order, due to its nature, is even more complex and client-centric. This requires on-going documentation, but the approach typically involves all of the following steps.|$|E

30|$|Hybrid {{technology}} {{is seen by}} many as a potential solution to reduce vehicle emissions in cities. However type <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> of hybrid vehicles measure emission levels comparable to those of conventional cars in the same market segment. It has been argued that type <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> do not represent the reality of emission in cities therefore, to quantify the real emission of hybrids and to compare them with those of conventional vehicles in the same conditions, an emission measurement campaign was organised.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that a conventional vehicle can emit {{more on the}} road than during type <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> while the reverse can be true for hybrids. However the driver has a great influence on all vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second class}} of problem cases involve {{coordination}} problems, where it seems intuitively obligatory {{for us to}} do the same thing that everyone around us is actually doing, but where a universal practice test does not require this coordination. E.g., consider the behavior [...] "drive on the left side the road--no matter what!" [...] If everyone does this, your doing so again produces more good than harm; but if not everyone does this (some driving on the right), then your doing so is likely to cause a great deal more harm than good. Like the rule of absolute pacifism, this passes some versions of a universal practice test, but fails a universal applicability test, because while everyone's practicing the behavior is not harmful, its practice by some persons while some other people are not doing so does produce significant harm. In no case will a behavior condemned by a universal practice test be acceptable for a universal <b>approval</b> <b>test</b> using the same criteria, so the latter is always at least as strong as the former.|$|E
50|$|It {{involved}} several teams being allocated {{a budget}} and several weeks {{to construct a}} road-legal vehicle which, if classified as a car, must pass the Single Vehicle <b>Approval</b> <b>test.</b> However, {{a few of the}} teams managed to avoid taking the SVA test, either by using an unmodified car chassis, such as the Chaos Crew in Series 2, who placed the body shell from an ice cream truck onto the unchanged chassis of a Range Rover, or by using their livelihood in order to classify their vehicle as an agricultural show-piece (The Barley Pickers in series 1). The teams then drove to various tests in-convoy across the UK where they were given eight hours at a local scrapheap to modify their vehicles for the testalthough, for all but the final test, the vehicles had to be returned to road-legal condition afterwards. In Series 3, four teams were given vehicles and participated in 5 challenges in the Galloway Forest Park. They had to adapt the vehicles to perform two different tasks in each episode. This series was unusual for Scrapheap in that the build time was added together with the time taken to complete each stage.|$|E
5000|$|During 1945 and 1946, Tadeusz Chyliński {{took part}} in a {{competition}} of the Civil Aviation Department for developing a training motor glider. He won first prize for his project, the HWL Pegaz motor glider. From 1946 to 1947, Tadeusz Chyliński based on an agreement with the Department of Civil Aviation (Departament Lotnictwa Cywilnego) with the help of Bronisław Żurakowski, developed the construction plans for the [...] "Pegaz". The motor glider was designed to train class [...] "C" [...] glider pilots in stand-alone (without dual-controls) motor piloting, as well as for training and pursuing aeronautic sports in inexpensive aircraft. The engine for the [...] "Pegaz" [...] was designed by Stefan Gajecki, who was well known for designing skimming boat motors.

In 1948, the work was taken over by Warsaw's Gocław Aircraft Plant 6.The motor glider (one for flying and two unassembled) was finished in spring of 1948. The engineless plane was on display at the Aviation Day in 1948. [...] "Pegaz" [...] was test-flown on July 16, 1949, piloted by Bronisław Żurakowski and Jerzy Szymankiewicz. The factory and certification test were conducted at the National Aviation Institute in Warsaw and completed in May 1950. [...] "Pegaz" [...] was in three air shows on Aviation Day in 1949, 50, 51.

30|$|Hybrids {{are seen}} as {{intrinsically}} clean vehicles to save fuel and emissions. To measure whether hybrids do consume and emit less than conventional vehicles several research works have been made. Most of them compare hybrid and conventional powertrains by testing them on the type-approval-procedure-driving-cycles. European type <b>approval</b> <b>tests</b> (on the NEDC—New European Driving Cycle) of hybrid vehicles measure emission levels of the same magnitude of conventional cars in the same market segment; emitting and consuming slightly less but far from the promised halving of consumption and elimination of emissions [1, 2].

40|$|Abstract: An {{alternative}} vapor was explored {{to replace}} carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) for testing breakthrough times of cartridges and canisters of gas masks in the National <b>Approval</b> <b>Test</b> of Respirators. Cyclohexane was single {{out as a}} candidate for the alternative vapor out of six vapors: trichloroethylene, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, toluene and cyclohexane from the viewpoints of similarity of vapor pressure and water-solubility to CCl 4, lower toxicity than CCl 4, and technical feasibility in generating an airflow of 30 L/min containing the vapor ranging from 300 to 5000 ppm. Breakthrough times of cartridges and canisters were examined by generating cyclohexane vapor in a test airflow of 30 L/min in comparison with CCl 4 vapor under various test conditions with different vapor concentrations and relative humidities (RH). As the results, the breakthrough times of the cartridges and canisters for cyclohexane were found to almost coincide with those for CCl 4 under all examined range of concentrations and RH. By an increase of humidity from 50 %RH to 80 %RH, the cartridges showed significant shortening of breakthrough times for both of CCl 4 and cyclohexane, but the susceptibility of the breakthrough time of cyclohexane to humidity was also similar to that of CCl 4. It was, therefore, concluded that cyclohexane can be recommended as the alternative vapor of CCl 4 for testing the breakthrough times of gas mask cartridges and canisters in the National <b>Approval</b> <b>Test...</b>|$|E
