Childs later remarked that Verity Lambert [...] "didn't want to come in <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> the same old routine – the kick bollock and scramble action adventure stuff that made the early name of the company". He continues to be one of British television's top producers, responsible for such shows as Chancer (1991), Inspector Morse (1987–2000), Sharpe (1993–2006), Kavanagh QC (1995–2001) and Lewis (2006–present).|$|E

"Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song.

[...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> the last half.'

He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all." ...|$|E

Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E

500|$|As Planet Terror took shape, Tarantino {{developed}} {{the story for}} Death Proof, based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would [...] "death-proof" [...] their cars. As {{long as they were}} driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60mph (97km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his [...] "death-proof" [...] car. Tarantino remembers, [...] "I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> what I do.

I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R.

500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E

500|$|Having {{not been}} in a proper studio since [...] "Deadweight", Beck felt anxious to [...] "go in <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> some stuff real quick", and {{compiled}} several songs he had had for years. Beck and his bandmates hammered out fourteen songs in fourteen days, although just twelve made it onto the album, 1998's Mutations. Beck decided on Nigel Godrich, producer for Radiohead's OK Computer the previous year, to be behind the boards for the project. Godrich was leaving the United States for England in a short time, {{which led to the}} album's quick production schedule—"No looking back, no doctoring anything". The whole point of the record was to capture the performance of the musicians live, an uncharacteristic far-cry from the cut-and-paste aesthetic of Odelay. Though the album was originally slated for release by Bong Load Records, Geffen intervened and issued the record against Beck's wishes. The artist then sought to void his contracts with both record labels, and in turn the labels sued him for breach of contract. The litigation went on for years and it remains unclear to this day if it has ever been completely resolved. Beck was later awarded Best Alternative Music Performance for Mutations at the 42nd Grammy Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Sebastian cites {{a number}} of musicians as his musical influences, {{including}} Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Chicago, and Boyz II Men. His music has crossed many genres, including pop, R, funk, smokey soul, gospel, jazz, pop rock, Memphis soul covers, '60s soul/pop and electro R. He has also stated an interest in recording dance and Bollywood albums. While Sebastian's first three albums showed elements of soul, it was The Memphis Album which consolidated {{his reputation as a}} soul musician. Reviewers almost unanimously agreed he had captured the spirit and essence of the Memphis soul classics. It was the critical and public reception for The Memphis Album which gave Sebastian the confidence to stay with the soul genre for his fifth album Like It Like That. In an interview with The Age he said he was told early in his career, [...] "If you self-indulge <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> what you're into, you're going to corner your market.
