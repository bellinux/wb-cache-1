5|$|Cane Ashby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard, who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As the World Turns but was recommended {{for a role}} on The Young and the Restless instead.

Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12, 2007 as an Australian bartender {{in search of his}} family. Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) but the character's background was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell in 2009, re-establishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson (Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis).|$|E
