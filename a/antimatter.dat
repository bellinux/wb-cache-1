5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding <b>antimatter</b> particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding <b>antimatter</b> particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance {{between the number of}} matter and <b>antimatter</b> particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no <b>antimatter</b> atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the <b>antimatter</b> counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor {{results show}} that gamma rays and <b>antimatter</b> {{particles}} (positrons) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms. It is suggested that the <b>antimatter</b> positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGF). TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning. The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays. About 500 TGFs may occur every day worldwide, but mostly go undetected.|$|E
5|$|In October 2017, {{scientists}} reported {{further evidence}} that matter and <b>antimatter,</b> equally produced at the Big Bang, are identical, should completely annihilate each other and, as a result, the universe should not exist.|$|E
5|$|The Universe is {{composed}} almost completely of dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter. Other contents are electromagnetic radiation (estimated {{to be from}} 0.005% to close to 0.01%) and <b>antimatter.</b> The total amount of electromagnetic radiation generated within the universe has decreased by 1/2 in the past 2 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of <b>antimatter.</b> Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E
5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 {{seconds after}} the Big Bang, during a period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and <b>antimatter</b> in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.|$|E
5|$|The {{charge on}} {{electrons}} and protons is opposite in sign, hence {{an amount of}} charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated {{with the work of}} Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by <b>antimatter,</b> each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and <b>antimatter</b> in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{building}} on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul Dirac produced {{a model of}} the electron– the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field. In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 {{a model of the}} vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the <b>antimatter</b> counterpart of the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than <b>antimatter.</b> It is generally assumed that {{when the universe was}} young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{branching}} into different timelines {{that can be}} experienced in any order, depending on the choices made by the player. While completing {{the first set of}} puzzle rooms, the participants learn of a pandemic caused by Radical-6, a virus that slows down its victims' cognition and drives them to suicide. Depending on the given timeline, the characters also discover either the murdered body of an old woman or <b>antimatter</b> bombs. The other participants' backstories are explored: Luna is a humanoid robot, tasked with maintaining the Nonary Game; K was raised by Zero Sr. inside of the facility; Tenmyouji willingly joined the game, together with his adopted grandson Quark, after being promised a chance to find a certain woman; Alice and Clover are government secret agents tasked with stopping the religious cult Free the Soul; and Dio is a member of Free the Soul.|$|E
5|$|A more {{coherent}} Walter explains that, {{according to}} the Observer September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled {{back in time to}} take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an <b>antimatter</b> device to wipe out the Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find the equipment to free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's hand for an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of licorice, a telltale sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels away from the city, Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as a necklace.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over <b>antimatter</b> in the present universe.|$|E
25|$|Dazzler hits <b>Antimatter</b> with {{everything}} {{she has to}} no avail but it gives Danvers time to activate a containment device that she designed. When <b>Antimatter</b> overloads the device, Singularity has Minoru remove Antimatter's tracking ability and transports the team to The Peak. As <b>Antimatter</b> eventually reaches The Peak, She-Hulk orders Singularity to stay behind {{while the rest of}} the team leaves to parley with <b>Antimatter.</b> After talks fail, <b>Antimatter</b> fatally wounds Dazzler and in turn She-Hulk decapitates <b>Antimatter.</b> Angered by Dazzler's death, Singularity leaves to confront a recovered <b>Antimatter</b> one-on-one.|$|E
25|$|After <b>Antimatter</b> kills one of Medusa's soldiers, she {{releases}} Singularity and teleports <b>Antimatter</b> to the moon. Realizing {{that physical}} attacks are having {{little effect on}} <b>Antimatter,</b> Singularity transports She-Hulk, Medusa and herself to Japan to seek the help of Minoru. When <b>Antimatter</b> returns, Minoru casts a spell that causes him to be temporarily unmade. The spell buys the women some time during which Danvers suggests that <b>Antimatter</b> maybe susceptible to intense levels of light particles. They then travel to Miami to recruit Dazzler just as <b>Antimatter</b> remerges.|$|E
25|$|As Singularity fights <b>Antimatter,</b> Dr. Tempest Bell, The Peak's lead scientist, {{develops}} a bomb capable of destroying <b>Antimatter</b> but denoting {{it will also}} kill Singularity. She-Hulk, Minoru and Danvers go to reinforce Singularity, while Medusa places the bomb inside <b>Antimatter.</b> Just as the bomb explodes, a revived Dazzler arrives with a dimensional teleporter and whisks Singularity away from the blast. With <b>Antimatter</b> destroyed, the team celebrates at a diner when Singularity senses a disturbance as remnants of <b>Antimatter</b> tear open portals to other worlds.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>antimatter</b> {{was first}} used by Arthur Schuster in two rather {{whimsical}} letters to Nature in 1898, in which he coined the term. He hypothesized antiatoms, as well as whole <b>antimatter</b> solar systems, and discussed the possibility of matter and <b>antimatter</b> annihilating each other. Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of <b>antimatter</b> in that it possessed negative gravity.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of Secret Wars, Singularity awakes in the primary Earth-616 universe and quickly spots Carol Danvers but Danvers does not recognize her. Unbeknownst to Singularity, she is being pursued by a similar being named <b>Antimatter.</b> While Danvers confronts <b>Antimatter,</b> Singularity flees to New York City. With <b>Antimatter</b> still in pursuit, Singularity locates She-Hulk, who does not remember her either, and asks for help. As the pair fight <b>Antimatter,</b> Medusa arrives with reinforcements and takes Singularity into custody.|$|E
25|$|Isolated {{and stored}} anti-matter {{could be used}} as a fuel for interplanetary or {{interstellar}} travel as part of an <b>antimatter</b> catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion or other <b>antimatter</b> rocketry, such as the redshift rocket. Since the energy density of <b>antimatter</b> is higher than that of conventional fuels, an antimatter-fueled spacecraft would have a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than a conventional spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation {{as to why}} the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and <b>antimatter.</b> This asymmetry of matter and <b>antimatter</b> in the visible universe {{is one of the great}} unsolved problems in physics. The process by which this inequality between matter and <b>antimatter</b> particles developed is called baryogenesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antimatter</b> {{cannot be}} stored in a {{container}} made of ordinary matter because <b>antimatter</b> reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and {{an equal amount of}} the container. <b>Antimatter</b> in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields, in a device called a Penning trap. This device cannot, however, contain <b>antimatter</b> that consists of uncharged particles, for which atomic traps are used. In particular, such a trap may use the dipole moment (electric or magnetic) of the trapped particles. At high vacuum, the matter or <b>antimatter</b> particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a magneto-optical trap or magnetic trap. Small particles can also be suspended with optical tweezers, using a highly focused laser beam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antimatter</b> {{particles}} bind {{with one}} another to form <b>antimatter,</b> just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) and an antiproton (the antiparticle of the proton) can form an antihydrogen atom. Physical principles indicate that complex <b>antimatter</b> atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements.|$|E
25|$|With {{the first}} {{successful}} production of <b>antimatter,</b> in particular anti-hydrogen, {{a new approach to}} test the weak equivalence principle has been proposed. Experiments to compare the gravitational behavior of matter and <b>antimatter</b> are currently being developed.|$|E
25|$|An <b>antimatter</b> rocket {{would have}} a far higher energy density and {{specific}} impulse than any other proposed class of rocket. If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make <b>antimatter</b> in the quantities required and store it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light. Whether <b>antimatter</b> propulsion {{could lead to the}} higher speeds (>90% that of light) at which relativistic time dilation would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers as perceived by an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of <b>antimatter</b> that would be required.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antimatter</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons. A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing <b>antimatter</b> in large enough quantities, {{and there is no}} evidence that it will ever be feasible. However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of <b>antimatter</b> in the Cold War, and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{all matter}} {{observable}} from the Earth {{seems to be}} made of matter rather than <b>antimatter.</b> If antimatter-dominated regions of space existed, the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and <b>antimatter</b> regions would be detectable.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{explicit}} introduction, the book depicts various fictional experts explaining matters in science, technology, and history in which critics {{have pointed out}} inaccuracies. An {{example of this is}} the <b>antimatter</b> discussions, wherein the book suggests that <b>antimatter</b> can be produced in useful and practical quantities and will be a limitless source of power. CERN published a FAQ page about Angels & Demons on their website stating that <b>antimatter</b> cannot be used as an energy source because creating it takes more energy than it produces.|$|E
25|$|Speculating that {{production}} and storage of <b>antimatter</b> should become feasible, two further issues {{need to be}} considered. First, in the annihilation of <b>antimatter,</b> much of the energy is lost as high-energy gamma radiation, and especially also as neutrinos, so that only about 40% of mc2 would actually be available if the <b>antimatter</b> were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally. Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of mc2 yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.|$|E
25|$|Antimatter-initialized fusion uses {{small amounts}} of <b>antimatter</b> to trigger a tiny fusion explosion. This has been studied {{primarily}} {{in the context of}} making nuclear pulse propulsion, and pure fusion bombs feasible. This is not near becoming a practical power source, due to the cost of manufacturing <b>antimatter</b> alone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antimatter</b> in {{the form}} of anti-atoms {{is one of the most}} {{difficult}} materials to produce. Individual <b>antimatter</b> particles, however, are commonly produced by particle accelerators and in some types of radioactive decay. The nuclei of antihelium have been artificially produced with difficulty. These are the most complex anti-nuclei so far observed.|$|E
25|$|The Feynman–Stueckelberg {{interpretation}} {{states that}} <b>antimatter</b> and antiparticles are regular particles traveling backward in time.|$|E
25|$|Why {{are there}} {{apparent}} {{violations of the}} symmetry between matter and <b>antimatter?</b> See also CP violation.|$|E
25|$|Satellite {{experiments}} have {{found evidence of}} positrons and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. These {{do not appear to}} be the products of large amounts of <b>antimatter</b> from the Big Bang, or indeed complex <b>antimatter</b> in the universe. Rather, they appear to consist of only these two elementary particles, newly made in energetic processes.|$|E
25|$|A Bell 222A {{was used}} to {{evacuate}} a canister of <b>antimatter</b> from St. Peter's Square in the 2009 film Angels & Demons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antimatter</b> {{may exist}} in {{relatively}} large amounts in far-away galaxies due to cosmic inflation in the primordial {{time of the}} universe. <b>Antimatter</b> galaxies, if they exist, {{are expected to have}} the same chemistry and absorption and emission spectra as normal-matter galaxies, and their astronomical objects would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish. NASA is trying to determine if such galaxies exist by looking for X-ray and gamma-ray signatures of annihilation events in colliding superclusters.|$|E
25|$|CERN {{releases}} new particle-collision {{data from}} the Large Hadron Collider which {{may help explain why}} matter became dominant over <b>antimatter</b> in the early universe.|$|E
