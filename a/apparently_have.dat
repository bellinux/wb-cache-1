5|$|With one day {{left before}} {{his meeting with}} Lipnick to discuss the movie, Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance. She visits him at the Earle, and after she admits that she wrote most of Mayhew's scripts, they <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> sex; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so. When Barton awakens the next morning, he, again, hears {{the sound of the}} mosquito, finds it on Audrey's back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey does not respond, Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid {{contacting}} the police. After a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Barton tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie, who announces he is going to New York for several days. Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him to watch it.|$|E

25|$|Clutch size {{ranges from}} six to eight eggs; {{incubation}} time is 25 to 27 days. Greater sage-grouse <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> high rates of nest desertion and nest predation. Data from several sage grouse studies indicate a range of nesting success from 23.7 to 60.3%, with predation accounting for 26 to 76% of lost nests.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{while most}} {{women in the}} United States <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> a {{negative}} view of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies {{seem to indicate that}} women from some Asian cultures have an understanding of menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy. Postmenopausal Indian women can enter Hindu temples and participate in rituals, marking it as a celebration for reaching an age of wisdom and experience.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{attempts}} to broadcast international versions of TWC – {{apart from the}} Australian version of The Weather Channel (now Sky News Weather Channel) – have failed. TWC also operates websites that provide localized forecasts in Brazil, France, Germany, India, Latin America and the United Kingdom, but some of these sites <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> not been developed further since 2003. The Weather Channel also shares radar imagery and forecasts with The Weather Network in Canada, particularly for The Weather Channel's Canadian forecasts.|$|E
25|$|End-of-ball bonus: After each ball is played, {{the player}} scores bonus points {{depending}} on how many times certain features have been activated or the numbers of items that the player may obtain. Some games award a seemingly arbitrary number of points that depend {{on the number of}} times any switch has been hit. Virtually all games have the ability to assign a multiplier to the bonus. Most games cap the bonus multiplier at 5x or 10x, although more modern games <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> no limit.|$|E

25|$|The stadium's record {{attendance}} {{was recorded in}} 1936, when 43,596 spectators were in attendance to watch the club play a Second Division match against Aston Villa; this was discovered to <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> been beaten when 44,526 watched Argyle host Huddersfield Town on 13 January 1934 in the FA Cup, although it is unclear if the source is reliable. The record average attendance for a single season, 23,290, came in the 1946–47 season. The stadium was selected as part of England's 2018 FIFA World Cup bid by the FA in December 2009. The ground has played host to England youth internationals in the past, and a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup match between Saint-Étienne and Manchester United in 1977. Aside from football-related uses, Home Park has played host to rugby and athletics {{in the past and}} now puts on live music during the summer, with Elton John, George Michael and Rod Stewart among the acts who have performed at the ground.|$|E
25|$|The Solifugae <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> neither venom glands nor any venom-delivery {{apparatus}} {{such as the}} fangs of spiders, stings of wasps, or venomous setae of caterpillars (e.g., Lonomia or Acharia species). One 1978 {{study is}} frequently quoted, in which the authors report detection of an exception to this rule in India, in that Rhagodes nigrocinctus had venom glands, and that injection of the secretion into mice was frequently fatal. However, no supporting studies have confirmed either {{the facts of the}} matter, such as by independent detection of the glands as claimed, or the relevance of the observations if correct. Even the authors of the original account denied having found any means of delivery of the putative venom by the animal, and the only means of administering the material to the mice was by parenteral injection. Given that many non-venoms such as saliva, blood and glandular secretions can be lethal if injected, and that no venomous function was even speculated upon in this study, there is no evidence as yet for even one venomous species of solifugid.|$|E
25|$|While local (to a {{database}} system) relaxed serializability methods compromise serializability for performance gain (and are utilized {{only when the}} application can tolerate possible resulting inaccuracies, or its integrity is unharmed), it is unclear that various proposed relaxed global serializability methods which compromise global serializability, provide any performance gain over commitment ordering which guarantees global serializability. Typically, the declared intention of such methods has not been performance gain over effective global serializability methods (which <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> been unknown to the inventors), but rather correctness criteria alternatives {{due to lack of}} a known effective global serializability method. Oddly, some of them were introduced years after CO had been introduced, and some even quote CO without realizing that it provides an effective global serializability solution, and thus without providing any performance comparison with CO to justify them as alternatives to global serializability for some applications (e.g., Two-level serializability). Two-level serializability is even presented as a major global concurrency control method in a 2010 edition of a text-book on databases (authored by two of the original authors of Two-level serializability, where one of them, Avi Silberschatz, is also an author of the original Strong recoverability articles). This book neither mentions CO nor references it, and strangely, apparently does not consider CO a valid Global serializability solution.|$|E

500|$|In Final Fantasy X the [...] is an {{important}} song. Its fictional history started as a song of defiance turned scripture and has numerous variations that is played throughout the game throughout Yuna's journey; primarily as {{the music of the}} temples. Though the Hymn's words <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> no discernible meaning within the context of Spira, the lyricist and scenario writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a small puzzle with the lyrics, using Japanese syllables. When properly deciphered, they form sentences that translates thus: Pray to Yu Yevon. [...] Dream, fayth. [...] Forever and ever, grant us prosperity. The hymn was composed and arranged by Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu.|$|E
500|$|At {{his high}} school reunion, Peter pretends to be a secret agent-astronaut-millionaire who wears a cowboy hat to impress his classmates, but the truth comes out when he meets Tom Brady. He {{subsequently}} gets drunk and {{has to make a}} run for the bathroom, knocking over everyone between him and the bathroom. Brady is impressed and gets Peter a spot on the New England Patriots football team as the starting center. Peter is soon fired for showboating in a game versus the Dallas Cowboys, driving on to the field then performing a massively-choreographed version of the song [...] "Shipoopi" [...] after scoring one touchdown. He is traded to the London Silly Nannies, who <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> no clue on how to play football. Peter decides to turn them around and challenges Brady to a game between the Silly Nannies and the Patriots. On the opening kickoff, Peter's teammates become terrified of the Patriots rushing toward them and run away, leaving Peter to face them alone. He tries and is immediately tackled. However, Brady compliments Peter on having the nerve to stand up to them.|$|E

2500|$|The authors {{state that}} {{when a person is}} {{suddenly}} frightened, then has a place the effect shown in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that [...] "all the crescents" [...] on the right, which <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> been emitted earlier than others, do not show anything other than [...] "the livid grey of fear; but a moment later the man is already partially recovering from the shock, and beginning to feel angry that he allowed himself to be startled." [...] The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the [...] "mingling of anger and fear," [...] while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that [...] "already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 and 2002 the {{brothers}} published five papers in peer-reviewed physics journals, including Annals of Physics and Classical and Quantum Gravity. [...] The {{controversy over the}} Bogdanovs' work began on October 22, 2002, with an email sent by University of Tours physicist Max Niedermaier to University of Pittsburgh physicist Ezra T. Newman. [...] Niedermayer suggested that the Bogdanovs' Ph.D. theses and papers were [...] "spoof," [...] created by throwing together string theory and theoretical physics jargon: [...] "The abstracts are delightfully meaningless combinations of buzzwords ... which <b>apparently</b> <b>have</b> been taken seriously." [...] Copies of the email reached American mathematical physicist John Baez, and on October 23 he created a discussion thread about the Bogdanovs' work on the Usenet newsgroup sci.physics.research, titled [...] "Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax?" [...] Baez was comparing the Bogdanovs' publications to the 1996 Sokal affair, in which physicist Alan Sokal successfully submitted an intentionally nonsensical paper to a cultural studies journal in order to criticize the incoherence of postmodernism. The Bogdanovs quickly became a popular discussion topic, with most respondents agreeing that the papers were flawed. [...] The Bogdanovs' background in entertainment lent some plausibility {{to the idea that}} they were attempting a deliberate hoax, but Igor Bogdanov quickly denied the accusation. [...] The online discussion was quickly followed by media attention; The Register reported on the dispute on November 1, 2002 [...] and stories in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Nature, The New York Times, and other publications appeared soon after.|$|E
