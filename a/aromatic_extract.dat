Prior to the trials, odor differences between the two plant species, the two <b>aromatic</b> <b>extracts,</b> and the straw pellets sprayed with the two <b>aromatic</b> <b>extracts</b> were verified using sensory analysis performed by 30 human panelists. Since odor differences observed among fresh samples were still detectable in <b>aromatic</b> <b>extracts</b> and moistened pellets, the extraction method was considered effective in reproducing plant odors. Strawpellets sprayed with either distilled water (W) or ryegrass (R) or clover (C) <b>aromatic</b> <b>extracts</b> were used to assess flavor preferences of 12 female Rossa Mediterranea goats. Sprayed pellet preference was evaluated in two sessions conducted in two consecutive weeks. Each session consisted of three two-choice presentations performed on three consecutive days. In both sessions, food intake, proportion of food intake, time spent feeding, and proportion of time spent feeding were significantly affected by pellet type (0 : 05 > P > 0 : 001). In particular, straw pellets sprayed with ryegrass extract were highly selected compared to those sprayed with clover (0 : 01 > P > 0 : 001) or water (0 : 01 > P > 0 : 001). In addition, in the second session, the clover extract was preferred to distilled water (0 : 05 > P > 0 : 01). The results of this study gave two main indications: first, goat selectivity for ryegrass against clover was consistent even when straw pellets sprayed with odors of these plants were offered, and secondly, the addition of <b>aromatic</b> <b>extracts</b> to straw pellets increased the preference for pellets...|$|R

The polycyclic aromatic content (PCA) of the extracts {{was determined by}} dimethyl sulphoxide extraction and ranged from 3. 7 - 9. 2 % w/w. The five extracts were evaluated for their potential to induce cutaneous and systemic neoplasia in female mice derived from Carworth Farm No 1 strain (CF 1). The test substances were applied undiluted (0. 2 ml per application) to the shorn dorsal skin twice weekly for up to 78 weeks, with 48 mice in each treatment group and 96 in the untreated control group; two further groups, each of 48 mice, were similarly treated either with a non-hydrotreated commercial <b>aromatic</b> <b>extract</b> (PCA content, 19. 7 % w/v) or with a low dose of benzo(a) pyrene (12. 5 micrograms/ml acetone). The mice were housed individually in polypropylene cages in specified pathogen free conditions. The incidence of cutaneous and systemic tumours was determined from histological analysis of haematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections. The results were correlated with the PCA content of the extracts and compared with those from female mice exposed to a non-hydrotreated commercial <b>aromatic</b> <b>extract.</b> Four of the hydrotreated extracts were carcinogenic for murine skin; the two products with the lower PCA contents were less carcinogenic than the products with the higher PCA contents and all were less carcinogenic than the commercial extract. One extract with the lowest PCA content was non-carcinogenic. Thus refining by severe hydrotreatment was an effective method of reducing the carcinogenic potential of petroleum aromatic extracts. Although other physicochemical properties may influence the biological activity of oil products, the PCA content determined by dimethyl sulphoxide extraction may be a useful indicator of the potential of oil products to induce cutaneous tumours in experimental animals.

40|$|The oils are {{generally}} {{added in the}} rubber compounds to improve processing properties, low temperature properties, dispersion of fillers, and to reduce cost. The conventionally widely used oils in tire compounds are Distillate <b>Aromatic</b> <b>Extract</b> (DAE) oils, which contain {{a high concentration of}} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs that can be released from tires by tire wear are harmful to health and environment, so safe process oils are needed to replace aromatic oil in tire compounds. This thesis comparatively studies the influences of PAH-free petroleum based extender oils, i. e. Treated Distillate <b>Aromatic</b> <b>Extract</b> (TDAE) and Mild Extracted Solvate (MES), versus the DAE oil on the properties of NR-based truck tire tread compounds and NR/SBR-based passenger tire tread compounds. Oil characterization data are analyzed, and the influence of the oils on the properties of unfilled compounds is also elucidated. The different chemical structures and compositions of DAE-, TDAE- and MES-oils that affect on their characteristics, have influences on their compatibility with rubbers and the properties of the corresponding rubber compounds. The theoretical predictions based on differences in solubility parameters (Δδ) and the experimental swelling study agree well in that MES is less compatible with NR and SBR compared with TDAE and DAE. The difference of cure characteristics, due to the presence of nitrogen-and sulfur-heterocyclic species in DAE oil, as observed in unfilled compounds, is diminished in the carbon black-filled compounds. The mechanical properties of both unfilled and carbon black filled compounds are little influenced by the change of oil types, but the properties are changed according to the oil loadings, basically due to the dilution effect. The different glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the oils affect the Tg’s of the rubber vulcanizates and hence the viscoelastic-related properties, i. e. abrasion resistance, rebound resilience, heat build-up and loss tangent. The replacement of toxic DAE by safe TDAE and MES enhances the elastic response of the materials. Based on the processing properties of the uncured compounds and mechanical as well as dynamic properties of the vulcanizates, TDAE oil provides better overall properties as replacement for DAE oil than MES...|$|E

The fore-mentioned properties of the oil allow the prediction of its behavior in a rubber compound. It was known from literature that the addition of oil causes {{a shift in the}} glass transition temperature (Tg) of the compound [2]. Therefore, the study was focused on the variation in the α-relaxation process or Tg of a rubber compound upon addition of TDAE. The conventional techniques for determination of Tg such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) as well as more sophisticated relaxation studies using Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) were used to characterize the TDAE-extended S-SBR and BR compounds.

To achieve this improvement it is necessary a good compatibility between the base bitumen and the polyethylene.

The PACs in refinery streams can cause effects in repeated-dose and developmental toxicity studies. In a 13 -week dermal study, light paraffinic DAE had several dose-related effects involving multiple organs; no-observed-effect level was 2000 mg/kg/d, reflecting differences due to variation in PACs. The NOAELs for RAEs were 500 mg/kg for 90 -day studies and 2000 mg/kg for developmental toxicity.

40|$|More than 800 {{aromatic}} compounds {{have been}} identified in wine, some of them at the ng/l level. Wine, therefore, constitutes a very complex matrix, from which it is difficult to isolate a specific aroma character. Gas chromatography–olfactometry (GC–O) applied to wine extracts is used to characterize odor-active zones that are often treated in a hierarchical way by Aroma Extract Dilution Analysis (AEDA). The aromatic impact of the volatiles is evaluated, generally by determining perception thresholds. This methodology has provided convincing results concerning wine flavors, but it does have its limitations. Forinstance, data on b-damascenone have demonstrated that these methods could reach their limits for this volatile, in particular, because of the non-quantitative representation of aroma extracts of wines, and because of the difficulty to accurately determine the perception threshold in wines for a compound already present. For b-damascenone, we have shown that its very low detection threshold with GC–O, its wide range, and its dependence on the composition of the medium resulted in overestimating its direct impact on the aroma of wine. Another way to facilitate the characterization of aromatic compounds was, therefore, investigated. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed for the analysis of wine extracts.

Six differently originated rejuvenators were added to extracted binder at 12 % dose including <b>aromatic</b> <b>extract,</b> waste engine oil, tall oil, organic oil, waste vegetable oil and waste vegetable grease. The rejuvenation potential of these products was evaluated by performing multiple empirical as well as performance tests and the results compared with a virgin binder. The rejuvenators proved to soften the extracted binder to the level of virgin and the kinematic viscosity results show that the optimum compaction temperature can be reduced by 15 °C to 25 °C compared to extracted binder. Performance Grade (PG) test results showed that none of the rejuvenators reduced the high PG of extracted binder to the level of virgin binder indicating increased rutting resistance. At the same time most are able to reduce low PG from - 12 °C of the extracted binder to at least the required - 22 °C. The low temperature performance correlated well with penetration index, proving that thermal cracking should not be an issue at appropriate rejuvenator dose.

All the three compounds show similar extrusion process behaviors in which the TDAE based compounds shows a marginal higher values than the m-EVO as its lower mooney viscosity lead to a better flow.

It is present in concentrations of 80-90% in clove bud oil and at 82-88% in clove leaf oil.|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple apparatus is described for extracting essential oils from aromatic plant material by atmospheric solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) without {{the addition of}} any solvent or water. Isolation and concentration of volatile compounds were performed by a single stage. The product solutions of volatile compounds were directly analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The essential oils from aromatic herbs (basil, crispate mint, thyme) and spices (ajowan, cumin, star anise) extracted by SFME for 30 minutes and 1 hour, {{were similar to those}} obtained by conventional hydro-distillation (HD) for (respectively) 4 and 8 hours. Substantially higher amounts of oxygenated compounds and lower amounts of monoterpenes hydrocarbons are present in the essential oils of the <b>aromatic</b> plants <b>extracted</b> by SFME in comparison with HD. Solvent-free microwave extraction is clearly advantageous to conventional distillation in terms of rapidity, efficiency, cleanliness, substantial saving of energy, and is environmentally friendly...|$|R
50|$|Euglossa viridissima is {{a species}} of green orchid bee from Central America in which the males have two teeth on their mandibles. The very similar bee that was first {{observed}} in Florida in 2003 {{was found to have}} three such teeth. Sequencing data from a mitochondrial gene was unable to separate E. viridissima and E. dilemma, indicating they are closely related and form a clade within Euglossa. However, microsatellite allele frequencies varied between the two groups. Males of these bees store <b>aromatic</b> compounds <b>extracted</b> from various environmental sources in pouches on their hind legs. Certain characteristic compounds present as main ingredients in these perfumes in E. dilemma were found to be absent in E. viridissima. Electroantennography found differences between the groups in olfactory sensitivity to isomers of HNDB (2-hydroxy-6-nona-1,3-dienyl-benzaldehyde). It was therefore concluded that E. dilemma is a cryptic sister species of E. viridissima.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY- In {{order to}} avoid the {{permanent}} and long use of synthesis acaricides, different alternatives have been proposed. Among plant or animal products, and among some molecules authorised in organic agriculture, organic acids and <b>aromatic</b> plants <b>extracts</b> are already developed in beehives. Formic acid, present naturally in the honey in high contents, is used in evaporation for one or two days or in slow evaporation several days. If the quantity of evaporated acid ranges from 7 to 10 gr per day, the average efficiency of the acaricide overpasses 95 %, without serious disturbances in the colony. However, nowadays no evaporation system guarantees this result, regardless of weather conditions or hive structure. Essential aromatic oils, containing thymol, menthol or camphor, or these molecules themselves, are good acaricides when they are used under correct conditions. These vary depending on the region and climate, something that explains the need to have complementary experiments i...|$|R
