[...] Despite these changes, Mexico continues to suffer great social inequality and lack of opportunities.

The Yellow Terror is {{threatening}} this world to-day. It is looming vast and ominous on that distant horizon. I do not know {{what is going to be}} the result of that Yellow Terror, but our government has had no hand in evoking it, and let's be happy in that and proud of it.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. {{has fallen}} behind Japan, the EU and South Korea in power grid technology, and <b>has</b> <b>made</b> it a {{national}} priority {{to improve its}} energy demand and supply management. The Pentagon has noted in several reports that reliance on oil and other diplomatically dangerous sources is a growing US national security concern. Consuming more energy per unit productivity than any other developed nation {{is no longer an}} option for the US according to the Obama <b>administration</b> which <b>has</b> <b>made</b> it a high priority to implement 'smart grid' technologies that are impossible to deploy without secure reliable and universal wired networking. The prior Bush <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> powerline networking a priority to ensure that broadband access would be at least co-extant with the power grid's reach.|$|R

The British were unresponsive and the results {{amounted}} to little. The matter was sidelined and successive Kenyan <b>administrations</b> <b>have</b> been seemingly willing to accept the territorial status quo and their de facto territorial control, even if the Kenyan influence did diminish after the relocation of the Sudan People's Liberation Army to Sudan in the 1980s-90s.|$|R

Obama asserted {{that he had been}} reluctant to intervene but that intervention had been championed by Clinton and Susan Rice. Obama cited the lack of preparation the <b>Administration</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> for a post-Gaddafi Libya, lack of followup by European countries and greater-than-expected intertribal divisions in Libya. However, Clinton's stance is that the intervention was beneficial because it avoided another Syria-like scenario.|$|R

This article argues that both <b>administrations</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a basic error {{in the choice of}} law. Wartime privileges may be claimed when armed conflict conditions prevail as defined by international law. These privileges are not triggered by declarations or policy preferences...|$|R
