25|$|According to United States {{data for}} 2004, in about 66% {{of men and}} 47% of women, the first symptom of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a heart attack or}} sudden cardiac death (death within one hour of onset of the symptom).|$|E
25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to relate the C. pneumoniae-mediated inflammatory state with <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases,</b> providing inconsistent results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify whether C. pneumoniae {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by enhancing inflammation. 12 case-control, 6 cross-sectional, and 7 prospective studies with a total of 10, 176 patients have been included in this meta-analysis. Odds Ratio (OR) with a 95 % confidence interval was used to assess the seroprevalence of C. pneumoniae and differences between levels of inflammatory markers were assessed by standard mean differences. Publication bias was performed to ensure the statistical power. hsCRP, fibrinogen, interleukin- (IL-) 6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ showed a significant increase in patients with atherosclerosis compared to healthy controls (P < 0. 05), along with a higher seroprevalence of C. pneumoniae (OR of 3. 11, 95 % CI: 2. 88 - 3. 36, P < 0. 001). More interestingly, hsCRP, IL- 6, and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in C. pneumoniae IgA seropositive compared to seronegative atherosclerotic patients (P < 0. 0001). In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests that C. pneumoniae infection may contribute to <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> by enhancing the inflammatory state, and, in particular, seropositivity to C. pneumoniae IgA, together with hsCRP, fibrinogen, and IL- 6, may be predictive of <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> risk...|$|R

The underlying atherosclerosis starts early in life, progresses slowly and is often extensive {{by the time of}} clinical presentation.

Themain outcomemeasures were mortality from all causes, all cancers, and all <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> (ASCVD). Hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age and potential confounders. During follow-up, 48, 757 deaths occurred, with 15, 507 deaths from cancer and 11, 676 from ASCVD. For men and women, white blood cell count was associated with all-cause mortality and ASCVD mortality but not with cancer mortality. In healthy nonsmokers, a graded association between a higher white blood cell count and a higher risk of ASCVD was observed in men (highest vs. lowest quintile: hazard ratio 2. 10, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 50, 2. 94) and in women (hazard ratio 1. 35, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 17, 1. 56). In healthy smokers, a graded association between a higher white blood cell count and a higher risk of ASCVDwas also observed in men (highest vs. lowest quintile: hazard ratio 1. 46, 95 %confidence interval: 1. 25, 1. 72).

40|$|ObjectivesIn this study, {{our goal}} was to {{determine}} if human resistin plays a role in regulating the uptake of atherogenic low-density lipoproteins in human hepatocytes. BackgroundSerum levels of resistin, an adipose tissue–derived adipokine, are increased in human obesity and are positively correlated with <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases.</b> However, the function of resistin in humans is enigmatic. MethodsHuman hepatocytes (HepG 2 and primary) were treated (24 h) with the following: 1) purified human resistin at various concentrations, with and without lovastatin; and 2) obese human serum with elevated resistin levels or serum from which resistin was removed via antibody-immunoprecipitation. The effect of the treatments on cellular low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels were determined by using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. ResultsResistin, at physiological levels observed in human obesity, down-regulated hepatocyte LDLR expression substantially (by 40 %). A key mechanism by which human resistin inhibited LDLR levels was by increased cellular expression of the recently identified protease, PCSK 9, which enhances intracellular LDLR lysosomal degradation. The quantitatively important role of human resistin in LDLR expression was demonstrated by antibody-immunoprecipitation removal of resistin in human serum, which decreased serum stimulation of hepatocyte LDLRs markedly (by 80 %). Furthermore, resistin diminished statin-mediated up-regulation of the LDLR by 60 %, implicating resistin in the relative ineffectiveness of statins in selective target populations. ConclusionsThese results reveal {{for the first time that}} resistin is a highly attractive therapeutic target in ameliorating elevated serum low-density lipoprotein and, thereby, <b>atherosclerotic</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> in obese humans...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Although {{essential}} for cell physiology, an increase or depletion of body iron has harmful effects on health.

The results of the literature on the effect of iron deficiency and overload on vascular health are critically reviewed in this study from a pathogenic and clinical point of view. ...|$|R
