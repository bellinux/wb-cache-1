40|$|Inoculation of {{herpes simplex}} virus on the {{forehead}} and/or snout of hairless mice resulted in a significantly lower mortality rate than inoculation of the skin in the lumbosacral area. Latent {{herpes simplex virus}} infections were detected in all forehead-inoculated and in 90 % of snout-inoculated mice. Phosphonoacetic acid was highly effective in preventing the development of skin lesions, and no latent infections were detected when phosphonoacetic acid ointment was applied 3 h after infection. Neither <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> nor <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> monophosphate prevented the establishment of latent infections in the trigeminal ganglia, although they protected the mice from the fatal outcome of the infection.

Manifestations of toxicity were mainly neurological and ranged from pain syndromes to tremors and, rarely, seizures. Suppression of numbers of lymphocytes was also noted. All effects were reversible with time. The extent of toxicity was dependent upon the dosage of <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside.</b> Treatment with interferon appeared to potentiate the occurrence of toxicity with <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside.</b> Arabinofuranosylhypoxanthine serum levels increased in a dose-dependent manner and tended to accumulate in interferon-treated hepatitis patients during a course of therapy.

Interferon production is also a normal antiviral response. It is therefore important to examine the combined actions of interferon and antiviral arabinosides for possible synergy or antagonism. We have examined the antiviral activities of human fibroblast interferon, <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside,</b> hypoxanthine arabinoside, and <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> 5 ′-monophosphate individually, using plaque inhibition of vaccinia and herpes simplex type 2 viruses in human skin fibroblast cultures. By combining doses of interferon and arabinosides that, acting alone, give intermediate degrees of plaque inhibition, {{we were able to}} compare the combined antiviral activity with that calculated from the activity of each inhibitor alone, assuming that the activities are statistically independent. Our results show that the plaque-inhibitory activities of interferon and the arabinosides tested are statistically independent. The results also show that the arabinosides do not destabilize the antiviral state previously induced by interferon, and that interferon pretreatment does not interfere with subsequent arabinoside action in infected cells.

In a preliminary study for toxicity, intramuscular injection of ara-AMP at 15 mg/kg per day as a single injection for 5 days to two normal patas monkeys caused no detectable local reaction, no weight loss or changes in serum transaminase levels, and no hematological abnormalities. When this dose was given {{in the treatment of}} four simian varicella virus-infected patas monkeys, no effect was observed on the clinical course of infection, as compared with four infected monkeys which received phosphate-buffered saline. Treatment was begun 43 h after virus inoculation and was continued for 16 days. Toxicity of intravenously administered ara-AMP at 100 to 50 mg/kg per day for 5 days to pairs of uninfected patas monkeys was evident by hematological and hepatic histological alterations, as well as the death of one monkey in each pair. No gross evidence of toxicity occurred in two monkeys which received 20 mg of ara-AMP per kg per day.

The concentration of Ara-A required to completely suppress plaque development (total plaque inhibitory concentration 100; TPIC 100) was greater than 10 μg/ml. However, when ADA activity was inhibited, the TPIC 100 was 0. 5 μg/ml or less. Chromatographic assay of arabinosylpurines in the media provided evidence that <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> was rapidly deaminated to 9 -β-d-arabinofuranosylhypoxanthine by the cellular monolayers, in the absence of animal serum, and that the rate of deamination, at 5 μg/ml, by the cells was equal to the rate of diffusion of Ara-A across the cellular membrane.

40|$|Treatment of {{hepatitis}} B virus-associated membranous nephropathy with <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> and thymic extract. Previously {{we found that}} corticosteroid treatment in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) -associated membranous nephropathy (HBVMN) {{was not associated with}} a favorable outcome. To distinguish the differences of the HBV DNA in macrophage, T and B cells among HBVMN patients with or without corticosteroid treatment, serial studies at different time points were investigated. HBV DNA appeared as an “episomal” molecule as with 3. 2 kb in macrophage, T and B cells. This molecule disappeared after 12 months among HBVMN patients without corticosteroid treatment. HBV DNA, by contrast, appeared as episomal form even three years later in T cells, with frequent proteinuria among HBVMN patients with corticosteroid treatment. This finding indicates that the use of corticosteroids leads to a potential risk of enhancing HBV viral replication in T cells. We studied 24 HBVMN patients who had previously received corticosteroid treatment and had persistent proteinuria, who were administered combination therapy with <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> for two weeks and thymic extract (Thymostimulin) for six months to decrease urine protein loss and obtain seroconversion. These 24 patients had heavy (22 of 24, 91. 6 %) or mild (2 of 24, 8. 4 %) proteinuria prior to <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> and thymostimulin treatment. All 24 patients demonstrated HBV DNA in mononuclear cells and simultaneously exhibited sera positive with HBsAg and HBeAg. In contrast, after treatment only one case (4. 2 %) had heavy and two cases (8. 4 %) mild proteinuria; HBV DNA was demonstrated in macrophage (4 of 24, 16. 7 %), T cells (9 of 24, 37. 5 %), and B cells (6 of 24, 25 %) as well as serum (24 of 24, 100 %) prior to treatment. The decreases to 16. 7 %, 37. 5 %, 25 % and 41. 6 % in the macrophage, T cell, B cell, and serum respectively, were statistically significant (P< 0. 01) in each instance. In addition, six cases with complete remission of proteinuria changed their hepatitis B markers. Four cases (16. 7 %) changed from HBe (+) /anti-HBe (-) to HBe (-) /anti-HBe (-).

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{susceptibility}} of type 1 and type 2 strains of Herpesvirus hominis to 9 -β-d-arabinofuranosyladenine (<b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside,</b> ara-A) {{was measured in}} a system where deamination was inhibited. Under these conditions, {{it was possible to}} measure the activity of low concentrations of ara-A. It was determined that plaque inhibitory concentration for type 1 viruses was less than 3 μg/ml for all strains tested. The plaque inhibitory concentration for 7 of 10 type 2 strains was also less than 3 μg/ml. The method used identified and controlled the interaction between antiviral agent (ara-A) and the indicator system, human skin fibroblastic cells. Otherwise, metabolism of ara-A resulted in rapid enzymatic degradation and loss of antiviral activity...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four {{episodes of}} genital herpes in 22 men, all {{confirmed}} by virus isolation, were studied {{in a double}} blind trial. They were treated either with 3 % <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> (Ara-A) in petrolatum ointment base or with the base alone applied four times daily for one week. The lesions were counted and sketeched on days 0, 2, and 7. There was no demonstrable advantage {{to be gained from}} the use of Ara-A ointment. The results of the Papanicolaou smears and virus isolation agreed in the diagnosis of 75 % of cases. The presence of continuing lesions or fresh ones in some patients after the acute phase of the initial or recurrent attack of herpes necessitates the man taking precautions on resuming sexual intercourse...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{improving}} the chemotherapeutic index of <b>adenine</b> <b>arabinoside</b> 5 -monophosphate (ara-AMP) {{in the treatment of}} chronic hepatitis B, this drug was conjugated with lactosaminated serum albumin (L-SA), a neoglycoprotein which only enters into hepatocytes where it is digested in lysosomes. In mice, the L-[3 H]SA-ara-AMP conjugates, intravenously injected, selectively penetrated the liver, only small quantities were taken up by cells of spleen, bone marrow, intestine, and brain. After administration of the conjugate to mice with Ectromelia virus hepatitis, ara-AMP was selectively concentrated in liver in a pharmacologically active form. If L-SA-ara-AMP conjugates behave in man as in mouse, their administration to patients with chronic hepatitis B should result in a selective concentration of ara-AMP in liver with a more efficient inhibition of virus replication accompanied by lower toxicity for other tissues...|$|E
