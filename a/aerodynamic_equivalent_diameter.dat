To evaluate the effect of an urban forest on atmospheric particle removal, a concentration gradient method was used to measure the deposition velocities of water-soluble inorganics in PM 2.5 in two national forest parks in Beijing, China.

Because effective density cannot be measured directly, in this study the electrical mobility and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameters</b> of airborne nanoparticles were measured simultaneously (tandem DMA/ELPI). Test aerosols consisted of spherical Di-Ethyl-Hexyl-Sebacate nanoparticles produced by nebulization (PALAS AGK 2000).

Using this model, it is possible to determine the proportion of each population exiting the DMA (p = 1, 2, … 5 elementary charges) in each channel of the overall ELPI signal. Thus, particle effective density can be estimated for each population. The results indicate that using the ELPI signal alone could lead to significant misevaluation of particle effective density, with biases up to 150 %.

PM is regulated by size, with PM 10, which {{is comprised of}} particles with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameters</b> {{less than or equal}} to 10 ?m, being the main focus of this research. FRM PM 10 samplers exhibit sampling errors when sampling dusts with mass median diameters (MMDs) that are larger than the 10 ?m sampler cutpoint. For industries to be regulated equitably, these sampler errors must be quantified and understood. This research evaluates the performance of FRM PM 10 and low volume total suspended particulate (TSP) samplers under the controlled conditions of a wind tunnel. The performance evaluation was conducted by observing the sampler cutpoints, slopes, and measured concentrations. These measured values were compared to values obtained using a collocated isokinetic reference sampler. The results of this research indicate that PM 10 samplers do not operate as intended under all conditions. The cutpoint of the PM 10 inlets was significantly higher than the maximum FRM limit of 10. 5 ?m when sampling dust with MMDs larger than the cutpoint of the sampler. The slope values for the PM 10 inlets were significantly higher than the maximum FRM limit of 1. 6. MMDs and geometric standard deviations of PM collected by TSP samplers were significantly different than those of PM collected using the collocated isokinetic sampler. The concentrations measured by the TSP samplers were significantly higher than the collocated isokinetic sampler. The results of this research provide a better understanding of the performance of TSP and PM 10 samplers operating under different conditions and shows that these samplers are not operating as intended.

Agricultural operations such as cotton gins, feed mills, and cattle feed yards may be inappropriately regulated by such regulations if the current methods of measuring and predicting the concentrations of regulated pollutants are used. The regulated particulate matter pollutants are those with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameters</b> {{less than or equal}} to a nominal 10 and 2. 5 micrometers (PM 10 and PM 2. 5) respectively. The current Federal Reference Method PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samplers exhibit oversampling errors when sampling dusts with particle size distributions similar to those of agricultural sources. These errors are due to the interaction of the performance characteristics of the sampler with the particle size distribution of the dust being sampled. The results of this work demonstrate the development of a new sampler that may be used to accurately sample total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations. The particle size distribution of TSP samples can be obtained and used to more accurately determine PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations. The results of this work indicate that accurate measures of TSP can be taken on a low volume basis. This work also shows that the low volume samplers provide advantages in maintaining more consistent sampling flow rates, and more robust measurements of TSP concentrations in high dust concentrations. The EPA approved dispersion model most commonly used to estimate concentrations downwind from a stationary source is the Industrial Source Complex Short Term version 3 (ISCST 3). ISCST 3 is known to over-predict downwind concentrations from low level point sources. The results of this research show that the magnitude of these errors could be as much as 250 %. A new approach to correcting these errors using the power law with P values as a function of stability class and downwind distance is demonstrated.

Efforts to reduce PM emissions from tillage {{through a variety of}} conservation management practices (CMPs) have been made, but the reductions from many of these practices have not been measured in the field. A study was conducted in California’s San Joaquin Valley to quantify emissions reductions from fall tillage CMP. Emissions were measured from conventional tillage methods and from a “combined operations” CMP, which combines several implements to reduce tractor passes. Measurements were made of soil moisture, bulk density, meteorological profiles, filter-based total suspended PM (TSP), concentrations of PM with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> ≤ 10 mm (PM 10) and PM with an <b>equivalent</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> ≤ 2. 5 mm (PM 2. 5), and aerosol size distribution. A mass-calibrated, scanning, three-wavelength light detection and ranging (LIDAR) procedure estimated PM through a series of algorithms. Emissions were calculated via inverse modeling with mass concentration measurements and applying a mass balance to LIDAR data. Inverse modeling emission estimates were higher, often with statistically significant differences. Derived PM 10 emissions for conventional operations generally agree with literature values. Sampling irregularities with a few filter-based samples prevented calculation of a complete set of emissions through inverse modeling; however, the LIDAR-based emissions dataset was complete. The CMP control effectiveness was calculated based on LIDAR-derived emissions to be 29 ± 2 %, 60 ± 1 %, and 25 ± 1 % for PM 2. 5, PM 10, and TSP size fractions, respectively.

40|$|Student Number : 0318623 R - PhD thesis - School of Geosciences - Faculty of SciencePhysical and {{chemical}} properties of atmospheric particles are fundamental {{but not necessarily}} easily accessible parameters. Uncertainties in these parameters are responsible for some uncertainties associated with radiative impacts of aerosol particles in global climate models. The uncertainties pertain to limitations of sampling and measurement devices, difficulties in modelling aerosols (source strengths, spatial and temporal variability) and in understanding microphysical and optical properties of aerosol particles. Physical {{and chemical}} properties can be obtained at single-particle level by microscopy analyses of individual particles. Using refined analytical and interpretative techniques to derive some of these fundamental properties, aerosol particles collected in various field campaigns and laboratory experiments were investigated using two high resolution microscopes. The particles were collected during the LBA-EUSTACH, Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment part of European Studies on Trace Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry; SMOCC campaign, Smoke Aerosols, Clouds, Rainfall and Climate; CTBH II, Cape Town Brown Haze II campaign; and a controlled combustion experiment. Microscopy techniques were compared and complemented with conventional techniques to characterise particle sizes, shapes, chemical compositions and mixing states. Particle size distributions were compared between geometric equivalent sizes measured from microscopes and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameters,</b> while taking into account particle densities. Large {{differences were found between}} the particle sizing techniques. Microscopy sizes (3 D) were systematically lower than expected, and depended on the relative humidity during particle sampling. Differences were attributed to loss of mass, presumably water adsorbed on particles. Losses were high and could not be accounted for by known humidity growth factors suggesting losses of other volatile compounds adsorbed on particles as well. Findings suggest that there are inherent problems in defining particle sizes with different sizing techniques, despite accounting for humidity growth of particles and particle density. For collected particles, there are mass losses on individual particles, as opposed to particle losses to walls during sampling. These losses will inevitably bias observed mass distributions derived from collected particles and hence their number-size distributions. Relatively young aggregated soot particles from wood combustion were investigated for particle morphology (fractality, specific mass) and dynamic properties. Based on a procedure that has been validated on modelled aggregates, several important parameters to characterise geometry and drag-to-mass relationship of aggregates were derived. Three techniques were used to derive fractal dimension of soot aggregates. Averaged fractal dimension was found to be Df = 1. 82 ± 0. 08. Dynamic shape factors of soot particles were 1. 7 to 2. 5 and increasing with mass of aggregates. In the regime 0. 2 < Kn < 0. 7 (Knudsen number, Kn = 2 # 21;/dmob) the mobility diameter dmob was observed to be proportional to the radius of gyration with a ratio dmob/ 2 Rg = 0. 81 ± 0. 07. Specific surface area of aggregates was determined to be 70 ± 10 m 2 g− 1 based on SEM image analysis. These parameters can be used directly in modelling microphysical behaviour of freshly formed soot particles from biomass combustion with fractal dimension of Df ≈ 1. 80. Chemical composition and size distributions of particles were investigated on filter samples collected during intense winter brown haze episodes in Cape Town. The sampling technique offered the capability to characterise highly heterogeneous aerosols over a polluted urban environment. Based on morphology and elemental composition, particles were categorised into seven particle groups of: aggregated soot particles, mineral dust, sulphates (SO 2 − 4), sea-salt, tar balls/fly ash, rod-shaped particles associated with soot agglomerates and those that could not be attributed to any of these groups were labelled as ‘others’. Apportionments of chemical species were highly variable both spatially and temporally.

This procedure was developed to more accurately determine PMIO concentrations using standard high volume samplers and the Coulter Counter Multisizer. The FEVol/Coulter method can be used to calculate TSP, PMIO and PM 2. 5 using just one exposed filter. It will assist in regulating PMIO air pollution and can be extended to estimate PNU. 5 concentrations in the future...|$|E

Total {{suspended}} particulate (TSP) concentrations, ammonia (NH 3) concentrations, and ventilation rates were measured in four commercial, tunnel–ventilated broiler houses in June through December of 2000 in Brazos County, Texas. TSP and NH 3 concentrations ranged from 7, 387 to 11, 387 g m– 3 and 2. 02 to 45 ppm, respectively. Ammonia concentration exhibited a correlation with {{the age of}} the birds. Mass median diameters (MMD) of the TSP samples were between 24. 0 and 26. 7 m <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter.</b> MMD increased with bird age. The mass fraction of PM 10 in the TSP samples was between 2. 72 % and 8. 40 % with a mean of 5. 94 %. Ventilation rates were measured between 0. 58 and 89 m 3 s– 1. Measured concentrations of PM 10 and ammonia were multiplied by the measured ventilation rates to calculate emission rates for PM 10 and ammonia. Ammonia emission rates varied from 38 to 2105 g hr– 1. TSP emission rates and PM 10 emission rates ranged from 7. 0 to 1673 g hr– 1 and 0. 58 to 99 g hr– 1, respectively. Emission rates for ammonia and particulate matter increased with {{the age of the}} birds. Most of the PM in the commercial broiler houses was large enough to be captured by the human or poultry respiratory system prior to being inhaled into the lungs...|$|E

In addi-tion to <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter,</b> engineers must also consider the impact of smear when design-ing a system that utilizes prefabricated vertical drains. An experiment and mathematical modeling were used to study the validity of using a reduced <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> to account for smear. Mathematical modeling of the fourmost commonly used <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> for-mulations yielded nearly the same equipotentials. In addition, the equipotentials calculated for the <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> wells differed substantially from a prefabricated vertical drain modeled with and without smear.

MaghirangLarge cattle feedlots emit {{considerable}} {{amounts of}} particulate matter (PM), including TSP (total suspended particulates), PM[subscript] 10 (PM with <b>equivalent</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 10 μm or less), and PM[subscript] 2. 5 (PM with <b>equivalent</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of 2. 5 μm or less). Particulate emissions result from pen surface disturbance by cattle hoof action, vehicle traffic on unpaved roads and alleyways, and wind erosion. Research {{is needed to}} determine concentrations of various size fractions, size distribution, and emission rates from various sources in feedlots. This research was conducted to measure particle size distribution using laser diffraction method and estimate emissions from unpaved roads and wind erosion. Particle size distribution and concentrations of PM[subscript] 10 and PM[subscript] 2. 5 at a commercial cattle feedlot in Kansas (Feedlot 1) were measured over a 2 -yr period. The feedlot had a capacity of 30, 000 head and total pen area of 50 ha and was equipped with a sprinkler system for dust control. Collocated low-volume samplers for TSP, PM[subscript] 10, and PM[subscript] 2. 5 were used to measure concentrations of TSP, PM[subscript] 10, and PM[subscript] 2. 5 at the upwind and downwind edges of the feedlot. Dust samples that were collected by TSP samplers were analyzed with a laser diffraction analyzer to determine particle size distribution. Particle size distribution at the downwind edge of the feedlot was also measured with micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI). The laser diffraction method and MOUDI did not differ significantly in mean geometric mean diameter (13. 7 vs. 13. 0 μm) but differed in mean geometric standard deviation (2. 9 vs. 2. 3). From laser diffraction and TSP data, PM[subscript] 10 and PM[subscript] 2. 5 concentrations were also calculated and were not significantly different from those measured by low-volume PM[subscript] 10 and PM[subscript] 2. 5 samplers (122 vs. 131 μg/m[superscript] 3 for PM[subscript] 10; 26 vs. 35 μg/m[superscript] 3 for PM[subscript] 2. 5). Both PM[subscript] 10 and PM[subscript] 2. 5 fractions decreased as pen surface moisture contents increased, while the PM[subscript] 2. 5 /PM[subscript] 10 ratio did not change much with pen surface moisture content. Published emission models were used to estimate PM[subscript] 10 emissions from unpaved roads and wind erosion at Feedlot 1 and another nearby feedlot (Feedlot 2). Feedlot 2 had a capacity of 30, 000 head, total pen surface area of 59 ha, and used water trucks for dust control. Estimated PM[subscript] 10 emissions from unpaved roads and wind erosion were less than 20 % of total PM[subscript] 10 emissions obtained from inverse dispersion modeling. Further research is needed to establish the applicability of published emission estimation models for cattle feedlots...|$|R

The <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> of {{the sample}} shown in Fig. 3 is 2.6 nm and is shown in Fig. 4 along with the <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameters</b> of the data {{obtained}} by Gutsch et al.

The {{performances}} of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samplers {{have not been}} clearly ascertained for particle sizes larger than 10 micrometers (µm) <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> (AED). (Agricultural dust emissions will typically have mass median diameters (MMD) larger than 10 µm AED.) It is our view that while the FRM PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samplers ' performances for ambient particles with MMD of 10 and 2. 5 µm AED, respectively have been established, the {{performances of}} these samplers with ambient PM having MMDs greater than particles sizes of interest have not been studied. Agricultural dusts have reported MMDs as large as 24 µm AED. The CAAQES faculty have published data demonstrating that use of FRM samplers to measure PM 10 concentrations of agricultural dust will result in concentrations that are as much as 300 % higher than if the measured concentrations of ambient PM were characterized as having MMDs equal to or less than 10 µm AED. This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} “over-sampling ” errors for dusts with larger MMD (Buser, et. al, 2002, Wang, et. al., 2004 and Capareda, et al., 2004). EPA defines PM coarse as the difference between PM 10 and PM 2. 5 sampler concentrations. PM 10 samplers will capture PM 2. 5.

States are required by EPA to submit state implementation plans (SIP) detailing how a state will implement and enforce regulatory actions {{to ensure that the}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are achieved. The NAAQS list federal ambient concentration limits for six criteria pollutants including particulate matter {{less than or equal to}} 10 micrometers (mm) <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> (PM 10). The primary criteria pollutant emitted by a cotton gin is PM 10. State air pollution regulatory agencies (SAPRA) regulate cotton gins by requiring minor source permits under the new source review (NSR) process. When granted the NSR minor source permit, the owner/operator has permission from the state to begin construction on either a new facility or modifications to an existing facility. States have granted cotton gin pre-construction permits based on permit by rule, standard permit, or individual facility permit. Recently, the state of New Mexico developed a new tool to use in permitting cotton gins. This new tool involves a property line setback distance. The property line setback distance is the distance from the emission point to the nearest property line. The results of field sampling and dispersion modeling taken from four day...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{particulate}} matter emissions from cotton gins {{is a priority}} in many states. The air pollution regulatory process requires that concentrations measured off-property be less than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Two methods are commonly {{used to determine the}} concentrations on or beyond the property line: ambient sampling and dispersion modeling. In order to limit the emissions from a cotton gin, the State Air Pollution Regulatory Agencies require that the gin obtain a permit. This permit sets the Allowable Emission Rate for the primary criteria pollutant of concern, particulate matter with an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>diameter</b> of ten microns or less. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established emission factors for the particulate emissions from cotton gins in its AP- 42 document. When using dispersion modeling or measuring ambient mass concentrations downwind of a cotton gin to determine if it is meeting its allowable emission rate, {{it is important to note}} that there are two sources of particulate matter. The exhaust systems from the machinery used to extract the cotton and bale is the source that is being permitted. The gin yard and roads also produce particulate matter. However, these sources are considered to be fugitive emissions, and are not regulated unless the source is considered to be a major source under the Title V operating permit program. There are no cotton gins that currently meet the threshold to be considered a Title V major source...|$|E

Nephelometer measurements gave average background scattering coefficient values of about 25 M/m at 550 nm wavelength, but strong dust events caused {{the value of this}} parameter to rise up to about 800 M/m Backscattering fractions did not depend on aerosol loading, and generally fell in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 25, comparable to values reported for marine and Arctic environments. Chemical analysis of the aerosol revealed that, in the coarse size range (2 - 10 micrometer <b>equivalent</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> (EAD)), calcium (Ca) was by far the most abundant element followed by silicon (Si), both of which are indicators for mineral dust. In the fine size fraction (< 2 micrometers EAD), sulfur (S) generally was the dominant element, except during high dust episodes when Ca and Si were again the most abundant. Furthermore, fine black carbon (BC) correlates with S, suggesting that they may have originated from the same sources or source regions. An indication of the short-term effect of aerosol loading on radiative forcing was provided by measurements of global and diffuse solar radiation, which showed that during high turbidity periods (strong dust events) almost all of the solar radiation reaching the area is scattered or absorbed...|$|R

To control PM emissions from cattle feedlots, water sprinkler systems can be implemented; however, limited data are available on their PM control efficiency. This research was conducted to determine the control efficiency of a water sprinkler system in reducing PM 10 emission from a cattle feedlot. This was accomplished by monitoring the PM 10 concentrations, with tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM™) PM 10 monitors, at the upwind and downwind boundaries of a cattle feedlot (KS 1) from January 2006 to July 2009. The feedlot was equipped with a sprinkler system that can apply up to 5 mm of water per day. It had approximately 30, 000 head of beef cattle and total pen area of approximately 50 ha.
