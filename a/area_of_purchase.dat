Milk is the principal source of iodine in UK diets, and while small studies in Europe have shown organic milk to have a lower iodine concentration than conventional milk, no such study has been conducted in Britain. In view of the increasing popularity of organic milk in the UK, we aimed to compare the iodine concentration of retail organic and conventional milk and to evaluate regional influences in iodine levels. Samples of organic milk (n 92) and conventional milk (n 80), purchased from retail outlets in sixteen areas of the UK (southern England, Wales and Northern Ireland), were analysed for iodine using inductively coupled plasma MS. The region of origin of the milk was determined from information on the label. Organic milk was 42 · 1  % lower in iodine content than conventional milk (median iodine concentration 144 · 5 v. 249 · 5  ng/g; P <  0 · 001). There {{was no difference in}} the iodine concentration of either conventional or organic milk by <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase.</b> However, a difference was seen in iodine concentration of organic milk by region of origin (P <  0 · 001). The lower iodine concentration of organic milk has public-health implications, particularly in view of emerging evidence of iodine deficiency in UK population sub-groups, including pregnant women. Individuals who choose organic milk should be aware that their iodine intake may be compromised and should ensure adequate iodine intake from alternative sources...|$|E
40|$|Through the 1990 s {{barriers}} to low-income homeownership decreased sharply, {{and by the}} early 2000 s low-income mortgage borrowers enjoyed unprecedented access to expanded home financing options, lower downpayment requirements, increased governmental subsidy, and the lowest interest rates in decades. This happened not by accident but through determination: {{beginning in the early}} 1970 s, federal housing policy makers began promoting the idea of increasing housing demand through expanded low-income household market participation as a strategy to solve the country's affordable housing crisis. Indeed, homeownership increased more rapidly amongst this group through the 1990 s than for any other segment of the population. This research examines housing opportunity outcomes for low-income black households by tenure (owning versus renting) in five large U. S. metropolitan areas- Chicago, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia and Washington DC- between 1990 and 2000 through analysis of U. S. Census Bureau Public Use Microdata Survey (PUMS) data. Housing opportunity is defined as a low-income household's ability to find a home that is 1) proportionately affordable to its income, 2) located in an area that provides access to higher quality public education, and 3) located in close proximity to employment. These housing characteristics encapsulate the most potent wealth creation benefits that policy makers maintain are inherent to homeownership. The research findings indicate that a greater proportion of low-income black renter households as compared to homeowner households paid a smaller proportion of their income for housing, commuted shorter distances to work, and had greater access to higher quality schools in 2000 in three of the five metropolitan areas studied (Chicago, Detroit and New York). Homeownership provided only slightly greater housing opportunity than renting in the other two metropolitan areas examined (Philadelphia and Washington DC). While outcomes varied by metropolitan area, between 1990 and 2000, low-income black renters experienced greater increases or smaller decreases in housing opportunity than did low-income black owners in four of the five metropolitan areas examined (Chicago, Detroit, New York and Philadelphia). The research findings support a main study conclusion that under the present market structure low-income homeownership does not necessarily result in greater housing opportunity for low-income buyers as compared to renters, and that renting is often a better tenure choice for many low-income households in these metropolitan housing markets. The study findings also suggests that federal subsides supporting low-income homeownership should be reconsidered based on careful analysis of existing market conditions in the metropolitan <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase.</b> The study concludes by making several federal housing policy recommendations, including expanding direct funding and support for the development of low-income rental property, and extending personal tax deductions to low-income renters to make renting a more financially attractive option for low-income households...|$|E

40|$|THESIS 8264 Over {{the last}} decade, supply-chain {{management}} (SCM), {{a field that}} emerged from the operational <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> and logistics, has become a focal area in business studies. However, efforts to move SCM from an operational to a more strategic perspective typically stop at the design, or operations strategy level, and it has proven difficult to move SCM to a strategic perspective. Led by operations and operations strategy researchers and practitioners, tremendous efforts have been made to develop management tools for the strategic adoption of SCM. However, despite findings of substantial benefits accruing to those firms that do develop their SCM capabilities, researchers report very low take-up of strategic SCM. This research explores the apparent paradox of the poor take-up of a strategic tool that has had high- profile success, and attempts to fiirther the evolution of SCM theory...|$|R

In an initial case study in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasing,</b> we find that much nonautomated guidelines information can be represented successfully using standard logicist methods. We show how to create very-high-level specifications with wellunderstood semantics.
