5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming {{certain parts of the}} script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not indicate to whom or mention Another World assets by name.|$|E
5|$|It {{had taken}} <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, from 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern {{by the end of}} 1980.|$|E
5|$|The Sprain Brook {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the early 1920s as a parkway between the Bronx River Parkway and the Hawthorne Circle. The parkway sold a majority of its right-of-way in the 1920s, but the proposed parkway met strong opposition {{from the village of}} Bronxville and Yonkers. The Sprain Brook proposal sat on the table until 1949, when the State Council of Parks, run by Robert Moses, sought to ease congestion on the Bronx River Parkway. Moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in Westchester, with the Sprain Brook Parkway serving as a traffic alternative to the Bronx River, and nearly <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half after the parkway was deeded land. This time, Bronxville opposed the project rather than Yonkers, but an agreement was worked out in 1951. This new alignment would bypass the parts of Bronxville and Yonkers to construct the freeway.|$|E

25|$|His {{immediate}} successor, {{according to}} the bishop list of Walter Bower, was Giric; but the next consecrated bishop we know about from other sources is Turgot. The obvious question is, did the bishopric really lie vacant for <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, did Bower or his source invent Giric, or did Giric actually succeed? The former options hardly seem probable in the context.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 Frederick Warne & Co. {{suffered}} a scandal, and asked Potter {{for a book}} {{in an effort to}} stave off the firm's complete ruin. Potter was unwilling to become involved in the intense labour of preparing an entirely new book, and suggested the publisher raid the Appley Dapply dummy book prepared <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half earlier. Seven rhymes with their accompanying illustrations were chosen and published as Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes. The book sold well.|$|E

25|$|In Formula One, Chris Amon {{took part}} in 96 Grands Prix, {{achieving}} 5 poles, leading 183 laps in 7 races, reaching the podium 11 times and scoring a total of 83 Championship points. Amon holds {{the record for the}} most different makes of car raced by a Formula 1 World Championship driver, with thirteen. A biography Forza Amon by journalist Eoin Young charts Amon's racing career and gives some insights into his personal life. The book makes clear one point on which Amon himself disagrees with most commentators, the issue of his bad luck. Amon has pointed out on several occasions that he competed for <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half in Formula One and survived some serious accidents, notably in 1976, whilst others, including friends like Bruce McLaren, suffered serious injury and death. In 2008, motorsport journalist Alan Henry rated Chris Amon as his 13th greatest driver.|$|E
25|$|In about 1594 Byrd's career {{entered a}} new phase. He was now in his early fifties, and seems to have gone into semi-retirement from the Chapel Royal. He moved with his family from Harlington to Stondon Massey, a small village near Chipping Ongar in Essex. His {{ownership}} of Stondon Place, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life, was bitterly contested by Joanna Shelley, with whom he engaged in a protracted and unedifying legal dispute lasting about <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half. The main reason for the move was apparently the proximity of Byrd's patron Sir John Petre (the son of the former Secretary of State Sir William Petre). A wealthy local landowner, Petre was a discreet Catholic who maintained two local manor houses, Ingatestone Hall and Thorndon Hall, the first of which still survives in a much-altered state. Petre held clandestine Mass celebrations, with music provided by his servants, which were subject to the unwelcome attention of spies and paid informers working for the Crown.|$|E

Chinna Ranga Rao had built the oldest part of the main palace with its Saracenic arches supporting the first level.

500|$|In late May 1879, the Republican-leaning Cincinnati Gazette {{reported}} on Blackburn's alleged plot to infect northern cities with yellow fever during the Civil War, apparently {{the first time}} the incident had been reported in Kentucky. The newspaper formed a special department {{for the sole purpose of}} investigating the claims against Blackburn and published a daily column in which it related the department's findings. In the wake of the Gazettes investigation, other Northern newspapers, including the Canton Repository, Cleveland Herald, and Philadelphia Press, derided Kentuckians for even considering the election of Blackburn (who they nicknamed [...] "Dr. Blackvomit"). The scandal gained more traction nationally than in Kentucky. Blackburn did not respond to the accusations, and Kentucky Republicans barely made mention of it, knowing that the northern press in general and the Cincinnati Gazette in particular were widely distrusted in the state. Kentucky newspaper editor Henry Watterson opined that most Kentuckians already knew about Blackburn's Civil War activities and either explicitly approved of them or were apathetic about events that had occurred <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half earlier.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} revived <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half {{later with the}} launch of the U2 360° Tour on 30 June 2009 in Barcelona, where it was once again {{performed}} as part of the encore. It was introduced by a robotic voice reading excerpts from the poem [...] "Funeral Blues" [...] by W. H. Auden, followed by Bono's appearance wearing a laser-studded jacket on a darkened stage illuminated only by a glowing steering wheel-shaped microphone that hangs from above. During the performance, Bono would alternatively embrace or hang from the microphone, or twirl around it, or swing it overhead to emphasize the lyrics. The New York Times said its use as [...] "a love song that can double as devotional" [...] helped keep the show's music and messages in balance, while the Chicago Tribune said that Bono sang the song with fervor as part of an encore during which [...] "the show's outsized ambitions produced a neon-lighted moment that nearly justified the costly enterprise." [...] Rolling Stone called the song's performance [...] "one of the show's highpoints." [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] continued to be performed during the encore throughout the first two legs of the tour, with minor changes {{such as the use of}} a different introduction.|$|E

500|$|On the {{programming}} front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by [...] physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The {{program was a}} new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, [...] "dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code." [...] Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his work—he had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments. In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performers—Mercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half {{and one of the}} most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of The Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston. He played the part anonymously at first. But, as one chronicler put it, [...] "nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{transition}} from treatment to storyboards {{took on an}} extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, A Bug's Life required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters. Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would {{give way to the}} film's larger needs. The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive. The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants. The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants. The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual [...] "universal ants". Each one of these [...] "universal ants" [...] would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same. It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.|$|E
