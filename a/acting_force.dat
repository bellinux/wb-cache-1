50|$|The {{universality}} of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity {{is the only}} <b>acting</b> <b>force.</b> All other forces, especially friction and air resistance, must be absent or at least negligible. For example, if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on Earth, the feather will take much longer to reach the ground; the feather is not really in free-fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather {{is comparable to the}} downward force of gravity. On the other hand, if the experiment is performed in a vacuum, {{in which there is no}} air resistance, the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time (assuming the acceleration of both objects towards each other, and of the ground towards both objects, for its own part, is negligible). This can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump. It is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum, as David Scott did on the surface of the Moon during Apollo 15.|$|E

Analysis of equation structure permits to make a conclusion that dynamics of transient processes of non-holonomic mechanisms is determined not only by <b>acting</b> <b>forces,</b> masses and their initial states but also by the law of changing first kinematic transfer functions and speed of their changes. </p...|$|R
