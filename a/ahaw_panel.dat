40|$|The Animal Health and Welfare (<b>AHAW)</b> <b>Panel</b> of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has {{evaluated}} the European Union Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Food-borne Outbreaks by EFSA and ECDC (the report) {{with regard to}} data needs and subsequent analyses that will minimise the impact of existing data gaps and inconsistencies. Specific assessments performed for bovine tuberculosis, echinococcosis, Q fever, brucellosis, rabies, cysticercosis and tularaemia show that the report gives an accurate picture of the epidemiological situation for the infections which have an EU harmonised monitoring system. Generally the data analysis is descriptive; further analysis for specific purposes and quantification of the trends should be considered. Specific information for each disease should contain (i) a clear case definition, (ii) a clear description of sampling techniques and diagnostic tests used, (iii) relevant epidemiological characteristics and (iv) relevant control measures or surveillance. Prioritisation of diseases from a public health viewpoint {{is not in the}} remit of the <b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel.</b> Proposed criteria to assess the value of including additional diseases in the report are (1) the disease is reported regularly in animals and humans in some EU Member States; (2) the disease is considered a serious public health issue; and (3) monitoring in animals is epidemiologically justifiable. The first two criteria are inclusion criteria; the third is used to prioritise diseases for inclusion in the report. The last section of the opinion addresses the value of the data included in the report for AHAW risk assessment. Their usefulness is often compromised by missing case definition, insufficient metadata or outdated data. It is recommended that data needs are further analysed to improve the preparedness of the <b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel</b> to answer risk questions, via some readily available and stable data as well as good knowledge of ad-hoc data models and sources throughout the EU...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA's Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (<b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel)</b> {{was asked}} to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion {{on the use of}} a low atmosphere pressure system (LAPS) for stunning poultry. Four documents were provided by the European Commission (EC) as the basis for an assessment {{of the extent to which}} the LAPS is able to provide a level of animal welfare at least equivalent to that ensured by the current allowed methods for stunning poultry. The LAPS is described as rendering poultry unconscious by gradually reducing oxygen tension in the atmosphere leading to progressive hypoxia in the birds. In order to be allowed in the EU, new stunning methods must ensure 1) absence of pain, distress and suffering until the onset of unconsciousness, and 2) that the animal remains unconscious until death. The submitted studies were peer-reviewed by the <b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel</b> as outlined in its “Guidance on the assessment criteria for studies evaluating the effectiveness of stunning intervention regarding animal protection at the time of killing”. It is unclear from the submitted documents whether the rate of decompression used in LAPS induces unconsciousness and death without causing avoidable pain and suffering in poultry. The assessed studies did not pass the eligibility assessment and, therefore, no further assessment was undertaken...|$|E
40|$|The survey {{describes}} {{the work of}} the Animal Health and Welfare (<b>AHAW)</b> <b>Panel</b> of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in the provision of scientific advice on the welfare of food producing animals including animal health and food safety aspects, where relevant, and on the impact of these scientific assessments on the EU regulatory framework. EFSA was created in 2002 with the mission to provide advice and scientific and technical support for the Community legislation and policies in all fields which have a direct or indirect impact on food and feed safety, plant health, environment and animal health and animal welfare. When providing objective and independent science-based advice, the risk assessment approach should be followed, whenever possible. The <b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel</b> of EFSA provides specific advices on risk factors related to animal diseases and welfare, mainly of food producing animals, including fish. According to EFSA’s remit, ethical, socio-economic, cultural and religious aspects are outside the scope of the EFSA’s assessments. Since 2004, the Animal Health and Welfare Panel of EFSA adopted a total of 21 scientific opinions on animal welfare. Animal diseases and food safety aspects have also been taken into account, where relevant. Animal welfare aspects have been considered in some scientific opinions on animal diseases (e. g. AI, FMD). The <b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel</b> is currently working on five scientific opinions on the welfare of dairy cows and on the welfare aspects of the stunning and killing of farmed fish for eight fish species (salmon, trout, carp, eel, tuna, sea bass, sea bream and turbot). The possible interactions and implications for food safety and animal disease have been considered, when relevant, in most of the AW scientific opinions, involving other areas of expertise in EFSA, like Biohazards, Contaminants and Plant Health. The final aim of EFSA’s scientific assessments on animal welfare is to support animal welfare EU legislation {{on the basis of the}} available scientific evidence. Many examples illustrate how EFSA’s scientific opinions are taken into consideration when legislative measures are proposed by the European Commission. In order to evaluate the overall impact of animal welfare, factors with possible incidence on animal diseases and food safety should also be considered. The evaluation of the interactions between animal welfare, animal disease and food safety could help the development of control and monitoring plans at farm level...|$|E
40|$|Pigs have a {{need for}} {{manipulable}} materials to satisfy a range of behavioural needs, which can be different in different classes of pig. When these needs are not met, a range of adverse welfare consequences result, one of these being an increased risk for tail-biting in weaners and rearing pigs. The ability to control the risk of tail- biting is essential when aiming to avoid tail-docking. Based on available scientific information this Opinion identifies the multiple interactions between risk factors, welfare consequences and animal and non-animal-based measures on the two subjects requested (i) the absence of functional manipulable materials, for pigs at different stages in life and (ii) tail-biting, for weaners and rearing pigs only. An attempt is made to quantify {{the relationships between the}} identified interactions by carrying out a statistical analysis of information from available databases, those being an international dataset collected using the Welfare Quality® protocol, which was not designed to evaluate risk factors for tail-biting and therefore, it had limitations in fitness for this analysis, and a large Finnish dataset with undocked pigs. Based on the current state of knowledge, the <b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel</b> proposes two simple tool-boxes for on farm use to assess (i) the functionality of the supplied manipulable material and (ii) the presence and strength of risk factors for tail biting. Both proposed tool-boxes include a combination of the most important resource-based and animal-based measures. Further development and validation of decision–support tools for customised farm assessment is strongly recommended and a proposal for harmonised data collection across the range of European farming circumstances is presented. A series of further recommendations are made by the <b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel...</b>|$|E
40|$|Small hive beetle (SHB) and Tropilaelaps are bee {{diseases}} considered exotic in the EU. SHBis {{a flying}} coleopteran {{that can be}} attracted to the odours of bees and bee products. In addition, SHB can survive and reproduce {{on a variety of}} ripe fruits. Tropilaelaps is an ectoparasite that does not survive long without honey bee brood and cannot fly by itself. The methodology used to assess the risk of entry of these pests in this scientific opinion was adapted from a pest risk assessment for entry used in the field of plant health. A qualitative risk assessment was performed taking into account current legislation but excluding the implementation of risk reduction options. This approach allowed the assessment of the worst case scenario for each risk factor. The risk pathways with a high risk of pest entry are ‘import of bee products (use in apiculture) ’ for SHB and ‘accidental import of bees’ (unintended presence of bees in a non-bee consignment) for both pests. The other risk pathways are associated with a moderate or low risk of SHB or Tropilaelaps entry into the risk assessment area. Risk reduction options were assessed separately from the risk assessment. Examples of risk reduction options with a high effectiveness and a high technical feasibility are the use of health certificates to guarantee pest freedom of consignments and keeping consignments without honey bee brood. Options with a high effectiveness and technical feasibility were identified in all risk pathways except ‘accidental import of bees’ and ‘dispersal of the pest via natural means and/or flight’. The <b>AHAW</b> <b>Panel</b> identified the need for validated rapid detection methods and for handling and sampling of imported bees in insect-proof environments. Education and training could help to monitor the pest distribution and to prevent pest entry by improving awareness, skills and expertise...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA <b>AHAW</b> <b>panel</b> is {{requested}} to develop several scientific opinions concerning animal based measures {{to assess the}} welfare of livestock animals. The main objective of this report is to review the broiler welfare literature to identify gaps and potential areas to strengthen and update three SCAHAW and EFSA opinions: i) The welfare of chickens kept for meat production (broilers) (SCAHAW, 2000), ii) Influence of genetic parameters on the welfare and resistance to stress of commercial broilers (EFSA, 2010), iii) Welfare aspects of the management and housing of the grand-parent and parent stocks raised and kept for breeding purposes (EFSA, 2010). The literature review was done {{by a group of}} authors and reviewers, under the supervision of an editorial team. A large number of new scientific references are quoted. Regarding the first and oldest opinion, this review presents 47 amended and new conclusions. In addition, it suggests twelve new recommendations and proposes a list of hazards. Especially the paragraphs on behavioural restriction, light, stocking density and environmental enrichment are updated with new information from a large number of new scientific references. Regarding the second opinion, nine new conclusions are proposed. Recommendations of the previous EFSA report are further supported by new information, and one new recommendation is a suggestion to further study the role of incubation conditions on welfare issues such as gait abnormalities, thermal discomfort and ascites. A limited number of new hazards are proposed. Regarding the third opinion, four new conclusions are proposed. Recommendations of the previous EFSA report are also in this case further supported by new information. One new recommendation is a suggestion to further study the impact of management on forced mating behaviour. A couple of new hazards are proposed...|$|E
