5|$|In 2001, a {{quicksand}} predator trap {{was discovered}} containing multiple Utahraptor specimens {{ranging in age}} from fully grown adult to tiny 3 foot long baby. Some scientists have hypothesized this is evidence of family hunting behaviour, however the full sandstone block is yet to be opened and researchers are unsure <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the animals died at the same time or not.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E

5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 and 1976, several {{stockholder}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against American Financial, and Keating was {{under fire for}} aspects involving unsecured loans, stock warrants, and {{the sale of the}} Enquirer. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched a major investigation of the company and charged Lindner, Keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false SEC reports. At particular issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms. Keating resigned from American Financial in August 1976, with conflicting stories <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not Keating and Lindner had remained close or whether they had fallen out.|$|E
5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure to}} renew the Licensing Act led to {{confusion}} and {{both positive and negative}} outcomes; while the government no longer played a part in censoring publications, and the monopoly of the Company over printing was broken, there was uncertainty <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not copyright was a binding legal concept without the legislation. Economic chaos also resulted; with the Company now unable to enforce any monopoly, provincial towns began establishing printing presses, producing cheaper books than the London booksellers. The absence of the censorship provisions also opened Britain up as a market for internationally printed books, which were similarly cheaper than those British printers could produce.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E
5|$|Through {{their first}} nine {{games of the}} year, the Jets went 5–4 and earned Ryan some early Coach of the Year consideration. The team {{proceeded}} to lose their next three contests as the rookie Smith committed eight turnovers while failing to score during that stretch. This prompted speculation by analysts <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not Ryan would be fired. The Jets broke their losing streak with a 37–27 win over the Raiders that kept them in playoff contention. The following week, the Jets played the Carolina Panthers and trailed by three points heading into the fourth quarter. In the span of five minutes, the Panthers scored twice and the Jets were unable to complete a comeback attempt, losing 20–30. The loss eliminated the Jets from playoff contention.|$|E

5|$|Two {{varieties}} {{have been}} described. Chalciporus piperatus var. hypochryseus was originally described as Boletus hypochryseus by Czech mycologist Josef Šutara in 1993, and {{was moved to}} Chalciporus a year later by Regis Courtecuisse. Wolfgang Klofac and Irmgard Krisai-Greilhuber reclassified it as a variety of C.piperatus in 2006, although some sources continue to regard it as a distinct species. Variety amarellus, first published by Quélet as Boletus amarellus in 1883 and later transferred to Chalciporus by Bataille in 1908, {{was described as a}} variety of C.piperatus in 1974 by Albert Pilát and Aurel Dermek.

5|$|Based on {{information}} from historical weather maps, {{it appeared that}} eastward-moving lower-atmospheric flow was present between September 16 and 17, though a closed circulation {{did not appear to}} be present. On September 18, the system developed into tropical depression between the Bahamas and Florida while it moved west-northwestward. After swiftly crossing the southern portion of the state, it strengthened into a tropical storm on September 19 over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and attained its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) early during September 20. It began turning north on September 21, and made landfall on the Mississippi coast on September 22. The storm weakened as it moved inland, and curved east-northeast later during that day, only to transition into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter. The storm lost extratropical characteristics over Virginia on September 23. As there were no reports of strong winds near the point of landfall, Partagás had doubt <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not this storm was a tropical storm, as the most intense winds were recorded when the system was classified as extratropical.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the Timberwolves {{would remain}} in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced {{that he and his}} representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

He {{was one of}} few players whose prime was during the steroid era and was not suspected of using steroids; Thome adamantly denies ever using performance-enhancing drugs. Soon after the announcement of his front office position (which signified {{the end of his}} playing career), writers began to speculate <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not Thome would make it to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and more specifically, whether he would gain entrance in his first year of eligibility in 2018.

5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. Historical significance to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had historical significance to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November, Allied bombers {{attacked}} the fortress at Sattelberg, {{as well as}} defensive positions around Kumawa. The 2/48th, nearing their objective, cautiously began to probe the outer positions, while to the north, three companies from the 2/24th managed to reach the saddle that lay below the north-eastern approach to the mission, although there was still uncertainty <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the Japanese had withdrawn from the 2,200 feature. To the south-west, the 2/23rd began skirting north around the main positions at Sattelberg, making for the 3,200 feature. After they had struck Turn-Off Corner, the infantry from the 2/23rd were accompanied by engineers from the 2/13th Field Company, who were tasked with laying down a makeshift road, over which the tanks that had been re-allocated to the 2/23rd would traverse.|$|E

5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} divided into three phases, {{expected}} to cost a total of $68million. Phase1 consisted of the prevention of erosion along the shorelines, improvements to the nearby drainage system, {{and the construction of}} dikes and aboiteaux; the work was carried out from 7 July 2008, to 14 April 2010. Phase2 consists of opening the gates to monitor river flow, both upstream and downstream, for two years. Phase3, commenced in 2012, consisted of the bridge's development and the removal of the causeway, and is anticipated to be completed in 2015. Confusion arose <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the project would be funded by the federal government. They refused, in spite of an earlier comment from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which had hinted at a possible negotiation. Unwilling to wait, the provincial government came forward with an initial $20million on 7 July 2008, to begin the first phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{synonyms}} {{are other}} binomial names that were given {{over time to}} this taxon by authors who were unaware that the specimens they were describing belonged to a species already described by Linnaeus; in some cases, local variations in colour and form may have misled these authors into thinking they had a different species. Strombus vanicorensis is a subsequent, changed spelling of Strombus vanikorensis {{by one of the}} original authors. There is some disagreement in the literature <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not this taxon and the similar-looking Laevistrombus turturella are actually separate species. Leo Man In 'T Veld and Koenraad de Turck (1998) considered that L.canarium and L.turturella are distinct (yet sympatric) species, based mainly on the shell morphology and a radula comparison. However, when Zaidi Che Cob reviewed a number of Strombus species in 2009, examining both shell characters and anatomical data including details of the genitalia, operculum and radula, he concluded that L.turturella was simply a morphotype, and therefore a synonym of L.canarium.|$|E
