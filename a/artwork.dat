5|$|In late July 2006, bus benches {{in several}} Californian cities were {{decorated}} with promotional <b>artwork</b> for Christ Illusion. City officials in Fullerton, California, demanded the <b>artwork</b> be immediately removed from seventeen bus benches located throughout the city, and contacted the hired company which had originally put the adverts {{in place to}} assume the task. The officials disliked the band's name, which they felt referred to a murderer. They also took offense to the antichrist and skull logo adorning the bench <b>artwork.</b> Eventually, the <b>artwork</b> was removed. However, various Orange County, California areas surrounding the city of Fullerton still had benches sporting the cover <b>artwork.</b>|$|E
5|$|The album's <b>artwork,</b> {{featuring}} a plastic skull with tinfoil, {{was not intended}} to be the original <b>artwork.</b> Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat Records to get the cover <b>artwork</b> properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the <b>artwork,</b> and instead made their own improvised and low-budget replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the single}} {{was never a}} {{physical}} CD release, <b>artwork</b> was created for it. The <b>artwork</b> featured the headless man who is otherwise seen throughout the releases for other singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, however on this cover, the area where his head would be is a fireball, and {{he appears to be}} holding a briefcase while walking down the hallway of a hotel, another common theme throughout the <b>artwork</b> for the album.

5|$|As {{with all}} the stops on the Westside MAX, {{displays}} of public <b>artwork</b> {{were included in the}} construction of the stop. Overall the <b>artwork</b> at the station reflects the gathering and dispersal of people and the harvest. Christine Bourdette, a sculptor, working with the architects from OTAK designed some of the <b>artwork</b> at Hatfield Station. Described as a “clash of sensibilities” and “organically abstract”, items include sculptures of bronze baskets and granite balls installed at the southern end of the station. Attached to the station's building is a bronze work entitled “Gathering Rail” which resembles twine woven together and is intended to represent the various themes of the community coming together.|$|E
40|$|Both {{philosophers}} and literary critics have championed <b>artworks</b> {{as necessary to}} moral education. As a result many of these critics believe that art that is bad or immoral can causally affect our character, resulting in moral harm. Moral harm {{is the idea that}} <b>artworks</b> possess a strong disposition to affect our moral beliefs such that we are less able to distinguish between what is good and what is bad. I examine this concept of moral harm and argue that immoral <b>artworks</b> do not have this kind of causal power over our moral beliefs. Proponents of the moral harm thesis are in error to attribute such a power to <b>artworks.</b> Additionally, I propose a definition of immoral <b>artworks</b> consistent with moral harm, as well as discuss the distinction between immoral <b>artworks</b> and <b>artworks</b> that are merely elicit disgust or offense...|$|R

40|$|The Prinzhorn Collection {{preserves}} {{and exhibits}} thousands of visual <b>artworks</b> by {{patients who were}} diagnosed to suffer from mental disease. From this collection, we analyzed 1, 256 images by 14 artists who were diagnosed with dementia praecox or schizophrenia. Six objective statistical properties {{that have been used}} previously to characterize visually aesthetic images were calculated. These properties reflect features of formal image composition, such as the complexity and distribution of oriented luminance gradients and edges, as well as Fourier spectral properties. Results for the artists with schizophrenia were compared to <b>artworks</b> from three public art collections of paintings and drawings that include highly acclaimed <b>artworks</b> as well as <b>artworks</b> of lesser artistic claim (control <b>artworks).</b> Many of the patients’ works did not differ from these control images. However, the <b>artworks</b> of 6 of the 14 artists with schizophrenia possess image properties that deviate from the range of values obtained for the control <b>artworks.</b> For example, the <b>artworks</b> of four of the patients are characterized by a relative dominance of specific edge orientations in their images (low first-order entropy of edge orientations). Three patients created <b>artworks</b> with a relatively high ratio of fine detail to coarse structure (high slope of the Fourier spectrum). In conclusion, the present exploratory study opens novel perspectives for the objective scientific investigation of visual <b>artworks</b> that were created by persons who suffer from schizophrenia...|$|R
