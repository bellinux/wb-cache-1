25|$|He {{began his}} career in the Imperial Service as the {{commander}} of a cohort of auxiliary infantry and rose to become Praetorian Prefect, the highest office in the Imperial hierarchy, with both civilian and military functions. His brilliant career reflected his mastery of contemporary cultural norms and his reputation for <b>administrative</b> <b>competence,</b> but also his ability to access patronage at the highest level. His official life was spent mainly in fiscal postings and he typified the powerful procuratorial functionaries who came to dominate the Imperial government {{in the second quarter of}} the Third Century. Nevertheless, as Praetorian Prefect, he also seems to have proved himself more than competent in his military role. Although he was on several occasions appointed to positions that contemporary Administrative Law reserved for officials of senatorial rank, he remained an equestrian until the end: it is possible that he deliberately avoided adlection to the Roman Senate preferring to exercise real power in offices from which senators were excluded. Unlike his successor in the Praetorian Prefecture, Philip the Arab, he did not take advantage of the youth and inexperience of his Imperial master (and son-in-law), Gordian III, to seize the Empire for himself.|$|E
500|$|Cruttwell's <b>administrative</b> <b>competence</b> was {{recognised}} in 1930, when he {{was elected}} principal of Hertford College. In this office, he helped to establish the university's geography school and arranged that the first Oxford professorship in geography was based at Hertford. During his tenure as principal, he completed his most significant academic works, including his Great War history (1934) which earned him the Oxford degree of DLitt. In 1936 Cruttwell delivered the Lees-Knowles Lecture at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the title [...] "The Role of British Strategy in the Great War". In the same year he published a biography of the Duke of Wellington and in 1937 produced his final major academic work, [...] A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World. An attempt in 1935 to emulate his grandfather and become one of the university's members of parliament failed when, as a Conservative candidate in the general election of 1935, Cruttwell was defeated. An Independent, A. P. Herbert, beat him on the third ballot in a single transferable vote system. This was {{the first time since the}} 1860s, that a Conservative had failed to hold either of the two university seats, a humiliation noted with relish by [...] Waugh who harboured a deep hostility towards his former tutor. According to The Times, Cruttwell had underestimated the nature and determination of the opposition and had taken his election as a Conservative for granted. In first preferences, he came bottom of the poll with only 1,803 votes, while his Conservative running mate, Lord Hugh Cecil, gained 7,365, almost five times as many. Because he polled less than one-eighth of the first ballot votes, Cruttwell forfeited his deposit.|$|E

40|$|The Article gives {{a general}} {{overview}} of the Hungarian constitutional and legal framework for the participation of national minorities in the decision-making. The relatively low number of people belonging to national minorities in Hungary {{as well as the}} scattered patterns of their settlement and some aspects of the Hungarian legal traditions underlie the choice of the so called personal autonomy approach. The minorities can establish via a special electing mechanism local and national self-governments enjoying consultative and truly public law type rule-making and <b>administrative</b> <b>competences.</b> Having given the proper interpretation of the relevant article of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court also contributed to the birth of the Act on the Rights of Minorities. The basic reason behind the creation of a very complicated, multilevel institutional complex is that in this way, educational and cultural needs of minorities of different scale can be represented in a relatively coherent manner. This does not exclude at all the possibility of bringing modifications to the legal text in the light of a decade's experience...|$|R

The conclusion give an insight, if all four scientific metropolitan functions can be found within the region and what their approach of a cooperative federalism is about. All four metropolitan functions can be found within the region in terms of the new high-speed railway. The innovation function is given through the INTERREG IVB-NWE project CODE 24, which was elected as a strategic initiative and was of European importance. The decision-making and control function is given through the established European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation, as it gives the whole initiative an European legal form. The symbol function can be found particularly in a footnote of the German Federal Train Track Expansion Act back in 2004, as the region achieved a legal boundary at the federal level. The last function, the gateway function, is given as the corridor between those two agglomerations has the highest traffic volume in Germany...|$|R
