50|$|The outer rim of Volkov is {{moderately}} eroded, {{with a small}} crater {{across the}} northeast rim and {{a gap in the}} southeast where it joins Volkov J.

5|$|The total Germanic {{population}} of Alamannia {{at this time}} has been estimated at <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> 120,000 - 150,000. This compares with the about 10 million inhabitants of Roman Gaul.

5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its adaptations to living on <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E

5|$|As {{the role}} of native cavalry grew, that of Roman/Latin cavalry diminished. In the early 1st century BC, Roman cavalry was phased out altogether. After the Social War, the socii were all granted Roman citizenship, the Latin alae abolished, and the socii {{recruited}} into the legions. Furthermore, Roman equestrians were no longer required to perform cavalry service after this time. The late Republican legion was thus probably bereft of cavalry (<b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> cavalry force of 120 men was probably added back to the legion under Augustus).|$|E
