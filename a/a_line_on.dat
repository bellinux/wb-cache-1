5|$|On 12 April, Nedeljković {{received}} orders {{direct from}} Simović {{that he was}} to defend the Bosanska Krajina region by holding the Germans along the Sava and Una, using a new 4th Army formed from the remnants of the 4th and 7th Armies. However, by this time the 4th Army amounted to about 250–300 infantry and 12 artillery pieces, divided between Bosanska Kostajnica, Bosanski Novi, Bihać and Prijedor. In order to delay the German advance, he was ordered to destroy all the bridges on the Una before withdrawing to <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> the Vrbas.|$|E
5|$|Led by the Elias-Arnott-Sykora line (The <b>A</b> <b>Line)</b> <b>on</b> {{offense and}} the goaltending of Brodeur (who {{appeared}} in a record 97 games between {{the regular season and}} playoffs), the Devils reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the second-straight year in 2001. They lost the series to the Colorado Avalanche despite leading 3–2. John Madden became the first player in franchise history to win the Frank J. Selke Trophy for top defensive forward. In the 2001–02 season, they were expected to be contenders once again, and they finished the season as the third-best team in the Atlantic Division, with 95 points. The Devils entered the playoffs as a sixth seed, but lost in the first round to the third-seeded Carolina Hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Sailing from Rodriguez on 22 November, the 70 {{vessels of}} the {{invasion}} fleet reached Grand Baie on 29 November. The French {{made no attempt to}} resist the landing either at sea or on land and Keating was able to rapidly advance on the capital, hastily mobilised militia units falling back before the British advance. On 30 November, Keating crossed the Rivière du Tombeau after the militia garrison withdrew and in the evening his forward units were skirmishing with Decaen's garrison of Port Napoleon {{a few miles from the}} capital. The following morning, Decaen's field commander, Edmé-Martin Vandermaesen made a stand, forming <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> a rise outside the town that blocked Keating's advance. Engaging the centre, Keating used his superior numbers to outflank and defeat the French garrison and Port Napoleon fell. A ceasefire was agreed on 2 December and the following day Decaen surrendered, although he and his men were repatriated to France with their standards and personal weapons.|$|E

25|$|The MRT was a {{very recent}} {{addition}} for Singapore and as such, the authorities {{wanted to keep the}} MRT map as easy to use for Singaporeans as possible. Hence, each direction of travel was colour-coded in a different colour as though it were <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> its own. In that way, confusion in decision-making when taking a certain line in a certain direction would be reduced for passengers. However, this reduced the amount of colours available for new lines and was not in line with international practice.|$|E

The cost of laying the track on Market Street, including the complicated layout at the junction with Long Row, was £6,575, while Hartley Road cost £7,600.|$|E

In 1944, the Wehrmacht had been pressed back along its entire front line in the East. By May 1944, the South Ukraine Army Group (Heeresgruppe Südukraine) was pushed back towards the prewar Romanian frontier, and managed to establish <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> the lower Dniester River, which was however breached in two places, with the Red Army holding bridgeheads. After June, calm returned to the sector, allowing the rebuilding of the German formations.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November 1858 the Mid-Kent Railway {{constructed}} {{a line from}} New Beckenham to Beckenham Junction station and obtained running rights over the WELCPR to Bromley (Shortlands).

The Mid Kent line connected with the WELCPR that later provided the necessary access to London.

25|$|On September 26, 2009, Ichiro was {{ejected from}} {{a game for}} the first time in his {{professional}} career. Arguing that a strikeout pitch from Toronto's David Purcey had been outside, Ichiro used his bat to draw <b>a</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> the outer edge of the plate, and was immediately tossed by umpire Brian Runge. He was the only Mariner to be ejected from a game all season. The ejection may have hurt Ichiro's chances regarding an esoteric record: the longest playing streak without going hitless in consecutive games. Ichiro's stretch was at 180 games, the longest in the majors since Doc Cramer went 191 consecutive games without back-to-back 0-fers in 1934–35. Ichiro went hitless in the following afternoon's game.|$|E
