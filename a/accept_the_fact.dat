In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communiqué announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.|$|E

5|$|Holly {{runs away}} from home and a {{large-scale}} police investigation is put in place to find her. Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat. Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him. After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma. Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam would take her back.|$|E

25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E

In the meantime, Edith has fallen hard for Sir Anthony Strallen, whom Robert discourages from marrying Edith due to his age and infirm condition. At Edith's insistence, Robert gives in and welcomes Sir Anthony, but the latter cannot <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there is no reservation from the Grantham family, and at the altar on their wedding day announces that he cannot go through with the marriage, devastating Edith.|$|E
25|$|Though Catherine's {{life and}} reign {{included}} remarkable personal successes, they ended with two failures. Her Swedish cousin (once removed), King Gustav IV Adolph, visited her in September 1796, the Empress's intention being that her granddaughter Alexandra should become Queen of Sweden by marriage. A ball was {{given at the}} imperial court on 11 September, when the engagement {{was supposed to be}} announced. Gustav Adolph felt pressured to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Alexandra would not be converting to Lutheranism, and though he was delighted by the young lady, he refused to appear at the ball and left for Stockholm. Catherine was so irritated at this, her health was affected. She recovered well enough to begin to plan a ceremony where a favourite grandson would supersede her difficult son on the throne, but she died of a stroke before the announcement could be made, just over two months after the engagement ball.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing about}} this horrific event, Chang strives to portray {{it as an}} unexamined Asian holocaust. Unfortunately, she {{undermines}} her argument—she is not a trained historian—by neglecting the wealth of sources in English and Japanese on this event. This leads her into errors such as greatly inflating the population of Nanjing (Nanking) {{at that time and}} uncritically accepting the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and contemporary Chinese figures for the numbers of Chinese civilians and soldiers killed. What particularly struck me about her argument was her attempt to charge all Japanese with refusing to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of the 'Rape of Nanking' and her condemnation of the 'persistent Japanese refusal {{to come to terms with}} its past.' ...|$|E

500|$|The boys {{seek help}} from a medium (a parody of Zelda Rubinstein's {{character}} in Poltergeist), who explains the celebrities are trapped in purgatory, which she compares to being stuck on a plane waiting endlessly on a runway for permission to take off. The medium manages to contact the spirits {{and tell them that}} they have passed on. Much to her surprise, the celebrities say that they all <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> Two deceased celebrities, CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and Patrick Swayze, tell her that Michael Jackson's refusal to acknowledge his death is the main cause of them being trapped. Some of the celebrities help the medium and the boys try to convince Jackson that he is dead, but Jackson keeps denying it and insists he is not only alive, but also a little white girl. His denial is so strong that he emits a very powerful force which flings the medium out the window of Ike's hospital room, where she falls to her death. The ghosts of these annoyed celebrities are shown in purgatory, which resembles the interior of an airplane, complete with seats, flight attendants and pilot voice-over announcements.|$|E
500|$|Fun Home {{has several}} themes {{recurring}} throughout the book. The biggest theme, arguably, is sexual orientation. Bechdel tells {{the readers of}} her journey of discovering her own sexuality through books. [...] "My realization at nineteen that I was a lesbian came about {{in a manner consistent}} with my bookish upbringing." [...] Her exposure (from reading literal definitions in dictionaries, reading interviews of others like her, etc.) helped her come to terms with her sexuality, but in truth, the hints of it plagued her childhood: her desire [...] "for the right to exchange [...] tank suit for a pair of shorts" [...] in Cannes" [...] or her desire for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip. [...] However, Bechdel also reveals that she wasn't alone in her choice of partners; her father also exhibited some homosexual behaviors, but in a different way than Alison. [...] "I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy" [...] when her mother reveals Bechdel's father's secret. Though both, father and daughter, had similar situations (Bechdel was a lesbian while her father was gay or bisexual), the two handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose to <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> and not hide from the issue, taking a female partner and going to [...] "gay union" [...] meetings when she was a student at Oberlin College. Bechdel was open about her sexuality before she'd even been in a same-sex relationship (of any sort). Her father, on the other hand, had had countless affairs with men but wasn't open about it. [...] This may be due to homophobia (his and/or others'), or because he was married with a family. In any case, it is clear that he is afraid of coming out, as illustrated by [...] "the fear in his eyes" [...] when the conversation topic is dangerously close to homosexuality.|$|E
