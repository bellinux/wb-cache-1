40|$|With {{the even}} faster {{popularity}} of multimedia applications in recent years, newly emerging applications require short-lived high bandwidth connections. The agile all-optical solution is one approach to {{setting up a}} solid supporting layer for the next-generation Ethernet-based communication network infrastructure. In agile <b>all-optical</b> <b>networks,</b> time division multiplexing (TDM) in the optical domain is applied on wavelength channels to further divide each wavelength channel into subchannels. This approach enables bandwidth virtualization where the bandwidth allocation for network traffic demands is decoupled from wavelength channels, supporting a variety of data rates ranging from sub-wavelength to super-wavelength. The objective of this thesis is to design a fast and smart control mechanism to manage the connection operations in agile <b>all-optical</b> <b>networks</b> by using analytical and simulation tools. This thesis focuses on the control of dynamic and flexible traffic in metro networks and covers the following aspects of the control plane: bandwidth allocation, which includes route selection and fiber, wavelength and timeslot assignment for flexible bandwidth demands aiming to minimize connection blocking; signaling and reservation, {{which is responsible for}} network information exchange and node switching control in order to manage connections effectively; and network protection and restoration, which is able to maintain the continuity of critical network services in the presence of network failures. In this work, network blocking performance is chosen as the key metric in measuring the performances of algorithms and protocols for dynamic traffic control. The proposed algorithms and protocols are evaluated by the definition of mathematical and simulation models through which the best approaches under different network conditions are identified. The algorithms, protocols and analytical and simulation models resulting from this thesis can be used to understand the different aspects of dynamic traffic control in agile <b>all-optical</b> <b>networks,</b> to predict the performance of some control mechanisms to be deployed in agile <b>all-optical</b> <b>networks,</b> and as a reference for the design of next-generation <b>all-optical</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
