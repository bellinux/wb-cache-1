2500|$|The Deluxe {{was among}} the [...] "new" [...] 1968 Les Pauls.

The mini-humbucker pickup fit into the pre-carved P-90 pickup cavity using an <b>adaptor</b> <b>ring</b> developed by Gibson {{in order to use}} a surplus supply of Epiphone mini-humbuckers. The Deluxe was introduced in late 1968 and helped to standardize production among Gibson's U.S.-built Les Pauls. The first incarnation of the Deluxe featured a one-piece body and slim three-piece neck. The multipiece body (a thin layer of maple on top of two layers of Honduran mahogany) arrived in 1969. In late 1969, a reinforcing neck volute was added. 1969 Deluxes feature the Gibson logo devoid of the dot over the [...] "i" [...] in Gibson. By late 1969/early 1970, the dot over the [...] "i" [...] had returned, plus a [...] "Made In USA" [...] stamp {{on the back of the}} headstock. The Deluxe could be specially-ordered with full-size humbucker pickups; such full size versions of the Deluxe were [...] "Standard" [...] spec. By 1975, the neck construction was changed from mahogany to maple, until the early 1980s, when the construction was returned to mahogany. The body changed back to solid mahogany from the pancake design in late 1976 or early 1977. Interest in this particular Les Paul model was so low that in 1985, Gibson canceled it. In 2005, the Deluxe was re-introduced.|$|E

40|$|The Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) is a {{secondary}} payload mission that {{was selected to}} launch with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) when that mission was upgraded from a Delta II to an Atlas launch vehicle. The LCROSS spacecraft employs the EELV Secondary Payload <b>Adaptor</b> (ESPA) <b>ring</b> as the primary structure, ensuring compatibility with both the Centaur upper stage and the LRO spacecraft. In this novel approach the ESPA ring, which was originally designed to hold up to 6 small satellites weighing 205 kg each, supports the LCROSS spacecraft subsystems on panels mounted to each adaptor fitting. This ESPA ring architecture affords low-cost access to space through reduced spacecraft costs and by enabling two capable missions {{for the cost of}} a single launch. The modular subsystem panel approach also provides flexibility in performing integration and in adapting the design to new missions. This paper describes our approach for leveraging the extra lift capability of the new generation of EELVs to enable the use of {{a secondary}} mission at well below the cost of an independently launched mission. We discuss the design of the LCROSS mission, and use the LCROSS architecture to illustrate a variety of planetary and astronomical missions that are compatible with being a secondary payload. Despite being labeled a secondary mission, provides the potential for high value science missions {{at a fraction of the}} cost of the traditional mission approach...|$|R
40|$|Many plasma {{membrane}} transporters in yeast are endocytosed {{in response to}} excess substrate or certain stresses and degraded in the vacuole. Endocytosis invariably requires ubiquitination by the HECT domain ligase Rsp 5. In the cases of the manganese transporter Smf 1 and the amino acid transporters Can 1, Lyp 1 and Mup 1 {{it has been shown}} that ubiquitination is mediated by arrestin-like adaptor proteins that bind to Rsp 5 and recognize specific transporters. As yeast contains a large family of arrestins, this has been suggested as a general model for transporter regulation; however, analysis is complicated by redundancy amongst the arrestins. We have tested this model by removing all the arrestins and examining the requirements for endocytosis of four more transporters, Itr 1 (inositol), Hxt 6 (glucose), Fur 4 (uracil) and Tat 2 (tryptophan). This reveals functions for the arrestins Art 5 /Ygr 068 c and Art 4 /Rod 1, and additional roles for Art 1 /Ldb 19, Art 2 /Ecm 21 and Art 8 /Csr 2. It also reveals functional redundancy between arrestins and the arrestin-like adaptors Bul 1 and Bul 2. In addition, we show that delivery to the vacuole often requires multiple additional ubiquitin ligases or <b>adaptors,</b> including the <b>RING</b> domain ligase Pib 1, and the adaptors Bsd 2, Ear 1 and Ssh 4, some acting redundantly. We discuss the similarities and differences in the requirements for regulation of different transporters.

The increase in projectile weight gave the new weapon a range of over 50,000 meters with normal ERFB-BB ammunition, {{making it one of the}} longest-range artillery pieces in the world. The gun was also purchased by the Iraqis, who mounted it in a self-propelled form to create the Al-Fao.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} bending behavior of thick-walled composite tubes addressing the bending stiffness property theoretically and experimentally, and investigating the failure behavior experimentally. A theoretical formulation, based on 3 D elasticity theory, is adopted for calculating the bending stiffness. An interesting bending stiffness behavior is brought up for thick-walled composite tubes made of two thick layers of [θ/-θ] stacking sequence. It is {{found that the}} bending stiffness value is decreasing when the wall thickness exceeds a specific value, for tubes have equal layers thickness and constant outer diameter (Do). A new parameter is defined from the used bending stiffness formulation, for each layer in the composite tube, denoted as “Eeff,n”, the effective extensional stiffness of the composite layer “n”. This new parameter represents the layer mechanical properties contribution in its bending stiffness, involving the effects of layer geometry and its interaction with adjacent layers in the tube. A novel parametric study is carried out using “Eeff,n” and {{it is found that}} the interaction effect improves highly the bending stiffness property. The responsible layer properties that control the interaction effect are specified and the improvement mechanism for the bending stiffness property is explained. Also the effective layer geometric parameters are specified and their role in the discovered bending stiffness behavior is investigated. Making use of the obtained results, the bending stiffness of a tube made of two thick layers of equal thickness and [θ/-θ] stacking sequence is compared to another tube made of repeated units of [θ/-θ] stacking sequence within the tube wall thickness “Multi-sublaminates configuration”. It is found that the second tube has higher bending stiffness value, noting that the two tubes have the same geometry iv and made of the same composite material. This is because the configuration of the second tube permits higher interaction effect between tube layers and cancels the negative effect of geometric parameters. According to that a simple and accurate equation is derived for designing the bending stiffness of multi-sublaminates composite tubes including only the interaction effects. In order to validate the superiority of the bending stiffness of multi-sublaminates composite tubes over tubes made of one sublaminate of thick layers, two thick-walled thermoplastic composite tubes are manufactured using automated fiber placement technique (AFP) and tested using a pure bending test setup. For the manufacturing process, a study is carried out to specify the process parameters for an AFP-made thermoplastic composite tube with acceptable quality. It is found that increasing the number of compaction passes improves the intimate contact between the composite layers and reduces the voids content. For the testing process, an <b>adaptor</b> <b>ring</b> is designed to permit fixing of the manufactured specimen in the pure bending test setup and to allow smooth conveying for the pure bending loading to the tested specimen. The pure bending test setup is shown to be a superior alternative test compared to the conventional 3 -point and 4 -point bending tests in testing composite tubes. The experimental results validate the obtained theoretical values and the used bending stiffness formulas. Lastly, the failure behavior of multi-sublaminates thick-walled composite tube is investigated according to the bending test results. The mode of failure of the tube under bending is due to delamination of the outer layers. Also, it is found that thick-walled composite tubes failed safely compared to thin-walled composite tubes...|$|E
