500|$|Many critics {{found the}} song {{intriguing}} {{and came up}} with interpretations of it as well. Andrew McGregor of the BBC questioned if [...] "Confessions Part II", as well as [...] "Truth Hurts", are only [...] "mere theatre" [...] or telling the truth. Laura Sinagra of Rolling Stone focuses on how Usher admits in the song about impregnating a mistress. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Usher was at an age when [...] "getting his 'chick on the side'" [...] seemed appropriate. Outside of rumors, Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly said that the best songs from the album were [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Burn", which he described as having smooth melodies. Matt Cibula of Popmatters said of the flow of the concept does not work. He pointed out that in the second part, Usher claims he [...] "barely knows the other lady", while in the first part, he <b>already</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> she was his ex-girlfriend. He furthered called it the [...] "wimpiest" [...] song on the theme of the album. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it a [...] "tricky infidelity narrative".|$|E
500|$|Kumaritashvili's death raised {{concerns}} about athlete safety at the Winter Olympics. As of 21 February 2010, there were 30 crashes in bobsleigh and luge at the Sliding Centre. Debate was raised on tightening qualification standards in weeding out unqualified athletes, in requiring {{a large number of}} training runs, in slowing down the sliding tracks, or in combining the three. The Russian National Sliding Centre planned for the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton events at the 2014 Winter Olympics has not been built though organizers <b>already</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it is designed to be [...] slower than The Whistler Sliding Centre. Sochi's Sliding Centre will be monitored via 3-D computer graphics and simulation. The IOC has improved safety standards over the years such as lowering obstacles for the equestrian three-day event, requiring protective head gear for boxing and ice hockey, and tightening qualification standards to preclude athletes not qualified for the event. FIBT President Storey wanted to wait to review safety of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton until after the 2010 Games, stating that track designers needed to find a balance between challenges and dangers on the track. Track designer Gurgel told Sport Bild that perhaps track walls should be raised [...] on future courses though a risk-proof course may not be possible. According to VANOC, over 30,000 runs were made prior to the games with neither the FIBT nor the FIL issuing public danger warnings about the track. IOC President Jacques Rogge stated that he [...] "will do everything in my power that this should not happen again in the future".|$|E

'I {{made you}} swear, daughters of Jerusalem...' this great oath to God {{was that they}} should not arouse the Redemption until that love will be desired and with good will, as it is written 'until I desire,' and our Sages <b>already</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the time of this oath is a {{thousand}} years, as it is written in the Baraita of Rabbi Yishmael in Pirkei Heichalot (in a comment on Daniel 7:25)..., and similarly in the Zohar II:17a...that it is one day of the Exile of the Community of Israel...|$|E

2500|$|Pope John Paul II again consecrated {{the entire}} world to the Virgin Mary in 1984, without {{explicitly}} mentioning Russia. Some believe that Sister Lúcia verified that this ceremony fulfilled the requests of the Virgin Mary. However, in the Blue Army's Spanish magazine, Sol de Fátima, in the September 1985 issue, Sister Lúcia said that the ceremony did not fulfill the Virgin Mary's request, as there was no specific mention of Russia and [...] "many bishops attached no importance to it." [...] In 2001, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone met with Sister Lúcia, who reportedly told him, [...] "I have <b>already</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the consecration desired by Our Lady was made in 1984, and has been accepted in Heaven." [...] Sister Lúcia died on 13 February 2005, without making any public statement of her own to settle the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Goddard had <b>already</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} be his last series. Immediately after the Third Test ended, while the players were celebrating in the {{dressing}} room, one of the selectors told Goddard he had been left out of the team for the final Test now that the series was won, in order that the team should consist only of players who would be touring England later that year. The decision and its timing were widely unpopular. Peter Pollock said [...] "it was no way to say thanks to {{a man who had been}} involved almost from the start in South Africa's rise to cricketing glory". Trevor Chesterfield described it as [...] "cruel and unnecessary; an act which took some of the sparkle out of the 4–0 whitewash". The captain, Ali Bacher, said that despite the team's success, the day was [...] "one of the saddest since I first played Test cricket for South Africa". Goddard himself simply said, [...] "I wouldn't be human if I did not say I was disappointed. But that's life." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Cao Cao's {{victory at}} Guandu, Cao Ren {{continued}} to join Cao Cao in his campaigns against Yuan Shao's heirs {{in the early}} 3rd century. During one battle near Hu Pass (壺關; present-day Huguan County, Shanxi), Cao Cao gave orders that all the enemy troops would be buried alive after the city fell. However, after several days of siege, Cao Cao's forces were unable to capture the city. Cao Ren then told Cao Cao, [...] "When we besiege a city, we must leave the defenders with a final option of surrendering. Now, as you've <b>already</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the defenders would be slaughtered after the city is taken, all of them would definitely put up fierce resistance. Besides, the city's fortifications are strong and the defenders have much supplies, so our forces would suffer heavy casualties if we attack, {{and we will be}} held up here if we switch to a defensive stance. It's not a wise choice to besiege a city whose defenders are willing to fight to the death." [...] Cao Cao heeded Cao Ren's advice, and the enemy surrendered later. After the campaign, Cao Ren received the title of a [...] "Marquis of a Chief Village" [...] (都亭侯) for his contributions.|$|E

Now, with the unfolding of the ‘Bridgegate’ scandal any hopes he may have had for 2016 may be in tatters. David Redlawsk and Ashley Koning take a look at why the scandal matters for Christie.

There was an ancient Targum to Job which was regarded by the Talmudists as a dangerous work (comp. Tosef., Shab. xiv.).|$|R
