50|$|There {{are many}} types of motors {{that can be used}} in a linear <b>actuator</b> <b>system.</b> These include dc brush, dc brushless, stepper, or in some cases, even {{induction}} motors. It all depends on the application requirements and the loads the actuator is designed to move. For example, a linear actuator using an integral horsepower AC induction motor driving a lead screw can be used to operate a large valve in a refinery. In this case, accuracy and high movement resolution aren't needed, but high force and speed are. For electromechanical linear actuators used in laboratory instrumentation robotics, optical and laser equipment, or X-Y tables, fine resolution in the micron range and high accuracy may require the use of a fractional horsepower stepper motor linear actuator with a fine pitch lead screw. There are many variations in the electromechanical linear <b>actuator</b> <b>system.</b> It is critical to understand the design requirements and application constraints to know which one would be best.|$|E

40|$|AbstractToday {{products}} {{are more and}} more substitutabledue to progress in information technology as well as globalization. New competitors, particularly from developing and emerging countries are putting established companies under pressure, due to lower production costs. In consequence, the prices and thus realizable profits for companies are decreasing. Focusing on the customer value can help to break this trend. In this way, the product understanding is changing. Besides offering products, offering services and combining both is getting more and more important. However, the product requirements are changing and may require new technologies. For small-to-medium-sized actuator applications shape memory alloy based <b>actuator</b> <b>systems</b> are a promising technology. In addition to the advantages in physical and mechanical properties, the integrated sensor function allows a simple condition monitoring and thus easy maintenance processes. Companies can generate new value for customers and are therefore able to improve their competitiveness. The consequence is that companies are offering new business models. For this reason, these actuators are ideal for industrial product-service systems. This paper illustrates the maintenance processes of shape memory based <b>actuator</b> <b>systems</b> using the integrated sensor function. Based on these maintenance processes andsuitable business models are designed as well as analyzed. As a result, recommendations for these <b>actuator</b> <b>systems</b> are provided. It is vital to introduce the relevant areas like shape memory alloy based <b>actuator</b> <b>systems,</b> industrial product service systems, maintenance and business models in the field of mechanical engineering first...|$|R
50|$|Examination of the {{aircraft}} and the cargo door, which was recovered largely intact in Windsor, demonstrated that the latches had never rotated to their locked position. In their locked position, pressure on the door presses the latches further shut, and no force is transmitted into the <b>actuator</b> <b>system</b> that closes and opens them. With the latches only partially closed, forces on the door were transmitted back into the actuator, eventually overwhelming it at about 6,600 lbf. The rapid depressurization when the door broke off caused the floor above it to partially cave in, which pulled the rudder cable to its extension limit and severed several other operating cables.|$|E
5000|$|Vibration calibrators [...] are {{electromechanical}} instruments which enable calibration of vibration {{sensors and}} measuring instruments to traceable standards. They produce sinusoidal mechanical vibration signals with known amplitudes and frequencies. The vibrating {{part of the}} instrument is usually a cylindrical steel stud with an internal thread for attachment of the test object. An electrodynamic or piezoelectric <b>actuator</b> <b>system</b> is used to produce the vibrations. With older instruments {{it was necessary to}} adjust the vibration amplitude according to the weight of the test object. However, modern instruments contain a built-in reference accelerometer and closed-loop control, with which the amplitude is kept constant up to a maximum specified weight of test object. Older models can be used to calibrate objects weighing up to a maximum of approximately 100 g, whereas the latest instruments can work stably with test objects weighing over 500 g.|$|E
50|$|A CH-47F Block 2 {{is planned}} to be {{introduced}} after 2020. The Block 2 aims for a payload of 22,000 lb with 4,000 ft (1,200 m) and 95°F (35°C) high and hot hover performance, eventually increased up to 6,000 ft (1,800 m), to carry the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; maximum takeoff weight would be raised to 24,500 kg. It features the composite-based advanced Chinook rotor blade (derived from the cancelled RAH-66 Comanche) 20% more powerful Honeywell T55-715 engines, and the active parallel <b>actuator</b> <b>system</b> (APAS); the APAS enhances the digital advanced flight-control system, providing an exact torque split between the rotors for greater efficiency.

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} event, Dan Applegate, Director of Product Engineering at Convair, wrote {{a memo to}} Convair {{management}} pointing out several problems with the door design. McDonnell Douglas had subcontracted design and construction of the DC-10 fuselage to Convair, and Applegate had overseen its development in ways that he felt were reducing {{the safety of the}} system. In particular, he noted that the <b>actuator</b> <b>system</b> had been switched from a hydraulic system to an electrical one, which he felt was less safe. He also noted that the floor would be prone to failure if the door was lost, and this would likely sever the control cables, leading to a loss of the aircraft. Finally, he pointed out that this precise failure had already occurred in ground testing in 1970, and he concluded that such an accident was almost certain to occur again in the future.|$|E

50|$|Because {{there is}} no camshaft, there are fewer moving parts. The cam shaft rollers and push rods have been {{replaced}} by an electro-hydraulic <b>actuator</b> <b>system</b> which uses the existing fuel pumps. This reduces development risks of the new system by employing existing technology. Direction changing on older B&W MC engines was engaged by changing the direction of the cam roller. With the new cam-less engine it is controlled by a computer. This gets rid of mechanical failures that can damage the engine if there is a malfunction in the engine when changing directions. Also, {{there is no}} chain connection between the crank shaft and the cam shaft so the engine is lighter with less points of failure. Since there is no camshaft, the parasitic load on the engine output is removed. This is particularly useful in large marine engines that can produce up to 100 megawatts as it can equate to a large amount of power saving. With a cam-less engine, fuel injection and exhaust timing are directly controlled by an Engine control unit and it can be constantly changed and adjusted without stopping the engine. This allows for the engine to run at lower RPM which is useful for maneuvering as it allows slower ship speeds for safe and precise docking. Aditionally, when a ship is maneuvering, the computer controlled Fuel injection and valve timing allows for faster RPM control, hence faster stopping in emergency situations.|$|E
