A fight broke out, in which one deputy was shot and another hit by a club. An Altman judge, a member of the WFM, charged the deputies with carrying concealed weapons and disturbing the peace, then released them.|$|E

25|$|During {{the year}} <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> raped, tortured, and killed civilians often as {{retribution}} for alleged collaboration with government forces. They sometimes threatened and harassed humanitarian workers. <b>Armed</b> <b>groups</b> killed nine UN peacekeepers during the year. Unlike in 2005, {{there were no}} reports of <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> imposing travel restrictions on humanitarian aid organizations, human rights NGOs, or journalists. Unlike in 2005, there were no reports of <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> killing or kidnapping humanitarian workers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Armed</b> <b>groups</b> {{operating}} outside {{government control}} subjected civilians to forced labor. Many <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> routinely forced civilians to transport looted goods for long distances without pay, and abducted men, women, and children for forced labor. On occasion, <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> also forced civilians to mine, particularly in Ituri District. <b>Armed</b> <b>groups</b> forced {{women and children}} to provide household labor or sexual services for periods ranging from several days to several months (see section 1.g.).|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is common}} for <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> to {{splinter}} (or “fragment”) during contexts of multi-party civil war, current guidance on Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) does not address the challenges that arise when recalcitrant fighters, unwilling to report to DDR, break ranks and form new <b>armed</b> <b>groups.</b> This Practice Note addresses this issue, drawing lessons from the multi-party context of the DRC and from the experiences of former members of three armed groups: the Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma), the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP), and the DRC national army (FARDC). While the findings indicate that the fragmentation of <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> may encourage desertion and subsequent participation in DDR, they also show that active <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> may monitor DDR programs and track those who demobilize. Remobilization may follow, either as active <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> target ex-combatants for forced re-recruitment or as ex-combatants remobilize in <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> of their own choice. Given these dynamics, practitioners in settings of partial peace may find it useful to consider non-traditional methods of DDR {{such as the use of}} mobile patrols and mobile disarmament units. The temporary relocation of ex-combatants to safe areas free from <b>armed</b> <b>groups,</b> or to protected transitional assistance camps, may also help to minimize remobilization during the reintegration phase...|$|R

40|$|Most {{contemporary}} armed {{conflicts are}} not of an international character. International Humanitarian Law (IHL) applicable to these conflicts is equally binding on non-State <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> {{as it is on}} States. The legal mechanisms for its implementation are, however, still mainly geared toward States. The author considers that the perspective of such groups and the difficulties for them in applying IHL should be taken into account {{in order to make the}} law more realistic and more often respected. It is submitted that the law is currently often developed and interpreted without taking into account the realities of <b>armed</b> <b>groups.</b> This contribution explores how <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> could be involved in the development, interpretation and operationalization of the law. It argues that <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> should be allowed to accept IHL formally, to create – amongst other things – a certain sense of ownership. Their respect of the law should also be rewarded. Possible methods to encourage, monitor and control respect of IHL by <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> are described. The author suggests in particular that <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> should be allowed and encouraged to [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to non-violent protests, <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> such as Azad Gomantak Dal (Free Goa Party) and the United Front of Goans conducted violent attacks aimed at weakening Portuguese rule in Goa. The Indian government supported {{the establishment of}} <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> such as Azad Gomantak Dal, giving them full financial, logistic and armament support. The <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> acted from bases situated in Indian territory and under cover of Indian police forces. The Indian government—through these <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> - attempted to destroy economic targets, telegraph and telephone lines, road, water and rail transport, in order to impede economic activity and create conditions for a general uprising.|$|R
50|$|After the Congolese wars, Walikale {{territory}} {{had known}} {{a period of}} relative calm: surely, <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> activities had not ceased, ‘food lootings’ were still frequent and <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> benefited from the central state’s ignorance of the region to continue their mining exploitation activities and to extend their local power. But at least, almost no conflicts were going on between <b>armed</b> <b>groups,</b> and nor the governmental army, nor was the MONUC interfering with their activities.|$|R

25|$|The GNC was {{challenged}} due to increasing security concerns in Tripoli. The GNC itself was attacked many times from militias and armed protesters who stormed the GNC assembly hall. Following his appointment, Abusahmain was tasked with providing security. He {{set up the}} Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR), which was initially intended to protect and secure Tripoli in August 2013. But this <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> was responsible for kidnapping Prime Minister Zeidan in October of that year resulting in the GNC dismissing it from its security function and Abusahmain himself as president. During his term, Abusahmain blocked inquiries into the distribution of state funds and it was alleged that Abusahmain was channeling government funding towards the LROR. The LROR was not an Islamist <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> but rather was made of rebels {{from the city of}} Gharyan. Its commander was Adel Gharyani.|$|E
25|$|Military {{operations}} {{conducted by}} the FARDC with MONUC support against <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> outside government control led to internal displacement of many persons during the year.

40|$|Technological {{advances}} are {{altering the}} contemporary asymmetric conflicts between non-­‐state <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> and state actors. This article discusses the humanitarian {{consequences of these}} changing conflicts by first illustrating the dangers posed by non-­‐state <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> gaining access to advanced technologies. A subsequent examination of the increasing ability of non-­‐state <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> to use new technologies, such as cyber operations, to mitigate state actor advantages and the resultant risks to civilian populations follows. The article concludes that the humanitarian challenges presented by this growing intimacy between non-­‐state <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> and technology, whether through a potentially devastating attack or by the dramatic erosion {{to the principle of}} distinction, are immense and cannot be ignored...|$|R
40|$|The type of {{relations}} between insurgent and counter-insurgent <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> on the one hand, and the civilians with whom they interact on the other, is subject to wide variation. At times, <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> try to approximate the behavior of states by extracting taxes, imposing new social norms, establishing predictable and routinized systems of rule enforcement, and supplying public goods. Yet, at other times, <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> interact with civilians only {{through the use of}} violence. There is variation not only across wars and <b>armed</b> <b>groups,</b> but also within these organizations. Civilian populations, for their part, also vary in how they respond to the presence of such groups. Some stay and collaborate, some choose to leave their hometowns and become refugees or internally displaced persons, some fight back by forming self-defense groups, and some enlist as full-time combatants. What explains a group’s decision to employ a specific strategy towards civilians? How can a civilian’s response to the presence of <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> in her hometown be explained...|$|R
40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} relationship between the human rights movement and <b>armed</b> <b>groups.</b> Drawing upon a wide array of case studies, it examines {{some of the most important}} legal and policy developments which have shaped this field since the 1980 s. It also critically explores some of the theoretical and practical models of interventions which have been deployed by different human rights organizations concerning abuses by <b>armed</b> <b>groups.</b> The paper then explores the dilemmas of engagement with <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> while managing the difficulties associated with conferring legitimacy on such groups. It also explores how human rights groups deal with the realities of the involvement of some <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> in governance functions within their own communities. Finally, we identify two areas where we believe important future developments in this field could be directed: the framework of transitional justice, and the role of human rights organizations in navigating the increasingly blurred boundaries between some <b>armed</b> <b>groups</b> and organized crim...|$|R

25|$|A more {{detailed}} Georgian government account was released later on August 30. According to it, the crisis had begun on August 28, when the <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> captured a patrol of the Border Police of Georgia {{who had been}} searching for the five missing local residents. The gunmen agreed to an offer by a senior border guard officer to keep just him as a hostage and to let go the civilians and the other border guards. Later, an official from the Georgian Interior Ministry arrived to negotiate and demanded their surrender, which was rejected. The group then decided to swap the last captive border guard for the official, telling him {{that he is now}} their hostage. Two of the gunmen then accompanied the official to a location where he could talk with his superiors to update them about the new developments, but instead they were led to an ambush site, where one of them was shot dead by a government sniper. The shooting sparked a firefight, in which 10 more members of the <b>armed</b> <b>group</b> and three Georgian troops were killed. Georgian forces used helicopters and aerial drones.|$|E
