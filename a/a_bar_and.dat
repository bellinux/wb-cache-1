5|$|The Cowshed houses away fans at Prenton Park, {{and has a}} {{capacity}} of 2,500. It has a slanted seating arrangement, caused by the main road running behind it.

Since the change, <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> TV screens {{have been added to the}} stand. The name is derived from its appearance before the redevelopment in 1995. With a 3 peak roof of corrugated iron, walls of wooden plank and a cinder bank floor it visually resembled an agricultural building.|$|E

5|$|An {{advertisement}} in The Guardian led Rowling {{to move to}} Porto, Portugal, {{to teach}} English as a foreign language. She taught at night and began writing in the day while listening to Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. After 18 months in Porto, she met Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> found they shared an interest in Jane Austen. They married on 16 October 1992 and their child, Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford), was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal. Rowling had previously suffered a miscarriage. The couple separated on 17 November 1993. Biographers have suggested that Rowling suffered domestic abuse during her marriage, although the extent is unknown. In December 1993, Rowling and her then-infant daughter moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, to be near Rowling's sister with three chapters of what would become Harry Potter in her suitcase.|$|E

Pete and Liz follow Paul to <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> {{find out that}} he is a Jenna Maroney impersonator, performing as her in a drag show. The next day, Liz asks Jenna if she knows what Paul does, but Jenna is aware of his work, having met Paul at a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest in which he won and Jenna herself placed fourth. Liz does not approve of the relationship and confronts Paul, asking what his intentions are with Jenna. Paul tells her that he is not using Jenna to further his career, but that he is with her because she accepts him for who he is. Liz is convinced by their touching (although weird) display of care for each other, ultimately approving of their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Pottier {{also won}} the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, he was leading by one hour at the halfway point. A cycling legend says {{that he decided to}} stop, entered <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> ordered a bottle of wine, and drank it almost completely. When he saw the first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall {{classification}} firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form {{in the second half of}} the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>and</b> return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E
