5000|$|Stephen Walt {{observed}} in the 1980s that most states, including all developed states, ally with, rather than balance against, the preponderant power. Noting this [...] "anomaly", Walt suggested his balance of threat hypothesis: [...] At first glance, this result would seem to contradict the assertion that states choose alliance partners in order to balance against the strongest. Focusing solely on <b>aggregate</b> <b>power</b> would lead us to expect more states to ally with the Soviet Union, {{in order to prevent}} the United States from using its superior overall resources in harmful ways. Judging from the preponderance of <b>aggregate</b> <b>power</b> favoring the West, many states appear to have 'bandwagoned' rather than balanced by aligning with the United States. This is even more striking when one remembers that the United States was overwhelmingly the world's most powerful country in the immediate postwar period, yet was able to bring most of the other industrial powers into alignment with rather than against it.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating the unobserved amount of photovoltaic (PV) generation and demand in a power distribution network starting from measurements of the <b>aggregated</b> <b>power</b> flow {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC) and local global horizontal irradiance (GHI). The estimation principle relies on modeling the PV generation {{as a function of the}} measured GHI, enabling the identification of PV production patterns in the <b>aggregated</b> <b>power</b> flow measurements. Four estimation algorithms are proposed: the first assumes that variability in the aggregated PV generation is given by variations of PV generation, the next two use a model of the demand to improve estimation performance, and the fourth assumes that, in a certain frequency range, the <b>aggregated</b> <b>power</b> flow is dominated by PV generation dynamics. These algorithms leverage irradiance transposition models to explore several azimuth/tilt configurations and explain PV generation patterns from multiple plants with non-uniform installation characteristics. Their estimation performance is compared and validated with measurements from a real-life setup including 4 houses with rooftop PV installations and battery systems for PV self-consumption.

40|$|Abstract—In {{wireless}} networks, reducing <b>aggregate</b> transmit <b>power</b> {{and in many}} cases, having even {{power distribution}} increase the network lifetime. Conventional direct transmission (DTX) scheme results in high <b>aggregate</b> transmit <b>power</b> and uneven power distribution. In this paper, we consider location-aware cooperation-based schemes namely immediate-neighbor cooperation (INC), maximal cooperation (MAX), and wireless network cocast (WNC) that achieve spatial diversity to reduce <b>aggregate</b> transmit <b>power</b> and even power distribution. INC utilizes twouser cooperative communication, resulting in good reduction of <b>aggregate</b> transmit <b>power</b> and low transmission delay; however, power distribution is still uneven. MAX utilizes multi-node cooperative communication, providing incremental diversity to achieve even power distribution and substantial reduction in <b>aggregate</b> transmit <b>power.</b> Transmission delay in MAX, however, grows quadratically with network sizes. As a result, the novel WNC is proposed to achieve incremental diversity as in MAX and low transmission delay as in INC. In WNC, mobile units acting as relays form unique linearly-coded signals from overheard signals and transmit them to the destination, where a multiuser detector jointly detects the symbols from all received signals. Performance evaluation in uniformly distributed networks shows that INC, MAX, and WNC substantially reduce <b>aggregate</b> transmit <b>power</b> while MAX and WNC also provide even power distribution.

30|$|DSFC {{presents}} a novel way {{to mitigate the}} difficulties of the increased need for the active power generation. The TCLs such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, and water heaters have been widely considered due to the short-term modulation of their <b>aggregated</b> <b>power</b> consumption [10, 12]. TCLs modulate the used power for cooling/heating to maintain the temperature nearly to the desired level. In Great Britain power system, the DSFC was considered in the applications of the modern power system’s frequency control [10, 12]. A novel technique was proposed in [56] for the domestic refrigerators, {{as an example of}} the TCLs demand side frequency control in the Great Britain power system. It was proposed to deal with the future inertia reduction and for estimating the infeed loss and post-fault restoration. Also, the method presented a non-real-time communication-controlled TCLs. <b>Aggregated</b> <b>power</b> of the TCLs was controlled as a linear function of the local frequency change [56].|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of factors that {{influence}} the decision of states to balance or bandwagon, as proposed by Stephen Walt in his account on alliance formation. First is <b>aggregate</b> <b>power,</b> which constitutes state's resources and capabilities. This particular factor can provoke balancing, in that a state with high <b>aggregate</b> <b>power</b> is a potential threat and can evoke fears of domination in smaller powers, but it can just as easily lead to bandwagoning as smaller states might be attracted to power and protection from a strong ally. Second factor is proximate power, whereby geographically close states pose a greater threat than distant ones as the ability to project power declines with distance. Once again, an aggressive and increasingly powerful neighbouring state is likely to alarm other states to engage in balancing strategies against it, however small, weak and vulnerable states neighbouring a great power are often prone to balancing {{due to the lack of}} viable alternatives, inability to balance independently or contribute to a balancing alliance. Offensive power is the third factor, which conveys that states with large and growing offensive capabilities are likely to provoke other to balance against them. The fourth factor concerns offensive intentions, where perceived aggressive or expansionist goals or motives of a state lead others to balance against it.|$|E
5000|$|Power is {{also used}} to {{describe}} the resources and capabilities of a state. This definition is quantitative and is most often used by geopoliticians and the military. Capabilities are thought of in tangible terms—they are measurable, weighable, quantifiable assets. A good example for this kind of measurement is the Composite Indicator on <b>Aggregate</b> <b>Power,</b> which involves 54 indicators and covers the capabilities of 44 states in Asia-Pacific from 1992 to 2012. Thomas Hobbes spoke of power as [...] "present means to obtain some future apparent good." [...] Hard power can be treated as a potential and is not often enforced on the international stage.|$|E
5000|$|A seaport, {{market and}} post village and a chapelry, {{in the parish}} and barony of Balrothery, county of Dublin, and {{province}} of Leinster, 15 miles (N. by E.) from Dublin; containing 3,016 inhabitants.The inhabitants are partly employed in the fishery, but principally {{in the manufacture of}} cotton; there are two large factories, the machinery of which is worked by steam-engines and water-wheels of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>power</b> of 84 horses, giving motion to 7,500 spindles, and spinning upon the average about 7400 lb. of cotton yarn per week. More than 300 persons are employed in these factories, to which are attached blue dye-works and in the village and neighbourhood are 942 hand-looms employed in the weaving department. The principal articles made at present are checks, jeans, calicoes and fustians. The village is also celebrated for the manufacture of the finest cotton stockings, which has been carried on successfully since its first establishment about 40 years since; there are 60 frames employed in this trade, and the average produce is about 60 dozen per week. There are on the quay a large corn store belonging to Messrs. Frost & Co., of Chester, and some extensive salt-works; and in the village is a tanyard.The fishery, since the withdrawing of the bounty, has very much diminished: there are at present only 10 wherries or small fishing boats belonging to the port. The village carries on a tolerably brisk coasting trade: in 1833, 134 coal vessels, of the aggregate burden of 11,566 tons, and 29 coasting vessels of 1,795 tons, entered inwards, and 17 coasters of 1,034 tons cleared outwards, from and to ports in Great Britain. The harbour is rendered safe for vessels of 150 tons' burden by an excellent pier, completed in 1763, principally by Baron Hamilton, aided by a parliamentary grant, and is a place of refuge for vessels of that burden at 3/4 tide. A jetty or pier, 420 feet (128 metres) long from the N. W. part of the harbour, with a curve of 105 feet (32 metres) in a western direction, forming an inner harbour in which at high tide is 14 feet (4 metres) of water, and affording complete shelter from all winds, was commenced in 1826 and completed in 1829, at an expense of £2,912-7s-9d, of which the late Fishery Board gave £1,569, the Marquess of Lansdowne £100, and the remainder was subscribed by the late Rev. Geo. Hamilton, proprietor of the village. At the end of the old pier there is a lighthouse.The Drogheda or Grand Northern Trunk railway from Dublin, for which an act has been obtained, is intended to pass along the shore close to the village and to the east of the church. The market is on Monday, and is abundantly supplied with corn, of which great quantities are sent to Dublin and to Liverpool; and there is a market for provisions on Saturday. Fairs are held on the 29th of April and September, chiefly for cattle. A market-house was erected in 1811, partly by subscription and partly {{at the expense of the}} Hamilton family. The village is the headquarters of the constabulary police force of the county; and near it is a Martello tower with a coast guard station, which is one of the nine stations within the district of Swords. Petty sessions for the north-east division of the county are held here every alternate Tuesday.The chapelry of St. George, Balbriggan, was founded by the late Rev. G. Hamilton, of Hampton Hall, who in 1813 granted some land and settled an endowment, under the 11th and 12th of Geo. III., for the establishment of a perpetual curacy; and an augmentation of £25 per annum has been recently granted by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from Primate Boulter's fund. In 1816 a chapel was completed, at an expense of £3,018-2s-2d, of which £1,400 was given by the late Board of First Fruits, £478-15s-2d., was raised by voluntary subscriptions of the inhabitants and £1,139-7s-0d., was given by the founder and his family. This chapel, which was a handsome edifice with a square embattled tower, and contained monuments to the memory of R. Hamilton, Esq., and the Rev. G. Hamilton, was burned by accident in 1835, and the congregation assemble for divine service in a school-room until it shall be restored, for which purpose the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have lately granted £480. The living is in the patronage of G. A. Hamilton, Esq.There is a chapel belonging to the R.C. Union or district of Balrothery and Balbriggan, also a place of worship for Wesleyan Methodists. A parochial school and dispensary are in the village.|$|E

40|$|Large {{groups of}} {{electrical}} loads {{can be controlled}} as a single entity to reduce the power demand in the electricity network. This approach, known as demand side management (DSM) or demand response, offers {{an alternative to the}} traditional paradigm in the electricity market, where matching supply and demand is achieved solely by regulating how much generation is dispatched. Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) such as air conditioners (ACs), fridges, water and space heaters are particularly suitable for DSM, as they store energy in the form of heat (or absence of it), allowing to shift the load to periods where the infrastructure is less heavily used. DSM can be implemented using feedback control techniques to regulate the <b>aggregated</b> <b>power</b> output of a population of these devices. To achieve high performance, modern feedback controllers are designed using a model of the plant (i. e. the population).

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been renewed {{interest}} in the potential of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), particularly, at very large scale of 10 MW or above owing to their structural simplicity. A significant disadvantage for many types of VAWTs is that the generated power is inherently periodic in nature. This power quality issue is exacerbated as the turbines increase in size and are aggregated requiring the transmission system to withstand large transients. These periodic perturbations in power can be smoothed out by permitting the rotor speed to vary; however, operation in this manner results in a poor capacity factor.
