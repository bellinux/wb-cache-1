25|$|A {{trick is}} to count up valence {{electrons}}, then count up the number of electrons needed to complete the octet rule (or with hydrogen just 2 electrons), then take the difference of these two numbers and the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> number of electrons {{that make up the}} bonds. The rest of the electrons just go to fill all the other atoms' octets.|$|E
25|$|A major {{question}} {{considered in}} mathematical Platonism is: Precisely {{where and how}} do the mathematical entities exist, {{and how do we}} know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.|$|E
500|$|On [...] "Blame Game", West {{attempts}} {{to call his}} past lover, but he receives a call back instead and he hears a conversation between her and Chris Rock, who begins an extended monologue approximately five minutes into the song. [...] Chris Rock performs a vulgar, profanity-ridden sketch in which he compliments his lover's dress sense and sexual technique, and asks her who taught her these skills. Each time he asks, the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same: [...] "Yeezy taught me.". Andy Gill of The Independent commented that a similar [...] "alliance of aristocratic piano and cello with less rarefied elements underpins 'Blame Game', a brutal rumination on West's sexual appetite".|$|E

2500|$|In the Hervarar saga, king Heidrek {{is asked}} by Gestumblindi (Odin), [...] "What is that lamp which lights up men, but flame engulfs it, and wargs grasp after it always." [...] Heidrek knows the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Sun, explaining: [...] "She lights up every land and shines over all men, and Skoll and Hatti are called wargs. Those are wolves, one going before the sun, the other after the moon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{presentation}} {{of the problem is}} to say : pick a random card out of the three, what are the odds that it has the same color on the other side? Since only one card is mixed and two have the same color on their sides, it is easier to understand that the probability is [...] Also note that saying that the color is black (or the coin is gold) instead of white doesn't matter since it is symmetric: the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same for white. So is the answer for the generic question 'same color on both sides'.|$|E
2500|$|During the Restoration {{the print}} {{revolution}} {{began to change}} every aspect of British society. It became possible for anyone to spend {{a small amount of}} money and have his or her opinions published as a broadsheet, and {{to gain access to the}} latest discoveries in science, literature, and political theory, as books became less expensive and digests and [...] "indexes" [...] of the sciences grew more numerous. The difficulty lay in discerning truth from falsehood, credible claims from impossible one. Swift writes A Tale of a Tub in the guise of a narrator who is excited and gullible about what the new world has to offer, and feels that he is quite the equal or superior of any author who ever lived because he, unlike them, possesses 'technology' and newer opinions. Swift seemingly asks the question of what a person with no discernment but with a thirst for knowledge would be like, and the <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> narrator of Tale of a Tub.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, a {{screenshot}} {{from the}} UKGameshows.com site was digitally altered {{and used in}} a piece on the satire site BS News. The image was also widely circulated as an email {{in which it was}} purported to show contestant Fiona Wheeler from the UK version, failing to answer her £100 question correctly after using all three lifelines because she was too sceptical of the assistance that was given; the image was actually a digitally altered screenshot of Wheeler's answering a different question from a higher tier. The hoax might have been inspired by an infamous moment from the French version of the show, in which a contestant requested help from the audience on a €3,000 question which asked which celestial body orbits the Earth: the Sun, the Moon, Mars or Venus. The majority of the audience provided the answer of [...] "the Sun", although the correct <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Moon, and the contestant ended up leaving with only €1,500 as a result. The hoax also borrows elements from a number of infamous moments on the U.S. version, where numerous unlucky contestants won nothing after submitting a wrong answer to one of the first five questions.|$|E
2500|$|For {{fifteen minutes}} after the {{individual}} round and {{fifteen minutes after}} the team round students can file what is known as a [...] "Request to Resolve", aka [...] "RTR". [...] If a student is extremely confident that they arrived at the correct answer and believe that the given answer is incorrect they can fill out a RTR form showing their work and explaining why their <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> correct one. [...] A resolution committee then reviews all RTRs submitted and either denies them or accepts them. [...] Most RTRs are denied because of some minor error on the student's part, {{but every once in a}} while a legitimate RTR is submitted. [...] In this case the official answer is changed and each student/team's score is recalculated using the new answer. [...] Most competitions have an errata sheet and verification forms to provide a central location of accepted and denied RTRs. There is an extremely rare status given to a RTR that is called a [...] "unique interpretation". [...] This occurs when a student interprets a problem in a drastically different, yet completely legitimate, way than the problem intended and thus changes the problem entirely. [...] In this case only that student is given credit for their answer and the original answer remains the same for the rest of the competitors.|$|E

60|$|Now therefore, {{when you}} hear me so often saying that the Northern races--Norman and Lombard,--are active, or dramatic, in their art; and that the Southern races--Greek and Arabian,--are contemplative, you ought {{instantly}} to ask farther, Active in what?

[...] Here Lanier faces {{one of the greatest}} problems of the age, the problem of industrialism with its false standards and waste of human happiness, and his <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same that Tennyson gave in his later poems; namely, that the familiar love in human hearts can settle every social question when left to its own unselfish way: ...|$|E
