We explore short-time homomorphic wavelet estimation as {{a combination of the}} classical homomorphic analysis and log-spectral averaging. The introduced method of log-spectral averaging using a short-term Fourier transform increases the number of sample points, thus reducing estimation variances.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} of a thin layer embedded in any formation creates complex reflection patterns caused by interferences within the thin bed. The generated reflectivity <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> have been increasingly used in seismic interpretation and more recently tested on ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data to characterize nonaqueous-phase liquid contaminants. Phase and frequency sensitivities of the reflected signals are generally not used, although they contain useful information. The present study aims to evaluate the potential of these combined properties to characterize a thin bed using GPR data acquired along a common-midpoint (CMP) survey, carried out to assess velocity variations in the ground. It has been restricted to the simple case of a thin bed embedded within a homogeneous formation, a situation often encountered in fractured media. Dispersive properties ofthe dielectric permittivity of investigated materials (homogeneous formation, thin bed) are described using a Jonscher parameterization, which permitted study of the dependency of <b>amplitude</b> and phase <b>variation</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> (APVO) curves on frequency and thin-bed properties (filling nature, aperture). In the second part, we discuss and illustrate {{the validity of the}} thin-bed approximation as well as simplify assumptions and make necessary careful corrections to convert raw CMP data into dispersive APVO curves. Two different strategies are discussed to correct the data from propagation effects: a classical normal-moveout approach and an inverse method. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a CMP GPR data set acquired along a vertical cliff. It allowed us to extract the characteristics of a subvertical fracture with satisfying resolution and confidence. The study motivates interest to use dispersion dependency of the reflection coefficient variations for thin-bed characterization...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative seismic {{interpretation}} {{has become an}} important and critical technology for improved hydrocarbon exploration and production. However, this is typically a resource-demanding process that requires information from several well logs, building a representative velocity model, and, of course, high-quality seismic data. Therefore, it is very challenging to perform in an exploration or appraisal phase with limited well control. Conventional {{seismic interpretation}} and qualitative analysis of <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> (AVO) are more common tools in these phases. Here, we demonstrate a method for predicting quantitative reservoir properties and facies using AVO data and a rock-physics model calibrated with well-log data. This is achieved using a probabilistic inversion method that combines stochastic inversion with Bayes' theorem. The method honors the nonuniqueness {{of the problem and}} calculates probabilities for the various solutions. To evaluate the performance of the method {{and the quality of the}} results, we compare them with similar reservoir property predictions obtained using the same method on seismic-inversion data. Even though both approaches use the same method, the input data have some fundamental differences, and some of the modeling assumptions are not the same. Considering these differences, the two approaches produce comparable predictions. This opens up the possibility to perform quantitative interpretation in earlier phases than what is common today, and it might provide the analyst with better control of the various assumptions that are introduced in the work process...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurements}} of fracture parameters, such as fracture orientation, fracture density and fracture compliance, in a reservoir {{is very important}} for field development and exploration. Traditional seismic methods for fracture characterization include shear wave birefringence (Gaiser and Dok, 2001; Dok et al., 2001; Angerer et al., 2002; Vetri et al., 2003) and <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> and azimuth (AVOA) (Ruger, 1998; Shen et al., 2002; Hall et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2010; Lynn et al., 2010). These methods are based on the equivalent medium theory with the assumption that fracture dimension and spacing are small relative to the seismic wave length, so a fracture zone behaves like an equivalent anisotropic medium. But fractures on the order of seismic wave length are also very important for enhanced oil recovery, and they are one of the important subsurface scattering sources that generate scattered seismic waves. Willis et al. (2006) developed the Scattering Index method to extract the fracture scattering characteristics by calculating the transfer funtion of a fracture zone. Fang et al. (2011) proposed a modification of the SI method (the Fracture Transfer Function (FTF) method) that leads to a more robust fracture characterization. In this paper, we use both laboratory data and field data to explore the capability of the FTF method. Eni-MIT Energy Initiative Founding Member Progra...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} fracture- and inclusion-induced seismic anisotropy in a carbonate reservoir rock and the resulting influence this anisotropy may have on surface seismic data. Whole-core velocity measurements made on a carbonate sample from the Gulf of Mexico show evidence of elastic anisotropy. Constraints on the style of this anisotropy are obtained from comparisons with effective medium modeling. The core exhibits monoclinic symmetry, which is interpreted as being caused by the combined effects of vertically-aligned drilling-induced fractures and oriented ellipsoidal vugs inclined at an of angle roughly 60 degrees to the vertical. The in situ anisotropy {{is believed to be}} orthorhombic, as there is evidence of natural fractures oriented orthogonally to the vugs. Surface seismic modeling is used to investigate <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> and azimuth (AVOA) effects due to such anisotropy. Our model is somewhat hypothetical, but consistent with velocities from the reservoir logs and the inferred in situ anisotropy. Our results suggest that for this model, P-wave AVOA will show significant azimuthal variation only at far offsets (near critical reflections). In fact, the onset of critical reflections will be dependent on the orientation of the seismic line with respect to the fracture direction. Shear modes will be more sensitive to fracture orientation at near offsets. In addition, we find that the P-P and P-S AVOA are sensitive to the presence of aligned vuggy porosity and so could provide a tool for identifying highly productive zones where fractures connect vugs...|$|R

40|$|Shenhu Area {{is located}} in the {{northern}} slope region of the South China Sea. Pre-drilling reservoir prediction by the analysis of both 2 D and 3 D seismic data indicates the presence of hydrate-bearing sediments of approximately 70 m thickness. Data also suggests a strong spatial correlation between gas hydrates and gas chimneys. Evidence suggests that these gas chimneys created pathways for the migration of gas and fluids into the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). In this study, we analyze reflection seismic data collected in the vicinity of a well where an abundance of gas hydrate is known to exist. Between the base of the gas hydrate stability zone and the top of the gas chimney, a thin layer of fine grained sediments is observed. A number of small faults (and possibly additional micro-fractures) breach the stratum and connect the gas chimney and GHSZ directly. Fluids, including free gas, may migrate upwards through these fractures. Additionally, small faults within the flanks of the gas chimney may effectively promote gas migration to the GHSZ. <b>Amplitude</b> <b>variation</b> <b>with</b> <b>offsets</b> analysis and instantaneous frequency analysis provided evidences of fluid pathways. A low-frequency anomaly over the center of the gas chimney indicates high seismic attenuation. This is interpreted to be caused by the migration of fluids (probably methane).

An inversion scheme has been developed to estimate fracture orientation and fracture density from <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> and azimuth (AVOA). The method has been tested on synthetic data and field data from an offshore fractured carbonate reservoir with promising results. Spectral characteristics of the numerical model data of the seismic wavefield scattered from aligned fractures with different spacing between fracture zones have been analyzed. Results indicate that the spacing of these large, open fracture zones can be estimated from the wavenumber spectra of the scattered wave amplitude {{as a function of}} offset in pre-stack data. Two approaches for converting seismically derived fracture parameters into fluid-flow parameters for use in reservoir simulators have been identified. The first is the numerical modeling of Stoke's flow in fracture networks, and the second uses a statistical model of a fracture distribution that allows for the calculation of the elastic properties and permeability tensor of the resulting equivalent medium.

40|$|Reflection {{seismology}} is {{a widely}} used geophysical method to image and delimit underground oil and gas prospects using seismic data illumination from the surface. The collected information in acquisition contains reflected energy {{that is used to}} build a time or a depth image of the subsurface, but is also corrupted with undesired components like multiple reflections and random noise. The success of seismic imaging heavily relies on building a velocity and anisotropy models that reflect the subsurface features to improve the resolution of the migrated sections. In this thesis, an automatic workflow for nonhyperbolic velocity analysis is presented to estimate the moveout parameters (velocity and anellipticity) in an efficient way using an accurate traveltime approximation, combined with efficient parameter sampling and highresolution coherency estimators that detect the reflected events in the gathers. The proposed estimators are based on differential semblance and use optimal trace sorting to improve resolution in moveout and residual moveout spectra that helps in enhanced parameter tracking. A modified version of the parabolic Radon transform is also presented with applications to multiple subtraction and trace interpolation. The transform is computed using a minimum-norm solution to an under-determined inverse problem solved by means of a singular value decomposition of a frequency-independent operator. This has benefits like improved separation of primaries and multiples when they severely intefer and preservation of amplitudes along the primaries after demultiple better than do the commonly used frequency-domain high-resolution parabolic Radon transforms. The presented methods are later applied to a shallow long-offset marine dataset that exhibits <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> (AVO) and have multiple energy in the gathers.

40|$|Traditional <b>amplitude</b> <b>variation</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> and azimuth (AVOAz) {{analysis}} for fracture characterization extracts fracture properties through analysis of reflection AVOAz to determine anisotropic parameters (e. g., Thomsen’s parameters) that are then related to fracture properties. The {{validity of this}} method relies on the basic assumption that a fractured unit {{can be viewed as}} an equivalent anisotropic medium. As a rule of thumb, this assumption is taken to be valid when the fracture spacing is less than λ/ 10. Under the effective medium assumption, diffractions from individual fractures destructively interfere and only specular reflections from boundaries of a fractured layer can be observed in seismic data. The effective medium theory has been widely used in fracture characterization, and its applicability has been validated through many field applications. However, through numerical simulations, we find that diffractions from fracture clusters can significantly distort the AVOAz signatures when a fracture system has irregular spacing even though the average fracture spacing is much smaller than a wavelength (e. g., ≪λ/ 10). Contamination by diffractions from irregularly spaced fractures on reflections can substantially bias the fracture properties estimated from AVOAz analysis and may possibly lead to incorrect estimates of fracture properties. Additionally, through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that fracture spacing uncertainty inverted from <b>amplitude</b> <b>variation</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> (AVO) analysis can be up to 10 %– 20 % when fractures are not uniformly distributed, which should be the realistic state of fractures present in the earth.

A new semblance scheme is introduced that aims to remove this trade-off. The new scheme uses the concepts of bootstrapped differential semblance with trend-based AB semblance. Results indicate that the new scheme indeed increases spectral resolution, reduces noise, and accounts for AVO anomalies.

In this case, multiple reflections coming from {{the two sides of the}} bed create interferences and generate complex reflection patterns. When multioffset data are available, <b>Amplitude</b> <b>Variations</b> of reflectivity according to Offset (AVO) have been increasingly used in seismic interpretation and more recently tested on Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data. Phase and frequency sensitivities of the reflected signals are generally not used, although they contain useful information. The present study proposes an original inversion methodology designed for 1 D media and denoted DAPVO (Dispersion of Amplitude and Phases Versus Offset curves). It combines all reflectivity properties (amplitude, phase and dispersion) of a reflected GPR signal generated by a thin-bed embedded within a homogeneous material, a situation often encountered in fractured media, for example. Dispersive properties of the dielectric permittivity of investigated materials (homogeneous formation, thin bed) are described using a Jonscher parameterization, which permitted study of the sensitivity of <b>amplitude</b> and phase <b>variations</b> <b>with</b> <b>offset</b> (APVO) curves on frequency and thin-bed properties (filling nature, aperture). We discuss and illustrate using synthetics the simplifying assumptions and careful corrections which are necessary to convert raw Common Mid-Point (CMP) reflected data into dispersive APVO curves. In particular, the propagation and radiation pattern corrections are made within the inversion process for all tested models of the search grid, which is based on the neighbourhood algorithm strategy. Within this work we notably show with various analytical data (different apertures and fillings) that the inversion process is efficient to provide not only the properties of the thin-bed, but also its depth and the properties of the surrounding homogeneous soil. This approach was successful thanks to the introduction of the dispersion characteristics, which restrict non-uniqueness problems potentially encountered when only AVO curves are used. Finally, all the methodology is successfully applied to a synthetic and to two real CMP GPR datasets, which were acquired along a vertical limestone cliff. It allowed extracting the characteristics of various subvertical fractures (filling, aperture) with satisfying resolution and confidence.
