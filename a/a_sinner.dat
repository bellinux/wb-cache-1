5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholicâ€”in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> and you are <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> all of your life. No matter how {{you try to get}} away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E
25|$|The {{central point}} of the Church doctrine, does not, however, lie {{in the areas of}} {{sexuality}} and creation but in the doctrine of justification. The human being is always <b>a</b> <b>sinner,</b> completely unable to reach God by his own merit. However, Christians are atoned by the grace of God, through the sacrifice of Christ, completely undeservedly. The Christian is simultaneously <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> and a righteous person. At the end of time, Christ will return and subject all to his judgment. Then everlasting perdition can only be avoided by Christ's mercy.|$|E

25|$|Wajib As-salat are compulsory, {{non-performance}} {{of which}} renders one <b>a</b> <b>sinner.</b> However, {{the evidence of}} the obligation is open to interpretation, with some of the madhab saying it is obligatory while others saying it is optional. To deny that a fard salah is obligatory is an act of disbelief while denying the obligation of a wajib salat is not disbelief. There are some who believe that as the 5 prayers are obligatory, it automatically renders all other prayers optional.|$|E
25|$|A {{large part}} of Ghalib's poetry focuses on the praise and veneration of Prophet Muhammad, which shows that Ghalib was a devout Muslim. Ghalib wrote his Abr-i gauharbar (The Jewel-carrying Cloud) in honor of Prophet Muhammad. Ghalib also wrote a qasida of 101 verses in {{dedication}} to the Prophet. Ghalib described himself as <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> who should be silent before the Prophet as he was not worthy of addressing the Prophet, who was praised by God.|$|E

60|$|The tempted, {{wherever}} he dwells, always thinks himself the biggest sinner, one most unworthy of eternal life.

I say this is his maul, his club, 34 his masterpiece; he doth with this as some do with their most enchanting songs, sings them everywhere. I believe there are but few saints in the world that have not had this temptation sounding in their ears. But were they but aware, Satan by all this does but drive them to the gap out at which they should go, and so escape his roaring. Saith he, thou art <b>a</b> great <b>sinner,</b> <b>a</b> horrible <b>sinner,</b> <b>a</b> profane-hearted wretch, one that cannot be matched for a vile one in the country. And all this while Christ says to his ministers, offer mercy, in the first place, to the biggest sinners. So that this temptation drives thee directly into the arms of Jesus Christ.|$|R

25|$|So the {{function}} of satisfaction for Aquinas is not to placate a wrathful God or {{in some other way}} remove the constraints which compel God to damn sinners. Instead, {{the function}} of satisfaction is to restore <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> to a state of harmony with God by repairing or restoring in the sinner what sin has damaged. This is Aquinas' major difference with Anselm. Rather than seeing the debt as one of honor, he sees the debt as a moral injustice to be righted.|$|E
25|$|Protestants {{perceived}} Roman Catholic salvation to {{be dependent}} upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation is a gift of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> is not accepted by God {{on account of the}} change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, for no one deserves salvation.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, there was a growing {{tendency}} to make explicit distinction between the condemned and the reader. The condemned was increasingly relegated to his social sphere; he was not seen as <b>a</b> <b>sinner,</b> someone to whom the audience could relate to, but as someone who came from an intellectually and morally inferior class. By the 1760s it was common for the Ordinary to put emphasis on grammatical and orthographic errors of the condemned and to apologise for having as subjects such mean individuals. The Ordinary frequently made claims that the condemned were creatures deserving of pity, suggesting that common criminals lacked the moral and intellectual faculties of the readers and so emphasising the distance between the reader and the condemned.|$|E

25|$|Alice courageously {{faces the}} shame of bearing and rearing their illegitimate {{daughter}} Anna alone. This ordeal is the test of the titleâ€”of herself, her family, and her community. Her story is paralleled in a subplot involving Sallie, <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> of a lower sort. Over the years Alice is supported by some, notably the senator, but vilified {{by most of the}} small-minded townsfolk, including her own mother. Her sister Gertrude, engaged to the priggish clergyman John Prescott, also suffers, her intended suddenly developing cold feet at the news of Alice's indiscretion. Perhaps the height of Alice's suffering is reached when Harriet, having lost her own child, importunes her to let her have Anna instead; persuaded {{it would be in the}} best interest of her daughter, Alice finally complies.|$|E
25|$|Christians in {{the early}} {{communities}} of the Church obtained forgiveness for those sins by practising prayer, good deeds, fasting and alms-giving. This early way of penitential discipline received in modern times the name of public penance, mistakenly confused with public announcement of the excommunication because of a public and grave sin. Sometimes sinners did publicly speak about their sins, but testimonies of the early Church show that in most cases offences were known to the priest alone. When a penitent did publicly confess his/her sins, decision to do it was always by the private initiative of the person, a free act of Christian faith for spiritual motives. The public character of early penance should be understood as prayerful participation and support given by the community to <b>a</b> <b>sinner,</b> and not as public humiliation.|$|E
25|$|Still, {{with all}} these seeming leanings to ascetic conduct, these rabbis did not {{encourage}} individual fasting. The community in distress did indeed proclaim a public fast, {{and it was the}} duty of the loyal member to participate. For he who would not share in the distress would have no part in the consolation of the people (Ta'an. 11a). The habitual faster was called <b>a</b> <b>sinner</b> (ib.). This judgment was enforced by an appeal to the Biblical text in connection with the Nazir's (Nazarite's) expiatory sacrifice (Num. vi. 11). Rabbi Zeira would not permit his disciples to indulge in extraordinary practices of self-restraint, if they presumed thereby to reflect on the piety of others saner than they. The title applied to such an adept at saintly practices is characteristically deprecatory for his attitude of mind: his conduct is declared to smack of conceit, if not of hypocrisy (Yer. Ber. ii. 5d).|$|E
6000|$|... 5. A fifth {{reason why}} God doth deal thus with sinners it is, because He would bring Christ {{and the soul}} {{together}} in a right way. Christ and sinners would never {{come together in a}} beloved posture, they would not so suitably suit each other, if they were not brought together this way, the sinner being killed. O, when the sinner is killed, and indeed struck dead to everything below a naked Jesus, how suitably then doth the soul and Christ suit one with another. Then here is <b>a</b> naked <b>sinner</b> for <b>a</b> righteousness Jesus, <b>a</b> poor <b>sinner</b> to <b>a</b> rich Jesus, <b>a</b> weak <b>sinner</b> to <b>a</b> strong Jesus, <b>a</b> blind <b>sinner</b> to <b>a</b> seeing Jesus, <b>an</b> ignorant, careless <b>sinner</b> to <b>a</b> wise and careful Jesus. O, how wise is God in dealing thus with the sinner! He strips him of his own knowledge, that He may fill him with Christ's; He killeth him for taking pleasure in sin, that he may take pleasure in Jesus Christ, etc.|$|R
