25|$|The <b>additional</b> <b>obligations</b> {{imposed by}} European law on {{national}} border authorities {{when it comes}} to processing travellers who are third-country nationals (e.g. the obligation to stamp their travel documents) should not prevent the development of automated border control systems which are made available to such travellers. As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated border gates in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, South Korean and United States biometric passports, {{as well as by the}} Portuguese Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated border gates in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch Royal Marechaussee at the Privium iris recognition automated border gates at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are Global Entry members, and all nationals who are holders of diplomatic passports), as well as by the German Federal Police at the ABG Plus iris recognition automated border gates at Frankfurt Airport (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are Global Entry members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped. At the Port of Helsinki, the Finnish Border Guard has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include Russian citizens (who, as Annex I nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.|$|E

5000|$|The {{policing}} {{of transnational}} and international crimes {{is a challenge}} to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention [...] "tantamount to abduction" [...] when carried out extraterritorially. These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co-operation, and placing <b>additional</b> <b>obligations</b> on the state such as aut dedere aut judicare ("extradite or prosecute") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other [...] "internationally protected persons".|$|E

Article 27(1) states that funds have to notify investee companies and shareholders when they acquire control, and article 28(4) {{requires them to}} disclose the acquisition to stakeholder groups including employees or representatives via the investee’s board. Article 29 places an obligation on the central Private Equity management company (rather than an investee companies) to give information on operational and financial developments in firm’s annual reports.

5000|$|Prior to the Hague Evidence Convention and the Hague Service Convention's of 1965 and 1970, most {{treaties}} would designate {{two separate}} agencies to, respectively, transmit and receive treaty petitions and applications with their corresponding agencies in foreign states. The Conventions of '65 and '70 consolidated these roles {{into a single}} Central Authority. Future Conventions, such as Hague Abduction Convention also demanded that the Central Authority in each country handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign Central Authorities. Not only did the Abduction Convention establish Central Authorities that facilitated two way communications, but it also gave a whole laundry list of <b>additional</b> <b>obligations</b> to these new authorities with language requiring Central Authorities to take [...] "any and all actions" [...] to secure {{the goals of the}} treaty and cooperate with other Central Authority's to do the same.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to statutory rights, expressly agreed terms and incorporated terms, the contractual {{hallmark of the}} employment relation is the series of standardised implied terms (or terms implied in law) that accompany it. In {{addition to}} individualised implied terms that the courts construe to reflect the reasonable expectations of the parties, the courts have long held that employees are owed <b>additional</b> <b>obligations,</b> such as a safe system of work and payment of wages even when the employer has no work to offer. Reflecting more recent priorities, employers have also been recognised to {{have a duty to}} inform their employees of their workplace pension rights, although they have stopped short of requiring employers to give advice on qualifying for workplace disability benefits. The key implied term, however, is the duty of good faith, or “mutual trust and confidence”. This is a flexible concept that is applied in a broad variety of circumstances leading to remedies in damages or an injunction, such as to require employers do not act in an authoritarian manner, call employees names behind their back, treat workers unequally when upgrading pay, run the company as a front for international crime, or exercise discretion to award a bonus capriciously. There is tension among judges {{about the extent to which}} the core implied term of mutual trust and confidence can be 'contracted out of', with the House of Lords having held that the parties are [...] "free" [...] to do so, while others approach the question as a matter of construction of the agreement which is within exclusive judicial competence to define.|$|E
