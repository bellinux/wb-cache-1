5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year, often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food.|$|E

5|$|Tornado {{occurrence}} {{is highly}} dependent {{on the time of}} day, because of solar heating. Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. Destructive tornadoes can occur <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.|$|E
5|$|A pure browser, {{the lesser}} kudu feeds on foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs, and herbs. Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, foliage from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year. The lesser kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year. The lesser kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E

5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year.|$|E
5|$|Fishing, {{including}} ice fishing, is {{a common}} pastime on Lake Chillisquaque. Fishing and boating are permitted on the lake <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day, although boats fuelled by gasoline are forbidden. Boating of any kind is also forbidden annually between March 15 and April 30 and is also forbidden in Goose Cove year-round. The only area for boating access on the lake is {{on the eastern side}} of the lake, at the Heron Cove Boat Access Area. The paddling and running stages of the Chilli Challenge triathlon are on Lake Chillisquaque and the Chillisuagi Trail, respectively.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E

5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year. In temperate regions, breeding {{is mostly}} seasonal, {{usually in the}} spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
5|$|The kōata, {{the growing}} {{tip of the}} plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, {{it was called the}} kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small {{artichoke}} heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.|$|E

5|$|The {{small round}} yellow fruit ripen and turn red <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year, {{although}} they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a syconium, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Ficusobliqua is pollinated by {{two species of}} fig wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P.xanthocephalus. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from Queensland, through New South Wales in rainforest, savanna woodland, sclerophyll forest and gallery forest. It {{is used as a}} shade tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|Weather systems {{affecting}} Newfoundland usually {{originate from}} the west, over mainland Canada, {{or from the}} southwest, from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Cyclonic storms consist of an area of low atmospheric pressure characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Such storms passing to the south of the island bring strong northeasterly winds sweeping in off the open North Atlantic Ocean. These storms are sometimes referred to as Nor'easters and are responsible for the worst of Newfoundland's weather. High winds sweeping over a large surface of ocean can build up very large waves. The frequency and severity of storms is greatest between November and March, although they may occur <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the year.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls {{living in}} {{tropical}} regions can breed <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year, but some seasonality in nesting is still evident. Where there are distinct {{wet and dry}} seasons, egg-laying usually takes place during the dry season, with increased rodent prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off. In arid regions, such as parts of Australia, breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods, triggered by temporary increases in the populations of small mammals. In temperate climates, nesting seasons become more distinct {{and there are some}} seasons of the year when no egg-laying takes place. In Europe and North America, most nesting takes place between March and June when temperatures are increasing. The actual dates of egg-laying vary by year and by location, being correlated with the amount of prey-rich foraging habitat around the nest site and often with the phase of the rodent abundance cycle. An increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate the local barn owls to begin nesting; thus, even in the cooler parts of its range, two broods are often raised in a good year.|$|E
