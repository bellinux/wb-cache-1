In order to provide meaningful quantities of electrical power to the grid, the next phase {{in the development of the}} technology will be the installation and operation of farms or arrays composed of multiple devices. As most tidal current sites are bi-directional and with bathymetry constraints, array layouts will necessarily take the form of highly optimized geometric configurations with reduced lateral inter-device spacing. This work discusses the concept of array layouts and proposes an appropriate and clear classification that can aid developers in understanding how arrays operate. This classification is supported by experimental studies conducted using several arrangements of multiple <b>actuator</b> <b>disks</b> to simulate early generation marine current energy converter arrays.

TFANS uses this information, along with scattering coefficients for inlet and exit elements, and provides complete noise solutions for turbofan engines. SOURCE 3 D is composed of a collection of FORTRAN programs that have been obtained by extending the approach of the earlier V 072 Rotor Wake/Stator Interaction Code.

The wind imparts a torque on the wind turbine, thrust is a necessary by-product of torque. Newtonian physics dictates that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the wind imparts a torque on the blades then the blades must be imparting a torque on the wind. This torque would then cause the flow to rotate. Thus the flow in the wake has two components, axial and tangential. This tangential flow {{is referred to as}} wake rotation.|$|E

In blade element momentum theory, angular momentum is included in the model, meaning that the wake (the air after interaction with the rotor) has angular momentum. That is, the air begins to rotate about the z-axis immediately upon interaction with the rotor (see diagram below). Angular momentum must be taken into account since the rotor, which is the device that extracts the energy from the wind, is rotating as a result of the interaction with the wind.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of flow past a partial cross-stream array of (idealized) tidal turbines are investigated both analytically and computationally {{to understand the}} mechanisms that determine the limiting performance of partial tidal fences. A two-scale analytical partial tidal fence model reported earlier is further extended by better accounting for the effect of array-scale flow expansion on device-scale dynamics, so that the new model is applicable to short fences (consisting of {{a small number of}} devices) as well as to long fences. The new model explains theoretically general trends of the limiting performance of partial tidal fences. The new model is then compared to three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computations of flow past an array of various numbers (up to 40) of <b>actuator</b> <b>disks.</b> On the whole, the analytical model agrees well with the RANS computations, suggesting that the two-scale dynamics described in the analytical model predominantly determines the fence performance in the RANS computations as well. The comparison also suggests that the limiting performance of short partial fences depends on how much of device far-wake mixing takes place within the array near-wake region. This factor, however, depends on the structures of the wake and therefore on the type/design of devices to be arrayed. © 2013 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{downstream}} turbine on {{the production of a}} turbine located upstream of the latter is studied in this work. This is done through the use of two CFD simulation codes, namely OpenFOAM and EllipSys 3 D, which solve the Navier-Stokes equations in their incompressible form using a finite volume approach.

The wind turbine rotors are modelled as <b>actuator</b> <b>disks</b> whose loading is determined through the use of tabulated airfoil data by applying the blade-element method. A generator torque controller is used in both simulation methods to ensure that the simulated turbines adapt, in terms of rotational velocity, to the inflow conditions they are submited to.

40|$|The {{actuator}} line method {{made it possible}} to describe the near wake of a wind turbine more accurately than with the <b>actuator</b> <b>disk</b> method. Whereas the {{actuator line}} generates the helicoidal vortex system shed from the tip blades, the <b>actuator</b> <b>disk</b> method sheds a vortex sheet {{from the edge of the}} rotor plane. But with the actuator line come also temporal and spatial constraints, such as the need for a much smaller time step than with <b>actuator</b> <b>disk.</b> While the latter one only has to obey the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, the former one is also restricted by the grid resolution and the rotor tip-speed.

40|$|Marine current energy {{conversion}} technology is presently at the prototype stage where single devices are deployed, or planned for installation, at isolated testing sites. The flow conditions for marine devices are distinctly different than for similar {{technologies such as}} the wind energy industry. The constrained nature of the operating fluid in the vertical plane is likely to introduce some interesting flow effects for marine current energy converters (MCECs). Experimental work was conducted at two indoor facilities. The first was the Chilworth hydraulics laboratory at the University of Southampton, UK. The working section of this flume is 21 m in length, 1. 35 m width and maximum depth 0. 4 m for steady operation. The Chilworth flume was used for studies where the downstream flow field was expected {{to interact with the}} bed and water surface. The second facility was the IFREMER circulating channel at Boulogne sur Mer, France. The channel has a working section 18 m in length, 4 m wide and 2 m deep. Disks were positioned at much greater depths than could be attained at the Chilworth flume thus eliminating or minimising any interaction with the bed or water surface. In order to visualise the flow field around the mesh disk rotor simulators a large number of point measurements were taken. A Nortek Vectrino ADV device was used for high frequency velocity sampling. For higher channel Froude numbers (shallow, faster moving flows) the wake created downstream of the <b>actuator</b> <b>disks</b> is deflected downwards towards the bed.

In an attempt to increase power generation by enhancing the mean kinetic energy (MKE) entrainment to the wind turbines, hypothetical synthetic forcing {{is applied to the}} flow at the turbine rotor locations. The synthetic forcing is not meant to represent any existing devices or control schemes, but rather acts as a proof of concept to inform future designs. The turbines are modeled using traditional <b>actuator</b> <b>disks,</b> and the unconventional synthetic forcing is applied in the vertical direction with the magnitude and direction dependent on the instantaneous velocity fluctuation at the rotor disk; in one set of LES meant to enhance the vertical entrainment of MKE, a downward force is prescribed in conjunction with a positive axial velocity fluctuation, whereas a negative axial velocity fluctuation results in an upward force. The magnitude of the forcing is proportional to the instantaneous thrust force with prefactors ranging from 0. 1 to 1. The synthetic vertical forcing is found to {{have a significant effect on}} the power generated by the wind farm. Consistent with previous findings, the MKE flux to the level of the turbines is found to vary along with the total power produced by the wind turbine array. The reverse strategy of downward forcing of slow axial velocity flow is found to have almost no effect on the power output or entrainment. Several of the scenarios tested, e. g., where the vertical force is of similar magnitude to the horizontal thrust, would be very difficult to implement in practice, but the simulations serve the purpose of identifying trends and bounds on possible power increases from flow modifications through action at the turbine rotor...|$|R

It does not contribute to the greenhouse gases and {{is also one of the}} least expensive forms of renewable energy. Due to this, number of wind turbines are increasing annually. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the physics behind a wind turbine wake and how to optimize its power production. One of the most common tools used in designing a wind turbine is Blade Element Momentum theory (BEM), which is based on the classic momentum theory (or <b>Actuator</b> <b>disk</b> theory). In momentum theory, flow is assumed to be steady, stationary, in-compressible and in-viscid. But in reality, wind turbines operate in very unsteady conditions such as gust, pitching, yawing, turbulence, etc. So, it is important to study an <b>actuator</b> <b>disk</b> wake under unsteady loading. In this project, cyclic unsteady loading on an <b>actuator</b> <b>disk</b> is studied. The main research objective is to study the behaviour of wake behind an <b>actuator</b> <b>disk</b> under cyclic unsteady loading. As learnt during the literature review, only a small number of studies have been dedicated to this research topic. In order to fulfil the objective, an experimental approach is taken.

40|$|The {{influence}} of atmospheric turbulence {{on the development}} of the flow along a long row of wind turbines is studied, in search for an asymptotic wake deficit state. Calculations are performed using EllipSys 3 D, a CFD code that solves the Navier-Stokes equations in their incompressible form using a finite volume approach. In this code, the Large Eddy Simulation technique is used for modelling turbulence, and the wind turbine rotors are represented as <b>actuator</b> <b>disks</b> whose loading is determined through the use of tabulated airfoil data by applying the blade-element method. Ten turbines are located along a row and separated from each other by seven rotor diameters, which is representative of the distance used in today’s offshore wind farms. Turbulence is pregenerated with the Mann model, with imposed turbulent levels of 4. 5 and 8. 9 %. The turbines are in this study isolated from their environment, as no effect from the ground is modeled. This makes the proposed study of the asymptotic wake state behavior easier. Analysis of the characteristics of the flow as a function of the position along the row of turbines is performed in terms of turbulence intensity, mean velocity, and power spectra of the velocity fluctuations. Power production along the row of turbines is also used as an indicator. Calculations are performed below rated power, where a generator torque controller implemented in EllipSys 3 D renders it possible for the turbines to adapt to the inlet conditions in which they operate. The results obtained for the turbulence intensity, power and mean velocity as a function of downstream distance show that an asymptotic wake state seems close to be reached near the end of the 10 turbine row. They also show a certain dependency on the imposed level of turbulence. Uncertainties obtained in the power spectra of the velocity fluctuations suggest that further investigation is necessary.

40|$|Abstract—A new {{decoupled}} track-seeking controller for a dualstage {{servo system}} of a magnetic disk drive has been developed. The controller {{is applied to}} the dual-stage system with a push-pull piezoelectric (PZT) micro-actuator and enables high-speed onetrack seeking and short-span track seeking. A one-track seeking controller was designed in three steps: 1) a voice coil motor (VCM) feedforward controller was designed to prevent overshoot in response of VCM actuator; 2) a feedforward loop from the VCM reference signal to the PZT actuator was designed in order to decouple the dual-stage actuator system; 3) a feedforward controller for the PZT actuator was designed such that an output PES (position error signal) only follows a PES reference signal. In the design of the short-span seeking controller, the PZT actuator’s stroke limit was considered. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed dual-stage track-seeking controller performs better than the conventional single VCM servo.

40|$|Flow {{augmentation}} {{consists in}} modifying mass flow across the actuation plane of a rotor to enhance energy extraction or propulsive efficiency. The talk sketches {{the distinction between}} passive and active rotor augmentation strategies. Power coefficient trends are compared analytically while numerical results illustrate differences in flow topology. Rotors are stylized as <b>actuator</b> <b>disks</b> that exert homogeneous normal forces on the steady flow of inviscid fluids to highlight the distinctive features of each augmentation principle. Passive augmentation principles have been well documented because they guide the design of ducted, shrouded and diffuser-augmented wind turbines 1 - 6. These axisymmetric bodies decrease average static pressures on the rotor plane to increase mass flux and power coefficient. Rotor-body interactions are dominated by conservative forces 5, 7 : the bodies don’t exchange energy with the fluid but act as augmenting devices and affect global energy balance by changing rotor state. Virtual work arguments show that bodies exert streamwise forces 4, 6 that can be related with the power coefficient through the law of de Vries 1, 6. Active flow augmentation is a rather recent theoretical concept 8. Its simplest energy extraction embodiment consists of an upstream actuator that accelerates flow onto a downstream actuator. This augmentation strategy is coined as active because the upstream actuator injects (spends) energy into the flow for the downstream actuator to extract (produce) energy from a greater mass flux than if it were alone. The interaction mechanism depends on the action of non-conservative forces and actuators interact exclusively through changes in total flow enthalpy when they are sufficiently far apart. No pressure interactions occur in this asymptotic case and a closed solution exists together with an analytical power coefficient law. Parallels can be drawn with wake ingestion propeller setups 9 but no practical energy extraction realizations have been attempted yet. Passive and active flow augmentation concepts are different but we hope that parallels between them shed further light on the physics of energy extraction from ideal fluid flows. The communication concludes with a few reflections meant to trigger an open discussion about the implications and applicability of the discussed theories. Wind Energ...|$|R
