5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits <b>and</b> <b>sinks.</b> From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|That night, {{after the}} {{military}} evacuates Yellowstone, Jackson watches Charlie's video of Charles Hapgood's theory that polar shifts, Earth crust displacement and the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar predict a 2012 phenomenon. According to Charlie, anyone {{who attempted to}} inform the public was killed, including Jackson's NASA contact. After Jackson and his children return home, he delivers Yuri's sons Alec and Oleg to Santa Monica Airport. Realizing that Charlie was right, Jackson rents a plane and rescues his family as the Earth-crust displacement begins, causing a 10.9 magnitude earthquake, and they escape from LA by air as the city is destroyed <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> into the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks the other kids, hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them to capsize and crash into {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a {{boat and}} head out onto the lake; their boat is quickly struck by {{something}} <b>and</b> <b>sinks.</b> The two find a large rock to climb up on and talk for a while about Mulder's quest to catch Big Blue, and the book Moby-Dick. When Dr. Farraday walks by the two realize they were close to shore all along. Mulder thinks the drop in the frog supply has caused Big Blue to move closer to shore and seek alternative food sources. Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be an alligator. Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being an alligator and not Big Blue. As the agents leave, Big Blue swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E

Suddenly, the ferry explodes <b>and</b> <b>sinks,</b> killing 543 passengers and crew members. Special Agent Douglas Carlin (Denzel Washington) from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is sent to investigate and discovers evidence of a bomb planted by a domestic terrorist. Arriving at the scene he meets with local investigators and FBI Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), and informs them of his findings. He learns about and is invited to examine a partially burned body pulled from the river, identified as Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), which was reported to the authorities minutes before the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Felix {{is finally}} able to explain to Isaac why Alchemy's release is a {{necessary}} thing for everyone, and that Saturos and Menardi were aiming for this goal merely {{for the sake of}} the survival of their home colony of Prox to the far north, located near the Mars Lighthouse. He also reveals that his parents and Isaac's father are alive and currently being held hostage in Prox in order to coerce Felix's initial cooperation. Isaac and his company agree to aid Felix, and the group sets out north to activate the Mars Lighthouse. The group discovers that Karst and Agatio have been transformed into mindless dragons and are forced to defeat them - they return the Mars Star before succumbing to their wounds. When they reach the tower's top, the Wise One, the entity responsible for originally tasking Isaac to prevent the breaking of Alchemy's seal, confronts them. He warns them that mankind could very well destroy Weyard themselves if they had possession of such a power, and when Isaac insists on breaking the seal regardless the Wise One summons a giant, three-headed dragon for the party to battle in the final struggle. After slaying the dragon, the party of Adepts finish their objective and activate Mars Lighthouse; with all four towers across Weyard lit, the process that heralds the return of the force of Alchemy to Weyard ensues at the mountain sanctum Mt. Aleph. Alex is there, however; he took advantage of everyone else's quests so that he would gain immense power for himself from the light of the Golden Sun, a manifestation of Alchemy itself. However, he discovers that the Wise One had taken steps to prevent this and is left to die as the mountain collapses <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> into the ground with him still on it.|$|E

25|$|Aside from purely human-produced {{synthetic}} halocarbons, most {{greenhouse gases}} have {{both natural and}} human-caused sources. During the pre-industrial Holocene, concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant, because the large natural sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> roughly balance. In the industrial era, human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, mainly through the {{burning of fossil fuels}} and clearing of forests.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{stormwater}} enters properties: backup through sewer pipes, toilets <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> into buildings; seepage through building walls and floors; the accumulation of water on property and in public rights-of-way; and the overflow of water from water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Where properties are built with basements, urban flooding is {{the primary cause of}} basement flooding.|$|E
25|$|Littoral {{cells are}} usually {{an area where}} changes in the volume of {{sediment}} directly affects changes in the coastline, and ideally they are defined to minimise longshore sediment exchange with other littoral cells, for example, a pocket beach surrounded by rocky headlands (which are presumed to exclude sediments). Sub-cells are usually defined to better measure the sediment budget of a coast with varying rates of accretion and erosion. The landward boundary of a littoral cell is usually {{the foot of a}} dune or cliff, however, the seaward boundary is difficult to define as mechanisms of sediment transport here are poorly understood. There are three kinds of boundaries between littoral cells: longshore, landward, and seaward; across which sediment may enter the littoral cell or leave it by various processes. It is important to identify which processes operate on a particular littoral cell and also important to identify sediment sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks,</b> as by measuring the sediment gained or lost by these sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks,</b> a sediment budget can be determined.|$|E

25|$|Prisoners {{that fall}} into the medium {{security}} group may sleep in cells, but share them two and two, and use bunk beds with lockers to store their possessions. The cell may have showers, toilets <b>and</b> <b>sinks,</b> but it's not a strictly enforced rule. Cells are locked at night {{with one or more}} correctional officers supervising. There is less supervision over the internal movements of prisoners. The perimeter is generally double fenced and regularly patrolled.|$|E
25|$|This {{sediment}} then {{enters the}} coastal system and is transported by longshore drift. A {{good example of}} the sediment budget and longshore drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store sand that has been transported by long shore transport. As well as storing sand these systems may also transfer or by pass sand into other beach systems, therefore inlet ebb-tidal shoal systems provide a good sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> for the sediment budget.|$|E
25|$|Urban {{flooding}} is the inundation of land {{or property}} in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas, caused by rainfall overwhelming {{the capacity of}} drainage systems, such as storm sewers. Although sometimes triggered by events such as flash flooding or snowmelt, urban flooding is a condition, characterized by its repetitive and systemic impacts on communities, that can happen {{regardless of whether or}} not affected communities are located within designated floodplains or near any body of water. Aside from potential overflow of rivers and lakes, snowmelt, stormwater or water released from damaged water mains may accumulate on property and in public rights-of-way, seep through building walls and floors, or backup into buildings through sewer pipes, toilets <b>and</b> <b>sinks.</b>|$|E
