5|$|In August 1960, Clements {{met with}} Combs <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> wanted to resign {{to work for}} the vice-presidential {{campaign}} of Lyndon Johnson. Combs called a press conference and announced that Clements' resignation would be effective September 1 and that he would be replaced by Henry Ward. The resignation {{was the end of the}} Clements faction of the state Democratic party. His split with Combs was so severe that he allied with his longtime foe, Happy Chandler, against the new Combs faction of the party. In the 1962 senatorial race, Clements opposed Wilson Wyatt's challenge to Senator Thruston Morton. Morton won re-election, ending Wyatt's political career. Chandler again sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1963. Clements appeared on stage with Chandler at a rally where Chandler claimed that Combs had arranged the truck deal to discredit Clements. Chandler hoped to damage Combs' reputation and, by extension, that of his hand-picked successor Edward T. Breathitt. His strategy was unsuccessful; Breathitt carried the primary and went on to win the general election. Clements' waning influence was evidenced by the fact that Breathitt carried Union County by a vote of 2,528 to 1,913.|$|E
25|$|On 9 March Hitler phoned Rundstedt <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> {{was to be}} {{replaced}} by Albert Kesselring, to be transferred from Italy. That was the end of Gerd von Rundstedt's military career after 52 years.|$|E
25|$|Charles Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Henry Rogers went to Pratt in New York <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> {{would take}} {{personal}} responsibility for the entire debt. This so impressed Pratt that he immediately hired him for his own organization.|$|E

60|$|Bob Pretty {{fell into}} the trap at once. He was {{standing}} at 'is gate in the dark, next day, smoking a pipe, when Peter Gubbins passed, and Peter, arter stopping and asking 'im for a light, spoke about 'is luck in getting the hamper, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>he</b> didn't bear no malice for it.|$|R
60|$|Caleb {{then went}} to Raymond, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>he</b> could not make his fire burn.|$|R
25|$|While {{attending}} them Chagdud Tulku met {{an older}} lama from Western Tibet, Lama Ladakh Nono, {{who was known}} for doing mirror divinations. He subsequently did a mirror divination for Chagdud <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> {{should go to the}} West and benefit many people there by teaching the Dharma. He also predicted that a Western woman would come into his life and that this would be good.|$|E
25|$|Others {{were not}} so affable. In fact, some stars hedged: Richard Gere, a friend of Wessler's, said yes—but also {{said he would not}} be {{available}} for more than a year. So Wessler waited him out, convinced his sketch was good. Gere eventually called Wessler <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was free to shoot, on just a couple of conditions: They had to do it in four days, and they needed to relocate the shoot from Los Angeles to New York City.|$|E
25|$|One player {{told his}} {{teammates}} {{that there were}} certain things contained in the contracts that needed clarification. He was summoned back into Bvute's office and warned {{that it was a}} take-it-or-leave-it offer: this player was later revealed to be Anthony Ireland. Another said that when he told Bvute he wanted to consult with friends, Bvute {{picked up the phone and}} called Kenyon Ziehl, the head of selection, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> wanted the player replaced in the squad. Unsurprisingly, the player backed down and signed.|$|E

25|$|Bud Moore Engineering took {{a three-year}} hiatus until 1972, when David Pearson piloted the No. 15 Ford to a 26th-place finish at Riverside. LeeRoy Yarbrough, Dick Brooks, and Donnie Allison also drove that year. In 1973, Bobby Isaac climbed {{on board with}} Sta-Power Industries sponsoring. Isaac had six top-ten {{finishes}} until the Talladega 500, when he radioed in to Moore <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was quitting. When {{he got out of}} the car, Isaac announced he was retiring. Some reports surfaced saying Isaac quit because voices in his head had told him to. His replacement was an unpolished rookie named Darrell Waltrip, who had a top-ten at Darlington Raceway.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan had {{a meeting}} with Butler on 11 September and was careful to keep his options open (retire now, retire in the New Year, or fight the next election). He talked the matter over with his son Maurice and other senior ministers. Over lunch with Lord Swinton on 30 September he favoured {{stepping}} down, but only if Hailsham could be shoehorned in as his successor. He saw Butler on the morning of 7 October <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> planned to stay on lead the Conservatives into the next General Election, then was struck down by prostate problems on the night of 7–8 October, {{on the eve of the}} Conservative Party conference.|$|E
25|$|Ewbank got {{his first}} {{professional}} head coaching job in early 1954 for the NFL's Baltimore Colts, a franchise that had started play the previous year. While it was a step up for Ewbank, Brown encouraged him {{not to take the}} job <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> would not be successful. After Ewbank took the job, Brown accused him of passing information about the Browns' draft targets to the Colts. Brown had insisted that he stay with the Browns through the 1954 draft, and NFL commissioner Bert Bell agreed. During the draft, Ewbank allegedly sent the names of players Brown liked to the Colts through Baltimore sportswriter John Steadman, including end Raymond Berry, who went on to have a long and successful career.|$|E

"Yesterday," [...] said Gordon, chuckling {{over the}} remembrance, [...] "he {{came in with}} a big piece of paper he'd picked up on the entry floor in one hand and his hat in the other--and he stuffed his hat into the coal-scuttle and hung up the paper on a nail as grave as you please. Never knew the {{difference}} till Ned Slocum went <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>He's</b> always doing things like that." ...|$|R
25|$|In January 2006 at the Royal Rumble, The Undertaker {{returned}} during Kurt Angle's {{celebration of}} his World Heavyweight Championship defense against Mark Henry on a horse-drawn cart, signaling for a title shot. As {{part of their}} storyline feud, The Undertaker lost his match with Angle at No Way Out after a thirty-minute match. Undertaker cornered Angle after the match <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was not finished with him; however, during a rematch on SmackDown!, Henry attacked The Undertaker from behind, costing him the title. This led to The Undertaker challenging Henry to a casket match at WrestleMania 22 and Henry vowed to end Undertaker's WrestleMania winning streak. The Undertaker defeated Henry to become 14–0 at WrestleMania. During a rematch on the next episode of SmackDown!, The Great Khali made his debut and assaulted The Undertaker to transition into a new storyline.|$|E
25|$|On October 15, 1976, Carlo Gambino {{died of a}} heart attack. With Gambino gone, Bruno {{lost his}} most {{important}} ally in the underworld. Many of Bruno's subordinates felt that they were missing out on money because of Bruno's old-fashioned and content ways. His consigliere Antonio Caponigro approached Genovese family boss Frank Tieri in order to seek the Commission's permission to kill Bruno and take over the crime family. Tieri, sensing an opportunity to take Caponigro's north New Jersey rackets, lied to Caponigro <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> had the Commission's support. On March 21, 1980, Bruno was shot {{in the back of the}} head while in his car by a gunman working for Caponigro. That April, Caponigro visited New York City under the assumption that he was going to be confirmed as boss. Instead, he was tortured and murdered for killing a Commission member without permission. Caponigro's co-conspirators Frank Sindone and John Simone were also murdered in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Ben-Gal {{described}} {{the battle to}} Eitan <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> was not sure he could hold on. Eitan asked him to hold on for another half-hour. At this point, the remaining eleven tanks of the Barak Brigade arrived, and Eitan directed them to Ben-Gal. Eitan told Ben-Gal of Ben-Hanan's force. Kahalani called Captain Emi Palant, the senior officer behind the ramps, to use a signal flag to get the tank commanders' attention and direct them to the ramp, but waving the flag got no response. Palant fired his machine gun {{at the side of}} the nearest tank to get the commander to look out, and the message was passed. He ran from tank to tank and rapped on their turrets to get their attention before returning to his own tank and starting to move forward. No tank followed. Kahalani heard a sergeant from the 74th Battalion and ordered him to take his position and guard the wadi. The sergeant replied he did not have any shells left. Zamir, who was flanking his position to the south, reported a massive Syrian attack and asked for permission to move the remaining tanks to Zamir's company to a better position slightly to the south. Ben-Gal refused. Kahalani reported that he was unable to control the tanks, which kept drifting to the rear. Ben-Gal said he would try to get him more tanks. Kahalani ordered the sergeant to take his place, saying the Syrians would not try to attack if they saw his tank.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>He</b> bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

5000|$|After {{winning a}} {{lifetime}} achievement award, esteemed successful screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) has a rude awakening. Steven believes the award {{has no real}} meaning, but it does—it means his career is over. His studio has reneged that means they won't renew his contract <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he's</b> gone cold, saying he's [...] "lost his edge." [...] A junior exec (Mark Feuerstein) tells Steven his new script is dull and to be off the lot by 5 p.m.|$|R

They each came up with various ideas and created The Drew Carey Show.

Carey Show and see if anybody at home could figure it out!" ...|$|E
500|$|At Beauregard's request, {{his allies}} in the Confederate Congress petitioned Davis to restore his command in the West. Davis {{remained}} angry at Beauregard's absence <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> should have stayed at his post {{even if he had}} to be carried around in a litter. He wrote, [...] "If the whole world were to ask me to restore General Beauregard to the command which I have already given to General Bragg, I would refuse it." [...] Beauregard was ordered to Charleston and took command of coastal defenses in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, replacing Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton. The latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} many {{alternate}} versions of this event. One version, which was later portrayed in The Babe Ruth Story, claims that Ruth went to Sylvester's hospital bed and promised him in person that he would {{hit a home run}} for him. On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> would [...] "try to knock you another homer, maybe two today". Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from blood poisoning, a spinal infection, a sinus condition, or had a condition requiring a spinal fusion. Contemporary analyses dispute whether Sylvester was ever hospitalized, dying, or if Ruth's three home runs had actually saved the boy's life, as claimed by the newspapers.|$|E
