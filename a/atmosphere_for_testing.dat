40|$|Abstract. Activated carbon, zeolite and {{titanium}} dioxide are wildly used for removing the organic compounds in waste water. Although, these materials exhibit high performance (in powder form), reclaiming {{of these materials}} from the waste water treatment system is still difficult. The objective {{of this study is}} to fabricate hollow composite cylinder activated carbon-zeolite samples which were used as a porous substrate. Various ratios of activated carbon, zeolite NaA and ball clay were mixed with special binder to form dough before extruded to hollow cylindrical shape. The hollow cylindrical samples were cut into 2. 5 cm long and then were fired at 600 °C for 2 hours under 5 %CO 2 +N 2 atmosphere. The fired samples were dip-coated with TiO 2 -P 25 and fired at 600 °C for 1 hour under 5 %CO 2 +N 2 <b>atmosphere</b> <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> the photocatalytic degradation of lignin solutions under UV light. The results showed that the strength of fired samples increasing with the ratio of clay increased. The XRD patterns of samples with the presence of clay showed peaks of zeolite and quartz. The physical properties, microstructure and photodegradation will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of solderability testing of printed circuit boards. The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare different <b>atmospheres</b> <b>for</b> solderability <b>testing</b> with different finishes of printed circuit boards (PCB’s). The article contains method descriptions that were used <b>for</b> solderability <b>testing</b> of printed circuit boards. The method of wetting balance <b>test</b> was chosen <b>for</b> this experiment. The PCB can be made with several kinds of surface finishing. Copper is the most commonly used material in the manufacture of printed circuit boards. The negative copper property is its low chemical stability. When a contact is in an atmosphere that contains oxygen, the surface is covered with a layer of copper oxides. This layer deteriorates copper solderability. Another way how to prevent oxidation of copper soldering pads of printed circuit boards is an inert atmosphere. As an inert atmosphere does not contain oxygen and prevents oxidation of the material used on PCB’s. The increasingly frequent introduction of inert atmospheres into soldering processes encourages the introduction of a inert atmosphere also in solderability testing processes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} {{infrasound}} {{is experiencing a}} renaissance in recent years since it was chosen as a verification technique for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Currently, 60 infrasound arrays are being installed to monitor the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>for</b> nuclear <b>tests</b> {{as part of the}} International Monitoring System (IMS). The number of non-IMS arrays also increases worldwide. The experimental ARCES infrasound array (ARCI) is an example of such an initiative. The detectability of infrasound differs for each array and {{is a function of the}} array location and configuration, the state of the atmosphere, and the presence of natural and anthropogenic sources. In this study, a year of infrasound data is analyzed as recorded by ARCI. Contributions of the atmosphere and the sources are evaluated in both a low- (0. 1 - 1. 0  Hz) and high-frequency (1. 0 - 7. 0  Hz) pass-band. The enormous number of detections in the low-frequency band is explained in terms of the stratospheric wind and ocean wave activity and compared with the detection of microseism. Understanding the detectability in the low-frequency band is of utmost importance for successfully applying infrasound as a verification technique since small-sized nuclear test will show up in this frequency range...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{reliability}} and the expected lifetime of optical links {{are closely related}} to the chemical action of the water molecules on silica network. However, polymeric coating also contributes largely to the mechanical properties of the fiber. Dynamic fatigue measurements were performed on silica optical fibers, either bare or coated, using two-point bending bench. Water concentration in test atmosphere was 50 % relative humidity or very dry atmosphere. When water content is a few ppm, the dynamic fatigue curve, which expresses the breaking strength as a function of stress rate deviates from linearity at high stress rate. The same behaviour is observed in ambient <b>atmosphere</b> <b>for</b> very high <b>testing</b> speeds. The comparison between bare and coated fibers shows that the fatigue behaviour at high stressing rate is influenced by the polymer coating. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Iron-air {{rechargeable}} oxide batteries (ROB) comprising solid oxide cells (SOC) {{as energy}} converters and Fe/metal-oxide redox couples were characterized using planar SOC stacks. The charge and discharge of the battery {{correspond to the}} operations in the electrolysis and fuel cell modes, respectively, but with a stagnant atmosphere consisting of hydrogen and steam. A novel method was employed to establish the stagnant <b>atmosphere</b> <b>for</b> battery <b>testing</b> during normal SOC operation without complicated modification to the test bench and stack/battery concept. Manipulation of the gas compositions during battery operation was not necessary, but {{the influence of the}} leakage current from the testing system had to be considered. Batteries incorporating Fe 2 O 3 / 8 YSZ, Fe 2 O 3 /CaO and Fe 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 storage materials were characterized at 800 °C. A maximum charge capacity of 30. 4 Ah per layer (with an 80 cm 2 active cell area) with ∼ 0. 5 mol Fe was reached with a current of 12 A. The charge capacity lost 11 % after ∼ 130 ROB cycles due to the increased agglomeration of active materials and formation of a dense oxide layer on the surface. The round trip efficiencies of the tested batteries were ≤ 84 % due to the large internal resistance. With state-of-the-art cells, the round trip efficiency can be further improved...|$|R
40|$|On April 15, 1920, {{the under}} Secretary of State for Aeronautics and Aerial Transport decided to adopt as Standard <b>Atmosphere</b> <b>for</b> {{official}} airplane <b>tests</b> in France, the atmosphere {{defined by the}} following law, known as the Law of the S.

For altitude 0 the pressure is 760 mm of mercury. In the magazine "L'Aeronautique" Mr. A. Toussaint has already written at length on the first studies {{which led to the}} elaboration of this law.

This provided for special notice to the chief inspector from all occupiers of cotton cloth factories (i.e. any room, shed, or workshop or part thereof in which weaving of cotton cloth is carried on) who intend to produce humidity by artificial means; regulated both temperature of workrooms and amount of moisture in the <b>atmosphere,</b> and provided <b>for</b> <b>tests</b> and records of the same; and fixed a standard minimum volume of fresh air (...) to be admitted in every hour for every person employed in the factory. Power was retained for the secretary of state to modify by order the standard for the maximum limit of humidity of the atmosphere at any given temperature. A short act in 1870 extended this power to other measures for the protection of health.|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori is known, worldwide, as the causative {{agent of}} gastric diseases. However, its {{transmission}} route {{has not been}} completely understood. To evaluate the survival of H. pylori (a clinical and a reference strain) artificially inoculated on lettuce and carrot samples, portions of 25 g were inoculated with approximately 10 (6) CFU/g of H. pylori and packed under normal and/or modified atmosphere (3 % oxygen, 10 % carbon dioxide, and 87 % nitrogen). The inoculated food samples were stored at 8 ºC, with daily enumeration of H. pylori populations on Columbia blood agar (CBA) and/ or Helicobacter pylori Special Peptone Agar (HPSPA). When CBA with antibiotics was used, the clinical isolate H. pylori HP 1 was detected for up to 72 h in sanitized lettuce and carrot. In sterilized carrot samples, H. pylori HP 1 remained viable for up to 96 h. The CBA without antibiotics allowed the recovery of H. pylori ATCC 43629, from carrot samples stored in both <b>atmospheres</b> <b>tested,</b> <b>for</b> up to 120 hours.

40|$|Blue supergiants of {{spectral}} types B and A are {{the visually}} brightest stars in spiral and irregular galaxies, with their most luminous members (at M_V=- 10) outshining entire dwarf galaxies. This characteristic {{allows us to}} use them as probes to study the Local Universe in great detail. In principle, already the existing large telescopes and instrumentation facilitate quantitative spectroscopy of these objects {{as far as the}} Virgo and Fornax clusters of galaxies. Beyond their challenging stellar <b>atmospheres</b> and opportunities <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> sophisticated non-LTE physics they offer numerous applications to modern astrophysics. Quantitative spectroscopy of supergiants can contribute to improve our understanding of massive star evolution. Galactic abundance gradients and abundance patterns, as can be obtained from studies of large ensembles of supergiants in our own and other galaxies, will foster the understanding of galactochemical evolution. Finally, they are promising independent indicators for calibrating the extragalactic distance scale, by application of the wind momentum-luminosity and the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationships. In view of this large potential, the objective of this thesis is to improve the status of quantitative spectroscopy of BA-type supergiants and to provide first applications on a sample of Galactic and extragalactic targets, within the Local Group and beyond.

40|$|Devolatilization of {{a single}} fuel {{particle}} and the related flame combustion were studied in a two-dimensional fluidized bed with a quartz wall, allowing visual observation of the conversion process. The aim was to evaluate the devolatilization behavior (ignition, flame temperature, flame life-time, devolatilization time) of different fuels (4 ranks of coal from lignite to anthracite and wood) when replacing O 2 /N 2 by O 2 /CO 2 in O 2 volume concentrations from 0 % to 40 %, at a fixed bed temperature of 1088 K using 6 mm spherical fuel particles. The volatiles’ flame was recorded by a color video camera to analyze ignition and extinction. The flame temperature was estimated by two-color pyrometry. Two thermocouples were inserted in the fuel particle to measure the temperature at the center and near the surface. Homogeneous and heterogeneous ignition modes, times of devolatilization, and flame duration (flame-life) under different gas atmospheres were analyzed. Results indicate that the mode of ignition of bituminous coal, lignite coal and wood changes when N 2 is replaced by CO 2. The ignition-delay time is much longer, and the flame temperature is lower in the O 2 /CO 2 atmosphere than in an O 2 /N 2 <b>atmosphere</b> <b>for</b> all the <b>tested</b> fuels. The devolatilization time of the anthracite particle is almost unaffected by the surrounding <b>atmosphere,</b> while <b>for</b> the other fuels this time is generally longer in O 2 /CO 2 than in O 2 /N 2 at the same O 2 concentration. The presence of a flame during the volatiles combustion did not accelerate the particle heating, not even at the highest O 2 concentration tested (40 vol%), however, after the extinction of the flame, the rate of particle heating is significantly affected by the oxygen concentration...|$|R
