40|$|A {{screening}} procedure {{for the detection}} of topically applied phototoxic agents is presented. Following application to the guinea pig ear, the significance of changes in ear thickness in irradiated and non-irradiated animals served as the determinant in establishing positive effects. Eight drugs reported to be phototoxic agents and hexachlorophene, which is suspected of being <b>a</b> <b>photoallergen,</b> were tested. Positive results were obtained with 8 -methoxypsoralen, chlorpromazine, prochlorperazine and demethyl-chlortetracycline...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{conducted}} a retrospective study (2003 - 07) evaluating {{the results of}} photopatch tests (PPTs) performed with an extended series {{with the objective of}} determining the main photoallergens in our region and whether they would be detected by a recently recommended baseline PPT series. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 83 patients (58 females/ 25 males, mean age 54. 8 years) were tested with <b>a</b> <b>photoallergen</b> series, and among these, 30 were also tested with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) series, irradiated at D 2 with 5 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A (UVA). RESULTS: Thirty-six of 83 patients (43. 3 %) had at least one positive reaction, with 21 (25. 3 %) reacting in the photoallergen series. The main relevant reactions were as follows: 10 to ultraviolet filters (benzophenone- 3 and benzophenone- 4, 3 patients each), 7 to promethazine, and 2 to chlorpromazine. Twenty of 30 patients tested (70 %) had a relevant positive PPT to an NSAID, 9 to piroxicam because of systemic photosensitivity, 8 to benzydamine from a topical gel or oral solution, and 2 to ketoprofen. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are discordant with most recently published studies because of the particularities of the population studied and to regional prescribing habits. Therefore, apart from the recommended baseline series of photoallergens, other substances must be tested according to regional peculiarities...|$|E
5|$|Another {{classification}} distinguishes two types. The {{first is}} a hypersensitivity caused by <b>a</b> reaction to <b>photoallergens</b> located only in people with SU; while the second is caused by photoallergens {{that can be found}} in both people with SU and people without it.|$|R
40|$|Background: Octocrylene is <b>a</b> new {{emerging}} <b>photoallergen.</b> We {{report and}} discuss 50 cases of photoallergic contact dermatitis from octocrylene use and/or positive photopatch test reactions to this UV filter and {{draw attention to}} the unexpected association in adults with a history of photoallergic contact dermatitis from ketoprofen. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of <b>a</b> new <b>photoallergen.</b>|$|R
40|$|The use of sunscreens is the ‘gold standard’ for {{protecting}} the skin from ultraviolet light. Octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) {{is one of the}} most widely used UVB filter but it can act as <b>a</b> sensitizer or <b>photoallergen.</b> When exposed to sunlight, OMC can change from the primary trans-form to cisform and the isomerization, not reversible, conducts to a reduction of the UVB filtering efficiency because the trans-form has a higher extinction coefficient. Photostability is the most important characteristic of effective sunscreens and it can be influenced by formulation ingredients and by applying technological strategies. In this work, photostability experiments, performed on emulsion– gels containing different percentages of OMC free or loaded in poly(d,l-lactide) nanoparticles, were carried out. The presence of a polymeric envelop may act to protect the active ingredient. In this study, the influence of poly(d,l-lactide) matrices on the photochemical stability of the sunscreen agent was investigated. As highlighted in this study, free OMC in different formulations has different photoisomerization degree. Moreover, a dissimilar behaviour was observed by studying different sunscreen concentrations in the same cosmetic formulation. Photostability results show a significant reduction in photoisomerization degree for formulations containing sunscreen loaded in nanoparticles, highlighting that the encapsulation is a suitable strategy to improve OMC photostability. Moreover, sun protection factor (SPF) results show that the UVB filter protective power is also maintained after encapsulation...|$|R
