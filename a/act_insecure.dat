40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{research}} how to implement a graphical interface for presenting information security information to management. The major conclusion of the study is that management use this kind of information mainly for financial and strategic matters. Hence the information must be presented in a way that enhances this use of the information. The study also concludes that people <b>act</b> <b>insecure</b> mainly due to: a) Insufficient knowledge of how/why to act secure. b) The users do not want to act secure due to social and organisational factors. To fight the first factor, the management need a tool that helps them to see where to spend their resources. To fight the second factor, the organisation needs to be well educated and the company culture should allow the users to act secure. Three heuristics for the design of information security solutions for management and a design solution for the interface are also presented in the study. The three heuristics are: 1. Provide overview information very early in the program. The ordinary manager does not have the time or the knowledge to make this overview by himself/herself. 2. Do not overwhelm the user. The ordinary management man/woman is not interested in the details of the information security and/or do not have time to read this sort of information. If he or she wants to access the details, he or she is likely to find them (if they are placed in a logical place). 3. Provide information {{in a way that is}} common to the manager. Use wordings that the user understands. Provide contextual help for expressions that must be presented in a technical way...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Security {{issues in}} {{software}} industries {{become more and}} more challenging due to malicious attacks and as a result, it leads to exploration of various security holes in software system. In order to se-cure the information assets associated with any software system, organizations plan to design the system based on a number of security patterns, useful to build and test new security mechanisms. These patterns are nothing but certain design guidelines. But they have certain limitations in terms of consistency and usability. Hence, these security patterns may sometimes <b>act</b> as <b>insecure.</b> In this study, an attempt has been made to compose security patterns for the web-based application. Subsequently, a formal modeling approach for the composition of security patterns is presented. In order to maximize comprehensibility, Unified Modeling Language (UML) notations are used to represent structural and behavioral aspects of a web-based system. A formal modeling language i. e., Alloy has been taken into consideration for an-alyzing web-based security pattens. For the demonstration of this approach, a case study i. e., an online banking system is considered. A qualitative evaluation is performed for the identified security patterns against the critical security properties. In this study a model-driven framework is presented, which helps to automate the process of analyzing web security patterns...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzed the}} probable causes of accidents at work, {{of the forest}} sectors, of a Federal Institution of Higher education in Minas Gerais State looking for minimizing risks damages to workerâ€™s health and safety. The analyses were accomplished {{by means of the}} Accidents Communications in Service data bank and the results showed that in the studied period, for the forest sector, 50. 71 % of the accidents were attributed to the <b>insecure</b> <b>act,</b> 16. 98 % to insecure condition and 17. 94 % to personal factor of insecurity. The functional evaluation indicated that in 7. 14 % of the accidents occurred with workers that were not in the function established by the employment respective contracts. The rates of gravity and frequency of accidents calculated for the forest sectors allowed to conclude that the indices were higher than the others sectors and much higher than the values published by the Brazilian Ministry of Social Service and Assistance...|$|R
500|$|The {{fourth season}} had twelve roles {{receiving}} star billing, with ten of them {{returning from the}} previous season, eight of whom {{are part of the}} original cast from the first one. All the actors who are billed as series regulars portray physicians from the surgical wing of the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. The majority of the show's episodes are narrated by Ellen Pompeo, who portrayed protagonist Dr. Meredith Grey, a surgical resident whose storylines are the series' focal points. Sandra Oh acted as Meredith's best friend, highly competitive resident Dr. Cristina Yang. Fellow resident Dr. Isobel [...] "Izzie" [...] Stevens was portrayed by Katherine Heigl, while Dr. Alexander [...] "Alex" [...] Karev was played by Justin Chambers. T.R. Knight <b>acted</b> as <b>insecure</b> resident with self-confidence issues, Dr. George O'Malley, whereas Chandra Wilson portrayed Chief Resident and general surgeon Dr. Miranda Bailey, former mentor of the five residents during their internship. James Pickens, Jr. portrayed attending physician and general surgeon Dr. Richard Webber, who continues his position as Chief of Surgery, despite his former wishes of retirement. Orthopedic surgeon and fifth-year resident Dr. Calliope [...] "Callie" [...] Torres, who was portrayed by Sara Ramirez, has to face her husband's unfaithfulness and her unexpected bisexuality. Attending plastic surgeon, Dr. Mark Sloan was portrayed by Eric Dane, who is constantly seeking reconciliation with former best friend, attending physician and Chief of Neurosurgery Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), whose lasting relationship with Meredith Grey faces difficulties. Former Reunion star Chyler Leigh was promoted to series regular status, after short appearances in the final two episodes of the third season, portraying Meredith's half-sister Lexie Grey, who opts for a surgical internship at Seattle Grace Hospital against Massachusetts General Hospital, after her mother's sudden death. Silence of the Lambs star, Brooke Smith was upgraded to series regular status after multiple guest appearances {{in the second and third}} seasons. An antagonizing character at first, she replaces Preston Burke as the Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, constantly displaying disrespect for Cristina's previous relationship with him.|$|R
30|$|Our main {{findings}} are as follows: Security Barriers Need to be Visible: While removing security barriers such as effortful authentication and warning messages may simplify security provision while limiting user frustration with barrier frequency, {{this study has}} shown that removing all barriers is probably unwise. Participants indicated that having a few barriers was desirable to show that the security mechanism is working as intended. Barriers also help users build a mental model of the security provided, and may help build user trust that their data and device are adequately protected. To our knowledge, this result is novel. Secret Knowledge is Problematic: We found that users were fearful of forgetting secret knowledge such as PINs and passwords because they linked that knowledge to the ability to use their device at will. Removing the dependence on remembering a secret, while still adequately protecting the device functionality and data, may help relieve the user of this fear. This result goes beyond other research that states that users do forget passwords and PINs [55] to state that users are fearful of forgetting, and thus allow this fear to inform their security provision on their mobile device. We also believe this result is in line with other studies that state the user does not wish to <b>act</b> in an <b>insecure</b> manner, but perhaps chooses to do so to make up for failings in the security provisions afforded them [3]. Biometrics are Acceptable: We found that users were willing to try transparent methods based on biometrics, although they wished to have a period of evaluation before making a final decision. This result is similar to those found by Clarke et al.[46], and show that a plausible authentication solution that uses biometrics and is also acceptable to users has not yet been discovered. Furthermore, we found that users are willing to consider trying transparent authentication, as they see a need for alternatives to passwords and PINs. This finding supports similar results reported by Clarke et al. in their evaluation of the NICA method [6].|$|R
