5|$|In 1909, Holden won {{the design}} {{competition}} for an extension to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Subsequently {{dedicated to the}} memory of King Edward VII (died 1910), the extension (1911–12) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around <b>a</b> <b>courtyard.</b> The plain, abstract blocks have towers on the corners and two-storey loggias, and are a further simplification of Holden's style.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the fort there is <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> planted with trees.

5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, {{as was the case}} when the buildings were connected by <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> and protected by a common fence.|$|E

5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges in a square around <b>a</b> <b>courtyard.</b> At each corner was a tower, and in {{the centre of the}} east side was a five-storey gatehouse. Clockwise from north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel Tower, the Lord’s Tower, and the Kitchen Tower. Opposite the gatehouse, in the castle's west range, was the great hall and the Lord's Tower in the south west {{contained}} the owner's accommodation and private rooms.|$|E
5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{comprises}} <b>a</b> <b>courtyard,</b> {{surrounded by}} a number of towers and a round keep. The castle is built from purple and green slate stone, mainly constructed in a dry stone fashion without mortar, {{with the exception of the}} keep. The courtyard follows the natural shape of the hill and is protected by a curtain wall; originally perhaps 15feet (5m) high, it is now only at most 3feet (1m) high. Of the castle buildings, only the keep remains to any significant height.|$|E
5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards {{as many as four}} times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E

The Odessa theater is octagonal with <b>a</b> covered <b>courtyard</b> containing fixed seats for 441 attendees and a single balcony, while the original London theater was a 20-sided polygon with <b>an</b> open-air <b>courtyard</b> where most attendees stood and three balconies offered more expensive seats: total capacity may have been as high as 3,000.|$|R

5|$|In 1221 Llywelyn {{took control}} of {{neighbouring}} Meirionnydd from his son, Gruffydd; Llywelyn had previously placed Gruffydd in power there, but {{the father and son}} had fallen out. The prince then began to build the castle of Castell y Bere with the intent of controlling the local population and securing his new south-west border, which included the mountain trade routes between Gwynedd, Powys Wenwynwyn and Deheubarth. Castell y Bere was the first of several stone castles built by Llywelyn and the initial castle consisted of several towers positioned around <b>a</b> <b>courtyard,</b> situated on a rocky hillock in the Dysynni Valley near Cadair Idris.|$|E
5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} of Adam Gordon, the castle was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of the castle tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended {{with the addition of a}} large house, built around <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> to the south-west.|$|E
5|$|Known as {{the castle}} by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, {{with a side}} room called the pound, where new prisoners would wait until a room was found for them. The front lodge led to <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners from the common side could not be seen by those on the master's side, who {{preferred}} not to be distressed {{by the sight of}} abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment.|$|E

5|$|Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin {{is a large}} oil and tempera on oak panel painting, usually dated between 1435 and 1440, {{attributed}} to the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. Housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it shows Luke the Evangelist, patron saint of artists, sketching the Virgin Mary as she nurses the Child Jesus. The figures are positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards <b>a</b> <b>courtyard,</b> river, town and landscape. The enclosed garden, illusionistic carvings of Adam and Eve on the arms of Mary's throne, and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting's many iconographic symbols.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{disagree}} on the house's initial construction date, and no records survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence dating parts of the building to the 15th century; William Robinson's History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham (1840) suggests a date of about 1514, although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late 16th century. Nikolaus Pevsner speculates the front may have formed part of <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> house of which the remainder has disappeared.|$|E

The temple is formed by a circular wall with 64 chambers and an open mandapa in the centre, separated by <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> which is circular in shape, where Shiva is deified.

5|$|The Møntergården {{cultural}} history museum of Odense {{is one of}} the most notable remaining Renaissance buildings of the city, built in 1646 by the nobleman Falk Gøye. It has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in Odense, and is named after the narrow street Møntestræde adjacent to the building, where a coin workshop once operated in around 1420. Located in <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> of half-timbered houses, the museum also has exhibits on Funen's ancient history, as well as Odense in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Warnecke's {{design for}} the square {{was based on the}} {{architectural}} theory of contextualism. Not only did Warnecke's design build the first modern buildings on Lafayette Square, but they were the first buildings in the city to utilize contextualism as a design philosophy. Warnecke's {{design for the}} Markey National Courts Building was to create tall, flat structures in red brick which would serve as relatively unobtrusive backgrounds to the lighter-colored residential homes like the Cutts-Madison House. The Cutts-Madison House, Cosmos Club building, and Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House were joined, and <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> built between them and the National Courts Building.|$|E
5|$|Watson's {{hotel was}} {{designed}} by the civil engineer Rowland Mason Ordish, who was also associated witah the St Pancras Station in London. The building was fabricated in England from cast iron components and was assembled and constructed on site. The external cast-iron frame closely resembles other high-profile 19th century buildings such as London's Crystal Palace. The main façade of the hotel is distinguished by building wide open balconies on each floor that connected the guest rooms, which were built around the atrium in <b>a</b> <b>courtyard</b> arrangement.|$|E
