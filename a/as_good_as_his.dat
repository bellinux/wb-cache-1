5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It {{appears to be a}} {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Pablo {{work with}} the first-team squad during {{pre-season}} training, coach César Ferrando {{was quoted as saying}} he would pick Pablo and ten others for the coming campaign. He was <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> word: Pablo made his Segunda División debut in a 1–1 draw away to Terrassa on 31 August 2002, and went on to start 38 of Albacete's 42 matches as they finished the season in third place and were promoted to La Liga. After only a few second-tier matches, he had made sufficient impact to attract interest from clubs both domestic and foreign and receive a call-up to the Spanish under-21 team for a friendly match against Bulgaria.|$|E
25|$|Mutombodzi {{was named}} in the 24-man squad for the West Indian tour. He {{replaced}} Prosper Utseya in the third ODI. He scored 13 runs until he was run out by Dwayne Bravo. He was the best bowler in the Match for Zimbabwe, picking up 2/35 in his ten overs with a good economy rate of 3.50 runs per over. He made his T20 debut on March 2, 2013. It was not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> ODI debut, as he just made 2 runs and went for 0-20 in his two overs. In the next T20, he took his first T20 wickets, with figures of 2-28 from his four overs.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and Scott Williams to free agency, and John Paxson to retirement, but {{picked up}} {{shooting}} guard Ron Harper, the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant coach Tex Winter's triple-post offense, and small-forward Jud Buechler. The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kukoc at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter Steve Kerr, whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993–94 season, Myers, and centers Luc Longley (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves) and Bill Wennington. However, they were struggling during the season, on March 18, 1995, they received {{the news that}} Michael Jordan {{was coming out of}} retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in the playoffs, where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic, which included Horace Grant, Anfernee Hardaway, and Shaquille O'Neal. When Jordan returned to the Bulls, he initially wore No. 45 (which was his number while playing for the Birmingham Barons, a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox). He chose the No. 45 because his older brother Larry wore that number in high school. Michael wanted to be half <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> brother so he chose 23 which is half of 45 (22.5) rounded up. However, Jordan switched back to the familiar 23 before game 2 of the Orlando Magic series.|$|E
500|$|Having {{withdrawn}} from politics, Kenyon instead switched his focus {{to his job}} as Master of the Rolls. As a judge of the Court of Chancery he was required to deal with cases of equity; though he was almost entirely unfamiliar with the Roman law it was based on, he had previously practised in the Chancery. He was not considered <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> successor, Sir William Grant, but Lord Eldon wrote that [...] "I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided {{more than any of}} my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all". With the retirement of Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice, Kenyon succeeded him on 9 June 1788, and was made Baron Kenyon of Gredington, in the county of Flint.|$|E
500|$|Guest {{stars in}} the episode include Tim Robbins as Jim Hope, Gary Coleman as himself, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, and Clarence Clemons as a narrator. Scully thought Robbins [...] "did a great job" [...] because the Simpsons staff wanted the {{character}} of Jim Hope to be [...] "fun and upbeat and somebody the kids would love." [...] Clemons narrates a few scenes {{at the end of}} the episode, telling the viewers how the story ends. When Coleman agrees to spend Christmas with the Simpsons, Clemons says, for example: [...] "And Gary Coleman was <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> word, and as for old Mr. Burns, he was visited by three ghosts during the night and agreed to fund the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants." [...] Shortly after Coleman's death in 2010, an article appeared in the newspaper El Comercio that noted that [...] "the nod to the harsh reality of Gary Coleman in [...] is given: in real life a few years ago Gary had to make a living as a shop security guard." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Cowdrey {{produced}} {{a volume of}} autobiography, appropriately titled Good Enough, taken from his usual response to comments {{that he was not}} <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> father. Cricket writer Colin Bateman stated, [...] "Cowdrey was fortunate to play Test cricket at all, but he did not deserve the shabby treatment which ended his brief England career".|$|E
2500|$|On March 24, 2008, it was {{announced}} {{he would be the}} Cubs' fifth starter for the 2008 season. [...] Historically, Marquis' numbers {{during the second half of}} the season were not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> numbers during the first half, but thanks to smart managing by Lou Piniella, Marquis and Rich Harden, newly acquired from the Oakland Athletics on July 8, rotated their starts for a time, and Marquis posted a winning month of August, going 3–1 with a 3.90 ERA. It was his second-lowest ERA after a 3.81 ERA in July. He finished the season 11–9, with a 4.53 ERA, and held batters to a [...]192 batting average with 2 outs and runners in scoring position.|$|E

60|$|I see {{now that}} it was {{necessary}} that the bravest and humanest man in all the country should be hung. Perhaps he saw it himself.

60|$|The coachman drove {{round to}} a minute; another minute {{brought down the}} gentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being late, been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them off in <b>as</b> <b>good</b> time <b>as</b> <b>his</b> own {{correctly}} punctual habits required.|$|R
2500|$|On April 14, 1876, Douglass {{delivered}} the keynote {{speech at the}} unveiling of the Emancipation Memorial in Washington's Lincoln Park. In that speech, Douglass spoke frankly about Lincoln, noting what he perceived as {{both positive and negative}} attributes of the late President. Calling Lincoln [...] "the white man's president", Douglass criticized Lincoln's tardiness in joining the cause of emancipation, noting that Lincoln initially opposed the expansion of slavery but did not support its elimination. But Douglass also asked, [...] "Can any colored man, or any white man friendly to the freedom of all men, ever forget the night which followed the first day of January 1863, when the world was to see if Abraham Lincoln would prove to be <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> word?" [...] Douglass also said: [...] "Though Mr. Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow-countrymen against the Negro, it is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts he loathed and hated slavery...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Closing out the year, The Marshall Mathers LP 2 {{was ranked}} in {{multiple}} [...] "Albums of the Year" [...] lists. XXL named it the second best {{album of the}} year. They commented saying, [...] "Three years after his widely praised album Recovery, Em tapped into his former self for Marshall Mathers LP 2. Slim Shady, along with the characters and stories from the first installment, are peppered throughout his latest effort. The Rap God also displays his lyrical prowess on songs like “Love Game” with Kendrick Lamar, the tribute to his mother in “Headlights," [...] and the old school rap-rock ode [...] "Berzerk." [...] Em also supplies the world with another Rihanna collaboration that ups the expectations for fans every time their name is paired together. Overall, Eminem proves once again that his second wind is just <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> glory days." [...] Complex ranked the album number six, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013, praising it as Eminem's best album since The Eminem Show. Music critic Robert Christgau named it the seventh best album of 2013 in his year-end list for The Barnes & Noble Review. Digital Spy placed it at number 14 on their list of the best albums of 2013. It was placed at number 24 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. Spin also ranked it at number 28 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013, saying [...] "His eighth solo album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, is an unwieldy beast; an imperfect yet mostly thrilling verbal-gymnastics routine that sticks the landing in the zone of Bad Taste with arms proudly raised." [...] It was also listed at number 48 on the PopMatters list of the best albums of 2013. It was positioned at number 64 on musicOMHs list of the top 100 of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Ford was legendary for his {{discipline}} and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; {{he was also}} infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive {{the full force of}} his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a [...] "big idiot" [...] and even punched Henry Fonda. Henry Brandon (who played Chief Scar from The Searchers) once referred to Ford as [...] "the only man who could make John Wayne cry"[...] He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: [...] "D'ya known, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things that I could get any child off the street to do better?". Stock Company veteran Ward Bond was reportedly one of the few actors who were impervious to Ford's taunting and sarcasms. Sir Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios when he starred in Mogambo, was not the only person to suffer at the hands of John Ford's notorious behaviour. He recalls [...] "Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them was Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally—sometimes very sadistically. In Ford's eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled {{out in front of the}} entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford's brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford's grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight." [...] "We now had to return to the MGM-British Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day's work, I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK. He was <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> word—for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour." ...|$|E

Black's trial {{began with the}} prosecutor, Toby Hedworth, stating that the discovery of Black's signature upon these receipts was <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> signing <b>his</b> own confession.|$|R
