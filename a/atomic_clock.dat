5|$|The first {{accurate}} <b>atomic</b> <b>clock,</b> a caesium standard {{based on}} a certain transition of the caesium-133 atom, was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Calibration of the caesium standard <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> {{was carried out by}} the use of the astronomical time scale ephemeris time (ET).|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units {{standardized}} its unit of time, the second, on {{the properties}} of cesium in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The cesium <b>atomic</b> <b>clock,</b> maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is accurate to 30billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and rubidium vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of rubidium clocks).|$|E
25|$|An <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> uses {{an atomic}} {{resonance}} frequency standard as its timekeeping element. The first <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> was an ammonia maser device built in 1949 at the United States National Bureau of Standards.|$|E
50|$|The power {{consumption}} of <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> varies with their size. <b>Atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> {{on the scale}} of one chip require less than 30 milliwatt; Primary frequency and time standards like the United States Time Standard <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks,</b> NIST-F1 and NIST-F2, use far greater quantities of power.|$|R
5000|$|HRL began {{research}} on <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> in 1959. In the late 1970s they produced experimental maser oscillators for NRL, which {{eventually led to}} space-based GPS <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In a 1955 paper Winterberg {{proposed}} {{a test of}} general relativity using accurate <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> placed in orbit in artificial satellites. [...] At that time <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> were not yet of the required accuracy and artificial satellites did not exist. Werner Heisenberg {{wrote a letter to}} Winterberg in 1957 in which he said the idea sounded [...] "very interesting". This idea was later experimentally verified by Hafele and Keating in 1971 by flying <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> on commercial jets. [...] The theoretical approach was the same as that used by Winterberg. Today <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> and relativistic corrections are used in GPS and it is said GPS could not function without them.|$|R
25|$|During the 1970s it was {{realized}} that gravitational time dilation caused the second produced by each <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> to differ depending on its altitude. A uniform second {{was produced by}} correcting the output of each <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> to mean sea level (the rotating geoid), lengthening the second by about 1. This correction was applied {{at the beginning of}} 1977 and formalized in 1980. In relativistic terms, the SI second is defined as the proper time on the rotating geoid.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of the <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> in the early 1960s, it was decided to use atomic time as the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.|$|E
25|$|The satellites' atomic clocks {{experience}} {{noise and}} clock drift errors. The navigation message contains corrections for these errors and {{estimates of the}} accuracy of the <b>atomic</b> <b>clock.</b> However, they are based on observations and may not indicate the clock's current state.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> {{has led to}} many scientific and technological advances such as a system of precise global and regional navigation satellite systems, and applications in the Internet, which depend critically on frequency and time standards. <b>Atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> are installed at sites of time signal radio transmitters. They are used at some long wave and medium wave broadcasting stations to deliver a very precise carrier frequency. <b>Atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> are used in many scientific disciplines, such as for long-baseline interferometry in radioastronomy.|$|R
40|$|The {{computation}} of the International Atomic Time (TAI), {{a worldwide}} time reference, is briefly examined. The types of <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks,</b> computation procedures, and time intercomparison between clocks utilizing navigation satellites are addressed. Changes {{in the system}} would essentially depend on {{the improvement of the}} <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks...</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides astronomical observations, the Neuchâtel {{observatory}} {{also works}} with <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks.</b> Before 1967, one second {{was defined by}} {{the rotation of the}} earth, and thus Neuchâtel observatory calibrated clocks via observations. Now its telescope is used in a historical fashion by local amateur astronomers, while the calibration is done via <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, the {{discrepancy}} between the molad interval and the mean synodic month is accumulating at an accelerating rate, since the mean synodic month is progressively shortening due to gravitational tidal effects. Measured on a strictly uniform time scale, such as that provided by an <b>atomic</b> <b>clock,</b> the mean synodic month is becoming gradually longer, but since the tides slow Earth's rotation rate even more, the mean synodic month is becoming gradually shorter in terms of mean solar time.|$|E
25|$|ETS-VIII was {{launched}} on 18 December 2006. The purpose of ETS-VIII is to test communication equipment with two very large antennas and an <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> test. On 26 December both antennas were successfully deployed. This didn't come unexpected, since JAXA tested the deployment mechanism before with the LDREX-2 Mission, which {{was launched}} on 14 October with the European Ariane 5. The test was successful. The mission of WINDS (Kizuna) {{is to create}} the worlds fastest satellite internet connection. WINDS was launched in February 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Ives–Stilwell {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} by Herbert Ives and G.R. Stilwell first in 1938 and with better accuracy in 1941. It was designed to test the transverse Doppler effect – the redshift of light from a moving source in a direction perpendicular to its velocity—which had been predicted by Einstein in 1905. The strategy was to compare observed Doppler shifts with what was predicted by classical theory, and look for a Lorentz factor correction. Such a correction was observed, from which was concluded that the frequency of a moving <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> is altered according to special relativity.|$|E

A remote sensing instrument, SAGE III-ISS, was delivered to the station in 2014 aboard a Dragon capsule, and the NICER experiment {{is scheduled to be}} delivered in 2016.

A number of expansions are planned for the module to study quantum physics and cosmology. ESA's development of technologies on all the main areas of life support has been ongoing for more than 20 years and are/have been used in modules such as Columbus and the ATV. The German Aerospace Center DLR manages ground control operations for Columbus and the ATV is controlled from the French CNES Toulouse Space Center.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the advent}} of the <b>atomic</b> <b>clock,</b> the most {{reliable}} timekeeper available to mankind was the earth's rotation. It was natural therefore that the astronomers under the auspice of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) took the lead in maintaining the standards relating to time. In 1988, responsibility for timekeeping passed to the BIPM who took on the role of coordinating a number of atomic clocks scattered around the globe. [...] During the twentieth century it became apparent that the earth's rotation was slowing down resulting in days becoming 1.4 milliseconds longer each century – this was verified by comparing the calculated timings of eclipses of the sun with those observed in antiquity going back to Chinese records of 763BC.|$|E
25|$|The last case also {{involves}} very fast-moving matter. It {{has been demonstrated}} by <b>atomic</b> <b>clocks</b> in very fast spacecraft.

500|$|Ramsey and his PhD student Daniel Kleppner {{developed}} the atomic hydrogen maser, looking {{to increase the}} accuracy with which the hyperfine separations of atomic hydrogen, deuterium and tritium could be measured, {{as well as to}} investigate how much the hyperfine structure was affected by external magnetic and electric fields. He also participated in developing an extremely stable clock based on a hydrogen maser. Since 1967, the second has been defined based on [...] 9,192,631,770 [...] hyperfine transition of a cesium-133 atom; the <b>atomic</b> <b>clock</b> which is used to set this standard is an application of Ramsey's work. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 [...] "for the invention of the separated oscillatory fields method and its use in the hydrogen maser and other atomic clocks". The Prize was shared with Hans G. Dehmelt and Wolfgang Paul.|$|E
500|$|Gravity and {{the nature}} of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local {{gravitational}} acceleration g, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth's gravity). There are also slight seasonal variations in g due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the delineation of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized helium–neon laser interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium <b>atomic</b> <b>clock.</b> Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8ppb of [...]|$|E
