5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, <b>and</b> <b>return</b> to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later <b>and</b> <b>return</b> early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E

40|$|In this research, it {{is proven}} that perfect {{synchronisation}} between the input impulse (human effort) and the ground reaction impulse/impact {{can result in a}} phenomenon called the dynamic elastic response to impulse synchronisation with favourable consequences to the behaviour of the energy storing <b>and</b> <b>returning</b> foot. An energy storing <b>and</b> <b>returning</b> composite prosthetic foot was first used in elite competition at the 1988 Paralympic Games. Since its introduction, the prostheses have proven {{to be a source of}} controversy. In 2008, it was concluded that the athletes who use such technology when running are in advantageous position when compared to able-bodied athletes. However, these findings have since been disputed. There still remain unanswered questions regarding the level of contribution of energy storing <b>and</b> <b>returning</b> feet in the performance of amputee athletes. A series of investigations have previously been conducted to study the dynamic characteristics of a number of energy storing <b>and</b> <b>returning</b> composite prosthetic feet. It was found that if a sinusoidal input impulse, with a frequency close to one of the energy storing <b>and</b> <b>returning</b> feet’s natural frequencies, could be applied, it can make the energy storing <b>and</b> <b>returning</b> foot susceptible to resonance, which, in the case of bending mode, if sustained can lead to a gain in height or increased velocity...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{institutional}} investor trades in stocks grouped by {{style and the}} relationship of these trades with equity market returns. It aggregates transactions drawn from a large universe of approximately $ 6 trillion of institutional funds. To analyze style behavior, we assign equities to deciles in each of five style dimensions: size, value/growth, cyclical/defensive, sector, and country. We find, first, strong evidence that investors organize and trade stocks across style-driven lines. This appears true for groupings both strongly and weakly related to fundamentals (e. g., industry or country groupings versus size or value/growth deciles). Second, the positive linkage between flows <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> emerges at daily frequencies, yet becomes even more important at lower frequencies. We show that quarterly decile flows <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> are even more strongly positively correlated than are daily flows <b>and</b> <b>returns.</b> However, as the horizon increases beyond a year, we find that the flow/return correlation declines. Third, style flows <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> are important components of individual stock expected returns. We find that nearby style inflows <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> positively forecast future returns while distant style inflows <b>and</b> <b>returns</b> forecast negatively. Fourth, we find strong correlations between style flows and temporary components of return. This suggests that behavioral theories {{may play a role in}} explaining the popularity and price impact of flow-related trading. ...|$|R
