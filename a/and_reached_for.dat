2500|$|The splendour of Byzantine art {{was always}} in the mind of early medieval Western artists and patrons, and many of the most {{important}} movements in the period were conscious attempts to produce art fit to stand next to both classical Roman and contemporary Byzantine art. This was especially the case for the imperial Carolingian art and Ottonian art. [...] Luxury products from the Empire were highly valued, <b>and</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> example the royal Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo burial in Suffolk of the 620s, which contains several pieces of silver. Byzantine silks were especially valued and large quantities were distributed as diplomatic gifts from Constantinople. [...] There are records of Byzantine artists working in the West, especially during the period of iconoclasm, and some works, like the frescos at Castelseprio and miniatures in the Vienna Coronation Gospels, seem to have been produced by such figures.|$|E
