2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then <b>air</b> <b>blow</b> to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.|$|E

These windows had no glass and they let the cool night <b>air</b> <b>blow</b> in. The sun had long since sunk. Out to the west, where a bold, black horizon-line swept away endlessly, the sky was clear gold, shading to yellow and blue above. Stars were out, pale and wan, but growing brighter.

60|$|Philip was {{perfectly}} unconscious {{when he was}} carried to his new room. His illness had continued about a week, and had been aggravated first by his incredulous and determined resistance of it, {{and then by the}} neglect with which he had been treated. It was fearful to see how his great strength had been cut down, as there he lay with scarcely a sign of life, except his gasping, labouring breath. Guy stood over him, let the <b>air</b> <b>blow</b> in from the open window, sprinkled his face with vinegar, and moistened his lips, longing for the physician, for whom, however, he knew he must wait many hours. Perplexed, ignorant of the proper treatment, fearing to do harm, and extremely anxious, he still was almost rejoiced: for {{there was no one to}} whom he was so glad to do a service, and a hope arose of full reconciliation.|$|E

He thought I was sick {{and he gave me}} a drink and let the <b>air</b> <b>blow</b> in on me through the window. I remember I lay back in the chair and I thought. And I listened. When would you come? I didn't feel that you could leave me there alone with him. For his coming was different this time. That pain like a blade in my side!... When it came I was not the same. I loved you. I understood then. I belonged to you. I couldn't let him touch me. I had never been his wife. When I realized this--that he was there, that you might suffer for it--I cried right out.|$|E

50|$|The {{depth and}} shape of Death Valley {{influence}} its summer temperatures. The valley is a long, narrow basin 282 ft below sea level, yet is walled by high, steep mountain ranges. The clear, dry air and sparse plant cover allow sunlight to heat the desert surface. Summer nights provide little relief, as overnight lows may only dip into the 82 to 98 F range. Moving masses of super-heated <b>air</b> <b>blow</b> through the valley creating extremely high temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s and 60s, {{the term}} [...] "air doctor" [...] {{was first used}} to refer to the {{non-contact}} method of debris blow-off using compressed air. The printing and textile industries were some of the largest users of air doctors at that time. They often needed wide paths of air from a compressed air system to control the thickness of liquids on a surface, or to blow debris off the surface of materials prior to the next process. Other terms used were air bar, air squeegee, air curtain, air jet, air blast, <b>air</b> <b>blow</b> off, air nozzle, air comb, air blade and air doctor blade. Today the most commonly used term is simply [...] "air knife".|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} and {{promising}} blow-type flow control concept is the counter-flow fluid injection which {{is able to}} exert high-authority control to global flows using low energy modifications to key flow regions. In this case the <b>air</b> <b>blow</b> slit {{is located at the}} pressure side near the leading edge stagnation point location and the control air-flow is directed tangentially to the surface but with a forward direction. During the operation of such a flow control system two different effects are present. One effect, boundary layer enhancement, is caused by the increased turbulence levels away from the wall region thus transporting higher-energy outer flow into the wall region. In addition to that another effect, the virtual shaping effect, is utilized to aerodynamically thicken the airfoil at high angles of attack. Both these effects help to delay or eliminate flow separation.|$|E
