5|$|Princeton did not rehire Wigner {{when his}} {{contract}} ran out in 1936. Through Gregory Breit, Wigner found new employment at the University of Wisconsin. There {{he met his}} first wife, Amelia Frank, who was a physics student there. However she died unexpectedly in 1937, leaving Wigner distraught. He therefore accepted a 1938 offer from Princeton to return there. Wigner became a naturalized citizen of the United States on January 8, 1937, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> his parents to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock {{was too much to}} bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} have hypothesised that Ducetius returned {{without the consent}} of Syracuse, but this is very improbable. He must have had the permission of Syracuse to end the exile at Corinth (the mother city of Syracuse), <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> according to Diodorus partly Corinthian settlers for the colonising project at Kale Akte. Syracuse would have had an interest of establishing an allied Sikel-Greek colony on the north coast, without risking too much in a potentially hostile Sikel-dominated area.|$|E

25|$|The Brownwood Lions {{had long}} been on the losing side of the {{football}} field, only winning one district championship between 1920 and 1959. 1960 was Coach Wood's first year in Brownwood <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> the team a 13-1 season. Temple was the only loss the Lions received that year and Brownwood easily claimed the district title {{for the first time}} in many years.

25|$|Maximilian Frederick's {{successor}} as the Elector of Bonn was Maximilian Francis, {{the youngest}} son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> notable changes to Bonn. Echoing changes made in Vienna {{by his brother}} Joseph, he introduced reforms based on Enlightenment philosophy, with increased support for education and the arts. The teenage Beethoven was almost certainly influenced by these changes. He {{may also have been}} influenced at this time by ideas prominent in freemasonry, as Neefe and others around Beethoven were members of the local chapter of the Order of the Illuminati.|$|E

25|$|Riesch's men found {{themselves}} in a soldiers' battle amid woods and snow squalls, with the more aggressive French having the advantage. Charles Decaen's French division soon appeared on the scene to block Riesch's awkward attempts to break through to Kollowrat. Meanwhile, Richpanse, Ney, and Emmanuel Grouchy enveloped and crushed Kollowrat's isolated column. When Riesch heard of the disaster, he fell back. His own losses amounted to 900 men, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> off 500 French prisoners. Badly shaken by the disaster, Archduke John ordered a rapid withdrawal to distance his troops from the French.|$|E
25|$|From 671 BC on, Memphis and the Delta region {{became the}} target of many attacks from the Assyrians, who {{expelled}} the Nubians and handed over power to client kings of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. Psamtik I was the first recognized as {{the king of the}} whole of Egypt, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> increased stability to the country during a 54-year reign from the new capital of Sais. Four successive Saite kings continued guiding Egypt successfully and peacefully from 610–526 BC, keeping the Babylonians in certain measures away with the help of Greek mercenaries.|$|E
25|$|Starr {{was then}} reassigned {{back to the}} 6th Cavalry in Maryland. In October 1865, he {{received}} a brevet commission to lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his outstanding service.

25|$|By day Asada canvassed politicians, {{business}} leaders and journalists for ideas, by night he met with his young friends to cultivate ideas. Asada was staying at the Ryugetsu Ryokan in Asakusa, Tōkyō and he {{used it as a}} meeting place for progressive scholars, architects and artists. He often invited people from other professions to give talks and one of these was the atomic physicist, Mitsuo Taketani. Taketani was a scholar who was also interested in Marxist theory <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> this along with his scientific theories to the group. Taketani's three stage methodology for scientific research influenced Kikutake's own three stage theory: ka (the general system), kata (the abstract image) and katachi (the solution as built), which he used to summarise his own design process from a broad vision to a concrete architectural form.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 Brownwood Lions {{opened the}} season with a loss to Abilene Cooper {{followed}} by a win over Fort Worth Trimble Tech and a second loss to Wichita Falls Washington.

25|$|Dolegiewicz {{had begun}} to covertly use and sell {{anabolic}} steroids over this period. In mid-1981 he sold 500 tablets of Dianabol to track coach Charlie Francis, marking the beginning of sprinter Ben Johnson's drug use. The 1982 season saw him win his last national title in the shot put, but he also managed to win his first international medal in the discus that year, taking the bronze at the 1982 Commonwealth Games behind Bradley Cooper of the Bahamas and Rob Gray (Canada's {{number one in the}} event). The inaugural World Championships in Athletics was held in 1983 and Dolegiewicz was in attendance for Canada. However, neither he nor his compatriot Bruno Pauletto progressed past the qualification stage. Dolegiewicz also saw the opportunity to sell Dianabol at the international competition, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> along several hundred tablets of the drug on the trip to Helsinki. He also began supplying Mike Spiritosa, another Canadian thrower, with drugs over the period.|$|E

25|$|In 1775, Bolts {{offered his}} {{services}} to the Imperial government, putting forward a proposal for re-establishing Austrian trade with India from the Adriatic port of Trieste. His proposal was accepted {{by the government of}} Empress Maria Theresa, and on 24 September 1776, Bolts sailed from Leghorn (todays Livorno) in the dominions of Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, the younger son of the Empress, to India in command of a ship under the Imperial flag, the former Indiaman Earl of Lincoln, renamed the Giuseppe e Teresa (also called Joseph et Thérèse or Joseph und Theresia). He took with him a ten-year charter authorising him to trade under Imperial colours between Austria’s Adriatic ports and Persia, India, China and Africa, and from Africa and Madagascar to America. This enterprise required substantial capital, which Bolts sought in the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium), <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> in the Antwerp banker, Charles Proli, and his associates, the bankers I.C.I.

25|$|Erik Hamrén {{was hired}} as a new manager, but his {{existing}} contract hindered him starting until July, so Henriksen continued until then. When he took over the team, it was in ninth place, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> up to fifth {{by the end of the}} season. The club qualified for the UEFA Cup by co-winning the Intertoto Cup after beating NAC Breda; in the UEFA Cup, Rosenborg advanced to the group stage. In his second season, Hamrén succeed at winning the league, although the club lost for Kazakhstan's Qarabağ in the qualification for the Europa League and lost 5–0 for Molde in the cup quarter-final. Hamrén left the club midways during the 2010 season to become manager for Sweden. Eggen took over as manager again, and led them to the league title, without having lost a single league match. After advancing past Linfield and AIK, Rosenborg lost against Copenhagen on the away goal rule to play in Champions League, and instead played the group stage of the Europa League.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{changes in}} the balance of power now {{undermined}} Paget's local supremacy. Mackworth had spent much of 1654 in London {{as a member of the}} Protector's Council but died near the end of the year. The new governor, the younger Humphrey Mackworth, did not wield the same monopoly of power as his father. Under the Rule of the Major-Generals, Shropshire fell into the area governed by the Independent James Berry <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> to the fore Thomas Hunt, a leading local Presbyterian. Hunt was on good terms with Richard Baxter and they explored ways of opening up the pulpits to fresh preachers. Baxter visited and encouraged John Bryan, who was having a hard time with a conservative congregation at Holy Cross, the former Shrewsbury Abbey, just to the east of the town. Hunt and Baxter also planned to bring Henry Newcome to Shrewsbury. The congregation of Julian's wanted to secure one of these fresh voices and began to spend considerable sums on improvements to the church, as well as making a direct approach to Newcome. Baxter wrote to Newcome, making clear that Paget's parish was the ultimate target.|$|E
