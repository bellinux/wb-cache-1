40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the Thesis "Physical factors {{influencing}} the development of corneal damage by UV rays" was a) to determine the light absorption properties in the rabbit cornea irradiated with UVB rays by measuring of physical values of absorbance A and transmittance T as functions of wavelength; b) To investigate the absorption coefficient {{as a function of}} wavelength; c) To evaluate the importance of this coefficient for corneal light absorption properties; d) To determine the light absorption properties in the rabbit cornea irradiated with UVA by measuring of physical values of absorbance A and transmittance T as functions of wavelength (to compare the effect of UVA with UVB rays). Material and Methods: To achieve individual aims, the new spectrohotometrical method was developed and following experimets were performed: a) Repeted irradiation of the rabbit cornea with UVB rays (daily dose 1. 01 J/cm 2 during 5 days); b) Repeated irradiation of the rabbit cornea with UVA rays (daily dose 1. 01 J/cm 2 or 2. 02 J/cm 2) during five days; c) Repeated irradiation of the rabbit cornea with the daily dose of 1. 01 J/cm 2 during 4 days and in individual time intervals investigation of corneal light absorption and hydration changes; d) The anti-UV efficacy of UV filter (<b>actinoquinol</b> combined with hyaluronic acid, [...] ...|$|E
