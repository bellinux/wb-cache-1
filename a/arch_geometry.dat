40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effect of particular deformations of aortic arch shape on blood pressure response in children who had undergone successful repair of coarctation of the aorta. MethodsWe studied normotensive patients (aged 15. 1 ± 5. 8 years) who had undergone coarctation surgery by means of simple (n = 43) or extended (n = 32) end-to-end anastomosis. All patients underwent systematic exercise testing during follow-up, as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Three types of aortic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> were evident on magnetic resonance imaging: gothic arch with angular geometry and an increased height/width ratio of the arch, crenel arch with a rectangular shape, and normal arch with a smooth rounded shape. For each subject’s arch, the continuous variable height/width ratio was calculated. ResultsExercise-induced hypertension was more frequent in patients with gothic arch, with a prevalence of 83 % at 15 years after surgical intervention (95 % confidence interval, 69 %- 97 %) versus 25 % (95 % confidence interval, 0 %- 50 %) in those with crenel and 21 % (95 % confidence interval, 10 %- 46 %) in those with normal <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> (P <. 001). The cumulative incidence of exercise-induced hypertension {{as a function of}} aortic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> was significantly higher in patients with gothic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> throughout follow-up. On multivariate analysis, both gothic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> and higher height/width ratio were significantly correlated with exercise-induced hypertension. ConclusionAn angulated gothic arch is independently associated with abnormal blood pressure response. This deformation of the aortic arch identifies a subgroup of subjects with postoperative coarctation at high risk of hypertension in young adult life...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the influence of aortic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> on vascular remodeling after anatomically successful repair of coarctation of the aorta (CoA). BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of the precoarctation vasculature are known to occur after CoA repair and appear related to adverse outcomes. The influence of aortic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> on such abnormalities is unknown. METHODS: Sixty-three postcoarctectomy subjects (age 15. 9 +/- 6. 3 years) were compared with 63 control volunteers. Aortic arch shape was characterized on magnetic resonance imaging using both qualitative classification, identifying 3 subtypes of <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> (Gothic, Crenel, Romanesque), and a quantitative index, height/width ratio (H/W) of the aorta. Using ultrasound, we measured carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and stiffness index and distensibility, as well as right brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and glyceryl trinitate (GTN) -induced dilatation, to assess the precoarctation vasculature of these subjects. RESULTS: Gothic arch type was associated with higher carotid IMT and stiffness index, lower carotid distensibility (p < 0. 001 for all), and lower brachial reactivity (FMD, p < 0. 01; GTN response, p < 0. 001) compared with Crenel and Romanesque geometries and with control subjects. The height/width ratio was also significantly related to these vascular abnormalities. Even in CoA subjects with Romanesque <b>arch</b> <b>geometry,</b> arterial function and stiffness parameters were significantly impaired compared with control subjects.

Methods: Advanced computational fluid dynamics techniques (coupled Navier-Stokes and elastodynamics equations) were used to predict the fluid–wall interactions in large arteries. We modeled the fluid dynamics and shear stress in the ascending and horizontal aorta in cases of ''gothic'' arch and normal ''Romanesque'' aortic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry.</b> A total of 30 patients after aortic coarctation repair prospectively underwent 3 -dimensional magnetic resonance imaging angiography of the thoracic aorta. Measurements of the ascending and horizontal aorta were assessed using multiplanar reformatting images. Results: Our computational model demonstrated that wall shear stress is greater in those with an angulated ''gothic'' aortic arch than in those with a ''Romanesque'' arch. In particular, wall shear stress affected the anterior and posterior segments of the ascending aorta and the inferior and superior segments of the horizontal aorta (vs {{the left and right}} segments). In vivo, a ''gothic'' arch was associated with dilatation of the ascending and horizontal aorta, which was eccentric rather than concentric (P <. 05). Conclusions: Our results have shown that wall shear stress is eccentric and significantly increased in the ascending and horizontal aorta in patients with a ‘‘gothic’’ aortic arch after repair of coarctation. This suggests that patients with an angulated ‘‘gothic’’ aortic arch might warrant increased surveillance for aortic complications...|$|E

The advancement of this work lies in the inclusion of arch self weight {{and the ability to}} produce moment-less arch forms for any span/rise ratio, and any ratio of uniformly distributed load per unit span, w, to uniformly distributed arch weight per unit arch length, q. The model is used to derive the shapes of two classical ‘moment-less’ arch forms: parabolic and catenary, prior to demonstrating a general case, not restricted by the unrealistic load assumptions (absence of q - {{in the case of a}} parabolic form, or no w - in the case of a catenary arch).

Both patient-derived and experimental animal model data support {{a significant role}} for biomechanical forces during arch development. The objective {{of the present study}} is to quantify changes in geometry, blood flow, and shear stress patterns (WSS) during a period of normal arch morphogenesis. Composite three-dimensional (3 D) models of the chick embryo aortic arches were generated at the Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) developmental stages HH 18 and HH 24 using fluorescent dye injection, micro-CT, Doppler velocity recordings, and pulsatile subject-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD). India ink and fluorescent dyes were injected into the embryonic ventricle or atrium to visualize right or left aortic arch morphologies and flows. 3 D morphology of the developing great vessels was obtained from polymeric casting followed by micro-CT scan. Inlet aortic arch flow and cerebral-to-lower body flow split was obtained from 20 MHz pulsed Doppler velocity measurements and literature data. Statistically significant variations of the individual arch diameters along the developmental timeline are reported and correlated with WSS calculations from CFD. CFD simulations quantified pulsatile blood flow distribution from the outflow tract through the aortic arches at stages HH 18 and HH 24. Flow perfusion to all three arch pairs are correlated with the in vivo observations of common pharyngeal arch defect progression. The complex spatial WSS and velocity distributions in the early embryonic aortic arches shifted between stages HH 18 and HH 24, consistent with increased flow velocities and altered anatomy. The highest values for WSS were noted at sites of narrowest arch diameters. Altered flow and WSS within individual arches could be simulated using altered distributions of inlet flow streams. Thus, inlet flow stream distributions, 3 D aortic sac and aortic <b>arch</b> <b>geometries,</b> and local vascular biologic responses to spatial variations in WSS are all likely to be important in the regulation of arch morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{models and}} in vitro endothelial cell culture devices are used {{extensively}} {{to understand the}} impacts of hemodynamics (including wall shear stress and mass transfer rates) on endothelial cell physiology and atherogenesis. The purpose of this thesis was to use numerical methods to simulate fluid flow and mass transfer phenomenon in endothelial cell culture devices and the mouse aortic arch {{in order to better}} understand endothelial cell physiology and atherogenesis. The design of endothelial cell culture devices that seek to determine the separate roles of abnormal wall shear stress and abnormal mass transfer rates is complicated because areas of "abnormal" mass transfer and "abnormal" wall shear stress tend to co-localize. Therefore, we used numerical methods and design optimization techniques to design two endothelial cell culture devices that are capable of separating areas of low wall shear stress from areas of low wall mass transfer. This resulted in the successful design optimization of one device with a helical geometry and a second device consisting of axial baffles in a tube. In addition to in vitro endothelial cell culture, mouse models of atherosclerosis are often used to investigate endothelial cell physiology. However, the wall shear stress patterns in the aortic arch of the mouse have not been determined using subject-specific aortic root velocity boundary conditions and aortic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry.</b> Using aortic root velocity profiles as measured via MRI and aortic <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> measured via CT scan of a corrosion cast of the arch, we determined the subject-specific wall shear stress patterns in the aortic arch of the mouse.

Two types of <b>arch</b> <b>geometry,</b> with span/rise of 4 and 2, were studied as a shallow and deep <b>arch</b> <b>geometry.</b> The models were tested in a centrifuge under a steady equivalent gravity of 12 g. Two types of 2 -D and 3 -D arch models were studied which had the same geometry but different in the addition of spandrel walls. The 3 -D models were built with spandrel walls but without any wing walls or parapet. Both 2 -D and 3 -D arch models were tested under rolling and failure loads. The models were usually tested with fourteen passes of a rolling load and then up to the observation of first signs of failure {{to enable them to}} be suitable for applying a repair method. The repaired models were tested using the same procedure but up to the full failure load. To understand the behaviour of the arch models under unsymmetrical loads different roller weights were applied at different positions. The arch deflection and the soil/masonry interaction in arch extrados were measured in all the tests and compared with each other. Plastic mesh reinforcement, stitching, and concrete slab on top of the soil backfill were applied as repair methods to the 2 -D arch models. A review of the results has shown an increase in arch stiffness, decrease in deflections and a significant improvement in the ultimate load carrying capacity. A significant effect on the pressure distribution on the arch barrel was observed due to the application of the concrete slab on top of the backfill. Stitching of arch barrel and the barrel to the spandrels, applying partial saddle concrete and strengthening of spandrel wall using reinforced concrete were tested in the 3 -D arch models. The results showed improvements in the stiffness and ultimate arch load carrying capacity due to these repair techniques.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of old masonry bridges are still in use {{and need to be}} assessed considering current traffic loading and safety requirements. Masonry bridges are complex heterogeneous syst ems, where masonry arches represent the main components. Thus a realistic modelling of arches is vital for accurate assessment of masonry bridges. The authors have previously proposed and validated a detailed mesoscale description for masonry arches allowi ng for the actual masonry bond and the specific <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> including the case of skew arches. In this paper, th e proposed mesoscale modelling strategy is used in a comprehensive numerical study to investigate the effects of various parameters, including masonry bond and defects in the brickwork, abutment stiffness and movements at the supports, which are usually disregarded in practical assessment of masonry arches and bridges. The results achieved show how these parameters affect the ultimate load capac ity, failure mechanisms and initial stiffness of square and skew arches, where the used of detailed 3 D mesoscale modelling is critical in providing accurate response predictions under a variety of loading conditions for which reduced models might provide i ncorrect results...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} {{theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation into the}} nonlinear statics and dynamics of clamped-clamped in-plane MEMS arches when excited by an electrostatic force. Theoretically, we first solve the equation of motion using a multi- mode Galarkin Reduced Order Model (ROM). We investigate the static response of the arch experimentally where we show several jumps due to the snap-through instability. Experimentally, {{a case study of}} in-plane silicon micromachined arch is studied and its mechanical behavior is measured using optical techniques. We develop an algorithm to extract various parameters that are needed to model the arch, such as the induced axial force, the modulus of elasticity, and the initially induced initial rise. After that, we excite the arch by a DC electrostatic force superimposed to an AC harmonic load. A softening spring behavior is observed when the excitation is close to the first resonance frequency due to the quadratic nonlinearity coming from the <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> and the electrostatic force. Also, a hardening spring behavior is observed when the excitation is close to the third (second symmetric) resonance frequency due to the cubic nonlinearity coming from mid-plane stretching. Then, we excite the arch by an electric load of two AC frequency components, where we report a combination resonance of the summed type. Agreement is reported among the theoretical and experimental work...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} determining the moment-optimized shape y(x) for arched structures under unpredictable loading scenarios. A frame geometry optimization derivation is presented that demonstrates the relationship between certain unpredicted loads and an equivalent guaranteed loading condition that is more easily solvable through standard equilibrium analysis. The relationship is then broadened to generate the geometric form for arches experiencing randomly applied point loads over continuous intervals. The conclusions from the frame derivation and subsequent applications are summarized in a generalizable conjecture regarding stochastic loading, which states that the moment-optimized <b>arch</b> <b>geometry</b> y₁(x), when subjected to a random point load P with a likelihood of occurrence determined by a probability density function f(x), {{is equal to the}} zero-moment solution y₂(x) for an arch subjected to a distributed load u(x) when f(x) = u(x). The conjecture is further reinforced by form-finding models programmed to minimize maximum moments under stochastic loading using structural analysis software. Conceding an extensive range of applicability, this relationship is a direct asset when considering the design of structures subjected to projectile impacts, the location of which are oftentimes unpredictable. As such, an in-progress military shelter development project is examined as a case study to demonstrate the practicality of the theorem. by Daniel Bradley Brownfield. Thesis: M.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is devoted to}} assess the capability of a new upper-bound approach for the limit analysis of FRP-reinforced masonry arches by comparing it to both experimental tests {{and a number of}} existing numerical procedures. The approach is based on an idea previously presented by the Authors and relies on the representation of the geometry of both the arch and of FRP reinforcement through Non Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) functions. This allows generating a rigid body assembly starting from the assigned geometry composed by very few elements which still provide an exact representation of the original shape. A homogenized kinematic formulation for the limit analysis of the obtained rigid blocks assembly is derived, which accounts for the main properties of masonry material. FRP material is included exploiting the Italian CNR Recommendations for the design of FRP based reinforcing interventions. The approach is capable of accurately predicting the load bearing capacity of masonry <b>arches</b> of arbitrary <b>geometry,</b> provided that the initial mesh is adjusted by means of a suitably devised Genetic Algorithm (GA) until the active interfaces among blocks (e. g. hinges) closely approximate the actual failure mechanism...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{pilot project}} an ogee arch is being studied as a {{self-supporting}} skin skylight for the Housing and Building National Research Center’s (HBRC) patio. The ogee arch consists {{of a pair of}} two tangential circular arcs making an <b>arch</b> shape. The <b>geometry</b> of the <b>arch</b> depends on several interrelated variables including the angles subtended by the arcs, the ratio of the radii of the two arcs, and the height of the arch. This paper provides curves for designing the <b>geometry</b> of ogee <b>arches.</b> The structural analysis of two-hinged ogee arches under different cases of loading is outlined deriving expressions for the horizontal base thrust and plotting their graphs. A parametric study of the antisymmetric in-plane buckling behavior of ogee arches is presented using a finite element eigenvalue buckling analysis for several cases of loading. The finite element models consist of beam elements and have varying geometrical dimensions representing different shapes of ogee arches. The structural response of the arches is verified through a linear finite element analysis. The results of the buckling analysis are verified through a nonlinear finite element analysis with initial imperfections. It is found that the buckling load {{is a function of the}} ratio of the height-to-base radius of the arch and expressions for the lower bound buckling load are derived as a function of this height-to-base radius ratio...|$|R
40|$|Earth {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{construction}} materials used by mankind and has been used as a building material since ancient times until the present days. Its qualities related to thermal comfort, low cost or simple construction techniques have contributed to such a long tradition throughout the world with several different architectural expressions, integrating the culture and history of each region. With the wide propagation of steel and concrete structures, there has been a general loss of the traditional knowledge in earth construction. This type of construction presents important structural fragilities and requires a special maintenance to preserve its qualities. In order to understand the structural behaviour of this type of structures, the associated construction methods and processes have to be considered. Aveiro University has been developing studies on adobe constructions, with research on the material mechanical characterization, experimental study of the structural behaviour of adobe masonry walls and, more recently, in the development of a detailed survey methodology for the characterization of buildings in Aveiro district. Integrated in these studies, <b>arches</b> with different <b>geometries</b> were built using adobe blocks and traditional construction methods. These arches were tested under different types of vertical loading (distributed symmetrical, distributed non-symmetrical and point load) until collapse. The experimental tests performed reproduce the typical loading conditions of these structures during construction and use. The tests conducted, the results obtained and the main conclusions attained are described in this paper...|$|R
