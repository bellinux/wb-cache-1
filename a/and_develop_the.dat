The unincorporated community around Hebron Church continues to be known as Intermont, after the former post office.

5|$|Decades later, {{during the}} {{production}} of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected Beauty and the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on Roger Rabbit. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in 19th century France. At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring {{for the expansion}} of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E

5|$|In November 1933 Serong {{applied to}} the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but was unsuccessful. He {{subsequently}} joined the CMF, serving in the 57th/60th Battalion, and was based in Heidelberg, in outer Melbourne. In a five-month period he went from the rank of private to lance corporal. He also studied the military and civilian subjects that made up Duntroon's first-year curriculum {{in the hope of}} gaining entry into the college at second-year level in 1934. Serong successfully completed the service entry exam in August 1934, entering RMC in February 1935. In 1936 Serong won the welterweight category of the RMC boxing championship. At the end of 1937 he graduated from Duntroon as a lieutenant, and initially served with the coastal artillery, being posted to Queenscliff in 1938. Subsequent postings included Fort Largs near Adelaide to help raise and train Militia <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> artillery installation there, before returning to Queenscliff as an instructor in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} {{the character of}} a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in {{the final version of the}} script.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{read this}} Ultra {{intelligence}} {{in the office of}} the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. The prospect of an additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans to capture <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E

The five purpose-built venues continue to be used in their original functions, and have helped the country develop into one of the top nations in Winter Olympic competition; Canada more than quintupled the five medals it won in Calgary at the 2010 games, the next Winter Olympics hosted on Canadian soil in Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|The Cultural and Educational rights, {{given in}} Articles 29 and 30, are {{measures}} {{to protect the rights}} of cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by enabling them to conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination. Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language, script culture of its own, the right to conserve <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> same, and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them. It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. However, this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes, as well as reservation of up to 50percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community.|$|E

5|$|The {{congregation}} required its own church building, {{and already}} owned land {{which could be}} used: in 1828 the Catholics had purchased a former hospital and the surrounding land in Gedangan, near the , and established an orphanage there. However, there were insufficient clergy for further development. Mgr. Joseph Lijnen (1815–82), who had become the congregation's pastor in 1858, left the Indies for Heythuysen, Netherlands. There, he convinced several Franciscan nuns {{to join him in}} the Indies <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> congregation through education and ministry. Upon returning to the Indies, designs were made for a church building across from the orphanage and convent established for the nuns.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} nearly left unlocalized {{due to its}} {{religious}} content; its localization was handled entirely by Square Electronic Arts staff and translator Richard Honeywood, who described {{it as one of}} the most troublesome games of his career. Upon release, Xenogears received critical acclaim, with praise particularly going towards the storyline, gameplay, characters, and physiological and religious themes, though the rushed pace of the second disc, due to a lack of gameplay and excessive narration, was generally panned. By 2003, the game had shipped over 1.19 million copies worldwide. It has since gained cult classic status and is often acknowledged as one of the greatest role-playing video games of all time. While a direct sequel was never developed, Takahashi would later found the studio Monolith Soft <b>and</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> Xenosaga trilogy as a spiritual successor.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Roman settlement around what is now Bond Street. In 1894, a culvert made from brick and stone was discovered in the area.

At that time, the house backed onto open fields, known as Albemarle Ground, and the development of estates in Mayfair had just begun.|$|E
