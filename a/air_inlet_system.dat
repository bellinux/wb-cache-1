30|$|The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>system</b> of {{traditional}} engines mainly relies on absorption by the quarter-wavelength straight-tube to suppress high-frequency noise, but two major problems exist. First, the quarter-wavelength straight-tube has a narrow denoising band and cannot cover the low-frequency noise band completely, {{which results in}} incomplete noise reduction. Second, due to the greatly restricted radial size of the air inlet tube in the engine’s inlet system, the longer length of the traditional quarter-wavelength straight-tube {{will be difficult to}} arrange in a compact car <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new type of muffler design, which has the advantages of both the quarter-wavelength straight-tube and Helmholtz muffler, with a wider noise elimination frequency band and smaller radial size. When used in a practical automobile test, the muffler showed excellent performance in high frequency noise reduction of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>system,</b> and this performance was supported by the experimental data.|$|E

30|$|The resonance-type {{resistance}} silencer {{is based}} on the principle of the Helmholtz resonator (HR). It has the advantages of simple structure, high amount of noise elimination, and small pressure loss, among other attributes. It is widely used in automotive engine air intake noise control (Sohn and Park 2011). Arefi et al. (2014) was able to improve reverberation time in a conference room using HRs with defined dimensions, diffusers, and sound absorbers. Mao and Pietrzko (2010) carried out an experimental investigation of passive control of sound transmission through a double-glazed window by using an arrangement of HRs. It was shown that a considerable reduction of the transmitted sound pressure levels has been achieved around the mass-air-mass resonance frequency (50 – 120  Hz). Lee et al. (2013) studied the effect of leakage on the acoustic performance of reactive silencers, such as expansion chambers, HRs, and quarter-wave resonators. Sanada and Tanaka (2013) used two degree of freedom Helmholtz-based resonators with a flexible panel to extend the frequency range of resonant sound absorbers. Yasuda et al. (2013), based on the typical structure, designed a muffler with an interconnecting hole on the tail tube, which was proposed to improve its acoustic performance. Park (2013) introduced a micro-perforated panel of absorbers backed by HRs to improve sound absorption in the low-frequency region, where conventional micro-perforated panel absorbers cannot provide sufficient absorption. Singh and Rienstra (2014) presented a systematic derivation of a solution of the nonlinear HR equation, in order to obtain analytically expressions for impedances close to resonance, while including nonlinear effects. Atak et al. (2014) combined two concepts to design acoustic lenses that are based on HRs. It was shown that using HR-based sonic crystals leads to better acoustic lens designs, especially at the low frequencies, where the local resonances are pronounced. At present, research focuses primarily on designing or analyzing HR, which has a good effects on the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>system’s</b> low-frequency noise elimination; however, a larger proportion of intake system noise is high-frequency, especially during rapid acceleration. In order to improve an automobile’s riding comfort, it is necessary to establish a method to suppress the engine’s <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> high-frequency noise during rapid acceleration.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} establish the potential benefits of improving the performance of the current gas turbine plant into a more advanced cycle with high efficiency and power output through <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> cooling. Problem statement: The hypothesis was that the low performance of the gas turbine plant was caused by high ambient temperature, the use of spray cooler was adopted to bring the air condition temperature close to ISO condition. Approach: In this study, performance characteristics were determined for a set of actual operational conditions including ambient temperature, relative humidity, turbine inlet temperature and pressure ratio. Results: The results obtained show that the use of a spray cooler on the existing gas turbine cycle gives a better thermal efficiency and less irreversibility rate in the components system and the entire plant. The power output of the gas turbine plant with spray cooler was found to have increased by over 7 %, accompanied by 2. 7 % increase in machine efficiency with a reduction in specific fuel consumption of 2. 05 and 10. 03 % increase in the energy of exhaust.

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s.

The system consists of the 45 -degree inlet elbow, the flow instrument, the 90 -degree mitered elbow and fans, respectively. The energy loss in each section can be determined by Bernoulli’s equation and ASHRAE standard table. Hence, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is {{used in this study}} based on Navier-Stroke equation and the standard k-epsilon turbulence modeling. Input boundary condition is 175 kg/s mass flow rate inside the 11 -m 2 cross sectional duct. According to the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> flow rate, the Reynolds number of airstream is 2. 7 x 106 (based on the hydraulic duct diameter), thus the flow behavior is turbulence. The numerical results are validated with the real operation data. It is found that the numerical result agrees well with the operating data, and dominant loss occurs at the flow rate measurement device. Normally, the air flow rate is measured by the airfoil and it gets high pressure drop inside the duct. To overcome this problem, the airfoil is planned to be replaced with the other type measuring instrument, such as the average pitot tube which generates low pressure drop of airstream.

40|$|To {{achieve a}} life cycle {{assessments}} of energy systems with both power output and economical profits maximized is considered {{as the main}} objective of operation management. This paperis designedto evaluate boththe performance of agas turbine added with an <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> cooling <b>system</b> {{as well as its}} life cycle cost. Accordingly, a thermodynamic model and an economic model are developed respectively to derive an analytical formula for calculating the cooling loads and life cycle cost. The majorresults show that the output power for gas turbine power plant with the cooling system (120 MWH) is higher than that of a gas turbine power plant without the cooling system (96. 6 MWh) at peak condition; while the life cycle cost of former plants is lower thanthe latter ones. Thus, the proposed methods suggest potential cost-effective improvements feasible and achievable through changing the structure of the system. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve effect of hybrid ventilation, the paper {{discussed}} a solar chimney to enhance natural ventilation. Some factors influencing solar chimney hybrid ventilation in classroom, such as heat sources, <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> arrangements, <b>air</b> velocity and solar radiation were studied by simulation and validated by experiments. The characteristics of temperature distribution and temperature efficiency in classroom were obtained and analyzed. A low position of <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> in the room makes high temperature efficiency, the optimal value of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity is about 0. 5 m/s. The research provides {{a better way to}} enhance hybrid ventilation by solar chimney...|$|R
