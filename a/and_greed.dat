5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine was {{presented}} as a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise. When {{the last of his}} sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) Julian the Apostate wrote the satire Symposium, or the Saturnalia, which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury <b>and</b> <b>greed.</b> Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess <b>and</b> <b>greed,</b> as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, <b>and</b> <b>greed,</b> by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E

5|$|The poem is a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between {{the lives of the people}} living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery <b>and</b> <b>greed,</b> making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred <b>and</b> <b>greed,</b> had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} found Crispin Bonham-Carter to {{have the}} best physical contrast to Firth's Darcy and gave him his first major television role as the good-natured and wealthy Mr Charles Bingley. Bonham-Carter had originally auditioned for the part of Mr George Wickham, a handsome militia lieutenant whose charm conceals his licentiousness <b>and</b> <b>greed,</b> but Adrian Lukis was cast instead. Anna Chancellor, of Four Weddings and a Funeral fame, played Mr Bingley's sister Caroline Bingley. (Chancellor is also Jane Austen's six-times-great-niece) Mr Bingley's other sister and his brother-in-law were played by Lucy Robinson (Louisa Hurst) and Rupert Vansittart (Mr Hurst). Casting the role of Darcy's young sister, Georgiana, proved hard as the producers were looking for a young actress who appeared innocent, proud and yet shy, had class and could also play the piano. After auditioning over 70 actresses, Simon Langton suggested Emilia Fox, the real-life daughter of Joanna David (Mrs Gardiner), for the part. Barbara Leigh-Hunt was cast as Darcy's meddling aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, without auditions or screen tests.|$|E

5|$|The {{two films}} most {{commonly}} compared to Greed are Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being {{lost in the}} desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. The Magnificent Ambersons <b>and</b> <b>Greed</b> both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. Ambersons was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that Greed influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to {{the intentions of the}} original novels. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film Greedy pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.|$|E

25|$|Jainism prescribes {{a path of}} non-violence to {{progress}} the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is {{the emphasis on the}} consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace <b>and</b> <b>greed</b> destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness <b>and</b> <b>greed</b> by contentment.|$|E

25|$|Since {{classical}} times, it {{has been}} noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures.

One, that Tacitus says is by the Caledonian chieftain Calgacus, ends Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.

25|$|Vn.Shankar Narayan {{suggests}} that the origin of vegetarianism in India developed from the idea that balance needed to be restored.

But fortunately, there were many serious attempts to bring back the humanity to sanity and restore balance from time to time.” He also says that the idea of living in harmony with nature became central to the leaders.|$|E
25|$|Already in {{the late}} Middle Ages, some {{distinction}} had been occasionally made between on one hand 'rälssi', tax exemption; {{and on the other}} hand a proper ennoblement. It was part of the custom that only kings were entitled to dub knights and ennoble, while in addition several other authorities, including at least important castellans of big castle fiefs, were able to grant tax exemption ('rälssi') to landholdings and useful local gentrymen. Only the increasing precision (<b>and</b> <b>greed</b> for tax revenues) of the Vasa kings brought implications of these differences afront in 16th century and particularly then in 17th century when the House of Knoghts and Nobility had been established.|$|E
