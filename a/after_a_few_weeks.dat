5|$|In {{between the}} Brazilian and Argentine Grands Prix, Rinland {{returned}} to Europe full-time {{to take the}} official post of the team's Technical Director. His long-term task was to establish an English-based design office for the team, but his initial job was to improve the competitiveness of the FG01 {{through a series of}} technical upgrades.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Poe plot, Riley was dismissed from the Democrat, so he returned to Greenfield to spend time writing poetry. Back home, he met Clara Louise Bottsford, a school teacher boarding in his father's home. They found they had much in common, particularly their love of literature. The couple began a twelve-year intermittent relationship which would be Riley's longest lasting. In mid-1878 the couple had their first breakup, caused partly by Riley's alcohol addiction. The event led Riley to make his first attempt to give up liquor. He joined a local temperance organization, but quit <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

The base was named for Captain Benno Fiala von Fernbrugg in 1967.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they {{would also have to}} deal with the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} {{decided to}} release the prisoners <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because {{it was thought that}} a demonstration of the size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion. Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite. Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming. When the prisoners traveled through Detroit on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged effigies of the Indians.|$|E
5|$|In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mengele {{worked as}} a {{carpenter}} while residing in a boarding house in the suburb of Vicente López. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> {{he moved to the}} house of a Nazi sympathiser in the more affluent neighborhood of Florida, Buenos Aires. He next {{worked as a}} salesman for his family's farm equipment company, and beginning in 1951 he made frequent trips to Paraguay as sales representative for that region. An apartment in the center of Buenos Aires became his residence in 1953, the same year he used family funds to buy a part interest in a carpentry concern. In 1954 he rented a house in the suburb of Olivos. Files released by the Argentine government in 1992 indicate that Mengele may have practiced medicine without a license, including performing abortions, while living in Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|In June 1951, Kennedy {{enlisted in}} the United States Army and signed up for an {{optional}} four-year term which was shortened to the minimum two years after his father intervened. Following basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey, he requested assignment to Fort Holabird in Maryland for Army Intelligence training, but was dropped without explanation <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> He went to Camp Gordon in Georgia for training in the Military Police Corps. In June 1952, Kennedy {{was assigned to the}} honor guard at SHAPE headquarters in Paris, France. His father's political connections ensured that he was not deployed to the ongoing Korean War. While stationed in Europe, he traveled extensively on weekends and climbed the Matterhorn in the Pennine Alps. He was discharged after 21 months in March 1953 as a private first class.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, {{the city}} {{government}} proposed that {{the maintenance of the}} new trains be privatized. This resulted in protests from the employees, who campaigned by refusing to work overtime. As a result, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service. The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009. As part of the agreement, a new limited company, Oslo Vognselskap, wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies. Responsibility for the debt accumulated for buying the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap, while operation and management of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T-banedrift.|$|E
5|$|In October 1944, the Banat and Bačka were {{captured}} by Soviet troops. Subotica was captured on the 12 October. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> they withdrew and ceded {{full control of}} the region to the Partisans, who established a military administration in the Banat, Bačka and Baranja on 17 October 1944. In {{the first few weeks}} after Bačka returned to Yugoslav control, about 16,800 Hungarians were killed by Serbs in revenge for killings during the Hungarian occupation. In November 1944, Tito declared that the Volksdeutsche of Yugoslavia were hostile to the nation, and ordered the internment of those living in areas under Partisan control. About 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche had been evacuated from Bačka; while an additional 30,000–60,000 from Bačka were serving in the Wehrmacht at the time.|$|E

5|$|The {{crossbows}} {{and early}} firearms were unwieldy and deteriorated {{rapidly in the}} field, often becoming unusable <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of campaigning due {{to the effects of}} the climate. The Maya lacked key elements of Old World technology, {{such as the use of}} iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is active during the night, makes nests of sedge and grass, and {{occasionally}} builds runways. Its diverse diet includes plants, fungi, {{and a variety}} of animals. Population densities are usually below 10 per ha (four per acre) and home ranges vary from 0.23 to 0.37ha (0.57 to 0.91acres), depending on sex and geography. Litters of generally three to five young are born after a pregnancy around 25 days, mainly during the summer. Newborns are helpless at birth, but are weaned <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> Several animals prey on the marsh rice rat, including the barn owl, and it usually lives for less than a year in the wild. It is infected by many different parasites and harbors a hantavirus that also infects humans. The species is not of conservation concern, but some populations are threatened.|$|E
5|$|The young hatch <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> and {{typically}} have only {{three pairs of}} legs, followed by up to four legless segments. As they grow, they continually moult, adding further segments and legs as they do so. Some species moult within specially prepared chambers of soil or silk, and may also shelter in these during wet weather, and most species eat the discarded exoskeleton after moulting. The adult stage, when individuals become reproductively mature, is generally reached in the final moult stage, which varies between species and orders, although some species continue to moult after adulthood. Furthermore, some species alternate between reproductive and non-reproductive stages after maturity, a phenomenon known as periodomorphosis, in which the reproductive structures regress during non-reproductive stages. Millipedes may live from one to ten years, depending on species.|$|E

5|$|After Adamle {{stepped down}} as General Manager, Stephanie soon became {{in charge of the}} brand and (reignited her feud) and had altercations with Chris Jericho in the {{following}} weeks, which involved her firing him (although he was later reinstated). After her father Vince returned, the family began a feud with Randy Orton, who began the storyline by punting Vince in the head. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of feuding, Orton and his alliance, The Legacy, punted Shane in the head and performed an RKO on McMahon. Following the attack, he was chased out of the ring by Triple H, who is her real-life husband. The rivalry between Orton, The Legacy and The Mcmahons heated up when Orton attacked and kissed Stephanie. Triple H and the Legacy rivalry continued at WrestleMania XXV, where Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Orton. The following month, Orton won the championship at Backlash. After Backlash McMahon left Raw and took a hiatus from WWE television.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of {{training}} with Burke, Sing was scouted by All Japan Women (AJW), despite her inexperience. Sing's debut match in Japan was a tag team match with partner Mami Kumano, defeating the Beauty Pair (Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda) in January 1979. In Japan, she began wrestling {{under the name}} Monster Ripper. Although she found adjusting to the Japanese culture difficult, Sing held AJW's title on two occasions {{and was the first}} Calgary born wrestler to gain success in Japan. During her time in the company, the Japanese female wrestlers gave her a hard time because they did not like losing to foreigners. Sing also had difficulty because of her youth and inexperience in the ring. Sing, however, was comforted by New Japan Pro Wrestling's Dynamite Kid, who had also trained in Calgary. Sing won the WWWA World Single Championship from Jackie Sato on July 31, 1979. Despite losing the title to Sato six weeks later, she regained it on March 15, 1980. The title was vacated in August 1980.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} neared completion, Miller began {{to market the}} game to players. Strongly {{encouraged}} by the updates the team was sending him, he began heavily advertising the game {{in all of the}} bulletin board systems (BBS) and game magazines he had access to. The game was completed in early December 1990, and on the afternoon of December 14 Miller began uploading the completed first episode to BBSs, with the other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for US$30. After the arrival of the first royalty check from Apogee, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game, the team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months.|$|E
