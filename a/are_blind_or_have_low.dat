The current superintendent of ISBVI, James Durst, does not actually hold valid Indiana licensure to be a superintendent [...] and is therefore officially the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the school instead. The Lions Clubs of Indiana support the institution as one of their state projects through monetary donations and volunteerism. ISBVI has a youth Lions Club called the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired Leo Club. Their colors are green and white. Their mascot is the rocket.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to explore how people who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> vision prefer to get online news, the problems they face in doing so and how their online news-gathering experiences could be made better. It also investigates whether they believe they experience a gap in their knowledge of news {{as a result of}} their level of news access. Using semi-structured interviews and observation sessions with 14 mid-Missouri residents who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> vision, the researcher discovered that many do not regularly use traditional news websites, often because of accessibility or usability problems. Instead, they tend to get news through other online and offline platforms. Subjects overall said they do not think they experience a knowledge gap, although anecdotes and observations revealed some problems. The 14 interviews yielded a list of suggested improvements to online news delivery. These were supplemented with interviews with six professionals who offered more insight into those improvements. The population of people who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> vision is not small, and the people interviewed for this study showed that they are generally an interested, engaged news audience. However, little research has been done on how to deliver news in ways that serve them best. This study seeks to begin to fill that gap...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{probable}} significance of tactile or haptic (Gibson, 1966) capacities {{in the early}} development of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> vision (Bigelow, 1990; Fraiberg, 1977; Hatwell, 1978), {{there are still many}} unanswered questions regarding the emergence of such capacities. A centraI issue in this respect is {{the nature and extent of}} children's memory of haptic features. Although there is evidence that blind preschoolers (Ungar, Blades, Spencer, & Morsley, 1994) and older children (Pathak & Pring, 1989) are able to retain information from tactile maps and two-dimensional displays, there has been little research on the age at which such memory abilities begin in children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> vision and few studies of memory for three-dimensional objects. There is evidence that blind infants show a poor spontaneous response to such objects in the naturalistic environment (Fraiberg, 1977), but this does not necessarily mean that the haptic features of objects could not be retained if infants were to engage in exploratory behavior. A promising tool for addressing these issues is habituation or familiarization, a procedure that has been successfully used to investigate haptic memory in sighted infants (Catherwood, 1993 a, 1993 b; Gottfried & Rose, 1980; Streri & P echeux, 1986). Variants of this procedure have been used to confirm that infants as young as 4 months are able to recognize objects on the basis of features, such as shape or texture, that have been experienced only through haptic means. In such procedures, infants are either repeatedly presented with or allowed to explore one item and then presented with "test" trials involving the re-presentation of this familiar item, as well as "novel" items that differ in one or more features from the familiar item. The essential premise is that if the infants display more exploratory interest in the novel items than in the familiar item (in terms of longer manipulation time), it suggests that the familiar item has been discriminated from the novel items or recognized on the basis of the feature or features in which the novel and familiar items differ (given that all other factors have been accounted for). These procedures would seem particularly suited to the study of recognition abilities in infants who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> vision, but they have not yet been applied in such research. The present investigation involved a pilot assessment of such procedures over two test sessions with two infants with severe low vision...|$|E
