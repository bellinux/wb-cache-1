The episode was the third of the series directed by Charles McDougall; he had previously directed the earlier season two episodes [...] "Christmas Party" [...] and [...] "Dwight's Speech". The episode features Angela and Oscar arguing over Angela's poster of two babies playing saxophones. [...] Jenna Fischer said that [...] "As a cast, the baby poster is one of our favorite props... Angela received the poster from her Secret Santa in the Christmas episode." [...] Fischer {{went on to say that}} [...] "I had to stand in between Angela and Oscar as they bicker about the poster while Michael tries to mediate the situation. The whole time, the cute jazz babies are staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> poster. It was hilarious!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked back}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{door with a}} twinkle in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|He drew {{himself up}} and folded his arms, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> immeasurable height of his own superiority.|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} the empty tumbler seemed to look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> reproachfully <b>from</b> <b>the</b> window sill.|$|R
60|$|We {{said good-bye}} {{at the club}} front door. He smiled down <b>at</b> <b>me</b> benevolently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of the steps.|$|R
60|$|Later, I sought her out. She {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> window-seat in our living-room, {{where she had}} been talking to the Scherer girls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear old Roddy! I {{saw your}} white face staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corner. You are not changed, {{for all your}} grand clothes and your London friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are leaving}} {{us for a}} few days?" [...] I remarked, {{suddenly}} catching {{a glimpse of a}} face like a round moon beaming <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> window.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see nothing}} now," [...] said I, closing my own eyes, [...] "unless {{it be the}} face of a sprite {{laughing}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of a deep well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} mean the Riverside Franchise," [...] I said. He looked up <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> miserably, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chair into which he had sunk, {{his hands in his}} pockets.|$|R
60|$|Passing of {{an evening}} I have seen his dark, grim figure flitting about {{in the shadow of}} the trees, or caught a glimpse of his hard, angular, swarthy face peering out suspiciously <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> bars.|$|R
60|$|The old {{man with}} the cough jerked his head back so {{suddenly}} that it startled me, and shot another glance of his red eyes <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> shade; but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing <b>from</b> one to <b>the</b> other.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will, {{and some}} day, when I am walking along Piccadilly, a passing {{automobile}} will splash me with mud. A heavily furred plutocrat will stare haughtily <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tonneau, {{and with a}} start of surprise I shall recognize--' ...|$|E
60|$|Grace drew herself {{entirely from}} my arms, and looked intently, and, as I fancied, anxiously <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other {{corner of the}} settee. Then she affectionately took one of my hands, in both her own, and pressed it gently.|$|E
60|$|She {{came forward}} shyly. I found it {{difficult}} to recognise in her the flaming Fury that a few minutes before had sprung <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> billows of her torn blue skirt. She shook hands with the red-haired man and kissed her father.|$|E
60|$|I bowed. Sir Thomas stood very stiffly, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{severely}} <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> broad {{brim of his}} hat.|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} {{gave way to}} me and talked no more. Instead she looked at me--as a thing beyond her controlling, but none the less interesting--much as she had looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> skirts of Lady Drew in the Warren when we were {{children}} together.|$|R
6000|$|... [87] Notwithstanding {{the hard}} words shot <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> behind <b>the</b> hedge of {{anonymity}} by {{a writer in}} a recent number of the Quarterly Review, I repeat, without the slightest fear of refutation, that the four Gospels, as {{they have come to}} us, are the work of unknown writers.|$|R
6000|$|And then my mare trod on a dead branch, and all vanished. My fairy was gone; {{and there}} was only little [...] "Connemara," [...] as we called her, nursing her doll, and smiling up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fern, where she had come to {{practise}} her new school-song.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my old name--the dear, {{familiar}} {{name that}} I thought I had parted from for ever. I started up--not frightened, {{the voice was}} too kind and gentle to frighten anybody--but very much surprised. There, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> doorway, stood a woman, whose face I never remembered to have seen before--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{laugh at}} me,' said he, taking the eldest daughter's hand, and {{laughing}} himself. 'You think my ambition as nonsensical as if I were to freeze myself {{to death on}} the top of Mount Washington, only that people might spy <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> country round about. And, truly, that would be a noble pedestal for a man's statue!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You--you Puritan!" [...] she cried. [...] "To {{think that}} I should have married a Puritan! What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who {{was such a}} stanch Royalist? Why, I think I can see him {{frowning}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} much more awful, Elspeth, if the French noble had killed <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> least <b>from</b> <b>the</b> light in which I look at it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, fired-oh-Ed. Canned. Got the gate. Thrown out. Got the razzle-dazzle. Got {{the hook}} thrown into me. Bounced. Kiyudeled. That is, at least, I will be, {{as soon as}} I let the old man get <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> judging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> love-letters he's been sending me, {{inviting}} me to cut a switch and {{come out to the}} wood-shed with him." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR HOWARD. I did; and I can {{confidently}} say, after a {{long experience}} of faces of the worst type looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dock, that I have never seen so entirely villainous a trio as that Moor and the two Krooboys, to whom you gave five dollars when {{they would have been}} perfectly satisfied with one.|$|E
60|$|Gallant Traddles, of {{the strong}} heart and the unruly hair; Sophy, dearest of girls; Betsy Trotwood, with your gentlemanly manners and your woman's heart, you have come to me in shabby rooms, making the dismal place seem bright. In dark hours your kindly faces have looked out <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shadows, your kindly voices have cheered me.|$|E
60|$|Janet {{looked a}} little {{surprised}} to see me lying stiffly on the sofa (I was afraid to move lest it should be displeasing to my aunt), but went on her errand. My aunt, with her hands behind her, {{walked up and down}} the room, until the gentleman who had squinted <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> upper window came in laughing.|$|E
6000|$|KING. [...] "'You look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{too much}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{favorable}} side! Ask these Gentlemen about my humors and my caprices; {{they will tell}} you fine things of me.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{two days}} Bursey was granted an {{interview}} with Byrd. “I was disappointed when I first saw Commander Byrd,” he recalled {{in an interview in}} 1979 in the Grand Rapids Press. “I had pictured him as a 7-foot giant with fire in his eyes. Instead, he was a slight man. Looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> across <b>the</b> desk, he seemed humble and friendly. It was probably the shortest interview on record.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} fire burning clear enough {{in my room}} by this time, and the {{curtains}} drawn before the windows and round the bed, giving it a very snug appearance. I {{sat down in a}} great chair upon the hearth to meditate on my happiness; and had enjoyed the contemplation of it for some time, when I found a likeness of Miss Dartle looking eagerly <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> above <b>the</b> chimney-piece.|$|R
6000|$|... "There she is," [...] he said, [...] "and you-all {{just watch}} my smoke. There's {{millions}} {{here for the}} man who can see them. And I seen all them millions this afternoon when them seven hundred dollars peeped up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the pan and chirruped, 'Well, if here ain't Burning Daylight come at last.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{laugh at}} me," [...] said he, taking the eldest daughter's hand and {{laughing}} himself. [...] "You think my ambition as nonsensical as if I were to freeze myself {{to death on}} the top of Mount Washington only that people might spy <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> country roundabout. And truly that would be a noble pedestal for a man's statue." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{never saw}} Grace either {{confused}} or taken by surprise, {{and when she}} explained quietly her father looked down <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top step as he said, [...] "I thank you, sir, but I did not catch the name. May I ask who it is to whom we are so much indebted? Neither do I quite understand yet how we got here before you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At first I was {{uncertain}} about it. But when I came back that way I looked again, and I caught him peeping out <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> one of <b>the</b> bar-room windows. As {{soon as he}} saw me look he dodged out of sight." ...|$|R
60|$|The King looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> angrily, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> court behind rose {{a murmur}} of wonder mingled with wrath, wonder at my marksmanship, and wrath because I had dared to shoot before the King.|$|R
60|$|And as {{the years}} passed under such {{influences}} as had been <b>at</b> work upon <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cradle, influences which had known no check save that brief one afforded by Gino Falcone, I became perforce devout and pious from very inclination.|$|R
