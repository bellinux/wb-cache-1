After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein {{would explain the}} discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} the Clarke Codex of Plato's dialogues at Oxford, Martin Schanz noticed that isolated {{letters in the}} margins of two dialogues formed an alphabetic series and marked every hundredth standard line (alpha = 100, beta = 200, etc.). He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> other manuscripts had similar marginal markings. His 1881 article named this kind of line-counting 'partial stichometry' and contrasted it to 'total stichometry' studied by Graux.|$|E

5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> this posture was unlikely, {{because the}} long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally {{have to be}} broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes {{many aspects of the}} arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} on plant evolution also progressed during this period; {{he worked on}} the genetics of forage grasses, looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the Poaceae and publishing numerous papers on the subject though the 1940s. He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was able to establish the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the autopolyploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that,</b> in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the first genetic change happened 3.8 {{million years ago}} on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{about the effect of}} climate change on Sub‐Sahara African (SSA) {{agricultural}} production in a post‐colonial setting. While agricultural production certainly {{is the result of a}} multi‐dimensional process (influenced by diverse branches of politics, by technology, and also by trade patters and violent conflicts, among others), already the partial analysis of the most obvious factors of influence is certainly valuable in the African case. Since agriculture is not only the single most important sector for the greatest majority of people there, but also a low‐tech endeavor in Africa, the impact of temperature and particularly rainfall is crucial – to the point of life‐threatening crop failure. In sum, we are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> climate change influenced agricultural production in Sub‐ Sahara Africa in an unfavourable way. When considering traditional and modern inputs (labour, land and livestock, as well as capital and fertilizer, respectively) in a fixed‐effects‐ model, particularly the effect of rainfall is significantly positive and important. Further, by separating countries into a low ‐ and a med‐tech group (with respect to modern inputs), different relationships between the standard factors can be revealed, and by refining th...|$|R
