500|$|When Fiasco was 18, {{he began}} {{creating}} {{music as a}} solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where {{he was able to}} find an old mixing board and a record player, stacks of vinyl records, and mic stands. [...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is {{going to come back to}} Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you have to go home and live with what you say." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, game {{designer}} Josh Millard released Ennuigi. Ennuigi adds metafictional commentary to {{the original}} game since it relates the story of Luigi's inability {{to come to terms}} with the lack of narrative. In a Reddit thread, Millard commented [...] "I [...] think it's a pretty weird implied narrative once you step back <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> and enjoyed funneling some thoughts about all that into a recharacterization of Luigi as a guy who's as legitimately confused and distressed by his strange life as you'd expect a person to be once removed from the bubble of cartoony context of the franchise." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....a {{painting}} is done when the artist dies. Previously, I {{felt that a}} painting was done when I have taken {{it as far as}} I could, at that point in time, and signed it. Now, if the {{painting is}} still in my possession and I am not impressed with it, I may rework it. A painting is like a motion picture, always evolving. We hit pause when it looks good to us and then we sign it. But we may come back to it sometime later <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> again with a perspective enhanced by experience and development and say, “this painting needs more work.” ...|$|E
60|$|Bradley Headstone <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{his finger}} again, {{took it out}} of the {{buttonhole}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> closer, bit the side of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> again.|$|R
60|$|He {{cocked his}} head, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{with his right}} eye. Then he hopped round to the other side, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with his left eye. With either optic it seemed equally desirable.|$|R
60|$|I drew <b>it</b> out, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> It was six o'clock; we {{had entered}} the cave at eleven.|$|R
2500|$|Pico {{spent several}} months in Perugia and nearby Fratta, {{recovering}} from his injuries. It was there, as he wrote to Ficino, that [...] "divine Providence ... caused certain books to fall into my hands. They are Chaldean books ... of Esdras, of Zoroaster and of Melchior, oracles of the magi, which contain a brief and dry interpretation of Chaldean philosophy, but full of mystery." [...] It was also in Perugia that Pico {{was introduced to the}} mystical Hebrew Kabbalah, which fascinated him, as did the late classical Hermetic writers, such as Hermes Trismegistus. The Kabbalah and Hermetica were thought in Pico's time to be as ancient as the Old Testament, and for that reason, he accorded them an almost scriptural status. It was always Pico's intention to walk completely around a topic <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from many possible angles, in order to derive the truest possible vision of the thing itself. Syncretism, for Pico, was seeing the same absolute from many different points of view, a Scholastic approach with a strong modern resonance.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Dolloby--Dolloby was {{the name}} over the shop door, at least--took the waistcoat, stood his pipe on its head, against the door-post, went into the shop, {{followed}} by me, snuffed the two candles with his fingers, spread the waistcoat on the counter, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> there, held it up against the light, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> there, <b>and</b> ultimately said: ...|$|R

6000|$|Once more {{he spread}} his black wings and flew down to the egg.

60|$|Mr. Waddington rose {{slowly to}} his feet. He lit a cigarette, sniffed <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> disparagingly. It was very fine Turkish tobacco {{and one of}} Burton's extravagances.|$|R
