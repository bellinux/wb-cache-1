She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues.

Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of <b>attraction</b> <b>to</b> Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
