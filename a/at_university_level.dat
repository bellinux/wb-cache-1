Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, {{as there is a}} principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E

Lyle played in both Irish games of the 1885 tournament, away loses to England and Scotland. The Scotland game was originally played in Ireland, but weather conditions forced the match to be abandoned after 20 minutes. Lyle played in both the original game and the replay, which sometimes incorrectly causes Lyle to be credited with six international caps. Despite a poor record the previous season, Lyle was reselected for the 1886 tournament, playing in a single game, a one-try loss to England.|$|E

Previously, there were no facilities in Gibraltar for full-time higher education, and consequently, all Gibraltarian students studied elsewhere at degree level or its equivalent and also for certain non-degree courses. The Government of Gibraltar operates a scholarship/grant system to provide funding for students studying in the United Kingdom. All Gibraltarian students used to follow the UK student loans procedure, applying for a loan from the Student Loans Company which was then reimbursed in full by the Government of Gibraltar. In August 2010, this system was replaced by the direct payment by {{the government}} of grants and tuition fees.

2500|$|Sirimavo Bandaranaike, {{the widow}} of Bandaranaike, took office as prime {{minister}} in 1960, and withstood an attempted coup d'état in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic polices, strengthening ties with the Soviet Union and China, while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a Marxist insurrection, which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a republic named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances {{and the use of}} communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s. The policy of standardisation by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment, which was in essence an affirmative action to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education, resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students <b>at</b> <b>university</b> <b>level</b> and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy. The assassination of Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiyappah in 1975 by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) marked a crisis point.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the turn}} of the century, the Oxford team {{included}} the three Nickalls brothers, two of whom went on to represent England. Their contribution <b>at</b> <b>university</b> <b>level</b> saw the Dark Blues romp to a 15–0 victory in 1898. Five years later, an American arrived at Oxford who was to become another 10-goal player and more famous than any of his predecessors – Devereux Milburn. Not content with gaining a rowing Blue and being on the swimming team, Milburn guided the polo team to victory in successive Varsity matches, winning by a margin of 14 goals on both occasions. Even swimming and playing polo against the same university on one day was no problem for him. He soon graduated to international level, playing number four for his country in every match between 1909 and 1927. Universally described as ‘the greatest back there has ever [...] been’, in his prime he had no equal. He was a pivotal member of the mighty ‘Big Four’, the greatest side to play during that era, and one that changed the way the back position is played. Previously, the English regarded the back’s role as similar to a goal-keeper in football, [...] i.e. to stay by the goal and defend. Whereas before, polo was a gentleman’s preoccupation. Milburn made a job of it.|$|E
2500|$|Mustafa Kemal {{promoted}} modern {{teaching methods}} {{at the primary}} education level, and Dewey took a place of honour. Dewey presented a paradigmatic set of recommendations designed for developing societies that are moving towards modernity in his [...] "Report and Recommendation for the Turkish educational system." [...] He was interested in adult education for the goal of forming a skill base in the country. Turkish women were taught not only child care, dress-making and household management, but also skills needed to join the economy outside the home. Turkish education became a state-supervised system, {{which was designed to}} create a skill base for the social and economic progress of the country. His [...] "unified" [...] education program was designed to educate responsible citizens as well as useful and appreciated members of society. Turkish education became an integrative system, aimed to alleviate poverty and used female education to establish gender equality. Atatürk himself put special emphasis on the education of girls and supported coeducation, introducing it <b>at</b> <b>university</b> <b>level</b> in 1923–24 and establishing it as the norm throughout the educational system by 1927. Atatürk's reforms on education made education much more accessible: between 1923 and 1938, the number of students attending primary schools increased by 224% from 342,000 to 765,000, the number of students attending middle schools increased by 12.5 times, from around 6,000 to 74,000 and the number of students attending high schools increased by almost 17 times, from 1,200 to 21,000.|$|E
2500|$|Recently {{appointed}} to the House of Lords, Lindsay participated in producing the influential Foreign Office report University Reform in Germany, which argued that no institution deserved the name of [...] "university" [...] unless it combined teaching and research. Consistent with his democratic ideals of education, Lindsay also warned {{of the dangers of}} training the specialist intellect in the natural sciences and the need to introduce elements of social sciences <b>at</b> <b>university</b> <b>level</b> by broadening the academic agenda. [...] Lindsay believed technological excesses sponsored by the state without a review of the social and political consequences had been a major contributor to Germany's downfall. [...] This was to heavily influence Keele's curriculum. On 13 March 1946, Lindsay wrote to Sir Walter Moberly, chair of the University Grants Committee (UGC), suggesting the creation of a college [...] "on new lines". The committee wanted a university for the 20th century that could overcome the division between arts and sciences, and what Moberly was calling the [...] "evil of departmentalism". [...] The UGC argued that [...] "The tasks of the modern citizen and the study of modern society should be central to the curriculum." [...] North Staffordshire was seen as an ideal site since it [...] "presented many typical problems thrown up by modern industrial conglomerations, such as those posed by technical innovation in the pottery and mining industries." [...] The college could become a [...] "social laboratory" [...] for industries and the local communities they catered for.|$|E
