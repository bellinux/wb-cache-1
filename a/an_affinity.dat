5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his spirited, unusual {{lifestyle}} is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{adapt to}} various {{habitats}}. Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees, and parks. It has <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|E
5|$|The mockingbird's habitat {{varies by}} location, but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation. In the eastern regions, {{suburban}} and urban {{areas such as}} parks, gardens are frequent residential areas. It has <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for shade and nesting. In western regions, desert scrub, chaparral are among its preferred habitats When foraging for food, it prefers short grass. This bird does not nest in densely forested areas, and generally resides in the same habitats year round.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war there were about 35,000 people who had been born in either Germany or Austria-Hungary living in Australia. Due to large-scale German migration in the late 19th century, there were also an inestimable number of people of German origin, many of whom maintained <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for their ancestral roots. Many of these were naturalised Australians, and indeed it is believed that many men of German origin enlisted in the AIF. However, due to concerns about the loyalties of some members of the German and Austrian communities, internment camps were set up where those suspected of unpatriotic acts were sent. In total it is believed that 4,500 people were interned under the provisions of the War Precautions Act, of which 700 were naturalised Australians and 70 Australian-born. Following the end of the war, 6,150 were deported.|$|E
5|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham to a prosperous family. He was {{encouraged}} by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the Royal Academy of Music Bax became fascinated with Ireland and Celtic culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. Later, he developed <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> with Nordic culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for fire, for instance, will be able to breathe fire much sooner than {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese {{ideology}} of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for foreign and exotic people.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Strickland {{garnered}} positive critical {{comment for}} the romantic comedy Fever Pitch, and in 2007, {{she was a}} cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently {{was added to the}} cast of Private Practice. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for her strong female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E
5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir shows <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> {{for using}} {{traditional}} Malay poetic forms {{such as the}} quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E

5|$|In Buah Rindu, {{particularly}} {{its earlier}} poems, Amir shows <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for using traditional Malay poetic forms {{such as the}} quatrain (found in pantun and syair). However, unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, Amir mixes the rhyming patterns; for instance, one quatrain may have a monorhyme (seloka) while the next may have an alternating simple 4-line (pantun) pattern. Lines are generally divided by a clear caesura, {{and in some cases}} even two. The caesura may not always be in the centre of a line; it is at times towards the front, and at times towards the rear.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, {{the substrate}} and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E

Maria initially raised José Julio Sarria on her own, but when this became too difficult she placed him with another couple. Both they and his mother indulged his early interest in wearing girl's clothing. Sarria showed <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for languages, which led to his first serious romance with another man. Sarria tutored Paul Kolish, an Austrian baron who had fled from the Nazis.

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater is {{generally}} {{held to be}} {{the only member of the}} genus, although its plumage suggests <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> with honeyeaters of the genus Melithreptus. It has been classified in that genus by Glen Storr, although others felt it more closely related to wattlebirds (Anthochaera) or miners (Manorina). A 2004 molecular study has resolved it as close to Melithreptus after all. Molecular clock estimates indicate the blue-faced honeyeater diverged from the Melithreptus honeyeaters somewhere between 12.8 and 6.4 million years ago, in the Miocene epoch. It differs from them in its much larger size, brighter plumage, more gregarious nature and larger patch of bare facial skin.|$|E
5|$|Because higher league {{placement}} {{results in}} {{a greater share of}} television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51million, compared to £42.5million at Chelsea, £39.3million at Liverpool, £34million at Arsenal and £27.9million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.|$|E
5|$|Despite the denunciations {{from the}} anarchist {{organizations}} and periodicals around the world, opinion {{began to change}} in 1976, when Sam Dolgoff published his book The Cuban Revolution: A Critical Perspective. As well, in 1979, the MLCE began publishing a new magazine titled Guángara Libertaria, reprinting Alfredo Gómez' article The Cuban Anarchists, or the Bad Conscience of Anarchism. In 1980, the MLCE and Guángara Libertaria supported the mass evacuation of Cubans from Cuba after many Cuban dissidents occupied the Peruvian embassy in Havana. Many of those who left Cuba at this time joined the editorial collective of Guángara. By 1985, the collective had correspondents around the world, including Mexico, Hawaii, Spain, and Venezuela. The magazine reached a press run of 5000 copies in 1987, making it the largest circulation anarchist periodical in the U.S. However, in 1992, the collective ceased publication of GL, though many of its members continued to publish writings. By 2008, the MLCE was structured as <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> group and coordinating network for Cuban anarchists of diverse tendencies.|$|E

5|$|The Morumbi Stadium {{failed to}} provide proof of funding for a R$630million {{renovation}} plan requested by FIFA to secure {{its status as a}} World Cup venue; the stadium was then excluded from the tournament on 16 June 2010. The Local World Cup Committee suggested to use Arena Corinthians instead. FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Journalist Wagner Vilaron from O Estado de S. Paulo deemed the exclusion of the Morumbi Stadium from the World Cup and the subsequent choice of Arena Corinthians as a venue for the event to be politically charged. After receiving several negative responses from FIFA about the renovation project for Morumbi, then-CBF-president Ricardo Teixeira lost patience with São Paulo Futebol Clube officers; he considered that they were delaying the decision by purposely failing to meet the requirements to force the government to spend money on the construction. São Paulo's opposition to Teixeira in the now defunct Clube dos 13 electionwhich was won by ruling-side Fábio Koff, aligned with São Paulo's Juvenal Juvêncioirritated the CBF president.

The level of IL- 6 was already increased at the first day following injury, and after a dip at day 2 or 3 rapidly reached a second maximal value at day 4 or 5. The serum concentrations of AGP and PI reached their maximal values after day 5 and remained {{at a high level}} throughout the total period studied (7 weeks). The concanavalin A reactivities of both acute-phase glycoproteins were found to be elevated only during the first 2 - 2. 5 weeks.

After day 16, the concanavalin <b>A</b> <b>affinity</b> rapidly declined long before a decrease was observed in the serum concentrations of AGP and PI.
