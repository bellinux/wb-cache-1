40|$|A {{filtration}} devise {{was developed}} to assess compressibility of fouling layers in membrane bioreactors. The system consists of a flat sheet membrane with <b>air</b> <b>scouring</b> operated at constant transmembrane pressure to assess the influence of pressure on resistance of fouling layers. By fitting a mathematical model, three model parameters were obtained; a back transport parameter describing the kinetics of fouling layer formation, a specific fouling layer resistance, and a compressibility parameter. This stands out from other on-site filterability tests as model parameters to simulate filtration performance are obtained together with a characterization of compressibility. Tests on membrane bioreactor sludge showed high reproducibility. The methodology's ability to assess compressibility was tested by filtrations of sludges from membrane bioreactors and conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants from three different sites. These proved that membrane bioreactor sludge showed higher compressibility than conventional activated sludge. In addition, detailed information on the underlying mechanisms {{of the difference in}} fouling propensity were obtained, as conventional activated sludge showed slower fouling formation, lower specific resistance and lower compressibility of fouling layers, which is explained by a higher degree of flocculation...|$|E

Another interesting approach is the moving biofilm MBR (BF-MBR) (Leiknes and Odegaard 2007), where the biomass is supported on floating carriers in an aerated chamber and membrane filtration is performed in a separate downstream chamber.

50|$|Backwashing of {{granular}} media filters involves several steps. First, {{the filter}} is taken off {{line and the}} water is drained to a level that is above {{the surface of the}} filter bed. Next, compressed air is pushed up through the filter material causing the filter bed to expand breaking up the compacted filter bed and forcing the accumulated particles into suspension. After the <b>air</b> <b>scour</b> cycle, clean backwash water is forced upwards through the filter bed continuing the filter bed expansion and carrying the particles in suspension into backwash troughs suspended above the filter surface. In some applications, air and water streams are simultaneously pushed upwards through the granular media followed by a rinse water wash. Backwashing continues for a fixed time, or until the turbidity of the backwash water is below an established value. At the end of the backwash cycle, the upward flow of water is terminated and the filter bed settles by gravity into its initial configuration. Water to be filtered is then applied to the filter surface until the filter clogs and the backwash cycle needs to be repeated.|$|R

Osmosis is a natural process that involves less energy consumption than reverse osmosis (RO), and therefore can be applied as a dilution process before low-pressure RO; {{it is expected to}} compete favourably against current advanced water reuse technologies that use microfiltration/ultrafiltration and RO. The focus of this research was to assess the efficiency of different cleaning procedures to remove fouling from the surface of a FO membrane during the operation of a submerged system working in FO-mode (active layer (AL) facing feed solution) intended for secondary wastewater effluent (SWWE) recovery, using seawater as draw solution (DS), which will be diluted and can further be fed to a low-pressure RO unit to produce fresh water. Natural organic matter (NOM) fouling was expected to affect the AL, while for the support layer (SL), transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) were used as indicators of fouling due to their stickiness and propensity to enhance the attachment of other foulants in seawater on the membrane surface. The composition of the NOM fouling layer was determined after proper characterisation with a liquid chromatograph coupled with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), showing biopolymers and protein-like substances as the main constituents. NOM fouling showed high hydraulic reversibility after a 25 % flux decline was observed, up to 89. 5 % when in situ <b>air</b> <b>scouring</b> for 15 min was used as a cleaning technique. Chemical cleaning with a mixture of Alconox, an industrial detergent containing phosphates, and sodium EDTA showed to increase the reversibility (93. 6 %). Osmotic backwash using a 4 % NaCl solution and DI water proved to be ineffective to recover flux due to the salt diffusion phenomena occurring at the AL. Part of the flux that could not be recovered is attributable to TEP fouling on the SL, which forms clusters clearly identifiable with an optical microscope and TEP-specific dyeing/staining of the membrane. Two solutions were tested to clean in place of the SL: a 1 % NaOCl solution and the same detergent solution used to clean the AL. The former agent compromised the integrity of the FO membrane, as proved with flux and conductivity measurements; 94. 5 % of flux was recovered with the latter agent, showing that chemically irreversible fouling for the FO membrane is on the order of 5. 5 %, which might be associated with the adsorption of biopolymers on the AL and some TEP residuals on the SL.

40|$|Drinking water {{production}} with low-pressure hollow-fibre membranes {{is becoming}} increasingly more widespread as replacement for conventional separation technology. Upstream coagulation can mitigate fouling layer formation on membranes and allows removal of colloidal and soluble compounds smaller than the membrane pores. However, integrating membrane systems with coagulation bears the risk of impaired system performance due to unfavourable aggregate characteristics. This is of particular importance when treating humic substances due to their strong dependence on the solution environment. The experimental work in this study aimed at finding optimal coagulation, flocculation, and membrane operating conditions for treating a typically Nordic surface water with high humic content. Commercial aluminium-based coagulants and chitosan were applied in the pre-treatment step. Short, controlled flocculation was achieved by using a pipe, jet-mix, or packed-bed flocculator. An outside-in operated ultrafiltration system based on a polymeric hollow-fibre was used as separation unit. The study showed that optimized coagulation conditions are crucial to successful operation of the membrane unit. For the applied raw water (colour 50 mg Pt/L), a specific aluminium dosage of 3 mg Al/L and a coagulation pH {{in the range of}} 6 – 6. 5 were found optimal with respect to permeate quality, membrane operation, and metal residuals. Coagulant dosages exceeding the optimal dosage and a pH drop increased hydraulically not-reversible fouling significantly. Chitosan neither met the expectations for NOM removal for the investigated raw water nor did its use seem favourable in combination with a polymeric membrane. Controlling floc aggregation can reduce pressure increase rates on the hollowfibre membrane provided that flocculators are designed for low velocity gradients (G< 30 s− 1). The packed-bed flocculator outperformed the other flocculators. However, flocculation times longer than 5 minutes should be applied to avoid rapid backwash pressure increases on the membrane. The membrane system was operated with fluxes in the range of 45 – 75 LMH during filtration and a 1. 5 times higher value during backwashes. Forward filtration without <b>air</b> <b>scouring</b> proved feasible. To improve detachment of fouling layers, vigorous <b>air</b> <b>scouring</b> was used during backwashes. A filtration cycle of 30 – 60 minutes followed by a backwash interval of about 30 seconds gave good results. Increasing coagulant dosage and flux were the two most significant contributors to hydraulically non-reversible fouling. Water recovery only had a minor effect on the pressure development of the membrane. However, the results suggest that efficient sludge removal from the immersion tank is of importance. Operation at lower NOM concentrations left pressure increase rates unchanged, rendering the application potential of the system highest for NOM-rich surface waters. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|While most {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) {{research focuses on}} improving membrane filtration through <b>air</b> <b>scour,</b> backwashing and chemical cleaning to physically counteract fouling, relatively few studies have dealt with fouling prevention, e. g. minimizing the impact of operational settings that negatively impact sludge filterability. To evaluate the importance of those settings, the effects of bioreactor aeration intensity variations on membrane fouling have been studied in a lab-scale MBR setup while simultaneously monitoring {{a unique set of}} key sludge parameters. In particular, this paper focuses on the impact of shear dynamics resulting from fine air bubbles on the activated sludge quality and flocculation state, impacting membrane fouling. When augmenting the fine bubble aeration intensity both the total and irreversible fouling rate increased. Major indications for sludge filterability deterioration were found to be a shift in the particle size distribution (PSD) in the 3 - 300 μm range towards smaller sludge flocs, and increasing concentrations of submicron particles (10 - 1000 nm), soluble microbial products and biopolymers. When lowering the aeration intensity, both the sludge characteristics and fouling either went back to background values or stabilized, respectively indicating a temporary or more permanent effect, with or without time delay. The shift in PSD to smaller flocs and fragments likely increased the total fouling through the formation of a less permeable cake layer, while high concentrations of submicron particles were likely causing increased irreversible fouling through pore blocking. The insights from the performed fouling experiments can be used to optimize system operation with respect to influent dynamics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Rapid sand {{filtration}} {{is an essential}} unit process in the water purification process. It captures and removes coagulated and flocculated material and other suspended matter not removed during the preceding treatment processes. The pores in the filter bed gradually become clogged and the media progressively collects deposit through the continuous use and life of the filter. During normal operations cleaning is initiated by excessive head loss, deterioration in filtrate quality or when the predetermined time for a filter run has elapsed. <b>Air</b> <b>scour,</b> to remove deposit from filter media by vigorous agitation, and wash water, to remove this deposit from the filter bed, are applied. The combined action of air and water should quickly return the media to its original perfectly clean state for the cycle to continue. However, on inspection it is often found that filter sand on purification plants is unacceptably dirty and backwash systems are clearly incapable of cleaning the media to its initial state of cleanliness. It is at times possible to relate the dirty filter media to faulty designs or poor operating procedures, but often {{the reasons for the}} media deterioration remain elusive and the media becomes dirtier the longer it is in use. As there was an almost complete lack of published or agreed upon procedures to measure the cleanliness of filter media, rudimentary methods for measuring filter media cleanliness and backwash efficiency were developed. Thereafter filter media from full-scale treatment plants was analyzed with these methods at regular intervals to establish some benchmarks for these determinants. These methods were also applied during the laboratory and pilot plant phases of the project...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{performance}} of the BiobeadTM version of the Biological Aerated Flooded Filter Process over the last few years. More than twenty of these units have been installed in the U. K. and the operating experience has enabled further development steps to be made, the range of application to be widened and the design methods associated with the technology to be refined. Operating problems have arisen when the design load is less than that found upon commissioning. For the BAFF system because of the short retention times within the media bed it is essential that excess dissolved oxygen is present at all times. Diurnal peaks in load must be allowed for in design. A related problem is that of septic influent. Septicity has a profound influence on the development flora and fauna in any biological system and so it is preferable that septicity is corrected outside of the BAFF system. Similarly intermittent saline intrusion will reduce performance, although to a lesser extent than that found on Activated Sludge processes. The final problem with BAFF's is that of media quality which is exclusively a quality control problem. The major engineering change introduced to the Biobead system is the aeration system which is now a simple sparge tube immersed in the media. This increases the allowable air rates and is particularly helpful in designing for larger than normal diurnal variation. Similarly, the <b>air</b> <b>scour</b> system now used an array of simple drop tubes. The performance of the media has been further improved by the use of charge neutralising additives to the plastic formulation together with broadening the range of source materials able to produce the textured surface finish.

In this study, bench-scale experiments {{were conducted to}} investigate the FO performance for microalgae dewatering {{which is one of}} the technical challenges in algal biofuel production. The filtration performance was assessed by analyzing permeate water flux and algal biomass concentration in the feed solution. Compared to the active layer facing draw solution (AL-DS) orientation (> 45 % flux reduction), active layer facing feed solution (AL-FS) was more efficient ( 90 % water flux recovery after deionized water flushing). In the AL-FS orientation, FO performance strongly depended on the draw solution chemistry with NaCl exhibiting the best results. When Ca 2 +-containing solution was used as draw solution, microalgae responded to the back diffusion of calcium ions by an extensive excretion of carbohydrates, accelerating the formation of algal flocs, thus enhancing the rate and extent of flux decline and reducing the algae dewatering efficiency. However, most of the flux decline was reversible by simple hydraulic flushing without any chemical cleaning reagents and <b>air</b> <b>scouring.</b> In addition, substantial adsorption of algal biomass was observed on feed spacer.

40|$|The use {{of energy}} still remains the main {{component}} of the costs of desalting water. Forward osmosis (FO) can help to reduce the costs of desalination, and extracting water from impaired sources can be beneficial in this regard. Experiments with FO membranes using a secondary wastewater effluent as a feed water and Red Sea water as a draw solution demonstrated that the technology is promising. FO coupled with low pressure reverse osmosis (LPRO) was implemented for indirect desalination. The system consumes only 50 % (~ 1. 5 kWh/m 3) of the energy used for high pressure seawater RO (SWRO) desalination (2. 5 - 4 kWh/m 3), and produces a good quality water extracted from the impaired feed water. Fouling of the FO membranes was not a major issue during long-term experiments over 14 days. After 10 days of continuous FO operation, the initial flux declined by 28 %. Cleaning the FO membranes with <b>air</b> <b>scouring</b> and clean water recovered the initial flux by 98. 8 %. A cost analysis revealed FO per se as viable technology. However, a minimum average FO flux of 10. 5 L/m 2 -h is needed to compete with water reuse using UF-LPRO, and 5. 5 L/m 2 -h is needed to recover and desalinate water at less cost than SWRO. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract: In general, filters develop {{problems}} {{over time}} {{due to the}} routine running of the filter, including backwashing. The difficulties in maintaining filters in good condition, given the eutrophic state of many of our raw waters, the high water temperature and resulting development of difficult-to-remove biofilm, are well known to South African water treatment plant operators. These difficulties are usually related to the deposits accumulated by the filter. The backwashing system, therefore, has to be really good to ensure filter cleanliness in the long run. This paper deals with a fairly simple operational option to significantly improve backwash efficiency at treatment plants where air and water are used consecutively. If <b>air</b> <b>scour</b> continues for more than about a minute, the media compacts, air channels form and the abrasion amongst media grains largely ceases. By interspersing shorter cycles of air and water, rather than using one single cycle, the media is repeatedly fluidised, giving each new burst of air renewed opportunity to effectively abrade the media grains. This concept is not new – at some South African treatment plants the “double” or even “triple” wash had been used for 15 years with reputed success. However, from 2003 to 2005, the Water Research Group at the University of Johannesburg (UJWRG) has systematically investigated this concept at five water treatment plants and in the laboratory, through the testing of both media and backwash water samples, to determine the quantitative benefits of multiple wash cycles. The paper describes the methods used and the typical results obtained. Multiple washing does indeed show great promise for improving backwash efficiency. On the average, a second wash removes about an additional 40 % to 50 % of the solids {{that would have been}} washed out with a single wash. Furthermore, a third and even fourth wash still continues to remove additional dirt from the filter. Multiple washing, therefore, may be used as a useful tool for effective rehabilitation as well as for routine operation...|$|R
40|$|Tertiary {{filtration}} {{of secondary}} wastewater is frequently {{used to improve}} wastewater treatment plant effluent quality. Four experimental filter columns were operated at the Preston, Idaho, Wastewater Treatment Plant {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of granular media, gravity filtration. The Preston plant is a trickling filter secondary treatment plant and services a population of approximately 3600 people. Four filter medium configurations were studied. Multi-media, dual-media, and single-media beds were constructed with the following media configurations: (1) coal-sand-garnet; (2) coal-sand; (3) sand-garnet; and (4) all sand. The filters were operated at two hydraulic loading rates. Effluents from the primary clarifier, trickling filter, and secondary clarifier were filtered to compare the difference in filter operation and performance when filtering different effluents. Wastewater quality parameters used to monitor filter performance were biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) and suspended solids. The quality of filter influend affected the quality of the filter effluent. Typical total BOD 5 and suspended soilds removal efficiencies were 30 percent and 75 percent, respectively. Soluble BOD 5 was not significantly removed by granular filtration. The four filter beds were equally effective in removing suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand. The coal layered filters operated for 22 hours maximum. The longest filter run time for the sand filters was 9 hours. Filtration of the Preston treatment facility effluent did not consistently produce and effluent that would satisfy the 10 mg/l BOD 5 effluent discharge requirement. A survey conducted to review approbal criteria and design standards for wastewater filters employed by state regulatory agencies indicated the following. Most state standards allowed the installation of either gravity flow filters or pressure filters. The majority of state agencies base the allowable hydraulic loading rate on the type and configuration of media employed. The majority of the design standards for wastewater filters permitted the following media types: (1) sand; (2) anthracite; (3) sand and anthracite; (4) sand, anthracite, and garnet or ilmenite. All wastewater filter design standards called for backwast appurtenances complete with <b>air</b> <b>scour</b> or mechanical scour...|$|R
5000|$|Pretreatment is {{important}} {{when working with}} reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes {{due to the nature}} of their spiral-wound design. The material is engineered in such a fashion as to allow only one-way flow through the system. As such, the spiral-wound design does not allow for backpulsing with water or <b>air</b> agitation to <b>scour</b> its surface and remove solids. Since accumulated material cannot be removed from the membrane surface systems, they are highly susceptible to fouling (loss of production capacity). Therefore, pretreatment is a necessity for any reverse osmosis or nanofiltration system. Pretreatment in sea water reverse osmosis systems has four major components: ...|$|R
40|$|The power demanded for the {{application}} of mechanically-imposed shear on an immersed flat sheet (iFS) membrane bioreactor (MBR) has been compared to that of conventional membrane <b>air</b> <b>scouring.</b> Literature correlations based on the Ostwald model were used to define the rheological characteristics of an MBR sludge. The correlation of specific power demand (, in Watts per m 2 membrane area) with shear rate γ in s- 1 was developed from first principles through a consideration of the force balance on the system in the case of mechanically-imposed shear. The corresponding aeration imposed shear correlation was interpreted from literature information. The analysis revealed the energy required to impose a shear mechanically through oscillation (or reciprocation) of the membrane to be between 20 and 70 % less than that demanded for providing the same shear by conventional aeration of the immersed membrane. The energy saving increases with decreasing shear in accordance with a power demand ratio (aeration:mechanical) of 1400 γ- 1. 4 for a specific sludge rheology. Whilst the absolute value is dependent on the sludge rheology, the aeration:mechanical power demand ratio is determined by the difference in the two exponents in the respective correlations between and γ. Consequently, aeration-imparted shear becomes energetically favoured beyond some threshold shear rate value (∼ 180 s- 1, based on the boundary conditions applied in the current study). The outcomes qualitatively corroborate findings from the limited practical measurement of energy demand in MBRs fitted with reciprocating immersed membranes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{microfiltration}} operating conditions on membrane fouling of colloidal particles of kaolin clay. Experiments were conducted with a flat sheet membrane submerged in a suspension prepared from kaolin clay powder of size varying from 0. 1 to 4 mm (Sigma) with a mean particle size 2. 10 mm. The particle size distribution of clay was unimodal and the concentration of kaolin clay {{was similar to the}} biomass concentration in a membrane bioreactor (10 g/L). The effects of scouring and permeate flux rates were studied in terms of the membrane fouling rate. A linear relationship between the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and particle deposition was established for different air flow rates and permeate flow rates. <b>Air</b> <b>scouring</b> was more effective at a low permeate flux. There was only a minor change in the mean particle size of deposited colloidal particles on the membrane at a given flux under varying air flows and at the beginning all had a similar rise in TMP. However, at the later stages as particles accumulated on the membrane surface there was a significant rise in TMP. 15 LMH flux was observed as critical flux beyond which a rise in the permeate flux showed a sharp rise in the TMP which varied with air flow rates and particle deposition. The sharp TMP rise that occurred during the initial few hours of operation indicated that air flow for fouling mitigation strategies should target this period to optimise the membrane process. The study showed that air flow and flux rates are the two major governing factors for particle deposition on the membrane surface...|$|E
40|$|A {{reflection}} of the place cost analysis holds in membrane process technology research and development is provided. The review encompassed two membrane processes and applications: (a) Reverse osmosis (RO) for seawater desalination, and (b) membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology for wastewater treatment. The cost analysis undertaken extended to (i) the determination of operating expenditure (OPEX) trends using simple analytical expressions, (ii) the subsequent estimation of the sensitivity of OPEX to individual system parameters, and (iii) published data on CAPEX for individual full-scale installations or from cost analyses. An appraisal of the peer-reviewed literature through a survey of a leading scientific database was also carried out. This bibliometric analysis was based on authors’ keywords; it aimed to establish the profile of process cost {{for each of the}} two applications when compared with other popular related topics. The OPEX analysis, ostensibly through a consideration of specific energy demand in kWh per m 3 permeate, revealed it to relate primarily to hydrodynamics in the case of RO, and to both membrane fouling and <b>air</b> <b>scouring</b> for MBRs. The bibliometric analysis of research trends revealed a marked difference in emphasis on cost aspects between the two research areas, with the focus on cost specifically being 16 times greater for RO desalination of seawater than MBR treatment of wastewater. MBR research appears to be dominated by fouling and foulant characterisation, making up almost a quarter of all studies, notwithstanding evidence from practitioners that other process parameters are as important in determining MBR process OPEX and operability. This work was made possible by the support of a National Priorities Research Programme (NPRP) grant from the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), grant reference number NPRP 8 - 1115 - 2 - 473...|$|E
50|$|Effects of {{turbulence}} upon radiator performance: {{in considering}} such effects, {{it is necessary}} to bear in mind the importance of the quantity of air flowing through the core, and the fact that at a given speed of flight rather widely different amounts of air flow through different radiators. The comparisons made in this report were based on a given airflow through the core, but speed of flight is the proper basis for comparing ihe general performance characteristics of a radiator. Any form of construction that imparts additional turbulence to the air may be expected to increase the resistance to flow of air and consequently to decrease the flow through the radiator for a given flying speed, {{while at the same time}} increasing the head resistance. If, then, there is to be a gain in general performimce, any device for producing turbulence must, by increasing the amount of cooling surface, or by causing the <b>air</b> to <b>scour</b> the surface more thoroughly, or both, increase the heat transfer enough to overbalance both the decrease in amount of air flow (which tends to decrease the heat transfer), and the increase in head resistance.|$|R
40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs) are a relevant source for organic micropollutants (OMPs) in surface water. Within this PhD thesis, lab-, pilot-, and full-scale filters with different granular activated carbons (GACs) and effluents of WWTPs were operated to investigate the elimination of OMPs (carbamezepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole) using GAC. The proportion of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of three WWTPs of different size and discharge structure was analyzed using liquid chromatography - organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and adsorption analysis according to SONTHEIMER. Rapid small scale column tests (RSSCTs) were carried out to test the suitability of different conventional characteristic numbers such as iodine number, methylene blue titer, Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface to predict breakthrough curves of pilot scale tests. Pilot scale tests were operated to quantify the abrasion of various GAC due to air scour; and GAC-filters in lab- and full-scale were operated {{to determine the effect}} of the total suspended solids (TSSs), the empty bed contact time (EBCT) and the operation in parallel mode on bed volumes. Using LC-OCD and adsorption analysis the study showed that the ratio of the fractions within the DOC of WWTP effluents is constant in first approximation. Knowing that the fractions with high adsorbabillity are most relevant for competitive adsorption with OMPs, WWTP effluents with high DOC concentrations lead to a faster exhaustion of GAC. Conventional characteristic numbers proved to be unsuitable to predict the adsorption capacity of GAC for the removal of OMPs from WWTP effluent. On the contrary, the density of GAC was identified as one possible parameter to describe the adsorption capacity of GAC. The study showed that RSSCTs can predict pilot scale GAC-filters breakthrough curves qualitatively concerning their shape and concerning the order of substances breaking through. The determination when a specific breakthrough criterion was reached (i. e. c/c 0 = 0. 2) was not possible using RSSCTs. Furthermore, higher EBCT proved to be more relevant for the elimination of DOC the lower the quality of the GAC was. <b>Air</b> <b>scour</b> of pilot GAC-filters for 2 min/d (100 m/h) with six different GACs caused abrasion losses between 0. 1 and 1. 5 mass-%/a. These losses are negligible compared to losses during GAC reactivation of typically 10 %. For the DOC and the OMPs carbamezepine and diclofenac no relevant influence of the TSS in the filters influent on their elimination could be found. Duplicating the EBCT (~ 15 to 30 min) resulted in an extension of operating time between 57 and 114 % until the breakthrough criteria was reached. Operating six GAC-filters in parallel mode led to an extension in operating time of 82 % (mean) compared to a single GAC-filter. The elimination of OMPs from WWTP effluents using parallel operated GAC-filters with a sufficient EBCT is advantageous. Whereas the operation of GAC-filters is usually easy, the abrasion of GAC due to backwash is negligible and the reduction of adsorption capacity due to high TSS concentration in the inlet was found to be irrelevant in this study. The selection and the quality control of activated carbon is still a challenge...|$|R

I have witnessed many tremendous thunder-storms among the Alps, and the most glorious effects of light and shadow: but I never happened to be present when any Lake was agitated by those hurricanes which I imagine must often torment them.

The spray, having been hurried aloft till it lost its consistency and whiteness, was driven along the mountain tops like flying showers that vanish in the distance.
