25|$|Angina pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, <b>anginal</b> pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|E

6000|$|Forgive this cold-blooded machinery--for I {{have been}} of late a {{stricken}} man, and still am not on my legs; though judging it a bit urgent to briefly communicate with you on a small practical matter. I have had quite a Devil of a summer, a very bad and damnable July and August, through a renewal of an ailment that I had regarded as a good deal subdued, but that descended upon me in force just after I last saw you and then absolutely raged for many weeks. (I allude to a most deplorable tendency to chronic pectoral, or, more specifically, <b>anginal,</b> pain; which, however, I finally, about a month ago, got {{more or less the}} better of, in a considerably reassuring way.) I was but beginning to profit by this comparative reprieve when I was smitten with a violent attack of the atrocious affection known as [...] "Shingles"--my impression of the nature of which had been vague and inconsiderate, but to the now grim shade of which I take off my hat in the very abjection of respect. It has been a very horrible visitation, but I am getting better; only I am still in bed and have to appeal to you in this graceless mechanical way. My appeal bears on a tiny and trivial circumstance, the fact that I have practically concluded an agreement for a Flat which I saw and liked and seemed to find within my powers before leaving town (No. 21 Carlyle Mansions, Cheyne Walk, S.W.) and which I am looking to for a more convenient and secure basis of regularly wintering in London, for the possibly brief remainder of my days, than any I have for a long time had. I want, in response to a letter just received from the proprietors of the same, to floor that apparently rather benighted and stupid body, who are restless over the question of a [...] "social reference" [...] (in addition to my reference to my Bankers), by a regular knock-down production of the most eminent and exalted tie I can produce; whereby I have given them your distinguished name as that of a voucher for my respectability--as distinguished from my solvency; for which latter I don't hint that you shall, however dimly, engage! So I have it on my conscience, you see, to let you know of the liberty I have thus taken with you; this on the chance of their really applying to you (which some final saving sense of their being rather silly may indeed keep them from doing.) If they do, kindly, very kindly, abound in my sense to the extent of intimating to them that not to know me famed for my respectability is scarcely to be respectable themselves! That is all I am able to trouble you with now. I am as yet a poor thing, more even the doctor's than mine own; but shall come round presently and shall then be able to give you a better account of myself. There is no question of my getting into the Flat in question till some time in January; I don't get possession till Dec. 25th, but this preliminary has had to be settled. Don't be burdened to write; I know your cares are on the eve of beginning again, and how heavy they may presently be. I have only wanted to create for our ironic intelligence the harmless pleasure of letting loose a little, in a roundabout way, upon the platitude of the City and West End Properties Limited, the dread effulgence of their Lordships; the latter being the light and you the transparent lantern that my shaky hand holds up. More, as I say, when that hand is less shaky.

When it's finished--well, when it's finished let some of those sweet young people, the bons amis (yours), come to me for the small change of remark that I gathered from you the other day (you were adorable about it) they have more than once chinked in your ear as from my poor old pocket, and they will see, you will, in what coin I shall have paid them. I too am working with a certain shrunken regularity--when not made to lapse and stumble by circumstances (damnably physical) beyond my control. These circumstances tend to come, on the whole (thanks to a great power of patience in my ancient organism,) rather more within my management than for a good while back; but to live with a bad and chronic <b>anginal</b> demon preying on one's vitals takes a great deal of doing.

It isn't to exploit your compassion--it's only to be able to feel that I am not without your fond understanding: so far as your blooming youth (there's the crack in the fiddle-case!) can fondly understand my so otherwise-conditioned age.... My desire is to stay on here as late into the autumn as may consort with my condition--I dream of sticking on through November even if possible: Cheyne Walk and the black-barged yellow river will be the more agreeable to me when I get back to them. I make out that you will then be in London again--I mean by November, though such a black gulf of time intervenes; and then of course I may look to you to come down to me for a couple of days. It will be the lowest kind of [...] "jinks"--so halting is my pace; yet we shall somehow make it serve. Don't say to me, by the way, à propos of jinks--the [...] "high" [...] kind that you speak of having so wallowed in previous to leaving town--that I ever challenge you as to why you wallow, or splash or plunge, or dizzily and sublimely soar (into the jinks element,) or whatever you may call it: as if I ever remarked on anything but the absolute inevitability of it for you at your age and with your natural curiosities, as it were, and passions. It's good healthy exercise, when it comes but in bouts and brief convulsions, and it's always a kind of thing that it's good, and considerably final, to have done. We must know, as much as possible, in our beautiful art, yours and mine, what we are talking about--and the only way to know is to have lived and loved and cursed and floundered and enjoyed and suffered. I think I don't regret a single [...] "excess" [...] of my responsive youth--I only regret, in my chilled age, certain occasions and possibilities I didn't embrace. Bad doctrine to impart to a young idiot or duffer, but in place for a young friend (pressed to my heart) with a fund of nobler passion, the preserving, the defying, the dedicating, and which always has the last word; the young friend who can dip and shake off and go his straight way again when it's time. But we'll talk of all this--it's absolutely late. Who is D. H. Lawrence, who, you think, would interest me? Send him and his book along--by which I simply mean Inoculate me, at your convenience (don't address me the volume), so far as I can be inoculated.

50|$|Angina in {{the setting}} of AS occurs due to left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy (LVH) that is caused by the constant production of increased pressure required to overcome the pressure gradient caused by the AS. While the muscular layer of the left ventricle thickens, the arteries that supply the muscle do not get significantly longer or bigger, so the muscle may not receive enough blood supply to meet its oxygen requirement. This ischemia may first be evident during exercise when the heart muscle requires increased blood supply to compensate for the increased workload. The individual may complain of <b>anginal</b> chest pain with exertion. At this stage, a cardiac stress test with imaging may be suggestive of ischemia.|$|E

50|$|Symptomatic {{treatment}} of visceral pain relies primarily upon pharmacotherapy. Since visceral pain can result secondary {{to a wide}} variety of causes, with or without associated pathology, a wide variety of pharmacological classes of drugs are used including a variety of analgesics (ex. opiates, NSAIDs, benzodiazepines), antispasmodics (ex. loperamide), antidepressants (ex. TCA, SSRI, SNRI) as well as others (ex. ketamine, clonidine, gabapentin). In addition, pharmacotherapy that targets the underlying cause of the pain can help alleviate symptoms due to lessening visceral nociceptive inputs. For example, the use of nitrates can reduce <b>anginal</b> pain by dilating the coronary arteries and thus reducing the ischemia causing the pain. The use of spasmolytics (antispasmodics) can help alleviate pain from a gastrointestinal obstruction by inhibiting the contraction of the gut. There are issues associated with pharmacotherapy that include side effects (ex. constipation associated with opiate use), chemical dependence or addiction, and inadequate pain relief.|$|E
50|$|Interest in {{a medical}} role for {{inorganic}} nitrite was first aroused because of the spectacular success of organic nitrites and related compounds {{in the treatment of}} angina pectoris. While working with Butter at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in the 1860s, Brunton noted that the pain of angina could be lessened by venesection and wrongly concluded that the pain must be due to elevated blood pressure. As a treatment for angina, the reduction of circulating blood by venesection was inconvenient. Therefore, he decided to try the effect on a patient of inhaling amyl nitrite, a recently synthesized compound and one that his colleague had shown lowered blood pressure in animals. Pain associated with an <b>anginal</b> attack disappeared rapidly, and the effect lasted for several minutes, generally long enough for the patient to recover by resting. For a time, amyl nitrite was the favored treatment for angina, but due to its volatility, it was replaced by chemically related compounds that had the same effect.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} define {{the extent to which}} the {{therapeutic}} efficacy of three single-drug regimens on ambulatory ischemia paralleled efficacy on other clinical manifestations of ischemia, specifically exercise test performance and <b>anginal</b> symptoms. Background. Some studies have shown that the presence and severity of ambulatory ischemia are predictive of <b>anginal</b> symptoms and exercise test performance, whereas other studies have not. Less is known about effects of antianginal treatment and whether response to therapy for one clinical manifestation reflects therapeutic responses for other clinical manifestations. Methods. We studied 50 patients in the Angina and Silent Ischemia Study who had documented coronary disease, an exercise test positive for ischemia, the presence of ambulatory and asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) Holter monitoring and stable <b>anginal</b> symptoms. Patients received maximally tolerated dose of sustained release propranolol (mean 293 mg/day), sustained release diltiazem (mean 350 mg/day), nifedipine (mean 79 mg/day) and placebo, each for 2 -week periods in a double-blind, crossover fashion. Patients' responses to treatment were assessed by 48 -h ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise test (standard Bruce protocol) and diaries of angina. Levels of efficacy for each agent and for each clinical measure were compared using Spearman correlation analysis. Results. With placebo there was no correlation among the frequency of ischemic episodes by ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise time to 1. 0 -mm ST segment depression or frequency of <b>anginal</b> episodes. Furthermore, for a given patient the efficacy of each active medication in reducing ambulatory ischemia was not correlated with response in <b>anginal</b> symptoms or exercise test performance (r = - 0. 21 to 0. 24, p = NS). Within each of these clinical measures, efficacy of one drug was more strongly correlated with efficacy of another drug (r = 0. 64 to 0. 81 for ambulatory ischemia, 0. 48 to 0. 56 for exercise test performance and 0. 16 to 0. 54 for <b>anginal</b> symptoms). Conclusions. Different measures of ischemia, specifically ambulatory ischemia assessed by ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise performance on exercise test and <b>anginal</b> symptoms, are independent.

40|$|AbstractPatients with {{diabetes}} {{are prone to}} silent myocardial infarction and silent exertional ischemia. Although the mechanism is not clear, it may reflect a specific impairment of the sensory innervation of the heart. To test this hypothesis, <b>anginal</b> perceptual threshold was measured in 32 diabetic patients and 36 nondiabetic control patients, {{all of whom had}} typical exertional angina. <b>Anginal</b> perceptual threshold was defined as the time from onset of 0. 1 mV ST depression to the onset of chest pain during treadmill stress electrocardiography. Although ST depression occurred earlier in the diabetic than in the nondiabetic group (111 ± 82 versus 216 ± 162 s, p < 0. 005), the <b>anginal</b> perceptual threshold in the diabetic group was delayed by a mean of 86 s (149 ± 76 versus 63 ± 59 s, p < 0. 001), with 95 % confidence intervals of 53 to 119 s. Autonomic function tests were abnormal in the diabetic group, and in both groups regression analyses (using a third order polynomial) showed marked prolongations of <b>anginal</b> perceptual threshold as the heart rate responses to the Valsalva maneuver decreased to below the normal range (r = 0. 5, p < 0. 001). There was a similar though less pronounced relation between <b>anginal</b> perceptual threshold and the heart rate responses to deep breathing (r = 0. 3, p < 0. 02). These data suggest that prolongation of the <b>anginal</b> perceptual threshold may be caused by autonomic neuropathy involving the sensory innervation of the heart. To test sensory function, median nerve conduction studies were performed in 19 patients (10 diabetic and 9 nondiabetic). These confirmed that sensory function was subclinically impaired in the subgroup {{with diabetes}}, as reflected by increased latency (3. 2 ± 0. 6 versus 2. 5 ± 0. 4 ms, p < 0. 05) and reduced signal amplitude (6. 3 ± 4. 2 versus 9. 1 ± 1. 7 μV, p < 0. 05) and conduction velocity (45. 0 ± 8. 5 versus 55. 2 ± 5. 0 m/s, p < 0. 01) relative to the nondiabetic subgroup. Thus, in patients with diabetes, <b>anginal</b> perceptual threshold is prolonged in association with autonomic and sensory neuropathy. The data suggest that altered perception of myocardial ischemia results from damage to the sensory innervation of the heart, representing a previously unrecognised feature of diabetic neuropathy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{coronary}} vasomotor {{responses to}} selective infusion of graded concentrations (10 − 6 to 10 − 4 M) of acetylcholine {{into the left}} anterior descending artery were assessed by quantitative coronary arteriography in 24 patients with normal coronary arteriograms (12 patients with atypical symptoms and 12 patients with typical <b>anginal</b> pain) and 36 patients with coronary artery disease with different degrees of atherosclerosis of the left anterior descending artery. In the patients with normal coronary arteries and atypical chest pain, acetylcholine induced predominantly a vasodilator response, which was maximal during a 10 − 5 Macetylcholine infusion. In contrast, in patients with coronary artery disease, acetylcholine caused dose-dependent vasoconstriction, which was observed even if the left anterior descending artery itself was smooth. Marked vasoconstriction was also induced in the patients with typical <b>anginal</b> pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries. In nine of these patients, this constrictor response was associated with <b>anginal</b> pain and elertrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia. Intracoronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) relieved the <b>anginal</b> pain and dilated all vessels. These data suggest that 1) patients with normal coronary arteriograms and angina pectoris manifest impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation similar to that observed in patients with overt coronary atherosclerosis; and 2) abnormal coronary vasoconstrictor responses resulting from this impairment {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia and angina in these patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate which characteristics of <b>anginal</b> symptoms or exercise test results could predict the favorable anti-ischemic effect of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol and the calcium antagonist nifedipine in patients with stable angina pectoris. Background. The characteristics of <b>anginal</b> symptoms and the results of exercise testing are considered of great importance for selecting medical treatment in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. However, little information is available on how this first evaluation may be used to select the best pharmacologic approach in individual patients. Methods. In this prospective multicenter study, 280 patients with stable angina pectoris were enrolled in 25 European centers. After baseline evaluation, consisting of an exercise test and a questionnaire investigating patients' <b>anginal</b> symptoms, the patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment for 6 weeks with either metoprolol (Controlled Release, 200 mg once daily) or nifedipine (Retard, 20 mg twice daily) according to a parallel group design. At the end of this period, exercise tests were repeated 1 to 4 after drug intake. Results. Both metoprolol and nifedipine prolonged exercise tolerance over baseline levels; the improvement was greater in the patients receiving metoprolol (p < 0. 05). Multivariate analysis revealed that low exercise tolerance was the only variable associated with a more favorable effect within each treatment group. Metoprolol was more effective than nifedipine in patients with a lower exercise tolerance or with a higher rate-pressure product at rest and at ischemic threshold. None of the characteristics of <b>anginal</b> symptoms or exercise test results predicted a greater efficacy of nifedipine over metoprolol. Conclusions. The results of a baseline exercise test, but not the characteristics of <b>anginal</b> symptoms, may offer useful information for selecting medical treatment in stable angina pectoris...|$|E

Increasing doses of adenosine (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 mg/min) were selectively infused into the right and then into the left coronary artery in 26 patients with stable angina. Results, No patient developed ischemic electrocardiographic changes during either adenosine infusion. Eighteen patients experienced cardiac pain during both infusions. Despite the stimulation of sensory receptors in different myocardial regions, 13 patients experienced cardiac pain in the same body area. Adeno-sine-induced pain was always similar to the <b>anginal</b> pain. By contrast, the remalning five patients experienced adenosine-induced cardiac pain in different body areas. In two of these patients, the distribution of <b>anginal</b> pain was similar to that experienced during one of the two adenosine infusions. In the remaining three patients, the distribution of <b>anginal</b> pain was similar to that experienced during adenosine infusion into the right coronary artery during some <b>anginal</b> episodes and to that experienced during adenosine infusion into the left coronary artery during other episodes. Conclusions. During stimulation by adenosine of sensory receptors in different myocardial regions, the majority of patients experience cardiac pain in the same body area; only a few experience pain in different areas. These differences might be caused by different organizations of the ascending neural pathways to the cortex, Our results suggest that in the same patient different distributions of pain during <b>anginal</b> attacks are probably due to ischemia In different myocardiol regions...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine {{released}} during myocardial ischemia is {{an adequate}} stimulus to stimulate cardiac nociceptors and to cause <b>anginal</b> pain. This conclusion {{is supported by}} hbe following arguments: the similarity of the adenosine-induced pain and angina pectoris with respect to quality, location and irradiation, the attenuation of adenosine-induced pain and of exercise-induced pain by adenosine receptor antagonists and the direct provocation of <b>anginal</b> pain by selective intracoronary infusion of adenosine. Finally, the reduction of adenosine-induced pain and of exercise-induced angina by the selective A 1 adenosine receptor antagonist bamiphylline, suggests that A 1 receptors {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of adenosine-induced pain...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY To {{examine the}} {{possible}} existence of collateral circulation during coronary artery spasm, {{we attempted to}} visualize the transient appearance of collateral vessels that could serve to salvage otherwise jeopardized ischemic areas. In three patients with vasospastic angina, total spastic obstruction of a major coronary artery was associated with transient collateral augmentation, which was supplied by the nonspas-tic artery during <b>anginal</b> period associated with ST-segment depression. These collateral vessels disap-peared when the angina and ST changes resolved after nitroglycerin administration. These {{findings suggest that the}} collateral blood supply could transiently occur through preexisting vessels to perfuse the ischemic area during coronary artery spasm and that such collateral flow could have a role in preventing transmural myocardial ischemia, resulting in a lesser degree of ischemia associated with ST-segment depression. PATIENTS with Prinzmetal's variant <b>anginal</b> who ex-hibit ST-segment elevation during <b>anginal</b> episodes have severe coronary artery spasm. 2 In some cases with angina pectoris with ST-segment depression, such a dynamic coronary narrowing may also play a pivotal role in provoking myocardial ischemia. 4 6 Ex...|$|E
40|$|Diltiazem was {{compared}} to atenolol in a double-blind trial involving 78 patients suffering from coronary heart disease. Following a 2 week control period, patients were randomly allocated to 6 weeks treatment with {{one or the other}} drug. The patients themselves made daily records of <b>anginal</b> attacks, trinitrate requirements, well-being and exercise tolerance. With both drugs there were highly significant reductions in the <b>anginal</b> attack rate and trinitrate requirements, and significant improvement on the other measures. However, there were no significant between drug differences. The incidence of side effects with diltiazem was very low and no patient had to omit treatment for this reason, although three patients did so on atenolol...|$|E
40|$|A case of Prinzmetal {{variant angina}} with {{transient}} {{complete atrioventricular block}} and syncopal episodes following an anteroseptal myocardial infarction is described. The syncopal attacks were not prevented by demand cardiac pacing and were presumably caused by transient severe ischaemia of the left ventricle, with a consequent reduction in cardiac output. The left ventriculogram showed a large anterior dyskinetic area corresponding to the high grade proximal obstruction in the left anterior descending artery demonstrated by coronary angiography. All other coronary vessels appeared free of disease and {{it is suggested that}} the <b>anginal</b> episodes were caused by transient proximal segmental spasm of the right coronary artery. The <b>anginal</b> episodes were successfully prevented by a regimen of two-hourly coronary arterial vasodilator therapy...|$|E
