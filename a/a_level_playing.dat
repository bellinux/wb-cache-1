5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy {{plays a major}} role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense of fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests a sense of fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E

5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was intended}} to stay true to the Dragon Quest formula within the design necessities and limitations of an MMORPG. During an earlier development phase, the UI featured {{a large amount of}} information showing the various player statuses, but seeking to streamline and simplify the game, they removed most of the display. A different gameplay challenge was presented by the move from turn-based to real-time battles, which went against the traditions of the Dragon Quest series. Fujisawa wanted to implement the classic battle system, but was opposed by Horii and other staff members, who successfully pushed for a real-time combat system. Elements of that battle system, such as the ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic, proved extremely challenging for the developers. Speaking about the difference between Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Yoshida said that they needed to preserve the atmosphere of a normal Dragon Quest title despite MMORPGs not being designed for solo playing. It was for this reason that the loaning of player characters as NPC party members was incorporated. During later development, and following the game's release, the main focus was on balancing the various elements, items and weapons so as to create <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field, in addition to keeping the in-game economy balanced. Several features featured in earlier entries, such as the Casino and Coliseum, needed to be kept back for a later time.|$|E

25|$|Many {{developing}} countries are highly dependent on agriculture. The FAO finds that agriculture provides for the livelihood of 70% of the world's poorest people.

In this context, they reiterated their commitment to pursue and implement policies which are inclusive, integrative and equitable. Toward this end, they reaffirmed their stand to carry out negotiations on Doha round of talks, through which the developed countries might eliminate some of their protectionist and trade-distorting practices, thereby providing <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field for the developing countries in the field of international trade.|$|E
25|$|Commentators {{also point}} out that, even if the ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E

25|$|Man Talk, Woman Talk is humorous, as quintessential comedies {{from the}} author can be. He makes use of wry humour to seek <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> ground for {{resolution}} of the biases men and women nurse about one another and which affect mutual co-existence of the two. The scene is a court though devoid of the usual technicalities of court rooms. Instead of legal jargon, there is humour, arguments and counter arguments. What the author arrives at is not to prove which gender is superior but to show the complementary roles of men and women. There {{is a great deal}} of wit in the work and the setting here is the university environment where the youthful contenders are idealistic.|$|E
25|$|The ATLB heard British Eagle's {{applications}}, Caledonian's counter {{applications and}} BOAC's objections in early 1968. Following {{the conclusion of}} the transatlantic scheduled licensing hearings in mid-1968, the ATLB rejected British Eagle's and Caledonian's applications. It felt that the independents generally lacked the financial strength to acquire the then latest widebodied and supersonic transport (SST) aircraft for their proposed services and that these airlines had insufficient economies of scale to enable them to compete with BOAC and the American carriers on <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field. It also felt that it would take the independents too long to make these services profitable. In British Eagle's case, the ATLB was impressed with the airline's well-equipped and competent engineering organisation but questioned its ability to finance the envisaged expansion because it considered the company seriously undercapitalised for its existing operations.|$|E

25|$|England have {{competed in}} twenty-six European Nations Cups, {{the first in}} 1935. In the past the tournament has been axed and revived many times, and it was stopped for six years because of the Second World War. From 1935 to 1949 (minus the war years) England played France and Wales annually, and won the tournament in 1935, 1946, 1947 and 1948. From 1950 to 1956 an Other Nationalities team were added as the fourth team in the {{competition}} (except in 1956 when Wales did not field a team). During those years England won in 1950 and 1954. Since then the tournament has run for some seasons, but never {{for more than five}} years at a time. But from 1970 to 1996 England won it six out of a possible nine times. In 2003 the tournament was revived and England comfortably won, beating her old rivals plus Scotland, Ireland and Russia. England beat the same opponents to win the cup again in 2004. This was the last time England competed to give the competition more of <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field for other teams, however the England Knights competed in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} chance to make a strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky start as a leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% Manufacturer's Sales Tax (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially vague about where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST.|$|E
