25|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered semi-monocoque structure with smooth lines. Incorporated in the fuselage was the cockpit, which {{was covered by}} a built-up plexi-glass canopy, and an integral fin which supported the plywood stressed-skin tailplane just above the fuselage top decking level. The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a rubber-sprung tail skid. For take-off a jettisonable two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off dollies it was important to release the dolly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> to avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage.

The military joined on cue: pro-Shah tank regiments stormed the capital and bombarded the prime minister's official residence, on Roosevelt's cue, according to his book. Mosaddegh managed to flee from the mob that set in to ransack his house, and, the following day, surrendered to General Zahedi, who was meanwhile set up by the CIA with makeshift headquarters at the Officers' Club. Mosaddegh was arrested at the Officers' Club and transferred to a military jail shortly after. On 22 August, the Shah returned from Rome.|$|E
25|$|At {{the siege}} of Samarkand, Spitamenes used Bactrian horse archers in {{effective}} swarming attacks against a relief column sent by Alexander the Great. Bactrian horse archers surrounded various Macedonian phalanxes, staying {{out of range of}} their melee weapons, and fired arrows until they had no more. The archers would then withdraw to a supply point, but another swarm of horse archers would sometimes replace them, and sometimes attack elsewhere. The Bactrians eventually caused the phalanx to break formation, and destroyed it. Alexander recognized his forces could not directly combat horse archers, but that the horse archers needed resupply of provisions, horses, and arrows. Alexander split his forces into five columns and began building fortifications in the areas where the Bactrians had resupplied. Eventually, his anti-swarm tactics worked: cut off from resupply, the Bactrians had to meet the Macedonian phalanx, which were vastly superior in melee. Alexander made it priority to engage guerillas or other light mobile forces. Spitamenes was effective as long as his force were mobile, and he had adequate communications with mounted couriers. Once he was forced into direct battle with heavy forces, he literally lost his head. At the Battle of the Jaxartes River, Alexander once again faced swarming tactics from an army of Scythian horse archers. Alexander sent a unit of heavy cavalry ahead of his main line. As expected, the Scythian horsemen surrounded the detached cavalry. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment,</b> Alexander's cavalry reversed direction and pushed half of the Scythians straight into the main phalanx of Alexander's army, where they were slaughtered. Upon seeing this, the remaining half of the Scythian army retreated from the battle.|$|E
25|$|Golf follows {{traditional}} golf rules: players {{must reach}} the {{hole on the}} green in as few strokes as possible by hitting the ball with a club, while avoiding obstacles including sand traps, water hazards, trees, and deep rough grass. In the screen's top left and right corners, players are shown the wind speed/direction and an aerial layout of the course, respectively. In advance of their turn, players choose aspects of the swing, such as speed, direction, stance, club type, swing power, and the ball impact point. Swing power requires players to stop an indicator <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> on a vertical arrow; the ball impact point requires players to stop a zig-zagging indicator as it moves down and then up a close-up of the ball. If players allow the indicator to move {{all the way up}} the vertical arrow, they will be given another chance to time their shot; if they allow the zig-zagging indicator to reach the top, the game will automatically stop it at the very top. If players hit the top of the ball, it will go further while hitting the bottom of the ball will cause the ball to go further but have a more controlled direction. Hitting the ball on the right or left sides will cause the ball to hook in either direction. The ideal spot is the center of the ball; unlike real golf, players do not need to hit the bottom of the ball when in bunkers or deep rough. Players can also place a grid on a nearby portion of the course to aide with the aim and distance of their shots. Players can choose between five different viewing perspectives, change button configurations, and review the positives and negatives of their last shots.|$|E

25|$|Alarmed by {{previous}} siege, led by General Aguinaldo in Imus, Cavite in September 1896, Governor-General Ramón Blanco y Erenas ordered the 4th Battalion of Cazadores from Spain to aid him in quelling the rebellion in Cavite. On November 3, 1896, the battalion arrived carrying {{a squadron of}} 1,328 men and some 55 officers. Apart from that, Blanco ordered about 144,000 men who recently came from Cuba and Spain to joint in suppressing the rebellion. Prior to the land attacks, Spanish naval raids were conducted {{on the shores of}} Cavite, where cannonballs were bombarded against the revolutionary fortifications in Bacoor, Noveleta, Binakayan and Cavite Viejo. The most fortified locations in Noveleta are the Dalahican and Dagatan shores defended by Magdiwang soldiers under the command of Gen. Santiago Alvarez, while the adjacent fishing village of Binakayan in Kawit was fortified by Magdalo under Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. Spanish naval operations were determined to crush the fortifications in these areas, mainly because the lake around Dalahican was so strategic as it connects to the interior of Cavite. Apart from defending Binakayan, the Magdalo soldiers also kept the lower part of Dagatan up to Cavite's border near Morong province (now Rizal province). On November 9, 1896, Spanish forces laid simultaneous attacks on the two fortified rebel strongholds with many Spaniards losing their lives. At each advancement, more Spanish soldiers were killed, including the officers. Aguinaldo then ordered his soldiers to counterattack <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> with the most number of men available for the engagement, and so they did. Huge numbers of Katipuneros rushed into the fight, swarming into several enemy units until one by one they were destroyed piecemeal. When the surviving Spaniards saw that their pofficers were killed by the defense of Binakayan, they were demoralized with many retreating back to their ships while some of them headed back to Manila, thus, terminating the attack in Binakayan. The Filipinos were in hot pursuit over the enemy, killing stragglers in the process, and it resulted in an utter rout for the Spanish and scattered them apart. The attack on Filipino positions by the Spaniards at Dalahican completely failed, suffering more than 1,000 casualties in the process, and by nightfall on November 11, the battle was over. They tried to retreat back towards Manila {{at the end of the}} battle, but, now cut off from Manila due to Filipino victory at Binakayan, fell back instead to Cavite City. Alvarez's revolutionaries, including those commanded by Aguinaldo who quickly joined the fray after Binakayan as reinforcements, pursued the retreating Spanish and for a while besieged Cavite City, where many Spanish soldiers surrendered to Aguinaldo.|$|E

500|$|The Laboratory {{turned to}} an alternative, albeit more {{technically}} difficult, design, an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In September 1943, mathematician John von Neumann had proposed a design {{in which a}} fissile core would be surrounded by two different high explosives that produced shock waves of different speeds. Alternating the faster- and slower-burning explosives in a carefully calculated configuration would produce a compressive wave upon their simultaneous detonation. This so-called [...] "explosive lens" [...] focused the shock waves inward with enough force to rapidly compress the plutonium core to several times its original density. This reduced {{the size of a}} critical mass, making it supercritical. It also activated a small neutron source {{at the center of the}} core, which assured that the chain reaction began in earnest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment.</b> Such a complicated process required research and experimentation in engineering and hydrodynamics before a practical design could be developed.
