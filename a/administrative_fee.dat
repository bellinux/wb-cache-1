This fee consists of an <b>administrative</b> <b>fee</b> for the university (only in some of the states), a fee for Studentenwerk, which is a statutory student affairs organization, a fee for the university's AStA (Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, students' government) and Studentenschaft (students' union), at many universities a fee for public transportation, and possibly more fees as decided by the university's students' parliament (e.g., for a cooperation with a local theater granting free entry for students). Summed up, the semester fee usually ranges between €150 and €350.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2009, the Searle Civil Justice Institute {{published}} {{an analysis of}} consumer cases in AAA resulting in an award from April to December 2007.

Consumer claimants seeking more than $75,000 paid an average of $1,448 in <b>administrative</b> <b>fees</b> and $1,256 in arbitrator fees.

25|$|The bank offered {{loans to}} income-producing manor owners (about 70–80% of total loans) or {{property}} owners in cities. Long-term loans were paid not in cash, but in mortgage bonds which provided for a fixed annual interest to their holders. Initially, that interest was 6%. Twice a year, the borrowers {{had to pay}} the interest to mortgage bond holders plus 1% <b>administrative</b> <b>fee</b> to the bank. This fee was lowered several times and in 1900s it was 0.25% for manor owners and 0.5% for city residents. The loans were provided for only up to 60% of the appraised value of the mortgaged real estate. The terms of the long-term loans varied over the years. Initially, the loans for manor owners were offered for 43.5, 48.67, or 54.5 years. More terms were added later, the longest being 66.17 years. The loan terms for city residents were shorter: initially up to 27.5 years and later up to 38.33 years. Most borrowers (more than 80% in 1912–1914) opted for the longest possible loans. Short-term loans, for one to three years, were available only for up to 10% of the appraised real estate value.|$|E
500|$|Social Security {{benefits}} would be adjusted for any price changes due to FairTax implementation. [...] The Beacon Hill Institute {{states that it}} would not matter, apart from transition issues, whether prices fall or rise—the relative tax burden and tax rate remains the same. [...] Decreases in production cost would not fully apply to imported products; so according to proponents, it would provide tax advantages for domestic production and increase U.S. competitiveness in global trade (see Border adjustability). [...] To ease the transition, U.S. retailers will receive a tax credit equal to the FairTax on their inventory to allow for quick cost reduction. Retailers would also receive an <b>administrative</b> <b>fee</b> equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs, which amounts to around $5 billion.|$|E
500|$|Proponents {{state the}} FairTax {{would reduce the}} number of tax filers by about 86% (from 100 million to 14 million) and reduce the filing {{complexity}} to a simplified state sales tax form. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), among others, have specifically identified the negative relationship between compliance costs and the number of focal points for collection. Under the FairTax, the federal government would be able to concentrate tax enforcement efforts on a single tax. Retailers would receive an <b>administrative</b> <b>fee</b> equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs. In addition, supporters state that the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses. Economic Census figures for 2002 show that 48.5% of merchandise sales are made by just 688 businesses ("Big-Box" [...] retailers). 85.7% of all retail sales are made by 92,334 businesses, which is 3.6% of American companies.

40|$|Although {{the number}} of mutual funds grew during the 1990 s, much of the growth is {{attributable}} {{to the introduction of}} multiple share class (MS) funds. Proponents argue that the MS structure leads to cost savings, which can be passed onto investors as lower expenses. However, if the structure lowers costs, sponsors are likely to profit from it. Though investors are concerned about the base expense ratio, the sum of <b>administrative</b> and management <b>fees,</b> fund sponsors generate profits from the management fees. As such, they would prefer to increase the management fee if they can simultaneously lower <b>administrative</b> <b>fees.</b> Our results indicate that MS fund investors pay lower <b>administrative</b> <b>fees,</b> but management fees are approximately 7 basis points higher than single-class funds. Overall, base expense ratios are higher than for single-class funds, suggesting fund sponsors capture the cost benefits the MS structure provides. Our results are robust to different model specifications and different estimation techniques. Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R
