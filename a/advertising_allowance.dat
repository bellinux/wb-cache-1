30|$|The {{cooperative}} advertising literature {{can be categorized}} into three groups: static, dynamic and stochastic models. Berger (1972) {{was the first to}} consider static model on {{cooperative advertising}} as discount given by the manufacturer to the retailer as an <b>advertising</b> <b>allowance.</b> Dant and Berger (1996) extended the Berger model to include cooperative advertising decision in franchising systems where demand is uncertain and both channel members differ on their expected sales. Huang et al. (2002) argued that embarking on static examination of cooperative advertising is justified since promotion effects do not last long compared to advertising, and is primarily a driver of short term sales. However, empirical results in Naik et al. (2005), Chintagunta and Vilcassim (1994) and Fruchter and Kalish (1998) suggest that dynamic models are superior in examining cooperative advertising.|$|E

5000|$|The Little Mermaid {{introduced}} a new policy at Disney, called the Retailer Profit Protection Plan. That was primarily designed to put all retailers of Disney product on an equal footing. Retailers violating the policy would be denied co-op <b>advertising</b> <b>allowances</b> from Disney. The first provision was a [...] "minimum advertised price" [...] (MAP). Retailers could never be advertised any price lower than $18.75 inclusive of any rebates and value-added offers. In addition, Disney established a rule regarding the [...] "nationally advertised availability date" [...] (NAAD). Any advertising appearing before the NAAD had to clearly show the NAAD. Along with the NAAD of May 18 went a Warehouse Release Date of May 14, the earliest ship date for distributors and rackjobbers, and a Will Call date of May 16, the last being the first allowable day for sales to the public. This difference between the official advertised date and the first actual date of sale continued for several years on every Disney, Touchstone, Hollywood, and Buena Vista video release.|$|R
25|$|A's success {{attracted}} the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's anti-trust chief, Thurman W. Arnold, who was urged to investigate A by Congressman Patman. In late 1941, following Pearl Harbor, the military placed many large businesses off-limits to the anti-trust division because of defense priorities, leaving grocery stores as an option. The next year, A and its senior executives, including the Hartford brothers, were criminally charged for restraint of trade in Dallas federal court. However, in 1944, prosecutors withdrew the complaint realizing that the Dallas federal judge thought the case was weak. The same day, charges were filed in Danville, Illinois, and were assigned to Federal Judge Walter Lindley. The prosecution complained that A had an unfair competitive advantage because its vertical integration including manufacturing, warehousing, and retailing allowed it to charge lower prices. Prosecutors also complained that A refused to buy from food retailers that insisted on selling through brokers or refused to give A <b>advertising</b> <b>allowances.</b> The judges contended that if unchecked, A would become a monopoly. A countered that its grocery-store share was only about 15%, significantly less than the leaders in other industries. Judge Lindley agreed with the government, fining each defendant $10,000.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} in new product introductions in consumer packaged goods categories, supermarkets are reluctant to accept new products. Therefore, {{it is very important}} for manufacturers to convince retailers of the high-demand potential of their products. We study how a high-demand manufacturer can use <b>advertising,</b> slotting <b>allowances,</b> and wholesale prices to signal its high demand to retailers. Specifically, we examine the relative importance of <b>advertising</b> and slotting <b>allowance</b> in signaling demand. That is, when is it optimal for the manufacturer to use high advertising support, and when is it optimal for it to offer slotting allowance as a signal of its demand? We show that when a high-demand manufacturer is trying to signal its demand to retailers, <b>advertising</b> and slotting <b>allowance</b> are partial substitutes of one another {{in the sense that the}} manufacturer can increase one in order to compensate for a reduction in the other. We find that the high-demand manufacturer's signaling strategy depends on three factors: the retailer's stocking costs, the intensity of retail competition, and the advertising response rate in the given product market. We begin with a model of one manufacturer dealing with one retailer. The manufacturer has private information about the potential demand for its new product. The retailer is uncertain about the likely demand of the new product and is willing to accept the product only if it is convinced that the demand is high. We characterize the high-demand manufacturer's separating equilibrium strategies. We find that the slotting allowance plays an important role in signaling when the retailer's stocking costs are high and the advertising effectiveness is low. On the other hand, the manufacturer does not offer any slotting <b>allowance,</b> and <b>advertising</b> plays a bigger role when the stocking costs are low or the advertising effectiveness is high. We then examine the effects of retail competition on the manufacturer strategy. We find that the slotting allowance plays a more important role when the retail level competition is very intense. The manufacturer may have to offer a positive slotting allowance even in the absence of retailers' demand uncertainty when the retail competition is sufficiently intense. This result shows that the slotting allowance may have an important role to play even in the absence of signaling or screening considerations. Thus, our analysis of competitive setting provides an alternative explanation for slotting allowances. It also offers support to the views of many retailers who believe that slotting allowances can help retailers recover high stocking costs in highly competitive retail markets. In the presence of retailers' demand uncertainty, the manufacturer offers a higher slotting allowance in order to signal its high demand. We also investigate the effect of retailer's uncertainty about the effectiveness of the manufacturer's advertising. We show that if the high-demand manufacturer also has a higher advertising response rate, the manufacturer provides even higher advertising support to alleviate the retailer's advertising-related uncertainty. By increasing the advertising support, the manufacturer credibly tells the retailer; that it would not be optimal for the manufacturer to provide such high advertising support unless it had high enough advertising effectiveness.
