500|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{has been}} outspoken {{in his defense}} of [...] "Jihad", and has claimed that the song has the [...] "coolest angle" [...] on Christ Illusion. [...] "These new songs aren't {{political}} at all," [...] King states, [...] "'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' — it's what's spewing out <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the TV." [...] He further clarified that the band was not attempting to promote the terrorists' perspective of the war, nor their ideological beliefs, although he expected others to assume that Slayer was doing so. They {{did not wish to}} dwell on the topic [...] "because every band on the planet already has" [...] and [...] "came from a certain perspective", so felt they had to present an alternative viewpoint. [...] "We're Slayer, we have to be different" [...] was King's assertion.|$|E
500|$|Singer {{and chief}} lyric writer Gruff Rhys has claimed that Phantom Power is about [...] "broken {{relationships}} and war" [...] with [...] "a positive outlook to the future". As [...] "BBC News 24 addicts" [...] Rhys {{and the band}} absorbed [...] "fucked up war images" [...] from the Iraq War during {{the making of the}} album which affected the way songs were written: [...] "We seem to be living in such a heavy time. We're just absorbing all the words thrown <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the TV and regurgitating them back." [...] Frustration with the George Bush administration and its foreign policy influenced the record with Rhys claiming that he feels qualified to address the subject as United States foreign policy [...] "effectively decides what the foreign policy is in the UK".|$|E
500|$|Araya {{read the}} article during his flight back to Los Angeles. Pre-production for Slayer's ninth studio album Christ Illusion had just begun, and the band was about to {{undertake}} a three-day rehearsal with producer Josh Abraham. Araya left his baggage at the hotel to attend the rehearsals, then returned to re-{{read the article}}. Finding it to be [...] "very profound", he {{woke up in the}} middle of the night and wrote down the lyrics. He said that his treatment of the topic is [...] "sincere", and that he believes it to be [...] "one that the military doesn't want you to know. They sweep it under the rug, but it's a story that needs to be told." [...] The band's guitarist, Kerry King, has said that [...] "these new songs [...] aren't political at all: 'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' — it's what's spewing out <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the TV." ...|$|E

500|$|Dylan biographer Howard Sounes {{described}} [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] as a [...] "grim masterpiece." [...] The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing folk-blues riffs and up {{and down}} chord progressions. Author Sean Wilentz has noted that the song's chord structure is similar to that used by the Everly Brothers' in their hit recording of [...] "Wake Up Little Susie". The lyrics of [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] express Dylan's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture, but unlike those in his earlier protest songs, do not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions. In his book Bob Dylan, Performing Artist, author Paul Williams has suggested that the song addresses [...] "the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> every direction." [...] Williams {{goes on to say that}} the song successfully paints a portrait of an [...] "alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'." [...] As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, comparing it to [...] "Demons", an episode of The X-Files which was broadcast during the same season. Shearman and Pearson found [...] "Walkabout" [...] the better episode of the two, but felt that it became [...] "a curiously passionate affair" [...] after the first act—from the cold open until Black is found by the police. Shearman also noted that Željko Ivanek's guest performance [...] "lacked subtlety", though praised Henriksen for a [...] "bravura performance. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Walkabout" [...] 4 out of 5, describing it as [...] "a fine outing". Gibron felt that the episode [...] "forces us to confront uneasy questions", likening the narrative to [...] "a giant puzzle with the pieces tossed <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> all angles". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated [...] "Walkabout" [...] an A−. Handlen noted that he was pleasantly surprised that the episode did not play on clichéd amnesia tropes as he had expected, and felt that involving Black so heavily in the cold open was a good method of changing the series' usual formula.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{a private}} trough," [...] exclaimed a thin voice, high like a peewit's cry. We started in {{surprise}} {{to see a}} tall, black-bearded man looking <b>at</b> <b>us</b> and away <b>from</b> <b>us</b> nervously, fidgeting uneasily some ten yards off.|$|R
50|$|He arrived <b>at</b> <b>US</b> Montauban <b>from</b> <b>US</b> Dax after a spell at Castres Olympique and a first {{professional}} contract at Section Paloise.

60|$|The hours passed slowly. The sun baked us; {{the stones}} were {{too hot to}} touch; flies buzzed behind our ears; tarantulas peeped <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> holes. The {{afternoon}} slowly waned.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] My large {{neighbour}} {{left his}} mouth open for a few moments. And then another sort of smile came on to his face. He began to peep <b>at</b> <b>us</b> sideways <b>from</b> his brown eyes, brightly, and was henceforth itching to get into conversation with {{the citizens of the}} world's mistress-city. His look of semi-impudence was quite gone, replaced by a look of ingratiating admiration.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{should like}} to have a word with you presently, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," [...] said he. [...] "Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my constables are at the door, and there is a four-wheeler waiting." [...] The wretched young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance <b>at</b> <b>us</b> walked <b>from</b> the room. The {{officers}} conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade remained.|$|R

6000|$|... "Hi! Hi! Hi!" [...] {{he joined}} his robust yell to mine, {{and for a}} moment we made the canyon bellow. When we stopped for breath the echoes bayed <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the {{opposite}} walls.|$|E

50|$|DuPont {{teamed with}} Louise Brough to win 20 Grand Slam women's doubles titles, which ties Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver {{for the most}} Grand Slam titles ever won by a women's doubles team.

Their 12 titles is an all-time record for a women's doubles team <b>at</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Championships, easily surpassing the four career titles won by the teams of Navratilova and Shriver, Doris Hart and Shirley Fry, and Sarah Palfrey and Alice Marble. DuPont won a total of 13 women's doubles titles <b>at</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Championships, which also is an all-time record, as is her 10 consecutive women's doubles titles <b>at</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Championships <b>from</b> 1941 through 1950.|$|R
