5|$|Barium {{hydroxide}} ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO2 in aqueous solutions <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{for using}} {{spirometry}} among those without symptoms {{in an effort}} to diagnose the condition earlier is of uncertain effect <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> currently not recommended.|$|E

60|$|All entirely bad {{works of}} art may be divided into those which, professing to be imaginative, bear no stamp of imagination, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> false, <b>and</b> those which, professing to be {{representative}} of matter, miss of the representation <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> nugatory.|$|R

5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by catechol-O-methyl transferase, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> {{no longer able to}} act as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme activity or gene regulation.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare human neurodegenerative disease, {{is caused by a}} misfolded version of a protein called alpha-synuclein, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> also classifiable as a prion disease. Several yeast proteins have also been identified as having prionogenic properties.|$|E

5|$|A vastly {{different}} application {{can be seen}} in the study of cognitive flexibility and video games. Examining the trait under the guise of “,” Dutch researchers observed that players of first-person shooter games (e.g. Call of Duty, Battlefield) exhibited greater “mental flexibility” on a series of measures than did non-gamers. The researchers posit that, while video game play may be controversial due to frequently graphic content, harnessing the effect of such games could lead to similar gains in various populations (e.g. the elderly, who face cognitive decline) <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> socially relevant.|$|E
5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> non-renewable. The problem is particularly bad in the sandy shanty towns {{where the majority of}} the population lives. Many people already have to buy water, which is expensive compared with the average wage.|$|E

5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy and, to {{a lesser}} extent, {{radiotherapy}} {{are likely to be}} offered to most people, whether or not surgery is possible. Specialists advise that the management of pancreatic cancer should {{be in the hands of}} a multidisciplinary team including specialists in several aspects of oncology, <b>and</b> <b>is,</b> <b>therefore,</b> best conducted in larger centers.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E

The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, though a non-UEFA competition, is officially recognised as UEFA Cup's precursor, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> also incorporated into this list. The 1979 Intercontinental Cup co-hosted by UEFA and CONMEBOL is also included in this list.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period. This {{is caused by}} the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> more stable.|$|E

5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Fragmentation of {{woodland}} {{can lead}} to local losses of breeding birds, but the species' range is still expanding. It has a large population and huge breeding area, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal power {{requires}} no fuel (except for pumps), <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, capital costs are significant. Drilling accounts for {{over half the}} costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet (extraction and injection wells) in Nevada can support 4.5 megawatts (MW) and costs about $10million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.|$|E
