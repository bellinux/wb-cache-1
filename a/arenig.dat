40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{controversial}} circumstances {{relating to}} the classification of the benign Theileria species from Japan, Australia and Britain, which are frequently referred to as T. sergenti/buffeli/orientalis group parasites, was reviewed. Our recent systematic comparisons suggest a possibility that the Japanese T. sergenti (minor piroplasm in common parlance) might be a new species and the Australian T. buffeli and British T. orientalis might belong to {{one and the same}} species. The necessity for the review of the genus name for these benign Theileria species was also briefly discussed after the morphological studies of their schizogony. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY The taxonomy of parasites of the genus Theileria of domestic animals appeared straightforward to most specialists about 30 years ago.

We therefore investigated the serum level of VEGF in patients with ovarian tumors and explored the potential use of VEGF as a tumor marker for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of human ovarian cancer. The serum VEGF (sVEGF) levels in 120 patients with ovarian carcinoma, 25 patients with benign ovarian tumor and 90 healthy female blood donors were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in this study. We also determined the levels of sVEGF in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer before and after surgery.

40|$|Abstract. Background: There is a {{significant}} positive association of increased ratios of cathepsin B to its endogenous inhibitor stefin (cystatin) A in prostatectomy tumors with pelvic lymph node metastases. Needle biopsy diagnosis of prostate cancer is critical in initial treatment selection. The objective was to characterize cathepsin B and stefin A immunostaining patterns in needle biopsies of histologically similar Gleason pattern 3 + 3 (score 6) foci in relation to pretreatment clinical data. Materials and Methods: Immunostaining of cathepsin B and stefin A of 65 biopsy sections were imaged, quantified and analyzed with Student's t-test (p< 0. 05). Results: Patients had T 1 c to T 3 b clinical stages and pre-surgery total prostate-specific antigen serum levels from 1. 25 to 20. 0 ng/ml.
