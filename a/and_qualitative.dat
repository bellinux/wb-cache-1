5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} the BDI-II have {{demonstrated}} that {{the factor structure of}} the BDI-II changes with population assessed. As such, no unified underlying factor structure is agreed upon. Scoring of the subscale structure is only for research <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> purposes. The subscale scores do not have individual cut-offs for interpretation. The factor structure of the BDI-II is discussed on pages 28–34 of the current BDI-II second edition manual originally published 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

These analyses showed that the samples possess high ash content, hence, appreciablemineral content.

5|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} {{nature of}} the study has resulted in information being gathered on subjects ranging from urban planning to gender studies. By using both quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> analyses, and by including considerable amounts of oral history, it has allowed for a vivid recreation of the society of early urban New Zealand. Several books have resulted from the project, among them Sites of Gender: Women, Men and Modernity, 1890–1939, edited by B. Brookes, A. Cooper, and R. Law (Auckland University Press, 2003) and Class and Occupation: The New Zealand Reality by E. Olssen and M. Hickey (University of Otago Press, 2005).|$|E
25|$|I/O {{psychologists have}} also {{employed}} qualitative methods, which largely involve focus groups, interviews, and case studies. I/O research on organizational culture research has employed ethnographic techniques and participant observation. A qualitative technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's Critical Incident Technique. I/O psychologists sometimes use quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> methods in concert. OHP {{researchers have also}} combined and coordinated quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> methods within a single study.|$|E

25|$|Another {{large-scale}} {{study was}} conducted in Australia, with the 850 rapes reported to the Victoria police between 2000 and 2003 (Heenan & Murray, 2006). Using both quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> methods, the researchers examined 812 cases with sufficient information to make an appropriate determination, and found that 2.1% of these were classified by police as false reports. All of these complainants were then charged or threatened with charges for filing a false police report.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} {{educational}} research (and {{the social sciences}} in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> studies. Quantitative research includes studies that use inferential statistics to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods {{in order to test}} their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.|$|E

The Thai navy was {{inferior to the}} French naval forces, but the Royal Thai Air Force held both a quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> edge over the local Armée de l'Air units. Among the 140 aircraft that composed the air force's first-line strength were 24 Mitsubishi Ki-30 light bombers, nine Mitsubishi Ki-21 medium bombers, 25 Curtiss Hawk 75N pursuit fighter planes, six Martin B-10 medium bombers, and 70 Vought O2U Corsair observation/attacker aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Coagulopathy {{is another}} {{cardinal}} feature of ALF. The liver has {{the central role}} in the synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Hepatocellular necrosis leads to impaired synthesis of many coagulation factors and their inhibitors. The former produces a prolongation in prothrombin time which is widely used to monitor the severity of hepatic injury. There is significant platelet dysfunction (with both quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> platelet defects). Progressive thrombocytopenia with the loss of larger and more active platelets is almost universal. Thrombocytopenia with or without DIC increases risk of intracerebral bleeding.|$|E

25|$|During 1938, the Italian Air Ministry {{launched}} Programme R, {{a comprehensive}} effort targeted towards {{the enactment of}} several improvements, both qualitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative,</b> throughout the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force). At the time, those fighter aircraft under consideration for their potential adoption had either already reached the prototype phase of development (such as the Fiat G.50 and the Macchi C.202) or were within advanced stages of development (like the Aeronautica Umbra Trojani AUT.18 and the Caproni Vizzola F.5). However, only one aircraft, designated as the Re.2000 by Italian aircraft manufacturer Reggiane, was intentionally designed {{with the intention of}} competing for orders under Programme R in mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the total image was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role. Taken at face value, each of the constituent parts (the fragments or facets) {{are just as important}} as the whole. Yet, the total image, greater than the sum of the parts of which it is composed, now resides in the mind of the beholder. The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter.|$|E
