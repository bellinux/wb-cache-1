I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

The same newspaper article {{made it clear that}} [...] "Ferguson Jnr" [...] was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Ferguson Senior as follows: [...] "They [...] did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense.

2500|$|In a {{subsequent}} teaching, [...] "What has {{happened after the}} 'Strange Fire' Conference" [...] (2013), MacArthur allowed that within the Charismatic movement {{there were those who}} believed in the authority of Scripture, honored the Lord, and pursued Godly living, and that the movement retained enough gospel truth so that souls could be saved within it. However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being [...] "a testimony to the absence of any theology," [...] and charged that [...] "its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement." [...] He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that [...] "In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to Calvary Chapel..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel."

They originally conceived the project as a television series, which they pitched to a number of television producers and studios in Hollywood.

40|$|International audienceFirm {{principles}} {{which can}} be relied on to analyze and discuss textual and graphical code representations are still missing. We propose a framework relying on ScanVis, {{an extension of the}} Semiology of Graphics that models the perception and scanning of abstract graphics, to model and to provide plausible explanations of phenomena pertaining to the visual perception of representations of code. This framework unifies many aspects of the visual layout and appearance of programming languages and reveals similarities and substantial differences in the visual operations required by those notations. We also show how the framework may help compare and generate representations of programming languages with respect to visual perception.

30|$|Cross-national {{studies on}} {{happiness}} have revealed large differences, {{not only is}} average happiness higher in rich nations than in poor ones, {{but there are also}} sizable differences in happiness among rich nations. For instance, the Finns are happier than the French, while GDP per capita is similar in France and Finland. In this paper we discuss whether freedom can explain that difference. The Finns feel more free than the French do. Does this discrepancy in perceived freedom correspond to a difference in actual freedom? Following Bay, we distinguished three kinds of actual freedom: social freedom, potential freedom and psychological freedom. In a comparative analysis of 49 nations we find that actual freedom reflects only partially in perceived freedom <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> of freedom have some independent relation with average happiness. Psychological freedom is most strongly related to happiness in rich nations. The Finns are happier than the French because they dare more to be free.|$|R

We compare these spectrum estimators for the different stacking scenarios, <b>and</b> show <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> of stacking actually decrease the variance of the corresponding spectrum estimators when compared to just taking an average of the observations, and find which stacking is optimal in this sense.
