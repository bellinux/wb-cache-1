5|$|Normal diving {{decompression}} procedures {{range from}} continuous ascent for no-stop dives, where the necessary decompression occurs during the ascent, which is {{kept to a}} controlled rate for this purpose, through staged decompression in open water or in <b>a</b> <b>bell,</b> to decompression from saturation, which generally occurs in a decompression chamber {{that is part of}} a saturation system. Decompression may be accelerated by the use of breathing gases that provide an increased concentration differential of the inert gas components of the breathing mixture by maximizing the acceptable oxygen content.|$|E
