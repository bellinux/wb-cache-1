5|$|<b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request,</b> Rawlinson was {{discharged}} from the RAF as a group captain on 13November 1961, and retired to South Australia. By 2003, {{he was living in}} Naracoorte, where in October he was visited by No.79 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander Peter Campbell, as part of the unit's sixtieth anniversary celebrations. Two of the squadron's Hawk127 fighter trainers later overflew the town in Rawlinson's honour. Rawlinson died in Naracoorte on 27August 2007, aged eighty-nine. He was survived by his wife and two sons, and cremated in a private ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{nickname}} and {{connection to the}} foundry, John McGraw named McGinnity the starter for the Giants' March 23, 1904 exhibition game against the Southern Association's Birmingham Iron Men which was scheduled {{to raise funds for}} the Vulcan statue then being cast for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition that summer in St. Louis, Missouri. <b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request,</b> McGinnity was allowed to visit the downtown foundry and personally pour some of the iron into the moulds for the statue.|$|E

50|$|<b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> special <b>request,</b> he {{was buried}} {{on the side of}} Hangman's Hill, where a gallows was located and only malefactors were interred. The site of his burial was {{subsequently}} deemed suitable for a church, and a chapel to was built in honor of St Michael. Arbogast is commemorated on 21 July.|$|R
60|$|Little Oscar, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> urgent <b>request,</b> {{was allowed}} to {{accompany}} them, and Trueheart, Goodred, and the family baby and nurse, were left in charge of an old Indian whose life had once been saved by Hendrick, and who, although too old {{to go on the}} war-path, was still well able to keep the family in provisions.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{removal from}} command on Guam, Hansell <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request</b> {{received}} a B-29 training assignment on February 15, 1945, {{command of the}} 38th Flying Training Wing at Williams Field, Arizona. In June 1945, he was transferred to Air Transport Command under his old mentor Lieutenant General Harold George, commanding the Caribbean Wing at West Palm Beach, Florida, from September 30, 1945 to January 14, 1946, and the North Atlantic Wing at Westover Field, Massachusetts, from July 1, 1946 to August 18, 1946.|$|E
5|$|Weir {{returned}} to Australia <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request</b> in late 1916 {{at the age}} of 50, and in 1917 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was mentioned in dispatches for his performance at Pozières and Mouquet Farm. He {{went on to become the}} first South Australian Public Service Commissioner. He was given an honorary promotion to brigadier general on his retirement from the Australian Military Forces in 1921. Weir was retired as public service commissioner in 1931. In retirement he contributed to various benevolent and charitable organisations, and died in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{played only}} one more match for the club, {{two weeks after the}} Cup Final. Not risked in their first match in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, against Internazionale on a hard pitch in the San Siro, he played in their next, a 1–0 win against a Zagreb Select XI in Yugoslavia. Following a {{favourable}} specialist's report during the close season, Boyd took part in pre-season training, but his back still troubled him. On 17 August 1956, the day before Birmingham were to open their 1956–57 League campaign, Boyd's contract with the club was terminated <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lieutenant General Thomas A. Wornham died on and his ashes were {{scattered}} <b>at</b> sea on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request.</b> He was {{survived by his}} wife Laura Wornham and his son Thomas V. A. Wornham.|$|R
60|$|Our good partner looks {{younger than}} usual. <b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> earnest <b>request,</b> the {{business}} in Frankfort has been sold; the head-partner first stipulating for the employment of a given number of reputable young women in the office. Removed from associations which are inexpressibly repellent to him, Mr. Keller is building a house, near Mrs. Wagner's pretty cottage, on the hill above the village. Here he proposes to pass {{the rest of his}} days peacefully, with his two married children.|$|R
60|$|This threat had {{the desired}} effect. One by one, {{the men were}} let {{up out of the}} forecastle, and sent into the boat. Cooked meat, bread, rum and water, were {{supplied}} to the English; and, to be ready to meet any accident, we lowered them a compass, and Sennit's quadrant. We did the last <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> earnest <b>request,</b> for he seemed to suspect we intended sending him adrift, as indeed was my plan, at the proper moment.|$|R
5|$|In 1953 the Returned and Services League (RSL), a {{veterans}} organisation, recommended Saunders {{for inclusion}} in the official Australian contingent to the coronation of Elizabeth II; the Federal government rejected the suggestion on the grounds that including Saunders would have meant excluding an officer who had been previously selected. Following his service in the Korean War, Saunders remained in the Army overseeing training for national servicemen at Puckapunyal. Away from active service, however, he soon became dissatisfied and in 1954 was discharged <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request.</b> The same year, he married an Irish nurse, Pat Montgomery; his first marriage had broken down soon after he returned from Korea.|$|E
5|$|General Carpenter {{commanded}} the 1st Division, 3rd Corps at Chickamauga and afterwards {{commanded the}} 3rd Division, 4th Corps at Tampa, Florida. Later, {{he was ordered}} to Cuba to occupy the Providence of Puerto Principe with a force consisting of the 8th Cavalry, 15th Infantry and the 3rd Georgia Volunteers. His were the first troops to take station in Cuba after the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Carpenter was appointed Military Governor of the province and remained in that capacity until June 12, 1899 when he was honorably discharged and reverted to his regular army rank of colonel. Colonel Carpenter was promoted on October 18, 1899, to brigadier general, Regular Army; he then retired the next day, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request,</b> having served honorably for 38 years.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{took part}} in the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, serving with British troops despite his New Zealand roots. He enlisted into 34 Company Army Service Corps on 10 August 1900. Holding the rank of conductor, he {{remained}} with the company until 19 February 1901 when he was transferred <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request</b> to a mounted unit, Rimington's Scouts and Guides. Shortly before Hastings had arrived, Major Frederick Damant had taken over command of the unit and it later became known as Damant's Horse. Working with Major General (later General) Bruce Hamilton's 21st Brigade in Cape Colony to drive out Boer forces led by Christiaan de Wet, Hastings gained the rank of sergeant and was wounded in action twice while serving with the unit. For a six-month period, he was detached from Damant's Horse, serving in Hamilton's field intelligence unit, during which time he commanded a group of native scouts.|$|E
25|$|<b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{previous}} <b>request,</b> Dragging Canoe was succeeded {{as leader}} of the Lower Cherokee by John Watts (Kunokeski), although The Bowl (Diwali) succeeded him as headman of Running Water, along with Bloody Fellow and Doublehead, who continued Dragging Canoe's policy of Indian unity, including an agreement with McGillivray of the Upper Muscogee to build joint blockhouses from which warriors of both tribes could operate at the confluence of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers, at Running Water, and at Muscle Shoals.|$|R
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{above and beyond}} the call of duty in the Southwest Pacific area from October 10, to November 15, 1944. Though assigned to duty as gunnery instructor and neither required nor expected to perform combat duty, Maj. Bong voluntarily and <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> urgent <b>request</b> engaged in repeated combat missions, including unusually hazardous sorties over Balikpapan, Borneo, and in the Leyte area of the Philippines. His aggressiveness and daring resulted in his shooting down 8 enemy airplanes during this period.|$|R
60|$|Admiral Bluewater {{lay in the}} cottage, while Sir Gervaise Oakes {{occupied}} the tent. The former had been transferred {{to the place where}} he was about to breathe <b>his</b> last, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> urgent <b>request,</b> while <b>his</b> friend had refused to be separated from him, so long as life remained. The two flags were still flying at the mast-heads of the Cæsar, a sort of melancholy memorial of the tie that had so long bound their gallant owners in the strong sympathies of an enduring personal and professional friendship.|$|R
5|$|Between the wars, Krueger {{served in}} a number of command and staff positions, and {{attended}} the Naval War College <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request.</b> In 1941, he assumed command of the Third Army, which he led in the Louisiana Maneuvers. He expected, in view of his age, to spend the war at home training troops, but in 1943 he was sent to General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area as commander of the Sixth Army and Alamo Force, which he led in a series of victorious campaigns against the Japanese. As an army commander, Krueger had to grapple with the problems imposed by vast distances, inhospitable terrain, unfavorable climate, and an indefatigable and dangerous enemy. He had to balance MacArthur's need to speed up the tempo of operations in order to win campaigns with the more cautious approach of subordinates who often found themselves confronted by unexpectedly large numbers of Japanese troops. In the Battle of Luzon in 1945, his largest, longest and last battle, he was finally able to maneuver his army as he had in 1941 against a Japanese army under Tomoyuki Yamashita.|$|E
5|$|He was {{released}} by Doncaster <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request</b> on 13 January 2009 and joined Conference Premier club Oxford United the next day on a contract {{until the end of}} the 2008–09 season. He made his debut in a 1–0 victory over Altrincham on 17 January 2009 and scored his first goal four days later with a shot into the top-left corner of the goal, which gave Oxford a 1–0 victory against Mansfield Town. Nelthorpe was named on standby for the England C team, who represent England at non-League level, in February 2009, for a friendly against Malta under-21s. He was sent off against Torquay United after clashing with Mustapha Carayol, which resulted in a three-match suspension, and following this he said he was looking to use his aggression more effectively. He made his return in a 2–1 victory over Kettering Town on 19 March 2009, during which he opened the scoring with a 20-yard free kick and assisted the second goal with a corner kick that was headed in by Chris Willmott. He finished the season with 16 appearances and 2 goals for Oxford.|$|E
5|$|The Ragamuffin menace {{was halted}} when the {{government}} dispatched field marshal (present-day divisional general) Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then Baron, later Duke of Caxias) in 1842. The Baron of Caxias had been the second {{in command of the}} Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion when it put down the mutiny of navy artillerymen in 1831. He and Joaquim Inácio established a close, lifelong friendship. Joaquim Inácio was promoted to frigate captain on 15 March 1844. Soon afterward, Joaquim Inácio was relieved of command, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request,</b> after becoming ever more at odds with his superior. On 2 April 1845, he was assigned command of the frigate Constituição and in October returned to Rio Grande do Sul, which by that time had been pacified. He escorted the Emperor during his tour of the Brazilian southern provinces. PedroII was favorably impressed with the character of the ship's captain. Dark-haired and of average height, Joaquim Inácio was joyful and pleasant. He was also hard-working, intelligent and well-learned. In addition to his native Portuguese, he could also speak and write in Latin, English and French.|$|E
60|$|The {{circumstances}} of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much extenuation. This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and had, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> particular <b>request,</b> been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.|$|R
5000|$|In 1894, he {{returned}} to Galway {{in order to bring}} his step-father to New York. The night prior to departure, he visited Patsy Touhey and Patrick FitzPatrick, who noted his condition was not the best but not alarming. However, he died within a week while en route, and was buried <b>at</b> sea on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 16 May 2007, NME {{published}} an article naming Bombay Bicycle Club [...] "...the hottest band to come from North London for quite some time". Bombay Bicycle Club released their debut EP, The Boy I Used to Be, on 12 February 2007. The band released {{it on their own}} independent record label, Mmm... Records. The EP was produced by Jim Abbiss <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>request,</b> and was recorded and mixed by Ewan Davies at Lincolnshire's Chapel Studios. To support the release of the EP they played a headline show at the Dingwalls in Camden as well as supporting fellow [...] "Road to V" [...] winners The Young Knives across some of their UK Tour. The band also played the Carling Stage at Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2007.|$|R
5|$|The Victorian Imperial Bushmen were {{initially}} based at Marandellas {{in case the}} Boers invaded Southern Rhodesia. In January 1901 they moved to the Cape Colony, where they were attached to a Coldstream Guards force {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Henniker. This sometimes formed part of a larger force under the command of Colonel Herbert Plumer. On 28 February 1901, a 16-man detachment of Victorian Imperial Bushmen under the command of Captain Joseph Dallimore tracked a party of Boers. During the night, Elliott, now a corporal, stole the Boers' 54 horses without waking them. At dawn the bushmen surrounded and attacked the Boer party's encampment, and compelled all 33 of them to surrender. For his part, Elliott was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, the British Empire's second-highest award for gallantry by other ranks after the Victoria Cross, and mentioned in despatches. He was given a British Army commission as a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment on 20 November 1900, but he remained with the Victorian Imperial Bushmen as an attached subaltern. He embarked for Australia on 22 June 1901, reaching Melbourne on 12 July. His British Army commission was cancelled <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request.</b>|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's talents as {{a general}} made {{significant}} contributions to several important Confederate victories, mostly in the Eastern Theater as one of Robert E. Lee's chief subordinates in the Army of Northern Virginia. He performed poorly at Seven Pines, but {{played an important role in}} the success of the Seven Days Battles in the summer of 1862. Longstreet led a devastating counterattack that routed the Union army at Second Bull Run in August. His men held their ground in defensive roles at Antietam and Fredericksburg. Longstreet's most controversial service was at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, where he openly disagreed with General Lee on the tactics to be employed and reluctantly supervised several attacks on Union forces, including the disastrous Pickett's Charge. Afterwards, Longstreet was, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request,</b> sent to the Western Theater to fight under Braxton Bragg, where his troops launched a ferocious assault on the Union lines at Chickamauga, which carried the day. Afterwards, his performance in semiautonomous command during the Knoxville Campaign resulted in a Confederate defeat. Unhappy serving under Bragg, Longstreet and his men were sent back to Lee. He ably commanded troops during the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, where he was seriously wounded by friendly fire. He later returned to the field, serving under Lee in the Siege of Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaign.|$|E
5|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in August 1914, Gellibrand offered his services, and was {{appointed}} to the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as a captain {{on the staff of the}} 1st Division. He landed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, and served in the Gallipoli Campaign until he was wounded on 11 May. He returned to Anzac on 31 May 1915, but put in for a transfer to the staff of the 2nd Division. In December, he was given command of the 12th Infantry Battalion, the 1st Division's Tasmanian battalion, then resting on Lemnos, but did not return to Anzac, which was evacuated in December. On 1 March 1916 he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 6th Infantry Brigade, which he led in the Battle of Pozières and Second Battle of Bullecourt. He was relieved of his command <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request,</b> and posted to the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom. He returned to the Western Front in November 1917 to command of the 12th Infantry Brigade, which he led in the Battle of Dernancourt in April 1918. He was promoted to major general on 1 June 1918, and commanded the 3rd Division in the Battle of Amiens and the Battle of the Hindenburg Line.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} home in 1883, he became {{assistant professor at}} Bucharest University's department of Romanian literature. He still made visits abroad: in 1885, he spent time in Galicia-Lodomeria, researching the Jagiellonian Library for Romanian-related subjects, the Ossoliński archive at Lemberg, and the Dosoftei fund <b>at</b> Schowkwa. Upon <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request,</b> he was also sent to Russian Poland, where he researched the Radziwiłł collection at Nesvizh Castle. He was hosted there by Antoni Radziwiłł, who allowed him to copy some 300 documents, and befriended his young daughter, later the Countess Potocki.|$|R
60|$|This was a half-witted lad, of {{very small}} stature, {{who had a}} kind of charge of the poultry under the old henwife; for in a Scottish family of that day there was a {{wonderful}} substitution of labour. This urchin being sent for from the stubble-field, was hastily muffled in the buff coat, and girded rather to than with the sword of a full-grown man, his little legs plunged into jack-boots, and a steel cap put upon his head, which seemed, from its size, {{as if it had been}} intended to extinguish him. Thus accoutred, he was hoisted, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> earnest <b>request,</b> upon the quietest horse of the party; and, prompted and supported by old Gudyill the butler, as his front file, he passed muster tolerably enough; the sheriff not caring to examine too closely the recruits of so well-affected a person as Lady Margaret Bellenden.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Banks {{told the}} Governor {{that he had}} seen it himself, whereupon M.

'Oh,' said [...] Mr. Banks, 'I can call the commandant, who has just told you that it [...] is true.' M. Wahis then tried to minimize the matter, when, to his [...] great surprise, Mr. Banks added: 'In any case I have, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> [...] <b>request,</b> furnished to the British Consul, who passed through here [...] lately, a signed statement concerning it.' M. Wahis rose from his [...] chair, saying: 'Oh, then, it is all over Europe!' Then for the first [...] time he said that the responsible Commissary must be punished." ...|$|R
5|$|After the war the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved, and Phleps {{returned}} to his homeland, which had become part of Romania under the Treaty of Trianon. He joined the Romanian Army and was appointed as commander of the Saxon National Guard, a militia formed from the German-speaking people of Siebenbürgen. In this role he opposed the Hungarian communist revolutionary government of Béla Kun, which fought Romania in 1919. During a battle at the Tisza river against Kun's forces he disobeyed direct orders and was subsequently court-martialled. The trial concluded that Phleps had saved the Romanian forces through his actions, and {{he was promoted to}} Oberst (colonel). He commanded the 84th Infantry Regiment, then joined the general staff and taught logistics at the War Academy in Bucharest. He attended the V Army Corps staff college in Brașov, and published a book, Logistics: Basics of Organisation and Execution, in 1926 which became the standard work on logistics for the Romanian Army. Ironically, after the book was published, Phleps failed his first general's examination on the topic of logistics. He commanded various Romanian units, including the 1st Brigade of the vânători de munte (mountain troops) and also acted as a military advisor to King Carol II in the 1930s. Phleps reached the rank of General-locotenent (major general) despite his reported disdain for the corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy of the royal court. After criticising government policy and publicly calling King Carol a liar when another general tried to twist his words, he was transferred to the reserves in 1940 and dismissed from the service <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>request</b> in 1941.|$|E

5000|$|Principal {{photography}} {{occurred between}} June 26, 2000 and September 20, 2000 at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney. Location shooting {{took place in}} the Tunisian desert, at the Plaza de España in Seville, London, China, Vancouver, San Diego, and Italy (Villa del Balbianello on Lake Como, and in the former royal Palace of Caserta). <b>At</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>request,</b> Samuel L. Jackson's character Mace Windu received a lightsaber that emitted an amethyst glow, as opposed to traditional blue and green for [...] "good guys" [...] and red for [...] "bad guys". Reshoots were performed in March 2001. During this time, a new action sequence was developed featuring the droid factory after Lucas had decided that the film lacked a quick enough pace in the corresponding time-frame. The sequence's previsualization was rushed, and the live-action footage was shot within four and a half hours. Because of Lucas' method of creating shots through various departments and sources that are sometimes miles and years apart from each other, Attack of the Clones became the first film ever to be produced through what Rick McCallum called [...] "virtual filmmaking".|$|R
60|$|But {{who shall}} ever dare {{to say that}} there is no hope, if he will but give his griefs to the world? That very night Mrs. Spurling had {{received}} a letter from her old school friend, Mrs. Louis Garraweg, with all her fears and her hopes poured out in it, and the whole sad story of their troubles. Swift from the Vicarage went the message to the Hall, and early next morning Mr. Raffles Haw, with a great black carpet-bag in his hand, found means to draw the cashier of the local branch of the Bank of England from his breakfast, and to persuade him to open <b>his</b> doors <b>at</b> unofficial hours. By half-past nine the crowd had already begun to collect around Garraweg's, when a stranger, pale and thin, with a bloated carpet-bag, was shown <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> very pressing <b>request</b> into the bank parlour.|$|R
5000|$|On 19 January 1993, {{after the}} Slovak Republic {{had become a}} {{separate}} state, the National Council of the Slovak Republic enacted a nationality law to establish [...] "the conditions of gain and loss of citizenship" [...] in the newly formed republic.

A citizen of Czechoslovakia as of 31 December 1992, who was not already {{a citizen of the}} Slovak Republic, had one year to apply for Slovak citizenship. Citizenship was also open to those who had lost Czechoslovak citizenship as a result of territorial dissolution {{after the fall of the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under the 1993 law, a citizen could lose Slovak citizenship only <b>at</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>request,</b> after having acquired citizenship in another country.
