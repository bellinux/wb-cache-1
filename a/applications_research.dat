50|$|For example, {{in order}} to meet the {{expectations}} for good color rendering in retail <b>applications,</b> <b>research</b> suggests using the well-established CRI along with another metric called gamut area index (GAI). GAI represents the relative separation of object colors illuminated by a light source; the greater the GAI, the greater the apparent saturation or vividness of the object colors. As a result, light sources which balance both CRI and GAI are generally preferred over ones that have only high CRI or only high GAI.|$|E
