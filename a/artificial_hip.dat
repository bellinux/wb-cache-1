25|$|Godfrey {{had been}} in pain since the 1931 car crash that damaged his hip. In 1953, he {{underwent}} pioneering hip replacement surgery in Boston using an early plastic <b>artificial</b> <b>hip</b> joint. The operation was successful and {{he returned to the}} show to the delight of his vast audience. During his recovery, CBS was so concerned about losing Godfrey's audience that they encouraged him to broadcast live from his Beacon Hill estate (near Leesburg, Virginia), with the signal carried by microwave towers built on the property.|$|E

Visser broke her hip and skidded face-first across the pavement, requiring reconstructive plastic surgery on her face and more than a decade later required an <b>artificial</b> <b>hip</b> replacement. She missed the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Jim Kaat would replace her while she recuperated. Jim Gray also served as a reporter for the All-Star Game and World Series.|$|E
25|$|Gardiner {{had retired}} from the Metro Chairmanship due to his ill health, {{particularly}} arthritis. He underwent surgery for his conditions in 1962. In 1967, he suffered as stroke, which caused slurring of his speech and problems with memory retention. He received an <b>artificial</b> <b>hip</b> in 1971, however the operation was not a success. Gardiner had to use a wheelchair for mobility. After that, Gardiner became less involved in business and had no directorships by 1975. He retired as partner from his law practice, although he kept an honorary title and small office.|$|E

40|$|Data {{from the}} 1988 Medical Device Implant Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey {{are used to}} {{summarize}} information about the prevalence of <b>artificial</b> <b>hips</b> among adults in the United States. The 1988 National Health Interview Survey was a cross-sectional survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized United States population, and included 122, 310 persons in 47, 485 households in a multistage probability sample. The supplement supplied the first population-based estimates of prevalence and morbidity of selected medical devices. Projected to the United States population, the survey results indicate that an estimated 674, 000 adults were using 811, 000 hip implants. Hip implant recipients {{were significantly more likely}} to be older, to be white, and to have lower educational, income, and activity levels than the general population of adults. After age-stratification, however, only differences in activity limitation and race remained. Current economic outlays for hip replacement surgery are substantial. With the aging population, use of health services by patients with <b>artificial</b> <b>hips</b> will probably increase unless measures to reduce the need for replacement surgery are instituted. These measures include reducing injuries and improving biomaterials. Further investigation is needed to examine the activity limitation and racial difference in prevalence found in this study...|$|R

40|$|Biological soft tissues, {{containing}} 50 - 85 % of water, display fascinating mechanical properties: sustainability {{to large}} deformation, extremely low surface sliding friction between cartilages, extraordinarily strong mechanical toughness and shock-absorbance of cartilages and tendons, strong bonding between hard bones and soft tendons, etc. From the view point of material science, soft tissues, consisting of macromolecular components such as fibrous collagen and proteoglycans besides water, are essentially {{a kind of}} soft & wet materials. The excellent properties of soft tissues should be originated from the soft & wet nature of bio-tissues. However, up to date, {{almost all of the}} artificial organs, such as artificial hearts, artificial blood vessels, <b>artificial</b> <b>hips</b> and knees, etc., have been constructed from hard & dry materials, such as metals, ceramics, and plastics. These artificial organs, to some extend, have been successfully served as substitutes of real organs, but are still far from satisfactory. For example, <b>artificial</b> <b>hips</b> and knees made of metals and ceramics, which are hard & dry materials, are lack in the shock-absorbing function and have a high frictional resistance against sliding motion. Another example is the artificial blood vessels. Blood blot occurs in artificial blood vessel made of polymers materials due to the protein adsorption of the blood wall surface. In order to construct artificial organs with an excellent function similar to the real biological one, a material innovation is urgently required: that is, one should find a Figure 1 Composite structure of cartilage...|$|R
50|$|Titanium {{alone is}} a strong, light metal. It is {{stronger}} than common, low-carbon steels, but 45% lighter. It is also twice as strong as weak aluminium alloys but only 60% heavier. Titanium has outstanding corrosion resistance to sea water, and thus is used in propeller shafts, rigging {{and other parts of}} boats that are exposed to sea water. Titanium and its alloys are used in airplanes, missiles and rockets where strength, low weight and resistance to high temperatures are important. Further, since titanium does not react within the human body, it and its alloys are used to create <b>artificial</b> <b>hips,</b> pins for setting bones, and for other biological implants.

40|$|The {{biomaterials}} used in {{the manufacture}} of implanted prosthetic devices profoundly impair the host 2 ̆ 7 s ability to opsonise and phagocytose invading microbes. As a result, while these devices generally provide effective relief from painful, crippling and life-threatening disorders, they can also induce vulnerability to infection in the recipients. The surfaces of the implants are susceptible to colonisation by microbial biofilms. The cells in the biofilm. s are further protected against opsonophagocytosis and are also resistant to antibacterials. Device associated infections thus tend to be refractile to antibiotic therapy and in many cases the device has to be removed before the infection will respond to treatment. Infection rates per implantation operation in totally implanted devices, such as, <b>artificial</b> <b>hips</b> and knees, have fallen over the years to 1 - 2...|$|R

40|$|NASA has {{developed}} software that enables American industry {{to establish the}} reliability and life of ceramic structures {{in a wide variety}} of 21 st Century applications. Designing ceramic components to survive at higher temperatures than the capability of most metals and in severe loading environments involves the disciplines of statistics and fracture mechanics. Successful application of advanced ceramics material properties and the use of a probabilistic brittle material design methodology. The NASA program, known as CARES (Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures), is a comprehensive general purpose design tool that predicts the probability of failure of a ceramic component as a function of its time in service. The latest version of this software, CARESALIFE, is coupled to several commercially available finite element analysis programs (ANSYS, MSC/NASTRAN, ABAQUS, COSMOS/N 4, MARC), resulting in an advanced integrated design tool which is adapted to the computing environment of the user. The NASA-developed CARES software has been successfully used by industrial, government, and academic organizations to design and optimize ceramic components for many demanding applications. Industrial sectors impacted by this program include aerospace, automotive, electronic, medical, and energy applications. Dual-use applications include engine components, graphite and ceramic high temperature valves, TV picture tubes, ceramic bearings, electronic chips, glass building panels, infrared windows, radiant heater tubes, heat exchangers, and <b>artificial</b> <b>hips,</b> knee caps, and teeth...|$|R
40|$|Human implant {{technologies}} {{are subject to}} continual innovation and proliferation, raising important issues for technology testing, healthcare sciences, clinical performance and risk assessment, and regulation. The regulatory environment of medical devices is being shaped by harmonisation of standards in the European Union. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare the histories and current regulatory environment of two technologies, breast implants and <b>artificial</b> <b>hips,</b> and to consider the implications of this comparison for a sociological healthcare research agenda to investigate the issues raised. The main focus is upon developments in the United Kingdom. Major points of contrast between the two technologies include the institutional contexts in which clinical evidence has been marshalled for government attention; the relative importance of strategic alliances between clinicians and manufacturers in the innovation process; the degree of public controversy evident; the varying definitions of an ‘adverse incident’ within medical device vigilance systems; and in the UK the presence of a national register for breast implants but not for hip implants. Inter-national contrasts in these dimensions are noted. The analysis suggests that improved understanding is required of the institutional, organisational and professional processes involved in implant technology innovation and regulation. A comparative research agenda is proposed, focusing upon: innovativeness and proliferation; safety and technological standards; clinical and social outcomes; and consumer/user information and choice. It is concluded that research in these areas will enhance the ‘evidence-base’ for the evaluation of human implant technologies in the context of their innovatory and regulatory environments...|$|R
