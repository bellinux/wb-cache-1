5000|$|In {{straight}} level flight, lift {{is equal}} to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight.</b> In turning flight the lift exceeds the <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight,</b> and {{is equal to}} the <b>weight</b> of the <b>aircraft</b> (mg) divided by the cosine of the angle of bank: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>aircraft</b> gross <b>weight</b> (also {{known as}} the all-up weight (AUW)) is the total <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight</b> at any moment during the flight or ground operation.|$|R
50|$|These newer {{aircraft}} use {{electronic control}} systems to increase {{safety and performance}} while saving <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight.</b> These electronic systems are lighter than the old mechanical systems and can also protect the aircraft from overstress situations, allowing designers to reduce over-engineered components, which further reduces the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R

50|$|Fuel {{jettisoning}} or {{fuel dumping}} {{is an emergency}} procedure used by crews of to reduce an <b>aircraft's</b> <b>weight</b> in an emergency when the aircraft needs to land safely.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{manufacturers}} {{are responsible for}} generating flight performance data which flight planners use to estimate fuel needs for a particular flight. The fuel burn rate is based on specific throttle settings for climbing and cruising. The planner uses the projected weather and <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight</b> as inputs to the flight performance data to estimate the necessary fuel to reach the destination. The fuel burn is usually given as {{the weight of the}} fuel (usually pounds or kilograms) instead of the volume (such as gallons or litres) because <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight</b> is critical.|$|R

50|$|A flight {{planning}} system can then calculate any destination holding {{on the basis}} that the final <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight</b> is zero fuel weight plus alternate holding plus alternate fuel plus alternate reserve.|$|R

50|$|An <b>aircraft's</b> gross <b>weight</b> will {{decrease}} during a flight due to fuel and oil consumption. An <b>aircraft's</b> gross <b>weight</b> may also vary during a flight due to payload dropping or in-flight refuelling.|$|R

5000|$|Reduce <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight.</b> Weight can {{be reduced}} by {{carrying}} only enough fuel to reach the (lower-altitude) destination rather than filling the tanks completely. In some cases, unnecessary equipment can {{be removed from the}} aircraft. However, in many cases, the only practical way to adequately reduce <b>aircraft</b> <b>weight</b> is to depart with a smaller passenger, cargo, or weapons load. Consequently, hot and high conditions at the originating airport may prevent a commercial aircraft from operating with a load large enough to be profitable, or may constrain the firepower that a combat aircraft can bring to bear when conducting a long-range airstrike.|$|R

50|$|The ACN-PCN method only {{deals with}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>weighting</b> {{in excess of}} 5,700 kg (12,566 lb) as the {{airports}} with pavement for smaller size aircraft need only report the maximum allowable mass and the maximum allowable tire pressure if applicable.|$|R
