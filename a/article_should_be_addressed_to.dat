40|$|This {{investigation}} examined whether infants display boundary extensionFa {{tendency to}} remember {{more of a}} visual scene than was presented. Three- to 7 -month-olds were familiarized with {{a photograph of a}} visual scene, and tested with wide-angle versus close-up views of the scene. Infants preferred the close-up, indicating that they perceived the wide angle (the one consistent with boundary extension) as more familiar. Converging experiments showed that: (a) infants did not spontaneously prefer the close-up, (b) adults did not judge the wide angle to be more similar to the familiarization stimulus, and (c) infants spontaneously preferred the close-up when the photographs depicted outline objects without backgrounds. The findings suggest that infants anticipate information that lies beyond the borders of a scene view. This research was supported by NIH Grants HD- 42451, HD- 46526, and MH- 54688.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Social {{categorization}} {{provides a}} valuable mechanism for explaining and predicting human behavior, yet {{also contributes to}} the development of social stereotyping and prejudice. Thus, understanding how social categorization develops is critical for both cognitive and social development. This article presents a theoretical perspective on the development of social categorization— that children map intuitive theories about the structure of the social world onto categories they encounter in their environment. In particular, two intuitive theories—that social categories are natural kinds and that social categories mark people who are obligated to one another—are described as shaping the acquisition of social categories. The article discusses implications for how children explain, predict, and interact with their environment. KEYWORDS—social categorization; folk theories; social cognition From early infancy, children have countless experiences with human behaviors and human variation. Classifying people into categories (e. g., girls, doctors, babies) is a crucial way of organizing these experiences. Social categorization enables children to encode and retrieve information about people efficiently and provides a valuable mechanism for predicting and explaining human action (for review, see Kinzler, Shutts, & Correll, 2010). Yet, social categorization also contributes to a range of negative psychological and social phenomena, including social stereotyping and prejudiced attitudes (Bigler & Liben, 2007; Rutland, Killen, & Abrams, 2010). Thus, social categorization is critical Correspondence concerning this <b>article</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> t...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the health disparities problem that exists among individuals from ethnic minority and low-income backgrounds and their majority coun-terparts. The argument is made that the involvement of counseling psychologists in addressing this health disparities problem presents an opportunity for the field to remain true to its commitment to prevention, multiculturalism, and social justice while becom-ing more competitive in the health care and health promotion fields. This article high-lights the prevalence of health disparities and identifies the primary factors contributing to these disparities. In addition, the roles and approaches that counseling psychologists can adopt to help alleviate this problem are specified. Counseling psychologists have been called on to advance the profession of psychology by using their knowledge of counseling theories, research, and practice to address the pressing challenges of the 21 st century that are facing our nation and nations around the world (Carter, 2003). Among these press-ing challenges is the prevention and reduction of health disparities in the United States. The term health disparities refers to existing differences between specific groups with regard to adverse health conditions, including differences in the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of diseases (National Institutes of Health, 1999). Health disparities have been especially well documented We thank the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for providing funding to support preparation of this article.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{categorize}} objects and events {{has long been}} an object of an intense interest and rigorous research in both humans and nonhuman animals (see Lazareva & Wasserman, 2008; Mareschal, Quinn, & Lea, 2010, for reviews). Until the seminal Herrnstein and Loveland’s study (1964), most of the comparative research used simple and well-defined stimuli (e. g., 1000 -Hz tone or a 450 nm light) as discriminanda. Although easily controllable, such stimuli have little relationship to the tasks faced by animals in their natural environments: After all, discriminating a hawk from a conspecific is unlikely {{to be based on the}} difference in a single wavelength or pure tone. Using more realistic stimuli, Herrnstein and Loveland (1964) demonstrated that pigeons can learn to discriminate color photographs that contain people from photographs that do not contain people, despite considerable variability in these photographs. Even more remarkably, the task did not appear to be difficult for pigeons. Herrnstein and Loveland reported that pigeons “showed some grasp of the concept” (p. 550) within 560 to 800 trials with 80 unique photographs; in other words, these pigeons have only seen each individual photograph 10 times or less. For comparison, successful discrimination of line drawings of circle and square in a go/ no-go procedure can require 473 trials on average, ranging from 280 to 660 trials (Towe, 1954).

40|$|The {{pilot study}} by Cavolli and colleagues 1 {{on the role}} of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in {{preventing}} atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting is definitely interesting. In my opinion, concerns in the current <b>article</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> before any future prospective validation is undertaken. 1. The elective coronary artery bypass grafting patients in the current study had relatively preserved left ventricular systolic functions (mean ejection fractions 60 %). Risk profile analysis over time has shown that, overall, more “sicker ” patients with lower ejection fractions (50 %) are currently being referred for coronary artery bypass grafting. 2 The generalizabilty of the findings in the current study remains to be tested in populations that reflect this real-world trend. These populations may actually have a higher risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation. 2. About a third of patients in SNP and placebo groups were preoperatively on -blockers. The postoperative exposure to -blockers was not documented. Neither was the perioperative exposure to amiodarone, statins, or digoxin documented. In the presence of these molecules that have been shown to have a favorable impact on arrhythmia incidence, 3, 4 the “true ” treatment effect of SNP is difficult to assess. The limitation was not acknowledged in the Discussion and {{raises the question of whether}} SNP has a predominant adjunctive role. 3. What was the frequency of perioperative stroke in the study?

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} witnessing interparental psychological aggression in childhood for daily conflict processes in adult intimate relationships. Both partners in 73 heterosexual couples provided daily diary reports of relationship conflict over a 28 -day period. Partners’ reports of witnessing mother-to-father and father-to-mother psychological aggression were used to predict exposure to daily relationship conflicts and reactivity to those conflicts (as reflected in end-of-day anger). Results showed no evidence of exposure effects: Witnessing interparental psychological aggression was unrelated {{to the number of}} conflict days reported by either partner. Reactivity effects emerged for males only, with father’s aggression predicting increased reactivity and mother’s aggression predicting the opposite. However, we found evidence of direct or unmediated effects of This research {{was supported in part by}} a National Institute of Mental Health grant ROI-MH 60366.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH PRACTICE We break this section into the following four subsections to parallel the organizational framework of the special issues: substantive theory, research design, measurement, and analysis. Also, in this section, we elucidate seven themes. The overarching theme championed by all authors is the importance of sound critical thinking and reasoned argument in designing and conduct-ing empirical research.

40|$|ABSTRACT Individual {{differences}} in personality may be described at three different levels. Level I consists of those broad, decontextualized, and rela-tively nonconditional constructs called "traits, " which provide a dispositional signature for personality description. No {{description of a}} person is adequate without trait attributions, but trait attributions themselves yield little beyond a "psychology ofthe stranger. " At Level II (called "personal concems"), per-sonality descriptions invoke personal strivings, life tasks, defense mechanisms, coping strategies, domain-specific skills and values, and a wide assortment of other motivational, developmental, or strategic constructs that are contextual-ized in time, place, or role. While dispositional traits and personal concerns appear to have near-universal applicability. Level III presents frameworks and constructs that may be uniquely relevant to adulthood only, and perhaps only within modern societies that put a premium on the individuation of the self. Thus, in contemporary Western societies, a full description of personality commonly requires {{a consideration of the}} extent to which a human life ex-presses unity and purpose, which are the hallmarks of identity. Identity in adulthood is an inner story of the self that integrates the reconstmcted past, perceived present, and anticipated future to provide a life with unity, purpose, and meaning. At Level III, psychologists may explore the person's identity as an internalized and evolving life story. Each of the three levels has its own geography and requires its own indigenous nomenclatures, taxonomies, theories, frameworks, and laws. One of the great social rituals in the lives of middle-class American famihes is "the drive home. " The ritual comes in many different forms.

40|$|Identity. The {{pattern of}} intercorrelations between the {{dimensions}} provided sup-portive evidence of its construct validity. To a lesser extent, evidence of predictive validity was also observed. When compared with {{findings from the}} original study using African Americans, two important differences were noted. First, levels of centrality were lower in the current sample suggesting that racial identity is less critical to one’s self-concept among Black Britons than their American counter-parts. Second, centrality and nationalist ideology were negatively associated {{with the amount of}} time spent with Whites in the American sample but were unre-lated to this criterion in the British sample. Attempts to explain these findings ex-plored both methodological and theoretical considerations. Psychological research into ethnicity has traditionally focused on inter-group conflict, and particularly on attitudes of majority toward minority group members, at the expense of ethnic identity (i. e., how members within minority groups relate to each other) (Phinney, 1990). Emerging differences between ethnic groups in terms of educational and occupational achievement led to social movements designed to increase ethnic awareness and pride (Laosa, 1984). In terms of psychological functioning, ethnic identity has evolved as a theoretically pivotal variable, a view attested to by the literary contributions of Malcolm X (1965) and others depicting their struggle for self-understanding (Phinney, 1990).
