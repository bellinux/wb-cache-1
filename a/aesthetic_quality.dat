5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and <b>aesthetic</b> <b>quality.</b> The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>quality</b> of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E
5|$|People visiting {{or living}} in Rome or the cities {{throughout}} the Empire {{would have seen}} art {{in a range of}} styles and media on a daily basis. Public or official art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for its historical significance or as an expression of imperial ideology. At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, mosaics, statues, and interior decoration often of high quality. In the private sphere, objects made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce can show varying degrees of <b>aesthetic</b> <b>quality</b> and artistic skill. A wealthy person might advertise his appreciation of culture through painting, sculpture, and decorative arts at his home—though some efforts strike modern viewers and some ancient connoisseurs as strenuous rather than tasteful. Greek art had a profound influence on the Roman tradition, and some of the most famous examples of Greek statues are known only from Roman Imperial versions and the occasional description in a Greek or Latin literary source.|$|E

40|$|Given {{a dearth}} of {{scholarly}} attention to the relationship of destination <b>aesthetic</b> and restorative <b>qualities,</b> this research investigates the connection between destination <b>aesthetic</b> and restorative <b>qualities.</b> It also explores the interrelationship between restorative and <b>aesthetic</b> <b>qualities</b> in nature-based and urban destinations. Associations between destination <b>aesthetic</b> <b>qualities</b> (Locale Characteristics, Scope, Upkeep, Accord, Perceived Age, and Shape) and restorative qualities (Compatibility, Extent, Mentally Away, Physically Away, Discord, and Fascination) were estimated by canonical correlation analysis. In nature-based destinations, the results illuminate the criticality of experiential characteristics of nature aesthetics to perceived destination restorative qualities and of fascination to destination <b>aesthetic</b> <b>qualities.</b> In urban destinations, findings indicate the importance of experiential characteristics of destinations and compatibility of tourists' needs and predispositions to vacation destination characteristics.

5|$|Recalled for {{the next}} match, against Lancashire at Old Trafford in Manchester, Hamence scored two while batting at No. 7 in the first innings and an unbeaten 49 at No. 6 in the second, putting on an unbeaten century {{partnership}} with Harvey as the match ended in a draw after the entire first day's play was lost to rain. His second innings was praised for the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>quality.</b> It was the first match on tour that Australia had failed to win. Hamence was rested for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was again drawn, before returning against Hampshire.

25|$|The {{definition}} {{and evaluation of}} art has become especially problematic since the 20th century.

With its detailed graphics, fluid animation and high-quality music, Donkey Kong Country rivaled the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>quality</b> of games that were being released on newer 32-bit CD-based consoles.

25|$|Depth {{of field}} {{increases}} with f-number, {{as illustrated in}} the image here. This means that photographs taken with a low f-number (large aperture) will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, {{with the rest of}} the image (nearer and farther elements) out of focus. This is frequently used for nature photography and portraiture because background blur (the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>quality</b> of which is known as 'bokeh') can be aesthetically pleasing and puts the viewer's focus on the main subject in the foreground. The depth of field of an image produced at a given f-number is dependent on other parameters as well, including the focal length, the subject distance, and the format of the film or sensor used to capture the image. Depth of field can be described as depending on just angle of view, subject distance, and entrance pupil diameter (as in von Rohr's method). As a result, smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same f-number for the same distance of focus and same angle of view since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length (wider angle lens) to produce the same angle of view, and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths. Therefore, reduced–depth-of-field effects will require smaller f-numbers when using small-format cameras than when using larger-format cameras.|$|E
500|$|Abraham [...] "Abe" [...] Waddington, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Abram Waddington (4 February 1893– 28 October 1959), {{was a professional}} cricketer for Yorkshire, who played in two Test matches for England, both against Australia in 1920–21. Between 1919 and 1927 Waddington made 255 appearances for Yorkshire, and in all first-class cricket played 266 matches. In these games, he took a total of 852 wickets with his left arm fast-medium bowling. Capable of making the ball swing, Waddington was admired for the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>quality</b> of his bowling action. He was a hostile bowler who sometimes sledged opposing batsmen and questioned umpires' decisions, behaviour which was unusual during his playing days.|$|E

Observing that it {{managed to be}} [...] "horrifying without being a bloodbath (you'll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)", Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing". TV Guide thought it was [...] "intelligent" [...] in its [...] "bloodless depiction of violence", while Anton Bitel felt {{the fact that it}} was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences [...] "a punishing assault on the senses". In Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema, Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence. Mike Emery of The Austin Chronicle praised the film's [...] "subtle touches"—such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas—and said that what made it so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality.|$|E
500|$|The American {{mathematician}} George Birkhoff's 1933 Aesthetic Measure {{proposes a}} quantitative metric of the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>quality</b> of an artwork. It does {{not attempt to}} measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but {{is limited to the}} [...] "elements of order" [...] of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, O, takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, C, counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as O/C. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.|$|E
