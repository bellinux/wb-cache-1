50|$|Amblyseius orientalis is {{a species}} of predatory mite {{belonging}} to the family Phytoseiidae. This oval, greyish <b>white</b> <b>mite</b> is very small; the female is around 380 μm in length and the male is even smaller at around 280 μm. Both sexes are notable for the very long setae {{on the margins of}} the body and on the fourth pair of legs. As with many of these often confusingly similar mites, the shape of the sclerotized body shields is important in identification.|$|R
50|$|Ear mites spread rapidly, {{and can be}} tansmitted {{from even}} brief {{physical}} contact with other animals. In pets, ear mites most commonly affect cats, ferrets, {{and to a lesser}} extent dogs. Humans can rarely be infected with ear mites. Infected animals have a large amount of crumbly dark brown material in their ears. On close inspection, tiny <b>white</b> <b>mites</b> can be seen in the debris. Ear mites do not burrow as some mites do, but live within the ear canal.|$|R

500|$|Brooks {{included}} two nude studies {{in this first}} exhibitiona provocative choice for a woman artist in 1910. In The Red Jacket, a young woman {{stands in front of}} a large folding screen, wearing only a small open jacket, with her hands behind her back. She is so frail, and her downcast face looks so forlorn that one contemporary reviewer referred to her as a consumptive; Brooks described her simply as [...] "a poor girl who was cold". The other, <b>White</b> <b>Azaleas,</b> is a more sexually charged nude study of a woman reclining on a couch. [...] Contemporary reviews compared it to Francisco de Goya's La maja desnuda and Édouard Manet's Olympia. Unlike the women in those paintings, the subject of <b>White</b> <b>Azaleas</b> looks away from the viewer; in the background above her is a series of Japanese prints which Brooks loved.|$|R

50|$|Riccardoella limacum or the <b>white</b> snail <b>mite</b> is {{a member}} of the Acari (mite) family which is {{parasitic}} primarily on snails. Slug mites are very small (less than 0.5 mm in length), white, and can be seen to move very rapidly over the surface of their host, particularly under the shell rim and near the pulmonary aperture. While once thought to be benign mucophages, more recent studies have shown that they actually subsist on the host's blood, and may bore into the host's body to feed.|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} was developed during six {{winter and spring}} seasons in the municipalities of Abreus and Aguada de Pasajeros with the aims to know the preference of Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) and levels of incidence for crops. The data filed were obtained in the Protection Station of Yaguaramas about four the crops in the register of existent areas, stationary fields, journeys of itinerary, reports of seasons and historical territorial registration. It was analyzed the levels of incidence by varieties, sowing times or plantation according to meteorological variables. It was picked up affected crops and frequency of incidence of the mite, percentage of area with presence and level of incidence per crops and season. It is reported the <b>white</b> <b>mite</b> as important pest, with high percent of affected areas in cold and spring season for potato, common bean, cowpea, pepper at fields and greenhouse. This surpassed the Control Economic Threshold in all cultivations sowed or planted; not being this way in common bean that only it happened in two seasons. In February-March, April-May the higher incidences occurred in the fields, without a marked preference for pepper greenhouse. The highest incidences happened to minimum temperature of 18 0 C and 94 % of relative humidity. It don not put on in evidence the preference of the mite for some variety of the crops in study; throwing differences among early, intermediate and late season for pepper greenhouse in spring and for common bean and cowpea...|$|R
