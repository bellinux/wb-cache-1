5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E

The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a muscle. In {{those who have a}} severe penicillin allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended.

5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E
5|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be detected. Other markers of muscle damage, such as aldolase, troponin, carbonic anhydrase type 3 and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), are mainly used in chronic muscle diseases. The transaminases, enzymes abundant in both liver <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue, are also usually increased; this {{can lead to}} the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E

5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E

Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper.

5|$|The {{abundant}} inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The {{most important}} ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerve <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> function, as action potentials in these tissues {{are produced by}} the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E
