5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5|$|The {{observations}} {{made with}} the sundial provided essential confirmation {{of the need to}} reform the Julian calendar. The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have been the source for inspiration.|$|E

5|$|Despite the misgivings of the expedition's commanders, {{the fleet}} left Brest as {{scheduled}} on 15 December 1796, one day {{ahead of a}} message from the Directory calling off the entire operation. De Galles knew that the British would be watching Brest harbour: their frigates were a constant presence as part of the Inshore Squadron of the blockade. In an effort to disguise his force's intentions, he first anchored in Camaret Bay and issued orders for his ships to pass through the Raz de Sein. The Raz was a dangerous narrow channel littered with rocks and sandbanks and subject to heavy surf during bad weather, but would also obscure the size, strength <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French fleet from the British squadron offshore, which French scouts claimed consisted of 30 ships.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Episode I in 2002, the Xenosaga project was reevaluated and staff reshuffled to allow newer staff members a chance to handle the series. Series creator and Monolith Soft co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi stepped down as director, taking on other {{responsibilities}} within the company {{in addition to being}} given wider creative input on projects. Takahashi's explanation was {{that he did not want}} to limit the scope <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Xenosaga series, and that his style of direction as seen for Episode I could result in the development period becoming extended exponentially. During this period the Xenosaga series, originally planned by Takahashi as a six-part series, was rearranged into a trilogy, with the possibility of further episodes should the series meet continued success. The new director was Koh Arai, while Tomohiro Hagiwara became lead producer, both of whom had worked on Episode I in minor roles; Takahashi on an executive role overseeing Episode II, in addition to keeping the staff informed with the lore of Xenosaga.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
