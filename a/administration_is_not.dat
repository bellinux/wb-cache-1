5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Like adult facilities, youth {{detention}} centers {{in some countries}} are experiencing overcrowding due to large increases in incarceration rates of young offenders. Crowding can create extremely dangerous environments in juvenile {{detention centers}} and juvenile correctional facilities. Overcrowding may also lead to the decrease in availability to provide the youth with much needed and promised programs and services while {{they are in the}} facility. Many times the <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> prepared to handle the large number of residents and therefore the facilities can become unstable and create instability in simple logistics.|$|E
25|$|In May 1882, the Provisional Association was {{replaced}} by the newly formed North Borneo Chartered Company with Alcock acting as the first President and Dent becoming the company managing director. The <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> considered as a British acquisition of the territory, but rather simply as a private enterprise with government guidelines to protect the territory from being encroached upon by other European powers. Under Governor Treacher, the company gained more territories on the western coast from the Sultanate of Brunei. The company subsequently acquired further sovereign and territorial rights from the sultan of Brunei, expanding the territory under control to the Putatan river (May 1884), the Padas district (November 1884), the Kawang river (February 1885), the Mantanani Islands (April 1885) and additional minor Padas territories (March 1898).|$|E

25|$|Progesterone for topical <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{approved}} by the FDA in the United States but is available from custom compounding pharmacies and is also notably available over-the-counter without a prescription in this country. It is available from these sources {{in the form of}} creams and gels. Topical progesterone {{has been used as a}} component of menopausal HRT to treat thousands of women in the United States and Europe. However, these products are unregulated and have not been clinically tested, often with little being known about their pharmacokinetics. Moreover, the effectiveness of topical progesterone for systemic therapy, as in menopausal HRT, is controversial. Clinical studies have found only very low levels (<3.5nbsp&ng/mL) of progesterone in circulation with the use of topical progesterone, and these levels are thought to be insufficient to confer endometrial protection from unopposed estrogen.|$|E
25|$|Given the Singapore government's {{focus on}} efficiency, {{the country has}} been said to {{emphasize}} a largely green-light approach towards administrative law. Public <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> seen as a necessary evil but a positive attribute, and the objective of administrative law is not primarily to stop bad administrative practices but to encourage good ones. In this approach, recourse to the judiciary is not the first line of defence against administrative abuses of powers. Instead, it is perceived that control can and should come internally from Parliament and the executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy. In other words, instead of redressing bad government through the courts, good government should be sought through the political process and public avenues. Courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules and principles by which the Singapore government may abide and conform to the rule of law.|$|E
25|$|With {{time as a}} {{critical}} aspect of emergency psychiatry, the rapidity of effect is an important consideration. Pharmacokinetics is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the route of administration, absorption, distribution and metabolism of the medication. A common route of administration is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug {{must be able to}} get to the stomach and stay there. In cases of vomiting and nausea this method of <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an option. Suppositories can, in some situations, be administered instead. Medication can also be administered through intramuscular injection, or through intravenous injection. The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug solubility, gastrointestinal motility and pH. If a medication is administered orally the amount of food in the stomach may also affect the rate of absorption. Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the blood–brain barrier to the brain. With all of these factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly. Antipsychotics, especially Haloperidol, as well as assorted benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.|$|E

60|$|This {{is nothing}} else than a spirit of disconnection, of distrust, and of treachery among public men. It is no {{accidental}} evil, nor has its effect been trusted to the usual frailty of nature; the distemper has been inoculated. The author is sensible of it, and we lament it together. This distemper is alone sufficient to take away considerably from the benefits of our constitution and situation, and perhaps to render their continuance precarious. If these evil dispositions should spread much farther, they must end in our destruction; for nothing can save a people destitute {{of public and private}} faith. However, the author, for the present state of things, has extended the charge by much too widely; as men are but too apt to take the measure of all mankind from their own particular acquaintance. Barren as this age may be in the growth of honor and virtue, the country does not want, at this moment, as strong, and those not a few examples, as were ever known, of an unshaken adherence to principle, and attachment to connection, against every allurement of interest. Those examples are not furnished by the great alone; nor by those, whose activity in public affairs may render it suspected that they make such a character one of the rounds in their ladder of ambition; but by men more quiet, and more in the shade, on whom an unmixed sense of honor alone could operate. Such examples indeed are not furnished in great abundance amongst those who are the subjects of the author's panegyric. He must look for them in another camp. He who complains of the ill effects of a divided and heterogeneous <b>administration,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> justifiable in laboring to render odious {{in the eyes of the}} public those men, whose principles, whose maxims of policy, and whose personal character, can alone administer a remedy to this capital evil of the age: neither is he consistent with himself, in constantly extolling those whom he knows to be the authors of the very mischief of which he complains, and which the whole nation feels so deeply.|$|E

50|$|The French {{presence}} as foreign masters was felt as a harsh restriction. Heavy taxes and conscription were enormous burdens {{that brought the}} country no advantage.

50|$|According to James Obelkevich, Primitive Methodism {{was more}} decentralised and democratic. Julia Werner concurs that the {{movement}} was decentralised.

60|$|The proper duty of a {{representative}} assembly {{in regard to}} matters of <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to decide them by its own vote, but to take care that the persons who have to decide them shall be the proper persons. Even this they can not advantageously do by nominating the individuals. There is no act which more imperatively requires to be performed under {{a strong sense of}} individual responsibility than the nomination to employments. The experience of every person conversant with public affairs bears out the assertion that there is scarcely any act respecting which the conscience of an average man is less sensitive; scarcely any case in which less consideration is paid to qualifications, partly because men do not know, and partly because they do not care for, the difference in qualifications between one person and another. When a minister makes what is meant to be an honest appointment, that is, when he does not actually job it for his personal connections or his party, an ignorant person might suppose that he would try to give it to the person best qualified. No such thing. An ordinary minister thinks himself a miracle of virtue if he gives it to a person of merit, or who has a claim on the public on any account, though the claim or the merit may be of the most opposite description to that required. Il fallait un calculateur, ce fut un danseur qui l'obtint, is hardly more of a caricature than in the days of Figaro; and the minister doubtless thinks himself not only blameless, but meritorious, if the man dances well. Besides, the qualifications which fit special individuals for special duties can only be recognized by those who know the individuals, or who make it their business to examine and judge of persons from what they have done, or from the evidence of those who {{are in a position to}} judge. When these conscientious obligations are so little regarded by great public officers who can be made responsible for their appointments, how must it be with assemblies who can not? Even now, the worst appointments are those which are made for the sake of gaining support or disarming opposition in the representative body; what might we expect if they were made by the body itself? Numerous bodies never regard special qualifications at all. Unless a man is fit for the gallows, he is thought to be about as fit as other people for almost any thing for which he can offer himself as a candidate. When appointments made by a public body are not decided, as they almost always are, by party connection or private jobbing, a man is appointed either because he has a reputation, often quite undeserved, for general ability, or oftener for no better reason than that he is personally popular.|$|E
