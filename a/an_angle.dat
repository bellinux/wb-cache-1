5|$|The first {{featured}} bout was {{a standard}} match between Kurt Angle and John Cena. Angle began bleeding internally after Cena performed a DDT {{on the ring}} apron on him. Later in the match, Cena attempted a FU but Angle reversed it into an unsuccessful cover attempt. Following that, Angle attempted <b>an</b> <b>Angle</b> Slam but Cena countered the maneuver. Cena later gave Angle an FU for a near fall and Angle gave Cena <b>an</b> <b>Angle</b> Slam for a near fall. Angle then countered Cena and applied an ankle lock, which led to Cena submitting.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{existing}} feuds were settled following the event. Notably, Batista was drafted to the SmackDown! brand, thus ending his feud with Triple H.

5|$|The final {{preliminary}} {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus Booker T. After Booker T backed Angle {{into the ring}} ropes and executed a shoulder charge, Angle began to bleed from the mouth.

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at <b>an</b> <b>angle</b> of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements. However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
