The allocation that Francisco Dominguez got for 2005 doubled the previous year (reaching 1.100 million Dominican pesos). Due to its marked deterioration and the deplorable conditions, he was motivated to transform the penitentiary system through an accelerated renovation of the prisons, the so-called [...] "new model prison." [...] In the first stage, nine of the 35 prisons in the country were incorporated into the new model.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{community}} development organizations providing assistance to communitiesin furthering {{the goals of}} community participation and self-help is conflictive. Providing institutionalized assistance often fosters dependency rather than advancingparticipation and self-help. The author examines goal statements of twenty leadingAmerican private voluntary organizations (PVOs) carrying out international communitydevelopment. Eighteen of the twenty espouse self-help, yet concentrate more on deliveringassistance than promoting empowerment. Their idea of self-help consists of supportingcommunity level <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> rather than advocating actualcommunity control. Most PVOs are donor-driven and transfer that dependency to thecommunities they serve. This {{raises the question of}} who is the client of the PVO, thedonor or the community? An alternative model is proposed in which developmentorganizations compete in a free market. In this way, communities can select servicesaccording to their needs...|$|E
40|$|Sulfate {{attack in}} {{concrete}} structures {{is considered to}} be among the major durability concerns in civil infrastructure systems. Proper modeling techniques can help us understand the influence of aggressive environments on the concrete performance more readily and accurately. Such an understanding improves the decision making process in every stage of construction and maintenance and will help in better <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> Aspects of cement chemistry, concrete physics, and mechanics are applied to develop a model for predicting sulfate penetration, reaction, damage evolution, and expansion, leading to degradation of cement-based materials exposed to a sulfate solution. The model is refined to address the interaction effects of various parameters using calibration data available from experiments conducted at the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST). Parameters of the model were refined through parametric analysis, consideration of specific boundary conditions, and calibration with experimental data...|$|E

The way to protect privacy in this age of information technology requires such access control system that can accommodate organization requirements to protect privacy of individuals with ease in management and <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> Among those requirements, purpose inference {{is one of the major}} problems as the total access control decision mainly relies on the user intentions/purposed.

40|$|The water-management {{model used}} in Cape Verde for {{irrigation}} {{water is a}} singular one involving {{both public and private}} institutions. The institutional framework adopted since independence (1975) includes influences of both Portuguese colonial occupation and African culture. Water is a common-pool resource, which can take the form of communal, private or state property, or not be subject to any form of ownership. Thus, this case study enables us to compare theories about managing. From a neo-liberal point of view, the common <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> of this kind is inefficient, but for one school of the institutional theory, solutions can come “from within”; in other words, from user groups themselves, who can co-operate, once they have defined commitments.

40|$|Public health {{management}} is {{an activity that}} includes special knowledge in management of infrastructure, work processes and outcomes in public health. Although the management of public health has advanced in recent years, many problems can still be identified {{in this area of}} knowledge, particularly in the management of public health in the Unified Health System (SUS). Inadequate practices in <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> (human, physical and financial) and services are added to the lack of specific training for health workers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{standard}} test for length change in hydraulic-cement mortars exposed to sulfate solution, ASTM C 1012 - 95, {{has been widely}} used by researchers to study the sulfate resistance of cement based materials. However, there are deficiencies in this test method including lengthy measuring period, insensitivity of the measurement tool to sulfate attack, effect of curing and pH change. So, in this study, a model will be built by artificial neural networks (ANNs) to simulate this test and overcome these defects. This model will deal with different types of cement {{in the presence of}} blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) or fly ash (PFA). From the results of simulations, it is possible to understand the impact of cement chemistry and these two types of additions on resistance of sulfate attack more readily, faster, and accurately.

We assessed multifunctional relationships of small-scale artisanal fisher organizations engaged in a coastal benthic resources comanagement system in Chile to explore bridging and linking social capital, using an egocentric network approach. The formal leaders of 38 small-scale fisher organizations were surveyed to investigate (1) similarities and differences in social capital among fisher organizations and regions, and (2) possible effects of social capital levels on comanagement performance. Results show that the best performing fisher organizations are those with higher levels of linking and bridging social capital. Positive and strong correlations exist between linking social capital levels and comanagement performance variables. Importantly, fisher organizations considered to manage resources successfully consistently presented high levels of linking social capital, irrespective of variability in bridging social capital. Using egocentric networks allows understanding actors' differences in the comanagement social structure, thus providing critical insights for improving comanagement systems...|$|E
