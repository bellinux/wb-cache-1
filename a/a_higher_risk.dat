The stability of the titanium screw implant in the patient's bone tissue post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using resonance frequency analysis.

5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of HIT in the general {{population}} is unknown. What is known is that women receiving heparin after a recent surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk,</b> while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some studies have shown that HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.|$|E
5|$|There is also modest {{evidence}} that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH.

40|$|Aims: Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) of the auricle has <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of metastatic spread, which {{is associated with}} high mortality.

The aim was to determine such criteria. Methods and results: The study was a retrospective analysis of the clinical and histological features of 229 cases of SCC of the auricle, with a minimum of 2 years' clinical follow-up. Overall, lymph node metastases were present in 24 cases (10. 5...|$|R
5|$|After {{the initial}} episode, 2% may {{experience}} a further episode {{within the first}} month. After this, there is a 1% annual risk of recurrence.

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy {{at the margins of}} wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

5|$|One {{study found}} that people with or without {{hypertension}} who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3g/d) had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, {{but this was not}} found to be true for people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5g.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of crews developing cancer, and {{can cause}} damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells {{are central to the}} immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} deep frying food is {{generally}} detrimental to its nutritional value. The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain {{large amounts of}} fats, especially saturated fats and trans fats. Consumption of large amounts of saturated and trans fats {{has been linked to}} <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> for some cancers including prostate cancer. Eating deep-fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, heart attacks, and diabetes. Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.|$|E
5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E
