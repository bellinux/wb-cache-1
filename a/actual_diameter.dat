2500|$|Andris Karpovics, a {{doctoral}} student of geology at the University of Latvia, described the crater as [...] "a simple, man-made hole with a substance poured in". He told journalists that the hole {{appeared to have been}} dug with shovels, and noted that thermite (a mixture of aluminium and iron, possibly with sulfur added), probably caused the increased temperatures observed in the crater. The crater was considerably smaller than initially reported: its <b>actual</b> <b>diameter</b> was around [...] and it was about [...] deep.|$|E
6000|$|... § VIII. In {{order to}} the delightfulness and {{security}} of all such arrangements, this law must be observed:--that {{in proportion to the}} height of wall above them, the shafts are to be short. You may take your given height of wall, and turn any quantity of that wall into shaft that you like; but you must not turn it all into tall shafts, and then put more wall above. Thus, having a house five stories high, you may turn the lower story into shafts, and leave the four stories in wall; or the two lower stories into shafts, and leave three in wall; but, whatever you add to the shaft, you must take from the wall. Then also, of course, the shorter the shaft the thicker will be its proportionate, if not its <b>actual,</b> <b>diameter.</b> In the Ducal Palace of Venice the shortest shafts are always the thickest.[61] ...|$|E

It is evident that the above shaft cannot be certain to freely enter a hole that is also 10 mm with the same tolerance. It might, if the <b>actual</b> shaft <b>diameter</b> is 9.99 mm and the <b>actual</b> hole <b>diameter</b> is 10.01 mm, but it would not if conversely the <b>actual</b> shaft <b>diameter</b> is 10.01 mm and the <b>actual</b> hole <b>diameter</b> is 9.99 mm.|$|R
5000|$|All {{copper pipe}} in Australia are {{referenced}} to their DN (diamètre nominal) number, {{which is the}} closest metric equivalent to a pipe's Imperial size.

50|$|Since {{shotguns}} {{were not}} {{originally intended to}} fire solid projectiles, but rather a compressible mass of shot, the <b>actual</b> <b>diameter</b> of the bore can vary. The fact that most shotgun bores are not cylindrical also causes deviations from the ideal bore diameter.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the diameters of porous particles are underestimated by Coulter measurements. This phenomenon has also been observed in hydrogel particles, but not characterized. Since the Coulter principle uses the displacement of electrolyte to determine particle size, electrolyte contained within the swelled hydrogel microparticles results in an underestimate of <b>actual</b> particle <b>diameters.</b> The increased use of hydrogel microspheres in biomedical applications {{has led to the}} increased application of the Coulter principle to evaluate the size distribution of microparticles. A relationship between the swelling ratio of the particles and their reported Coulter diameters will permit calculation of the <b>actual</b> <b>diameters</b> of these particles. Using polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogel microspheres, we determined a correction factor that relates the polymer swelling ratio and the reported Coulter <b>diameters</b> to their <b>actual</b> size...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{scanning}} laser acoustic microscopy (SLAM) to characterize artifically seeded voids in sintered silicon nitride structural ceramic specimens was investigated. The voids ranged from 20 to 430 microns {{in diameter and}} were embedded up to 2 mm {{beneath the surface of}} the specimens. Probability of detection was determined as a function of void depth and size. Trigonometric relationships and Airy's diffraction theory were used to obtain predictions of void depth and size from acoustic diffraction patterns produced by the voids. Agreement was observed between actual and predicted void depths. However, predicted void diameters were generally much greater than <b>actual</b> <b>diameters.</b> Precise diameter predictions are difficult to obtain because of measurement uncertainty and the limitations of the 100 MHz SLAM applied to typical ceramic specimens...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{mechanical}} separations use centrifugation after expansion cooling {{to separate}} the contaminants (carbon dioxide and/or hydrogen sulphide) out of natural gas. The size of condensed carbon dioxide (CO 2) enriched droplets after expansion cooling determines the design of these centrifugal separation units. We report the first measurements of condensed CO 2 enriched droplets using an optical reflectance method. CO 2 droplets in a methane enriched atmosphere down to 2 µm are detected. The optical reflectance method directly yields a chord length distribution rather than the <b>actual</b> <b>diameters.</b> A complete scheme to interpret the diameters from these raw signal (chord length distribution) measurements is presented.

50|$|Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) is loosely {{related to}} the inside {{diameter}} of Schedule 40 pipe. Because of the pipe wall thickness, the <b>actual</b> <b>diameter</b> of the threads {{is larger than the}} NPS, considerably so for small NPS. Pipe of other schedules with a certain NPS has different wall thickness, but the same outside diameter and thread profile as Schedule 40, so the inside diameter of the pipe is therefore different from the NPS.|$|E
50|$|The 4.85×49mm {{originally}} {{started off}} as the 5×44mm round, which was made in 1970. The bullet shape used in these early prototypes were based on one used by the 6.23×43mm round, another experimental British round. The actual cases were made from reformed 5.56 NATO rounds. However, it was soon decided that the round would be renamed to “4.85×44mm” in order to match {{the diameter of the}} test gun barrel's lands.

40|$|With ZnO {{nanorods}} hydrothermally synthesized on manually assembled {{arrays of}} optical fiber cores, 3 D arrays of ZnO nanorod-based cylindrically hierarchical structures with nominal pitch 250 [*]μm or 375 [*]μm were constructed. Based on micrographs of {{scanning electron microscopy}} and image processing operators of MATLAB software, the 3 D arrays of cylindrically hierarchical structures were quantitatively characterized. The values of the <b>actual</b> <b>diameters,</b> the <b>actual</b> pitches, and the parallelism errors suggest that the process capability of the manual assembling is sufficient {{and the quality of}} the 3 D arrays of cylindrically hierarchical structures is acceptable. The values of the characteristic parameters such as roughness, skewness, kurtosis, correlation length, and power spectrum density show that the surface morphologies of the cylindrically hierarchical structures not only were affected significantly by Zn 2 + concentration of the growth solution but also were anisotropic due to different curvature radii of the optical fiber core at side and front view...|$|R
40|$|The angular diameters of a Orionis and o Ceti were {{measured}} at a wavelength of 11. 15 km using the two-telescope Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI). Based on Ðtting the visibility data to uniform disk models, {{the diameter of}} a Orionis is 54. 7 ^ 0. 3 mas and that of o Ceti at phase 0. 90 is 47. 8 ^ 0. 5 mas. These diameters are the most precise ever measured in the mid-infrared, {{due in part to}} the addition of a 56 m baseline to the ISI, which provided sufficient resolution to observe the Ðrst zero in the visibility function of the stellar disks. Moreover, the e†ects of limb darkening and stellar hot spots are small at these wavelengths. Theoretically estimated limb-darkening e†ects indicate the <b>actual</b> <b>diameters</b> are approximately 1 % ^ 0. 5 % larger than the uniform disk approximation, or 55. 2 ^ 0. 5 and 48. 2 ^ 0. 6 mas for a Orionis and o Ceti, respectively...|$|R

50|$|Rivet diameters and lengths are {{measured}} in millimeters.
