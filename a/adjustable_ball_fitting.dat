50|$|A British firm, Schumacher Racing, was {{the first}} to develop an <b>adjustable</b> <b>ball</b> {{differential}} in 1980, which allowed nearly infinite tuning for various track conditions. At the time the majority of on-road cars had a solid axle, while off-road cars generally had a gear-type differential. Team Associated followed suit with the introduction of the RC100 1/8 scale gas on-road car, RC12 1/12 scale on-road electric car, and RC10 1/10 scale off-road electric racing buggy in 1984 (see below). Team Losi followed with the introduction of the JRX2 in 1988.|$|R

25|$|There {{were two}} {{principal}} types of GFM cloche, {{each with a}} set of subtypes. The 1929 Type A cloche was the initial model, with a short variant, a longer version, a wider version, and a model that could accommodate two soldiers. The 1934 Type B cloche was larger in diameter, with thicker armor. The gun ports were redesigned to fire through a <b>ball</b> <b>fitting</b> that was more resistant to opposing fire. Some Type A cloches were fitted with the new ports.|$|R

5000|$|Barnes was {{described}} as more than six feet tall and maintaining an erect posture with wide shoulders, a deep chest, long arms and strong legs - in John Arlott's view, [...] "perfectly built to be a bowler". [...] He bowled right arm fast-medium but also had what Arlott called [...] "the accuracy, spin and resource of a slow bowler". Barnes' high delivery provided him with a lift off the pitch that forced even the best batsmen to play him at an awkward height. He was clever at concealing his pace and could produce deliveries that were both appreciably faster and slower than his usual fast-medium pace; and could bowl an effective yorker. Barnes considered himself essentially a spin bowler as he bowled both the off-break and the leg-break. [...] Although technically formidable, Barnes allied his skillset to a hostile persona and great stamina which, Arlott says, [...] "were reflected in constant, unrelenting probing for a batsman's weakness and then attacking it by surprise, each <b>ball</b> <b>fitting</b> into a tactical pattern". [...] In Barnes's era, the same ball {{would be used for}} the whole of a team's innings, with no new ball, although bowlers were assisted by the unpredictability of uncovered pitches.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} muzzle-loading rifle, with {{a closely}} <b>fitting</b> <b>ball</b> {{to take the}} rifling grooves, was loaded with difficulty, particularly when foul, {{and for this reason}} was not generally used for military purposes.

The original muzzle-loading rifle, on the other hand, with a more closely <b>fitting</b> <b>ball</b> to take the rifling grooves, was more difficult to load, particularly when the bore of the barrel was fouled from previous firings. For this reason, early rifles were not generally used for military purposes.|$|R
40|$|Structural {{testing was}} {{performed}} to evaluate heritage forward skirts from the Space Shuttle program for use on the Space Launch System (SLS) program. One forward skirt is located in each solid rocket booster. Heritage forward skirts are aluminum 2219 welded structures. Loads are applied at the forward skirt thrust post and ball assembly. Testing was needed because SLS ascent loads are roughly 40 % higher than Space Shuttle loads. Testing objectives were to determine margins of safety, demonstrate reliability, and validate analytical models. Two forward skirts were structurally tested using the test configuration. The test stand applied loads to the thrust post. Four hydraulic actuators were used to apply axial load and two hydraulic actuators were used to apply radial and tangential loads. The first test {{was referred to as}} FSTA- 1 (Forward Skirt Structural Test Article) and was performed in April/May 2014. The purpose of FSTA- 1 was to verify the ultimate capability of the forward skirt subjected to ascent ultimate loads. Testing consisted of two liftoff load cases taken to 100 % limit load followed by an ascent load case taken to 110 % limit load. The forward skirt was unloaded to no load after each test case. Lastly, the forward skirt was tested to 140 % limit and then to failure using the ascent loads. The second test was referred to as FSTA- 2 and performed in July/August of 2014. The purpose of FSTA- 2 was to verify the ultimate capability of the forward skirt subjected to liftoff ultimate loads. Testing consisted of six liftoff load cases taken to 100 % limit load followed by the six liftoff cases taken to 140 % limit load. Two ascent load cases were then tested to 100 % limit load. The forward skirt was unloaded to no load after each test case. Lastly, the forward skirt was tested to 140 % limit and then to failure using the ascent loads. The forward skirts on FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 successfully carried all applied liftoff and ascent load cases. Both FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 were tested to failure by increasing the ascent loads. Failure occurred in the forward skirt thrust post radius. The forward skirts on FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 had nearly identical failure modes. FSTA- 1 failed at 1. 72 times limit load and FSTA- 2 failed at 1. 62 times limit load. This difference is primarily attributed to variation in material properties in the thrust post region. Test data were obtained from strain gages, deflection gages, ARAMIS digital strain measurement, acoustic emissions, and high-speed video. Strain gage data and ARAMIS strain were compared to finite element (FE) analysis predictions. Both the forward skirt and tooling were modeled. This allows the analysis to simulate the loading {{as close as possible to}} actual test configuration. FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 were instrumented with over 200 strain gages to ensure all possible failure modes could be captured. However, it turned out that three gages provided critical strain data. One was located in the post bore and two on the post radius. More gages were not specified due to space limitations and the desire to not interfere with the use of the ARAMIS system on the post radius. Measured strains were compared to analysis results for the load cycle to failure. Note that FSTA- 1 gages were lost before failure was reached. FSTA- 2 gages made it to the failure load but one of the radius gages was lost before testing began. This gage was not replaced because of the time and cost associated with disassembly of the test structure. Correlation to analysis was excellent for FSTA- 1. FSTA- 2 was not quite as good because there was more residual strain from previous load cycles. FSTA- 2 was loaded and unloaded with 12 liftoff cases and two ascent cases before taking the skirt to failure. FSTA- 1 only had two liftoff cases and one ascent case before taking the skirt to failure. The ARAMIS system was used to determine strain at the post radius by processing digital images of a speckled paint pattern. Digital cameras recorded images of the speckled paint pattern. ARAMIS strain results for FSTA- 2 just prior to failure. Note a high strain location develops near the left side. This high strain compares well to analysis prediction for both FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2. The strain at this location was also plotted versus limit load. Both FSTA- 1 and FSTA- 2 had excellent correlation between ARAMIS and analysis strains. Acoustic emission (AE) sensors were used to monitor for damage formation that may occur during testing (e. g., crack formation and growth or propagation). AE was very important because after disassembly of FSTA- 1, a crack was observed in the <b>ball</b> <b>fitting</b> radius. The <b>ball</b> <b>fitting</b> did not crack on FSTA- 2. AE data was used to reconstruct when the crack occurred. The AE energy versus time plot for FSTA. The energy increased considerably at 850 seconds (152 % limit load), indicating a crack could have formed at this point. The only visual evidence found that could have corresponded to this was the crack that initiated in the <b>ball</b> <b>fitting.</b> The cracks in the forward skirt aluminum structures would likely have been lower energy due to a lower modulus and all that were found after failure correlated to occurring after the initial crack in the post radius. This was verified by high-speed cameras used to record the failure...|$|R
40|$|To {{recognize}} and retrieve soccer game scenes, {{the movement of}} the players and the ball must be analyzed. This paper describes a method of tracking the players and the ball and estimating their 3 D positions from video images recorded from TV broadcasting. Our system detects the players and tracks them by predicting their motions. Our system determines the ball from among ball candidates by considering the motion continuity of the ball. The camera parameters (pan, tilt, and zoom) are estimated by detecting line regions on the field in every frame and by matching them to the model. Because our method uses not only straight lines but also circular ones for the matching, it {{can be applied to the}} whole area of the field. Our system also estimates the 3 D position of the <b>ball</b> by <b>fitting</b> a 3 D physical model to the observed ball trajectory.

40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an overcenter mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an <b>adjustable</b> preload <b>ball</b> and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A locking knob is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|R
5000|$|Grease {{fittings}} are {{permanently installed}} by either a (taper) thread or straight push-fit ('hammer in') arrangement, leaving a nipple connection that a grease gun attaches to.

40|$|Cortical {{thickness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental measurements for population and longitudinal studies in brain imaging. Therefore, measuring cortical thickness from MRI data is an important topic in computational brain imaging. In this work we present a new approach for measuring cortical thickness that is based on <b>fitting</b> <b>balls</b> into the gray matter mantle of the brain by maximizing the amount of probability-weighted gray matter that is contained in each ball. Previous methods often solely measure the distance between the extracted inner and outer boundary surfaces of the gray matter, and ignore the underlying probabilities that are assigned to each voxel in the MRI volume, a natural consequence of noise and partial volume effects present in MRI. Moreover, our proposed framework works directly on the volumetric data, without relying on an accurate segmentation, which is only used as an initial condition for the optimization step. We present the underlying concepts of the proposed framework and examples. Index Terms â€” Magnetic resonance imaging, thickness measurement, computational anatomy...|$|R
