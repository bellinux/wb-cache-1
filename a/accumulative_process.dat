40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate how UV-C irradiation and refrigeration affect shelf-life and antioxidant level of litchi, longan, and rambutan. Three forms (whole, dehulled, and destoned) of fresh fruits were treated by refrigeration and UV-C irradiations.

The results showed that both refrigeration and UV-C exposure extended the shelf-life of the fruits. The refrigeration enriched antioxidant levels of litchi but caused nutritional degradation in longan and rambutan; UV-C radiation enriched litchi antioxidant contents but was related to reduction of antioxidant capacity in longan and rambutan.

40|$|Existing {{techniques}} to reconstruct tree models of progression for <b>accumulative</b> <b>processes,</b> such as cancer, seek to estimate causation by combining correlation and a frequentist notion of temporal priority. In this paper, we define a novel theoretical framework called CAPRESE (CAncer PRogression Extraction with Single Edges) to reconstruct such models {{based on the}} notion of probabilistic causation defined by Suppes. We consider a general reconstruction setting complicated by the presence of noise in the data due to biological variation, as well as experimental or measurement errors. To improve tolerance to noise we define and use a shrinkage-like estimator. We prove the correctness of our algorithm by showing asymptotic convergence to the correct tree under mild constraints on the level of noise. Moreover, on synthetic data, we show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, that it is efficient even with {{a relatively small number of}} samples and that its performance quickly converges to its asymptote as the number of samples increases.

Longitudinal data confirm that health disparities do change as individuals move through the life course, that these processes are intertwined with selection and causation between socioeconomic status (SES) and health and from variation across cohorts representing vastly different historical contexts. Variations in health disparities across the life course offer unique opportunities to gain traction into understanding the production of these disparities. The life course perspective provides a rich set of concepts, methods, and a theoretical framework for guiding our inquiry into how SES disparities in health unfold as people live their lives. This article focuses attention on how socioeconomic conditions experienced as one is growing up relate to health and mortality across the adult life course.

In this study, the EEG signals were firstly analyzed with a power projective base method. Then we were applied a decision-making model, the sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT), for single-trial classification of motor imagery movement events. The unique strength of this proposed classification method lies in its <b>accumulative</b> <b>process,</b> which increases the discriminative power as more and more evidence is observed over time. The properties of the method were illustrated on thirteen subjects’ recordings from three datasets. Results showed that our proposed power projective method outperformed two benchmark methods for every subject.

The average maximum accuracy of the SPRT method was 84. 1 %, as compared with 82. 3 % accuracy for the sequential Bayesian (SB) method. The proposed SPRT method provides an explicit relationship between stopping time, thresholds, and error, which is important for balancing the time-accuracy trade-off.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{question about the}} nature of human learning is whether it is an all-or-none, or a gradual, <b>accumulative</b> <b>process.</b> Associative and statistical theories of word learning rely critically on the later assumption: that the process of learning a word’s meaning unfolds over time. That is, learning the correct referent for a word involves the accumulation of partial knowledge across multiple instances. Some theories also make an even stronger claim: partial knowledge of one word-object mapping can speed up the acquisition of other word-object mappings. We present three experiments that test and verify these claims by exposing learners to two consecutive blocks of cross-situational learning, in which half of the words and objects in the second block were those that participants failed to learn in Block 1. In line with an accumulative account, re-exposure to these mis-mapped items accelerated the acquisition of both previously experienced mappings and also wholly new word-object mappings. But how does partial knowledge of some words speed the acquisition of others? We consider two hypotheses. First, partial knowledge of a word could reduce the amount of information required for it to reach threshold, and the supra-threshold mapping could subsequently aid in the acquisition of new mappings. Alternatively, partial knowledge of a word’s meaning could be useful for disambiguating the meanings of other words even before the threshold of learning is reached. We construct and compare computational models embodying each of these hypotheses and show that the latter provides a better explanation of the empirical data...|$|E
40|$|For some {{ambiguous}} scenes perceptual conflict arises between {{integration and}} segregation. Initially, all stimulus features seem integrated. Then abruptly, perhaps {{after a few}} seconds, a segregated perceptual organization emerges. For example, segregation of acoustic features into streams may require several seconds. In behavioral experiments, when a subject’s reports of stream segregation are averaged over repeated trials, one obtains a buildup function, a smooth time course for segregation probability. The buildup function has been said to reflect an underlying mechanism of evidence accumulation or adaptation. During long duration stimuli perception may alternate between integration and segregation. We present a statistical model based on an alternating renewal process that generates buildup functions without an <b>accumulative</b> <b>process.</b> In our model, perception alternates during a trial between different groupings, as in perceptual bistability, with random and independent dominance durations sampled from different percept-specific probability distributions. Using this theory, we describe the short-term dynamics of buildup observed on short trials {{in terms of the}} long-term statistics of percept durations for the two alternating perceptual organizations. Our statistical-dynamics model describes well the buildup functions and alternations in simulations of pseudo-mechanistic neuronal network models with percept-selective populations competing through mutual inhibition. Even though the competition model can show history dependence through slow adaptation, our statistical switching model, that neglects history, predicts well the buildup function. We propose that accumulation is not a necessary feature to produce buildup. Generally, if alternations between two states exhibit independent durations with stationary statistics then the associated buildup function can be described by the statistical dynamics of an alternating renewal process...|$|E

The timing of the introduction of the Black rat on the main islands (before Middle Age European contact in Lanzarote and after Middle Age European contact in Fuerteventura) matches with the last occurrence dates for the presence of Lava mouse on these islands, and are very probably their cause. The losses of these Lava mouse populations occurred in an asynchronous way, spreading across at least six centuries.

The study re-examines the possible origins {{and evolution of}} khayl as a context for subsequent examination and analysis of ornamentation in performance practice. The study examines the components of rga structure in two stages; Chapter II discusses the tripartite structure of ruti, svara and phrase {{with reference to the}} sastraic tradition as well as to twentieth century sources. The components are found to represent different levels of melodic activity. The discussion is continued in Chapter III where additional components of rga are introduced. 'Ornamentation' proves to be inadequate as a term to describe the many aspects of melodic movement which take place in performance. Consequently this term has to be redefined in the context of khayil and the problem of terminology addressed. The study shows the presence of an <b>accumulative</b> <b>process</b> whereby components of rãga, including gamaka and alaipkra, work at different levels.

The "wasting syndrome complex" (WSC) [Shochat et al., 1997] was the single most important mortality factor in adult animals, being responsible for 47 % of all cases. Other important factors were intraspecific aggression (13 %) and malignant catarrhal fever (12 %). The number of deaths showed a peak at the age of 6 - 8 years. A similar peak was found in the age distribution of WSC cases only, suggesting an <b>accumulative</b> <b>process</b> that leads to the death of an animal once a threshold is reached. While the dominance of WSC is in accord with the American literature, the high incidence of intraspecific aggression found in this and other European surveys is not reported in North America.

Most reports of WSC in the literature concern animals that grazed in pasture-like enclosures. In no case was WSC triggered by controlled feeding of freshly cut grass fed to animals in holding pens.

An Indigenous paradigm frames the qualitative research method of life history research, narrative and story telling. The data, as proposed by Kovach (2010) was gathered through an Indigenous ‘conversational method’. These methods allowed for {{a focus on the}} interconnection of experiences related to family and social relationships, schooling and professional practice. The rich stories revealed by the four artists were examined individually and through a cross-case analysis. The findings indicate that both external and internal factors impact on the development of cultural identity. Identity development, as has been found with artistic identity development, is an <b>accumulative</b> <b>process</b> and education is an important factor. Family, self- awareness and a broadened knowledge of the external world along with a sustained interrogation of their inner world are also essential. 	The knowledge developed in this thesis will help art educators recognize the value of meaningful cultural exchanges in the classroom, see the need to examine identity in a profound manner and discourage the practice of characterizing abilities and inclinations as cultural traits. Ultimately the particularized case studies will indicate a new direction that inserts itself into a larger narrative regarding Indigenous ways of teaching and learning...|$|E

Havent-hi aquest buit terminològic, també hi consta una sèrie de propostes neològiquesSpecialized translation {{needs the}} help from terminology. Terminology pretends to study/nevery specialized subject {{that is not}} covered by some specific languages. Thanks to/nterminology, specialized communication is possible in a proper way, because behind/neach term {{there is a long}} process of study. This paper pretends to study the current/nnormalisation process that terminologists and sometimes translators do when a subject/nneeds to be covered. The object of study of this process is the Catalan gastronomy,/nwhich will be translated into English, because it is known by some studies that British/npeople are interested on sweets and chocolates and that the United Kingdom is the/nsecond European country consuming more sweets per person and per year. Following a/nlineal and <b>accumulative</b> <b>process</b> of documentation and analysis, this paper has all the/nnecessary information to create equivalent terms from the most popular desserts.

40|$|Ultrafine grained sheets were {{prepared}} from a twin-roll cast AA 8006 aluminium alloy using <b>accumulative</b> roll-bonding <b>process</b> at room temperature. The evolution of microstructure of sheets after three accumulative roll-bonding passes during isochronal annealing with a constant step of 20 °C/ 20 min was studied by light and electron microscopy. The {{influence of the}} resulting microstructure on mechanical properties was monitored by microhardness measurements. The microhardness increases when the material is annealed up to 160 °C. Above this temperature a fast drop of microhardness occurs followed by a negligible variation at annealing temperatures exceeding 300 °C. In order to map continuously the microstructure changes during annealing, the in situ TEM experiments in the heating stage were performed {{as a supplement to}} post-mortem TEM observations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Lightweight {{metallic}} foams are {{an attractive}} material having excellent energy absorption and acoustic damping. The density of magnesium {{is the smallest}} among structural metallic materials, and is about two third of the density of aluminum. It is, however, difficult to produce magnesium foams by conventional process because of their chemical activity. This paper provides a novel manufacturing process of magnesium foams. <b>Accumulative</b> diffusion-bonding <b>process</b> can produce a magnesium matrix composite (preform) containing titanium hydride (TiH 2) particles as a blowing agent. Foaming tests of three magnesium alloys, AZ 31, AZ 91 and ZA 146, revealed that low solidus temperature is effective to produce fine cell morphology. Chemical composition is significantly important to optimize the cell morphology of magnesium foams...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarchaeological {{materials}} {{are influenced by}} many consecutive factors, from human hunting strategies, consumption patterns and waste disposal to mechanical and chemical changes in bone structure and shape. Here Mesolithic osteoarchaeological patterns have been examined {{in relation to the}} production of bone and antler artefacts. The osseous production in Sweden of the period c. 7000 – 4500 cal BC shows both similarities and differences between six investigated sites, representing two different geographical regions. These may be seen in both manufacturing techniques and raw material use and may be linked to different traditions, but also to different utilization of different taskscapes. The production is also linked to lithic craft and the theme of e. g. raw material acquisition is also relevant in relation to the production of osseous artefacts.  Spatial studies clearly show how different taphonomic processes affect the accumulation of bone material on site, but also how practitioners’ choices associated with the osseous craft affect these patterns. On several of the investigated sites, deposits of raw material have been found in the waters outside the settlements. In the settlement debitage from the production and forming of the artefacts, bone knapping floors have been identified. These are located centrally, in relation to other archaeological structures such as lithic knapping floors and dwellings. The osteoarchaeological record is biased in part due to debitage from osseous production but also from active human selection, transport and deposition of raw materials. These activities and the human choices of production affect the patterns, and through careful taphonomic analyses various <b>accumulative</b> <b>processes</b> may be highlighted. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Manuscript. Paper 4 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
