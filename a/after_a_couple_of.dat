5|$|The French evicted the Order from Malta {{during the}} Mediterranean {{campaign}} of 1798, and the Order surrendered <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days. The Maltese, although initially welcoming the French occupiers, rebelled <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months {{due to a}} number of reforms and the looting of churches. The insurgents took control of Gozo which became briefly independent, as well as Mdina and the towns and villages of the main island, leaving the French blockaded in the well-defended harbour area.|$|E
5|$|French forces invaded Malta in June 1798, and the Order capitulated <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days. The French {{occupied}} the island until September, when the Maltese rebelled and blockaded the French {{forces in the}} harbour area with foreign help. The Floriana Lines remained under French control throughout the blockade, and the Maltese built Tas-Samra Battery and a battery on Corradino in order to bombard them.|$|E
5|$|From the {{southern}} terminus at SH-7, {{the southern}} section of SH-74 goes due north to Elmore City, where it intersects with SH-29. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{turns in the}} Elmore City area, the highway continues due north to Maysville and SH-19. Still continuing northward, the highway meets the southern terminus of State Highway 24, and continues into Purcell.|$|E

5|$|Trapping resumed in the U.S. after 1962 once numbers had {{recovered}} sufficiently. During the early 1970s, {{the value of}} fisher pelts soared, leading to another population crash in 1976. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years of closed seasons, fisher trapping re-opened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits. The population has steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite a much lower pelt value.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Brody's {{teenage son}} Mike disobeys his father by sneaking out to go sailing {{with his friends}} after his love interest, Jackie Peters, goads him to, but his younger brother, Sean, catches him, and persuades Mike to bring him along. After an {{argument}} at the dock, Marge, one of Mike's friends, playfully lets Sean come in her boat with her, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> other grouping arrangements, they head out, going past a team of divers, led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after going underwater, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an embolism. Soon after, the shark hits teenagers Tina Wilcox and Eddie Marchand; Eddie falls {{into the water and}} is killed by the shark.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, the GWR returned to direct government control, {{and by the end}} of the war a Labour government was in power and again planning to nationalise the railways. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years trying to recover from the ravages of war, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. The Great Western Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years, being formally wound up on 23 December 1949. GWR designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and the region maintained its own distinctive character, even painting for a while its stations and express trains in a form of chocolate and cream.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months pondering {{his future}} career plans, he {{received}} {{a telephone call from}} the Stockport County chairman, Victor Bernard, who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport was a struggling lower league club with a small budget, and Trautmann's appointment was an attempt to improve its image. Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club would be playing. This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard. From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team Preußen Münster, taking them to a 13th-place finish in the Regionalliga West, following which he had a short spell at Opel Rüsselsheim.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Ayabe, Ueshiba began a regimen of spiritual training, regularly retreating {{to the mountains}} or performing misogi in the Nachi Falls. As his prowess as a martial artist increased, his fame began to spread. He was challenged by many established martial artists, some of whom later became his students after being defeated by him. In the autumn of 1925 {{he was asked to}} give a demonstration of his art in Tokyo, at the behest of Admiral Isamu Takeshita; one of the spectators was Yamamoto Gonnohyōe, who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the Imperial Guard in his martial art. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks, however, Ueshiba took issue with several government officials who voiced concerns about his connections to Deguchi; he cancelled the training and returned to Ayabe.|$|E

5|$|In New Zealand, Neighbours is {{broadcast}} on TV2 at 6:30 pm weekdays. In October 2010, it began airing episodes {{at the same}} pace as Australia. The show was initially broadcast by TVNZ in 1988, but by 1996 it {{was removed from the}} schedule. TV4 (now C4) picked the show up and began broadcasting it from 1997. They dropped it in 2000 and it returned to TV2 in 2002. Repeats of the previous day's episode of Neighbours were formerly shown at 2:30 pm weekdays and are now shown at 11.00 am weekdays. The show moved to 5:25 pm weeknights on TV One in late 2007. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months, the show moved to 3:50 pm weekdays. The show eventually moved back to TV2. The TV2 website offers viewers the chance to watch episodes online with its OnDemand service.|$|E
5|$|Route177 {{began at}} {{a traffic light}} {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 206 {{in the city of}} Somerville. At the intersection, southbound traffic on Route206 had to use a jughandle to connect to Route177. The state highway went northeastward, progressing along as South Bridge Street through a curve. Heading northward, the route passed the Somerville Old Cemetery before intersecting with Fifth Street. There, state-maintenance ended, and the designation of Route177 terminated. Entering downtown Somerville, South Bridge Street continued northward into a large residential community. Passing to the east and west of several residential homes, South Bridge Street continued into the downtown portion, crossing the current-day Raritan Valley Line tracks maintained by New Jersey Transit and served the Somerville train station. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> blocks of residential homes and businesses, South Bridge Street came to an intersection with New Jersey Route 28, where it switched to North Bridge Street.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} game modes in Day of Defeat: Source: {{territorial}} control and detonation. In territorial control maps, players must fight for control of all strategic points on the map. The strategic points take various forms, such as a destroyed tank in a street or fields and buildings, and are designated by a flag in its vicinity, which displays the army colors of the team who controls the point. Points are captured by {{a certain number of}} team members surrounding the point, with it either capturing instantly or <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> seconds. Players on the other side can disrupt a capture by placing themselves within the capture area during the process or by killing the enemy players at the point. The first side to hold all the points simultaneously wins the round.|$|E

Later on, Lojina sees her brother-in-law slip and fall from a tree in her dream and wakes up in shock. Ojahang is dead by then.|$|R
5|$|These events {{coincided with}} the {{accession}} of Nero to the imperial throne in Rome, and the young emperor decided to react vigorously. The war, which was the only major foreign campaign of his reign, began with rapid success for the Roman forces, led by the able general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. They overcame the forces loyal to Tiridates, installed their own candidate, Tigranes VI, on the Armenian throne, and left the country. The Romans were aided {{by the fact that}} the Parthian king Vologases was embroiled in the suppression of a series of revolts in his own country. As soon as these had been dealt with, however, the Parthians turned their attention to Armenia, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years of inconclusive campaigning, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Romans in the Battle of Rhandeia.|$|E
5|$|As the 1995–96 season concluded, John McNamara {{sold the}} club to Premier Computers, headed by Alan McGrath. McGrath {{unveiled}} a {{plan to build a}} state-of-the-art stadium in the Dublin southwest suburb of Tallaght, and employed Pat Byrne as commercial manager. However, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks and a loss in {{the first game of the}} season, O’Neill was dismissed, while Eviston resigned in solidarity. Byrne was appointed manager of the side playing in Tolka Park once again, and they struggled through the season with the League's joint top scorer, Tony Cousins playing a leading role in avoiding relegation. In May 1997, Alan McGrath resigned as club chairman and was replaced by Brian Kearney, also of Premier Computers, who succeeded in acquiring planning permission for the new stadium in January 1998. However, the permission was delayed by objections until November 1998, by which time Joe Colwell had replaced Kearney as chairman and ended Premier Computers' involvement with the club. On the pitch, Mick Byrne guided Rovers to an Intertoto Cup spot in 1997–98 and an eighth-place finish, the next season. He was replaced by Damien Richardson, who managed the club during their stay at Morton Stadium before his dismissal in April 2002, after a disagreement with Colwell. By that time, a half-built shell of a stadium stood at the Tallaght site; Mulden International Ltd, recruited by Colwell to complete the project, had pulled out of building the stadium. They leased it to a separate company, transferring the responsibility, and focused on four acres that they had retained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others {{want to return to}} Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, because there was no need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be forgotten, and that his work will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} Games, she competed {{in a warm}} up event in Switzerland, and set Australian records in the 100m, 400m and 800m events. At the 2004 games, she won a bronze medal in the T53 100m, behind Tanni Grey-Thompson and Francesca Porcellato. Her goal for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics was to set a {{personal}} best, but she also had eyes on a medal. She took the year off her psychology degree to train six times a week. At the 2008 games, along with her team mates Christie Dawes, Madison de Rozario, and Jemima Moore, she achieved her best Paralympic result, winning a silver medal behind China's world record in the T53/54 4x100m relay. In the individual events, she finished fifth in the women's T53 100m event (a race won in world record time by Huang Lisha), seventh in the women's T53 200m event (also won in a world record time by Huang), seventh in the women's T53 400m event, and led out the women's 800m final, eventually finishing sixth. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> sub-par competition results in 2011, Ballard made big changes to her diet, gloves, technique, chair position, and training regime. She entered the 2012 London Paralympics ranked world number one in both the T53 100m and 200m. At the games, Ballard participated in the T53 class events for 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m events.

5|$|The 2014 Yellow Jackets, {{despite being}} {{predicted}} to finish 5th in Coastal Division by ESPN, garnered a 10-2 regular season record (6-2 ACC), including wins over then No. 19 Clemson and No. 9 Georgia {{to finish the}} regular season ranked No. 11 by the College Football Playoff Committee. The highlight of the season came when Georgia Tech defeated the Bulldogs in Athens in an overtime game that featured numerous swings in momentum. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> controversial calls that gave UGA the advantage, the Rambling Wreck fought back, staying with the Bulldogs. With 18 seconds left, the Yellow Jackets delivered 30-yard drive that ended up with Harrison Butker's 53-yard field goal sending the game into overtime. After a 1-yard rushing touchdown by Georgia Tech RB Zack Laskey, the win was clinched by the Jackets when cornerback D.J. White intercepted UGA quarterback, Hutson Mason. Georgia Tech won the Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division and met No. 4 Florida State in the 2014 ACC Championship Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, losing 37-35. The 2014 appearance marked Georgia Tech's third ACC Championship Game in seven seasons under Paul Johnson. With {{the advent of the}} College Football Playoff, Florida State was chosen in the top four (ranked No. 3), under which circumstance the Orange Bowl selected Georgia Tech, now ranked No. 12, as its replacement to face the No. 7 Mississippi State Bulldogs on December 31, 2014. In the orange bowl game, Justin Thomas led the Jackets to a dominating 49-34 win over No. 7 Mississippi State. The Yellow Jackets finished the season 11–3, No. 8 in AP poll and No. 7 in the American Coaches Poll.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly <b>after,</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E
