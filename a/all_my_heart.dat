After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

500|$|Though many {{regarded}} Sharp's murder as {{an honor}} killing, some New Court partisans charged that Beauchamp had been incited to violence {{by members of}} the Old Court party, specifically Patrick Darby. Sharp was thought to be the minority party's choice for Speaker of the House for the 1826 session. By enticing Beauchamp to murder Sharp, the Old Court could remove a political enemy. Sharp's widow Eliza appeared to believe this notion. In an 1826 letter in the New Court Argus of Western America, she referred to Darby as [...] "the chief instigator of the foul murder which has deprived me of <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> held most dear on earth".|$|E

In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange {{at the opposite end}} of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland with <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is my good fortune." ...|$|E
500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart,</b> for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed she smiled and said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E

A performance lasts about forty minutes. The aria [...] "Schafe können sicher weiden" [...] ("Sheep May Safely Graze"), is the most familiar part of this cantata.|$|R

2500|$|Newman also {{experienced}} intense male friendships, the first with Richard Hurrell Froude (1803–1836), the longest with Ambrose St John (1815–1875), who shared communitarian life with Newman for 32 years starting in 1843 (when St John was 28). Newman wrote after St John's death: [...] "I have ever thought no bereavement was {{equal to that}} of a husband's or a wife's, but I feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater, or any one's sorrow greater, than mine". He directed that he be buried in the same grave as St. John: [...] "I wish, with <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart,</b> to be buried in Fr Ambrose St John's grave– and I give this as my last, my imperative will".|$|E

It was performed in Weissenfels in the evening after a hunting party. Christian is named four times in Salomon Franck's libretto for the cantata and equated with the classical deity Pan. The hunt is characterized as an activity suitable for princes.|$|R

2500|$|Ballou's antislavery sentiments are {{exemplified}} in his 1843 Fourth of July address entitled [...] "The Voice of Duty," [...] {{in which he}} called on Americans to honor {{the foundations of the}} country by not being selective or hypocritical in their judgment of who should be free: [...] "We honor liberty only when we make her impartial--the same for and to all men." [...] Ballou also responded to those who claimed that abolitionists dishonor the U.S. Constitution, saying that he stood [...] "on a higher moral platform than any human compact." [...] Of the Founding Fathers Ballou stated: [...] "I honor them with <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> for their devotion to right principles, for all the truly noble traits in their character, for their fidelity to their own highest light. But because I honor their love of liberty, must I honor their compromises with slavery?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Pro and his {{brothers}} were visited by Generals Roberto Cruz and Palomera Lopez around 11 p.m. on November 22, 1927. [...] The next day, as Pro walked from his cell to the courtyard and the firing squad, he blessed the soldiers, knelt, and briefly prayed quietly. Declining a blindfold, he faced his executioners with a crucifix {{in one hand and}} a rosary in the other and held his arms out in imitation of the crucified Christ and shouted out, [...] "May God have mercy on you! May God bless you! Lord, Thou knowest that I am innocent! With <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> I forgive my enemies!" [...] Before the firing squad were ordered to shoot, Pro raised his arms in imitation of Christ and shouted the defiant cry of the Cristeros, [...] "Viva Cristo Rey!" [...] – [...] "Long live Christ the King!". When the initial shots of the firing squad failed to kill him, a soldier shot him at point-blank range.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1910, as {{recognition}} of his activities, and in particular for his work with the Blaj foundations, Stroescu was elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. This appointment left him indifferent, as he considered his deeds [...] "only natural". He declared himself [...] "at my country's disposal, with all this mind God gave me, from <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> and with my entire wealth". According to Halippa and Pelivan, his focus fell on Transylvania and elsewhere only because censorship and repression prevented him from openly financing nationalism in his native province. Another account {{is that he was}} felt called into action by the anti-Magyarization writings of Ioan Slavici. Moreover, his philanthropic activity was preceded by that of his late brother Mihail, who, as early as 1882, had set up ten model schools in Romania-proper, after having failed to create a Romanian studies department at Novorossiya University. Also noted for founding a school in Stolniceni, Mihail had set up a rural hospital at Bekir, eventually splitting his wealth between ASTRA, the Romanian vocational schools of Brașov, and his tenant farmers.|$|E
