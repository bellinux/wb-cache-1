An <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device is often required to convey parts to complete a series of processes in a modern production line. But the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device has problems of large volume, high noise and low efficiency. It has reduced the efficiency of production line. So it is necessary to make innovation for the <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> system. A new type of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device based on linear servo motor is proposed in the paper. This device overcomes some disadvantages of the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device. 1...|$|R

Greater {{attention is focused on}} the possibilities of hydrogen produciton. Next part describes anaerobic fermentation and optimum conditions for hydrogen production. The main part of the thesis deals with posibility of hydrogen production in an experimental laboratory unit using brewer´s grains as a primary material. The experiment was aimed to find suitable process conditions for hydrogen production. The quantity of produced gas and his quality depending on the amount of brewer´s grains and frequency of the dosage was observed. Based on the experiment, some recommendations are proposed for further research. An <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> system is the most important of them. It will improve the quality of experimental work. A separate chapter is devoted to the <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> system...|$|R
