The Fairy Godmother from Cinderella cannot magically turn a pumpkin into a carriage outside the bounds of fiction, because pumpkins and carriages possess internal organisation that is fundamentally complex. A large pumpkin randomly reassembled at the most minute level {{would be much more}} likely to result in a featureless pile of ash or sludge than in a complex and intricately organised carriage.|$|E

Toyota’s global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale clay {{model of the}} car {{during a trip to}} the Australian branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen. Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would love this concept to become a production reality, it is very much a concept that demonstrates the passion within Toyota for cars that <b>are</b> <b>fun</b> to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.|$|E

[...] St. Petersburg Times book critic Colette Bancroft said of the images in the book, [...] "I can tell you lots of the photos <b>are</b> <b>fun,</b> although a few are a little scary, {{like the one in}} which she looks like a space alien awaiting a gynecological exam." ...|$|E

Later that year she made Everything But the Truth for Universal, at a time in her career when she was trying to distance herself from adventure films. O'Hara thought the film was so bad that neither she nor her family saw it, though she enjoyed working with John Forsythe.|$|E

500|$|The notes {{range from}} nearly {{insignificant}} details to major discrepancies and deliberate distortions. [...] They have a self-deprecatory tone that {{is common in}} North American comics, tracing its roots to the awkwardly self-aware underground comix of the 1960s and 1970s. [...] They also reveal Brown's process in shaping the story from conflicting sources. [...] He acknowledges {{some of the more}} capricious details. [...] He explains he was not committed to the conspiracy theory he presented, but included it in order to present Macdonald in a certain light: [...] "illains <b>are</b> <b>fun</b> in a story", he said, and he was [...] "trying to tell this tale in an engaging manner". [...] He also included a [...] "Major-General Thomas Bland Strange" [...] in an 1885 meeting at which the general was not actually present. [...] Brown explains that he included Strange because he was amused by the Major-General's name.|$|E
500|$|Finding it {{difficult}} for hardcore gamers to fully enjoy Phantom Hourglass, Nintendo World Report claimed that the game's lack of alternative control schemes was a telling sign that Nintendo did not have The Legend of Zelda fans in mind when creating the game. They still described the game as [...] "decent", but felt that [...] "it’s also a game {{apart from the rest}} of the series. It just feels different, and I think it demonstrates that Nintendo is reluctant to sail into the murky waters beyond Wind Waker." [...] The American newspaper The New York Times enjoyed Phantom Hourglass for the most part, but complained about the timer in the Temple of the Ocean King as unnecessary and gimmicky, remarking that the game's dungeons are only [...] "fun to go through once, but none of them <b>are</b> <b>fun</b> enough to go through 20 times". They noted that the time spent traveling through dungeons [...] "removed all thoughts of it being perfect".|$|E

The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E

500|$|The {{play has}} {{received}} modest reviews. Julian Hall of The Independent criticized {{it for a}} lack of inside stories about The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Cartwright never allows you to become bored but that means some issues are skirted over faster than American closing credits on television. You never really get a feel what it is like recording the show." [...] Brian Logan of The Guardian described Cartwright as [...] "a lively host [...] eager to please", but found the play to be [...] "an overweeningly upbeat collection of Simpsons chitchat." [...] David Chatterton of British Theatre Guide described it as [...] "interesting and entertaining, but not really a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans." [...] Clive Davis of The Times wrote that [...] "In contrast to The Simpsons itself, where not a line, not a syllable, goes to waste, Cartwright has a habit of losing herself in anecdotes that stumble into dead-ends. [...] The half-hearted trivia quiz involving volunteers from the audience soon dies a death too. The performance really cries out for a hard-headed director. The video clips of Cartwright at large <b>are</b> <b>fun,</b> however." ...|$|E
500|$|Jack DeVries, who {{reviewed}} Green Day: Rock Band for IGN, enjoyed having complete albums in the game, but {{was disappointed}} by the low number of songs in the game, especially from the albums between Dookie and American Idiot, saying that [...] "Nearly all of Green Day's albums went platinum and I'd like a much larger representation from all of them." [...] Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera praised the selection of songs, saying they [...] "fit with the gameplay of Rock Band very well". Some reviewers, such as GamePro's Mitch Dyer, were {{disappointed by the}} focus on Green Day's newer songs. Several reviewers were critical of the setlist, feeling that the songs were not fun to play or were too easy. Others praised the songs chosen, saying that songs such as [...] "F.O.D." [...] provide the game with musical variety, and that they <b>are</b> <b>fun</b> to play on all the instruments. Reviewers criticized the game's use of radio edits, with Kuchera calling the editing [...] "a bummer". DeVries likewise felt that [...] "given how much these boys love to drop f-bombs, [...] makes the songs sound funny." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} the score of 7.9 ("Good") from both Bob Colayco of GameSpot ("If you're {{looking for an}} intense shooter experience, Darkwatch will not disappoint") and Jeremy Dunham of IGN ("Cowboys, vampires, and sexy dead girls <b>are</b> <b>fun</b> in parties, {{but not so much}} alone"). According to the review by Cheat Code Central, [...] "just about every aspect of Darkwatch is cool. The environments are cool, the weapons are cool, the characters are cool and while the gameplay is not unique it's definitely one of the best first-person shooters on the Xbox and PS2. The controls alone are worth the price of admission." [...] John Scalzo of Gaming Target wrote that [...] "for anyone looking for something a little different out of their FPS experience, Darkwatch is that game." [...] The reviewer in GamePro wrote that Darkwatch [...] "mixes its Western Roots with gothic horror and steampunk aesthetics, and the results are uniquely engaging," [...] adding that if some the game's [...] "cooler" [...] concepts [...] "had been explored further, lengthening the game in the process, Darkwatch could've rivaled the best of the genre." [...] Official Xbox Magazine called it [...] "a solid and robust blaster that's tons of fun. Helped no end by the excellent Blood Powers and top multiplayer." ...|$|E

500|$|Lost Luggage {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. [...] Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz {{wrote in a}} 1982 issue of the magazine Electronic Games that Lost Luggage did not have [...] "the spark of greatness". While they praised the game for shifting away from [...] "the typical SF shoot-out" [...] and {{said that it was}} [...] "solid" [...] and [...] "playable", they remarked on its plain-looking graphics and said that [...] "even the greatest concept cannot make a great game when it isn't blended with an outstanding type of play action." [...] Writing for Video, Kunkel and Katz commented on the game's [...] "incredibly cute touches", but suggested that Apollo may have better [...] "scrimp on the frills" [...] in favor of additional gameplay challenges. Danny Goodman of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games wrote that [...] "graphics <b>are</b> <b>fun</b> to watch, but the game play for experienced players gets old fast". A reviewer for the magazine TV Gamer recommended the game for children, but felt that seasoned video game players would enjoy Kaboom! more. More positive opinions were from Videogaming Illustrated, which described the game as the most charming of Apollo's releases, and Texas Monthly, which described it as a [...] "fiendish little amusement." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers criticized or {{had little}} {{praise for the}} game's {{emphasis}} on collecting items and backtracking—"an interactive egg hunt". This had become a trend in the developer's games, and Donkey Kong 64 followed the [...] "predictable formula" [...] of making players collect multiple sets of items and those sets in full for a special ending. Next Generation also saw the developer creating a habit of backtracking in their games. GameSpot was more diplomatic: those who liked collecting items would be titillated by its replay value, {{and those who did}} not would be frustrated by its chores. The puzzles and minigames <b>are</b> <b>fun</b> the first time through, according to EGM, but they quickly become worn when replayed with increasingly tighter time restrictions. GameSpot, however, considered parts of Donkey Kong 64 gameplay [...] "cerebral", requiring the player to consider several simultaneous tasks to solve later puzzles. Already familiar with the game's concepts borrowed from Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, and Banjo-Kazooie, reviewers considered the game's tasks less innovative or interesting to decipher. In retrospective reviews, Nintendo Life described the chore of collecting objects [...] "excessive" [...] and repetitive. They suggested that backtracking, for instance, could be reduced by letting the player switch between characters at any time.|$|E
