The name had been used several times in science fiction, and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll {{conducted}} by New Scientist magazine ("Xena", despite only being a nickname, came fourth).

25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{to how the}} town of Modoc got its name.

Another theory is that Modoc was named after the Modoc people who were traditionally located in northern California.

25|$|In the elections, the TDP {{allied with}} the Sanjaya Vichara Manch party and decided to field educated {{candidates}} who had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>name</b> in the society and were not indulging in corruption, which was an innovative political concept at the time. NTR himself decided to contest from two assembly constituencies, Gudivada and Tirupati. NTR used many innovative ways of campaigning, such as being the first politician in India to use rath yatras for campaigning. However, it was MGR who had started the opentop van campaigning for elections, as {{it was felt that}} he can address the roadshows {{as an alternative to the}} mammoth meetings, which involves large amount of money as well as manpower. For this, he used a modified Chevrolet van which was given the name of Chaitanya Ratham. In this, NTR travelled across the state of Andhra Pradesh, crisscrossing all the districts. With his son Nandamuri Harikrishna, also a film actor, driving the van, NTR notched up over 75,000 kilometres during his campaign, a distinctive sight with the van's yellow party flags and banners and NTR sitting on top of the vehicle hailing the crowds. NTR campaigned for restoring the dignity of the Telugu people and advocated the forming a closer bond between the government and the common people, going into the elections with the slogan, Telugu Vari Atma Gauravam (lit. Telugu people's self-respect).|$|E

500|$|After an {{unauthorized}} paperback edition of The Lord of the Rings appeared from Ace Books in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine asked Tolkien to refresh {{the text of}} The Hobbit to renew the US copyright. This text became the 1966 third edition. Tolkien {{took the opportunity to}} align the narrative even more closely to The Lord of the Rings and to cosmological developments from his still unpublished Quenta Silmarillion as it stood at that time. These small edits included, for example, changing the phrase [...] "elves that are now called Gnomes" [...] from the first and second editions on page 63, to [...] "High Elves of the West, my kin" [...] in the third edition. Tolkien had used [...] "gnome" [...] in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the High Elves—the Noldor (or [...] "Deep Elves")—thinking [...] "gnome", derived from the Greek gnosis (knowledge), was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>name</b> for the wisest of the elves. However, because of its common denotation of a garden gnome, derived from the 16th-century Paracelsus, Tolkien abandoned the term.|$|E
500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>name</b> for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|The band {{initially}} {{intended to}} title the album Metal Up Your Ass with the cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger {{emerging from a}} toilet bowl. However, Zazula convinced them to change this as he thought distributors would not stock it. The final cover featured {{the shadow of a}} hand letting go of a bloodied hammer. Burton was credited with coming up with the name Kill 'Em All—referring to timid record distributors, saying, [...] "Those record company fuckers... kill 'em all!"—as a response to the situation. Ulrich thought Kill 'Em All was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>name,</b> and Zazula agreed. Burton suggested to Gary L. Heard, also responsible for the Metallica photograph on the back cover, to feature a bloodied hammer on the album art. According to Hammett, [...] "Cliff carried a hammer with him everywhere he went. He always had a hammer in his luggage, and he would take it out occasionally and start destroying things." [...] Even though the original title was unused, the band did later release a [...] "Metal Up Your Ass" [...] T-shirt with the proposed artwork. A live bootleg recording of a 1982 performance at the Old Waldorf, titled Metal Up Your Ass (Live), featured the original cover artwork. Original pressings of the album came with an inner sleeve that included pictures and lyrics as well as a silver label on the vinyl. Subsequent pressings had a blank white sleeve and standard album label. The 1988 reissue re-introduced the lyrics and photos. The original release can be distinguished by the words [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] {{at the top of the}} back cover. This was dropped from the reissue. The phrase [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] was dedicated to San Francisco fan Ray Burch, known for his headbanging at the band's early shows.|$|E

For if <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>name</b> is more precious than riches, a man, in being robbed of his good name, is no less injured than if he were robbed of his goods; while, in the latter case, false testimony is sometimes not less injurious than rapine committed by the hand.” ...|$|E
