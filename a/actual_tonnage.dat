This reflects the reappearing problem of overestimating the targets in the Gibraltar convoys, the commanders mistaking coasters with the engine aft as tankers and claiming normal ship sizes for North Atlantic convoys, while the average size of the ships in the convoy HG 73 was about 2,200 GRT, for example.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the treatise is to review the sample methodology and the exploration methods at a heavy mineral sands deposit. The level of confidence and the risk associated with the resource calculations will be established based on the sample methodology. Two drilling methods used at Hillendale are compared statistically and visually. It {{is clear from the}} comparison that the Wallis Aircore (WAC) method is significantly better than the Reverse Circulation (RCN) method. This is evident also when comparing results of the two methods with the recovery from the mined out areas. The WAC drilling method reduces the risk of downhole contamination due to the change in the drilling method allowing air to be forced back in an inner tube after the sample is collected compared to the air blowout of the RCN method. The WAC method reduces the variability introduced in the sample collection as compared to the RCN method. The average calculated value (for total heavy minerals (THM) and Ilmenite) of the global population for the two methods is similar. The reduced variability in the sample population of the WAC method results in a lower population being required for the confidence interval about the mean at a 95 % confidence level. The lower number of required samples results in a lowering of project cost. Blockmodels created from the two drilling methods are compared statistically (mode, median, standard deviation). The global mean of the input data compares well with the global mean of the estimated blockmodel. In reconciling the resource blockmodels with actual production data, the variability as introduced by the RCN drilling method is clear. The WAC drilling information produces a blockmodel with an acceptable level of variance (deviation of the geological model from the actual values obtained during mining) as defined by Hillendale mine management of less than 10 %. This is determined by reconciling the estimated geological blockmodel for a specific mined out area against the <b>actual</b> <b>tonnages</b> and plant recovery values achieved in the same area. Ultimately, because the drill spacing is standard in the mining operation under study, the required confidence in the mean might not be achieved by either of the two drilling methods in certain portions of the mine, but the results from the WAC method will be closer to the reality than the RCN method with the same number of drillholes. Three main risks are identified in the sample methodology; they have a high probability to occur or have a high cost impact. The risk inherent in sampling and analysis is the most important of the risks identified in this study. The risk can be effectively reduced by implementing a quality assurance and quality control programme (QAQC). The other high risks are introduced by the drilling method and drillhole spacing. The risk can be reduced by continuous improvement and keeping up to date with new developments in the industry such as improved drilling techniques and by improved knowledge of the ore-body. The knowledge will help in understanding the risk - It may become clear in the text how this can reduce the risk. In conclusion, the improvement and implementation of systems such as improved drilling technique and quality assurance and quality control programmes enables one to establish an acceptable confidence level in the resource calculation as well as reducing the inherent risk to an acceptable level for future decisions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unique method of monitoring {{the effectiveness of}} the planning process as well as the execution of mine plans. The method primarily determines the degree of deviation from the original mine plans by comparing actual mined areas to initially planned mining areas. The performance of mining operations is also measured by comparing <b>actual</b> and planned <b>tonnages</b> for a particular period. Once the degree of deviation from mine plans has been established the cause/s of the deviation can be determined through a simple fault tree analysis. Accurate identification of the reasons of deviation can aid the mine in selecting possible methods to correct the deviation. It is, however, {{beyond the scope of this}} paper to discuss the methods employed in correcting such deviations, as each mining operation will have unique causes of plan deviation and methods of remedying them. Deviations from the plan greatly affect the yields obtainable, which in turn affects the life of mine, thus having negative economic and financial implications. Accordingly, this paper {{presents a}} project management method which aims to reduce risk by improving planning systems to ensure optimum overall extraction of coal reserves...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of selected electronic transfer technology, i. e., digital imagery, utilized by Range Extension Specialists in Texas to assess rangeland conditions. The study was conducted near College Station, Texas during the Spring semester of 1999. Rangeland sites were assessed by three Range Extension Specialists; these sites represented actual quantity of forage tonnage per acre, height, stem diameter of woody species, percent weed and woody species, and weed and woody species identification. One objective was to determine the relationship between ''on-site'' and ''in-office'' recommendations made by Range Extension Specialists using digital images. The findings were: 1. No statistically significant differences existed among the five ''in-office'' Range Extension Specialists when making quantitative rangeland observations for tonnage per acre, while using only 35 mm digitized images. However, there was a high degree of variation in the observations. 2. "In-office'' Range Extension Specialists were extremely variable and tended to underestimate when assessing forage biomass per acre, although their estimates corresponded with an increase in <b>actual</b> forage <b>tonnage</b> per acre. Additional findings were: 1. Only the height of mesquite observation gave evidence to suggest any differences among "in-office'' specialists. 2. Much variation existed in all observations within and among specialists, except for height of mesquite. 3. "In-office" specialists varied extremely in assessing all the range sites, except for mesquite height and stem diameter sites. 4. The species of plants significantly affected accuracy in correctly identifying plants. The second objective was to determine the relationship between the quality of 35 mm camera digitized images and digital camera images. The finding was that no statistically significant difference existed for the type of camera used when making rangeland observations in this study. Overall conclusions were that Range Extension Specialists cannot accurately make rangeland recommendations from digital images using existing technology and no difference existed for the type of camera used when making estimations in this study...|$|R
40|$|Forecasting {{the size}} of the {{sugarcane}} crop is essential to the industry for optimising cane milling and sugar marketing. The SASA Experiment Station provides regular forecasts of mill and industry average cane yields from a climatic perspective. The usefulness of this information depends on its accuracy, and this communication reports briefly on this aspect. Future yields are calculated by applying the Canesim crop model to historic weather data, likely future weather scenarios, soil characteristics and management practices. Data from approximately 70 weather and rainfall stations are used to simulate the crop for each month of the milling season. Mean yields are calculated for homogenous climate zones, mill areas and the industry as a whole, and are expressed {{as a percentage of the}} yield from the previous season. The information is disseminated to the industry bi-monthly from February to August. Estimation accuracy was determined by calculating the relative mean absolute error between estimated and <b>actual</b> <b>tonnage.</b> Actual yields were adjusted for long term trends in harvest age, the extent of the area that receives irrigation, and any water restrictions. This was compared with the inter-annual coefficient of variation in actual yields to assess the potential value of the forecasts. The mean absolute error (MAE) for the industry estimate was 6. 6 % compared with an inter-annual variation in actual yield of 15. 4 %. This suggests that the industry cane crop estimate should be of value to decision-makers. On average, the MAE at the mill level was 12 %, and ranged from 26 % for Komatipoort to 8 % for Amatikulu. These results indicate that, although further improvements to estimates are needed for irrigated mill areas, the estimates for most dryland areas are sufficiently accurate to be of value to mill management...|$|E
40|$|Excess fishing {{capacity}} {{and the growth}} in global demand for fishery products have made overfishing ubiquitous in the world's oceans. Here we describe the potential catch losses due to unsustainable fishing in all countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and {{on the high seas}} over 1950 - 2004. To do so, we relied upon catch and price statistics from the Sea Around Us Project as well as an empirical relationship we derived from species stock assessments by the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 2000 alone, estimated global catch losses amounted to 7 - 36 % of the <b>actual</b> <b>tonnage</b> landed that year, resulting in a landed value loss of between $ 6. 4 and 36 billion (in 2004 constant US$). From 1950 - 2004, 36 - 53 % of commercial species in 55 - 66 % of EEZs may have been overfished. Referring to a species-level database of intrinsic vulnerability (V) based on life-history traits, it appears that susceptible species were depleted quickly and serially, with the average V of potential catch losses declining at a similar rate to that of actual landings. The three continental regions to incur greatest losses by mass were Europe, North America, and Asia-forming a geographic progression in time. But low-income and small island nations, heavily dependent on marine resources for protein, were impacted most profoundly. Our analysis shows that without the inexorable march of overfishing, ~ 20 million people worldwide could have averted undernourishment in 2000. For the same year, total catch in the waters of low-income food deficit nations might have been up to 17 % greater than the tonnage actually landed there. The situation may be worst for Africa, which in our analysis registered losses of about 9 - 49 % of its actual catches by mass in year 2000, thus seriously threatening progress towards the UN Millennium Development Goals...|$|E
40|$|Prior to 1928, the Pacific {{mackerel}} fishery was {{of minor}} importance, the catch being almost wholly {{absorbed by the}} fresh fish trade. Since that year, a large scale canning industry has developed in Southern California with an almost unlimited demand for fish. The bulk of the catch is processed in the Los Angeles Harbor area though large tonnages are handled at Newport Beach, some thirty miles to the south. Small amounts are canned at San Diego and at Ensenada, Mexico, the southern limit of the fishery. In Central California, mackerel are sometimes landed mixed with sardines (Sardinops caerulea) caught by the San Francisco and Monterey purse seine fleets. The quantity taken is rarely sufficient to warrant segregation for canning, and the mixed loads {{are for the most}} part reduced as "sardines. " As a result, there is no record of the <b>actual</b> <b>tonnage</b> of mackerel handled at these ports. The Southern California fishery for the canneries was at first prosecuted largely by net boats, first the lampara and later the purse seine fleet accounting for most of the catch. Since 1939, the emphasis has shifted to a large fleet of small "scoop" boats. The crews of these vessels, usually two or three men, fish with ground bait and dip the mackerel with a long-handled brail. The total catch has fluctuated widely from year to year with little relation to economic demand. Monthly landings reach a peak in the fall and winter months; there is a period of scarcity, apparently associated with spawning, which usually occurs in the spring but sometimes extends from mid-winter to early summer. For the period covered by this report the season is regarded as commencing in June and closing the following March. The biological range of the species far exceeds the commercial, extending from the Gulf of Alaska southward into the Gulf of California. Mackerel are known to be abundant along much of the Lower California coast and heavy spawning occurs in Mexican waters. The population is apparently limited north of Central California and does not support a fishery above Monterey Bay. The mackerel fleet operating out of Los Angeles Harbor (including for this report the City of Long Beach as well as the San Pedro, Wilmington and Terminal Island districts which comprise Los Angeles Harbor proper) exploits {{a large portion of the}} waters off Southern California. The purse seine fleet for both mackerel and sardines ranges from near Pt. Conception in the north to the Oceanside region in the south, and offshore to the Channel Islands. The scoop fleet covers Santa Monica Bay, the mainland coast as far south as Newport Beach, and offshore around Santa Catalina Island. Virtually the entire catch landed at Newport Beach is made by scoop boats fishing along the mainland coast between Huntington Beach and San Onofre and at Santa Catalina Island. At times this fleet will work south to Oceanside. Fishing at San Diego is carried on within twenty-five miles of port and is generally of minor significance. At the present time (1948), there is no regular mackerel fishery in Central California. Until about 1941, a small hook-and-line fleet operated in Monterey Bay, supplying the fresh fish markets. The sardine fleet, which takes mackerel incidentally, operates between Pt. Reyes (30 miles northwest of San Francisco) and Pt. Buchon, about 100 miles south of Monterey. The San Francisco fleet fishes from north of Pt. Reyes to Monterey Bay. With the tremendous increase in the commercial importance of mackerel, the California Division of Fish and Game instituted a research program designed to provide sufficient knowledge of the species to permit its proper management. Of basic importance was an understanding of the movements of the fish — whether the Southern California fishery was exploiting one or more of several independent populations existing throughout the range or whether and to what degree fish from other areas contributed to the local catch. The tagging program was devised originally in 1935 with this question in mind. It later seemed possible that tag returns might be used in studies of abundance and an intensified program was pursued in 1940 and 1941. With the outbreak of war, field work was greatly curtailed, though a few fish were tagged in the winter of 1942 – 43. Tags were collected through the 1946 – 47 season. Three progress reports have been issued. These papers give more detailed information as to fishing methods and tagging techniques than is contained in the present publication, which does summarize the more pertinent data. The tagging program demonstrated that mackerel from as far north as Oregon and as far south as the central portion of Lower California eventually entered the Southern California fishery. There was no evidence of a cyclic movement, although tagging in Lower California was not so conducted as to show such movement. There were indications of gradual dispersion over a period of years from the point of release. No fish were tagged south of central Lower California. There were few returned from this region and it seems probable that mackerel from farther south contribute little to the fishery...|$|E
