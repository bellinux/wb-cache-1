5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E

5|$|Operation Yoav {{had left}} Faluja as an enclave within Israeli-held {{territory}} and during November 1948 the Hammers routinely returned to bomb {{what became known}} as the Faluja Pocket. The town would nonetheless hold out until the end of the war. On December 22 Israel launched Operation Horev, its last major offensive of the war, to finally defeat the Egyptian expeditionary force and expel it beyond the borders of Mandatory Palestine. 69 Squadron once again flew in support of Israeli efforts in the south, targeting the air base at El-Arish, Khan Younis, Gaza and Rafah. The squadron also revisited Faluja to prevent <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> sortie from the beleaguered pocket, and on New Year's Day 1949 flew a failed attempt to bomb <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> Navy flotilla which had shelled Tel Aviv. 69 Squadron flew its last missions of the war in the early morning of January 7, 1949, against Rafah. Having evaded Egyptian flak on most occasions, both participating bombers were hit, rendering one unserviceable.|$|E

5|$|A {{receiving}} station was formed from the immobile sections of light horse and mounted rifle brigades' field ambulances, a section from the 1/1st Welsh and the 157th Indian Field Ambulances with an operating unit, the Anzac Field Laboratory, and a detachment from <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> hospital.

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, Reshef {{focused on}} clearing the Tirtur Road. He left {{a battalion of}} around 30 tanks between the junction and {{the western part of}} the Chinese Farm, and prepared to attack with two armored battalions provided by Sharon. He concentrated on the section of the Tirtur Road defended by <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> battalion forming the left flank of the 16th Infantry Brigade. One of Reshef's battalions attacked from the north-east, the other from the west. The Egyptian battalion managed to halt the advance, aided by fire from tanks and anti-tank weapons on the slopes of Missouri, a hill north-west of the Chinese Farm, causing Reshef to break off his attack.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>Egyptian</b> historian, {{known by}} his Greek name as Manetho (c. 3rd century BC), {{was the first}} to compile a {{comprehensive}} history of Egypt. Manetho was active during the reign of Ptolemy II (r. 283–246 BC) and used The Histories by the Greek Herodotus (c. 484 BC–c. 425 BC) as his main source of inspiration for a history of Egypt written in Greek. However, the primary sources for Manetho's work were the king list chronicles of previous Egyptian dynasties.|$|E

5|$|In 332BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt {{with little}} {{resistance}} from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom, was based on <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous Library of Alexandria. The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit {{the way for the}} many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-450s the Athenians {{launched}} an unsuccessful attempt to aid <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> revolt against Persia, {{which led to}} a prolonged siege of a Persian fortress in the Nile Delta. The campaign culminated in disaster; the besieging force was defeated and destroyed. In 451–450 BC the Athenians sent troops to Cyprus. Cimon defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, but died of disease in 449BC. Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and Cyprus, although some researchers, such as Karl Julius Beloch, argue that the dispatch of such a great fleet conforms with the spirit of Cimon's policy.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{remains an}} iconic {{figure in the}} Arab world, {{particularly}} for his strides towards social justice and Arab unity, modernization policies, and anti-imperialist efforts. His presidency also encouraged and coincided with <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> cultural boom, and launched large industrial projects, including the Aswan Dam and Helwan City. Nasser's detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his human rights violations and his dominance of military over civil institutions, establishing a pattern of military and dictatorial rule in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Operation Badr, <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> {{military}} operation, had {{the objective}} of crossing the Suez Canal and seizing the Bar Lev line of fortifications. Three of these fortifications, codenamed Budapest, Orkal and Lahtzanit, fell within the area of operations of the Port Said Military Sector. Commanded by Major General Omar Khaled, the sector was a military command independent of the Egyptian Second Field Army to the south. The military sector incorporated the towns of Port Said and Port Fouad on the Mediterranean Sea and surrounding areas. Two independent infantry brigades, the 30th and 135th, were under the military sector's command along with some coast guard units.|$|E

5|$|The IDF command {{did not see}} {{the forces}} in the western Negev as {{sufficient}} to fully stop <b>an</b> <b>Egyptian</b> invasion, wherever it was headed, and ordered an operation to stop or delay the advancing column. The command also feared that the Arab forces would try to create facts on the ground before the impending UN-imposed ceasefire. The two Arab forces that were considered a threat were the Iraqis in the Triangle (Jenin–Nablus–Tulkarm) and the Egyptians at Majdal–Isdud. Thus, Golani and Carmeli were to attack Jenin, Alexandroni was to harass Tulkarm, and Givati was to attack Isdud.|$|E
