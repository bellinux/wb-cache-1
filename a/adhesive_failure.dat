In this case, the adhesive remains intact and is still bonded to one substrate and remnants of the other. For example, when one removes a price label, the adhesive usually remains on the label and the surface. This is cohesive failure. If, however, a layer of paper remains stuck to the surface, the adhesive has not failed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a resin coating technique on dentin tensile bond strengths of dual-cured resin cements. METHODS: 10 bovine dentin specimens were tested for tensile bond strengths of each of the following four materials: Panavia F, Link Max, Bistite II, Rely-X. Bovine dentin ground with 600 -grit SiC was bonded with a resin cement according to the manufacturers' instructions or the resin coating technique, which was used in combination with one coat of a dentin adhesive; Clearfil SE Bond, Unifil Bond, One-Up Bond F or Single Bond, with one coat of a low viscosity micro-filled resin, Protect Liner-F. Each dentin adhesive and the low viscosity micro-filled resin were cured for 10 seconds and 20 seconds respectively. After 1 day storage in water, the specimens were subjected to the tensile bond test at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/minute. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test (P 0. 05). Regarding the fracture modes, complete and partial <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> were observed in the cases without resin coating. For the resin coating groups, the fracture modes were much more complicated, although, <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> rarely occurred.

40|$|A major {{unresolved}} {{problem of}} the ultrasonic testing of adhesive bonds concerns the relation between quantities measured by ultrasonic methods and the actual ultimate strength of the bond. In this paper it is postulated that <b>adhesive</b> <b>failure</b> is preceded by nonlinear behavior which can be represented by a simple relation between tractions and gross displacement increments across the adhesive layer. The effects of this nonlinear behavior on various wave phenomena, including reflection for normal incidence, interface waves, and antiplane transverse wave have been investigated. The overall objective is to obtain information when the adhesive is pulled in the nonlinear range, either by the wave system itself or by {{the application of a}} large static deformation on which the ultrasonic wave motion has been superimposed. The nonlinear parameters which can be extracted from the ultrasonic data, in principle allow an extrapolation to the point of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failure.</b> For a detailed discussion of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failure</b> and other failure mechanisms in adhesives, we refer to Ref.

30|$|The <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> {{indicate}} a rupture {{of the bond}} at the dentin/composite interface, the cohesive fractures breaking the dentin or composite, while mixed-type fractures, indicate cohesive disruption in the composite and adhesive in the dentin [24].

Therefore, the higher prevalence of adhesive fractures indicated that the bond strength of the specimens was analyzed and not the internal resistance of the material.|$|R

Objective: Evaluate the influence of ozone pretreatment on the shear strength of an etch-and-rinse and a self-etch system to enamel and analyze the respective failure modes.

Specimens were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n= 15) : Group G 1 (Excite&# 174; with ozone) and group G 3 (AdheSE&# 174; with ozone) were prepared with ozone gas from the HealOzone unit (Kavo&# 174;) for 20 s prior to adhesion, and groups G 2 (Excite&# 174;) and G 4 (AdheSE&# 174;) were used as control. Teeth were bisected and polished to simulate a smear layer just before the application of the adhesive systems. The adhesives were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions to a standardized 3 mm diameter surface, and a composite (Synergy D 6, Coltene Whaledent) cylinder with 2 mm increments was build. Specimens were stored in 100 % humidity for 24 h at 37 &# 176;C and then subjected to a thermal cycling regimen of 500 cycles. Shear bond tests were performed with a Watanabe device in a universal testing machine at 5 mm/min. The failure mode was analyzed under scanning electron microscope. Means and standard deviation of shear bond strength (SBS) were calculated and difference between the groups was analyzed using ANOVA, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Levene and Bonferroni. Chi-squared statistical tests were used to evaluate the failure modes. Results: Mean bond strength values and failure modes were as follows: G 1 - 26. 85 &# 177; 6. 18 MPa (33. 3 % of adhesive cohesive failure); G 2 - 27. 95 &# 177; 5. 58 MPa (53. 8 % of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> between enamel and adhesive); G 3 - 15. 0 &# 177; 3. 84 MPa (77. 8 % of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> between enamel and adhesive) and G 4 - 13. 1 &# 177; 3. 68 MPa (36. 4 % of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> between enamel and adhesive).

A two-step self-etch adhesive, Clearﬁl SE Bond(SE; Kuraray) and a one-step self-etch adhesive, Clearﬁl S 3 Bond (S 3; Kuraray) were applied to dentin surfaces and light-cured. Composite build-ups were performed using Filtek Z 250 (3 M ESPE). For lTBS evaluation, composite-dentin beams of 0. 8 mm 2 were stressed to failure at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} between polymers {{and concrete}} {{is complex and}} needs to be studied with adequate methods. One problem is about the best test to determine adhesion strength. The use of traditional tests like direct tension, flexure or shear, normally does not enable the correct determination of the adhesion strength. If the adhesive is good and the substrate’s surfaces are well prepared, the failure is in the substrate. With this kind of faitures it is possible to say that adhesion strength is higher than the failure stress. It is not possible to give a numerical value of adhesion strength. A test based on fracture mechanics makes the determination of adhesion strength easier. The use of a notched specimen concentrates the stresses in the poliymer/substrate joint and <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> are more frequent. With <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures,</b> it is possibie to determine the numerical value of the adhesion strength. The results’ analysis of adhesion tests needs to be made using appropriate methods. The presentation of the results is made in accordance with a square optimisation method where the adhesion in tension and the failure mode are taken into consideration. The use of this method is exemplified with results of adhesion tests for concrete/epoxies resins. The incorporation of fillers into the epoxies enabies a good adhesion even when Lhe concrete is wet. Tension tests were made to study the influence of the type, the granulometry and the quantity of the filler on the behaviour of the bonds...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} use of adhesives {{in industry}} has boosted the search for tests which allow the adherence level to be defined. These tests, {{depending on the type}} of load, examine different stresses, failure modes and mixed modes. Furthermore, these tests can be focused either on initiation or propagation of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failure.</b> The subject of this study is the initiation of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failure.</b> The initiation of failure can be determined with the 3 -point bending test. Trials of 3 -point bending tests were conducted on an aluminum 2024 substrate, with two different thicknesses, in order to understand the impact of the adherend thickness. The aluminum substrate received different types of surface pre-treatment: acetone cleaning, hydrochloric acid etching or aminopropyltriethoxysilane coating. Two adhesives were used: the first one was a mixture of epoxy pre-polymer DGEBA and DETA amine, whereas the second was a commercially formulated adhesive, ELECOLIT 6604. The initiation of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failure</b> was obtained by 3 -point bending test and verified with SEM analysis. The failure loads measured enabled the effect of surface treatment on <b>adhesive</b> <b>failure</b> to be revealed: the results indicate that the surface treatment with silane is the most efficient in comparison to hydrochloric acid etching and of course to the simple acetone degreasing. It was assumed that the scatter of the results obtained for each series is due to the variation of the “intrinsic” adherence between the adhesive and the substrate. Furthermore, it was noted that the failure loads for different substrate thicknesses cannot be compared due to the effect of the thickness: it was therefore not possible to simply compare results obtained for different thicknesses of the same substrate for a given substrate-adhesive system. The energy approach proposed in this study makes it possible. The energy requested to initiate the <b>adhesive</b> <b>failure</b> for a given system can then be known, whatever the initial geometry of the 3 -point bending test is. However, it was also shown that the thickness of the substrate must be correctly chosen. A thick substrate increases the dispersion and a thin substrate may induce local unwelcome plastic strain. In conclusion, this study allows to define an energy criteria for adhesives failure initiation...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The oral {{environment}} {{is subject to}} biofilm accumulation and cariogenic challenge, and few studies exist {{on the effect of}} these factors on the bond strength of adhesive systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} test if the exposure of adhesive interfaces to cariogenic challenge under biofilm accumulation could promote higher degradation than the exposure to biofilm accumulation alone. Material And Methods: Five molars were ground until exposure of medium dentin and then restored (Single Bond 2 and Z 250 3 M ESPE). The tooth/resin sets were cut to obtain beam-shaped specimens, which were distributed according to the aging conditions (n= 20) : water for 24 h (control); biofilm under cariogenic challenge for 3, 5 or 10 days; biofilm without cariogenic challenge for 10 days; and water for 3 months. Microcosm biofilms were formed from human saliva and grown in a saliva analogue medium, supplemented or not with sucrose to promote cariogenic challenge. Specimens were tested for microtensile bond strength, and failure modes were classified using light microscopy. Bond strength data were analyzed using ANOVA and failure modes were analyzed using ANOVA on ranks (&# 945;= 0. 05). Results: No significant differences in bond strength were detected among the aging methods (P= 0. 248). The aging period was associated with an increase in the frequency of <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> for the groups aged for 10 days or longer (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective. This study {{evaluated}} a new approach, named {{dimethyl sulfoxide}} (DMSO) -wet bonding, {{to produce more}} desirable long-term prospects for the ultrafine interactions between synthetic polymeric biomaterials and the inherently hydrated dentin substrate. Methods. Sound third molars were randomly restored with/without DMSO pretreatment using a total-etch (Scocthbond Multipurpose: SBMP) and a self-etch (Clearfil SE Bond: CF) adhesive systems. Restored teeth (n = 10) /group were sectioned into sticks and submitted to different analyses: micro-Raman determined the degree of conversion inside the hybrid layer (DC); resin dentin microtensile bond strength and fracture pattern analysis at 24 h, 1 year and 2 years of aging; and nanoleakage evaluation at 24 h and 2 years. Results. DMSO-wet bonding produced significantly higher 24 h bond strengths for SBMP that were sustained over the two-year period, with significantly less <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures.</b> Similarly, DMSO-treated CF samples presented significantly higher bond strength than untreated samples at two years. Both adhesives had significant less <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures</b> at 2 years with DMSO. DMSO {{had no effect on}} DC of SBMP, but significantly increased the DC of CE DMSO-treated SBMP samples presented reduced silver uptake compared to untreated samples after aging. Significance. Biomodification of the dentin substrate by the proposed strategy using DMSO is a suitable approach to produce more durable hybrid layers with superior ability to withstand hydrolytic degradation over time. Although the active role of DMSO on dentin bond improvement may vary according to monomer composition, its use seems to be effective on both self-etch and etch-and-rinse bonding mechanisms.

Controls were abraded with 600 -grit SiC paper. A two-step self-etching adhesive, Clearfil SE Bond (SE, Kuraray) and a one-step self-etching adhesive, Clearfil S 3 Bond (S 3, Kuraray) were applied to dentin surfaces and light cured. Composite buildups were performed using Filtek Z 250 (3 M ESPE). For μTBS evaluation, composite-dentin beams of 0. 8 mm 2 were stressed to failure at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The μTBS data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests. Representative fractured beams from each group were prepared for fractographic analysis under SEM. Results: Two-way ANOVA showed that the effects of dentin surface preparations, adhesive systems, and their interaction were statistically significant (p < 0. 001). The μTBS was the highest when bonding SE to dentin surface prepared with 600 -grit SiC abrasive paper (47. 3 ± 7. 4 MPa), followed by high-speed tungsten carbide burs (40. 8 ± 6. 1 MPa), and the lowest when bonding S 3 to dentin surfaces prepared with a high-speed diamond bur (15. 2 ± 6. 2 MPa).

RESULTS: Mean fracture loads were 255 N (SD= 108 N) for Group A, 599 N (SD= 465 N) for Group B and 786 N (SD= 197 N) for Group C (values significantly different, all p values < 0. 05). Group A showed purely <b>adhesive</b> <b>failures,</b> while Groups B and C showed 73 and 53 % fractures of remaining tooth substrate (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Mini FRC anchors increase fracture resistance of reattached coronal fragments, but induce more remaining tooth substrate fractures...|$|R
