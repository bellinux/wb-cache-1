50|$|Copper {{has a high}} conductivity. <b>Annealed</b> <b>copper</b> is the {{international}} standard to which all other electrical conductors are compared. The main grade of copper used for electrical applications, such as building wire, motor windings, cables and busbars, is electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper (CW004A or ASTM designation C100140). This copper has an electrical conductivity of at least 100% IACS (International <b>Annealed</b> <b>Copper</b> Standard). If high conductivity copper must be welded or brazed or used in a reducing atmosphere, then oxygen-free high conductivity copper (CW008A or ASTM designation C10100) may be used.

The {{effects of the}} film deposition method, annealing temperature, film thickness, annealing gas, and patterning by photolithography are systematically investigated. Long and aligned nanowires can only be formed within a narrow temperature range from 400 to 500 °C. Electroplated copper film is favourable for the nanowire growth, compared to that deposited by thermal evaporation. <b>Annealing</b> <b>copper</b> thin film in static air produces large-area, uniform, but not well vertically aligned nanowires along the thin film surface. <b>Annealing</b> <b>copper</b> thin film under a N 2 /O 2 gas flow generates vertically aligned, but not very uniform nanowires on large areas. Patterning copper thin film by photolithography helps to synthesize large-area, uniform, and vertically aligned nanowires along the film surface. The copper thin film is converted into bicrystal CuO nanowires, Cu 2 O film, and also perhaps some CuO film after the thermal treatment in static air.

40|$|AbstractThe micro cutting {{mechanism}} {{is very different}} from the macro cutting process, where the workpiece is not considered as isotropic solid. Hence the effect of microstructure on the micro {{cutting mechanism}} needs to be further studied. In this paper, pure copper with two different grain sizes was machined by the natural single crystal diamond cutting tool, in order to study the effect of microstructure on the machined surface integrity and chip formation, during the micro cutting process. According to the experimental results, the hardness of original pure copper was higher than the <b>annealed</b> pure <b>copper</b> due to the grain boundary strengthening. The grain boundary can be found in the machined surface of <b>annealed</b> pure <b>copper.</b> As for original pure copper, the grain boundary is absent and the surface had only traces of tool path. In the grain boundary, the height of peak-valley is larger than that inside grain. The following indicates that the reduction of grain size will reduce the effect of microstructure on the surface integrity in the micro cutting process. With the decreasing of feed rate, cutting chip's shape changed from continuous to segmented at the same depth of cut (DOC) in both original and <b>annealed</b> pure <b>copper.</b> The chip of <b>annealed</b> pure <b>copper</b> is more segmented than the original copper at some cutting conditions...|$|R

The purest modern copper wire is a better conductor, measuring over 103% on this scale. The gains are from two sources. First, modern copper is more pure. However, this avenue for improvement seems at an end. Making the copper purer still makes no significant improvement. Second, annealing and other processes have been improved. Annealing reduces the dislocations and other crystal defects which are sources of resistance. But the resulting wires are still polycrystalline. The grain boundaries and remaining crystal defects are responsible for some residual resistance. This can be quantified and better understood by examining single crystals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel technique for joining similar and dissimilar metal foils, namely micro clinching with cutting by laser shock forming. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to study the deformation behavior of single layer material, during which many important process parameters were determined. The process window of the 1060 pure aluminum foils and <b>annealed</b> <b>copper</b> foils produced by micro clinching with cutting was analyzed. Moreover, similar material combination (<b>annealed</b> <b>copper</b> foils) and dissimilar material combination (1060 pure aluminum foils and 304 stainless steel foils) were successfully achieved.

In addition, the mechanical strength of different material combinations joined by micro clinching with cutting was measured in single lap shearing tests. According to the achieved results, this novel technique is more suitable for material combinations where the upper foil is thicker than lower foil. With the increase of laser energy, the interlock increased while the minimum thickness of upper foil decreased gradually.
