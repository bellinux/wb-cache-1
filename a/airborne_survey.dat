40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of investigations to determine accurate positions of aircrafts in <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys</b> (<b>airborne</b> gravity and airborne lidar) using precise point positioning, and also introduces a new so called “stepwise geometric misalignment determination ” method to retrieve the airborne lidar system misalignment angle by automating the matching of lidar data with ground truth. Kinematic GPS positioning has been widely used, but the available commercial software systems are normally only suitable for the short or medium range kinematic baseline. However, in polar areas, <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys</b> have baselines ranging from a few hundred kilometers to even more than one thousand kilometers due to logistic limitations. It is a challenge to the traditional kinematic GPS software based on double differenced models, such as GPSurvey or GrafNav. Since Zumberge demonstrated the perfect performance of point positioning for kinematic applications, the precise point positioning attracted a lot of attention and opened a new alternative door to kinematic positioning...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the UK’s {{industrial}} past, spoil heaps are widespread through our environment and encompass the waste products from a variety of different industrial processes. Two high-resolution <b>airborne</b> geophysical <b>surveys,</b> conducted over parts of the UK in 1998 and 1999, identified four radiometric anomalies in the East Shirebrook region corresponding to four areas of colliery spoil. These areas which are composed of shales, siltstones and sandstones extracted during mining mixed with left over coal displayed elevated potassium, uranium and thorium, relative to their surroundings. Ground follow-up work was undertaken at Shirebrook and Warsop Vale, the two disused collieries from the four radiometric anomalies identified by the <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys</b> in the East Shirebrook area. Active extraction ceased at these mines in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s and both have been undergoing reclamation and re-landscaping. The ground survey entailed ground-based continuous gamma spectrometry traverses over accessible parts of each site, ground-based static gamma spectrometry measurements over transects of the sites, surface soil sampling at these transect points for laboratory XRF analysis and short core sampling at Warsop Vale for gamma spectrometry analysis on a core logger. The ground survey confirmed, and more accurately delineated the anomalies observed by the <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys.</b> The ground-based continuous gamma spectrometry highlighted the marked difference between the radiometric signature of the spoil heaps and neighbouring agricultural land. A high degree of spatial variation was apparent in the ground-based gamma spectrometry data and highlighted that the spoil itself is not a uniform mass. Ground survey static gamma spectrometry results and XRF analysis of surface soil samples correlate significantly. Comparison of these surface soil samples (0 - 15 cm) obtained at both Shirebrook and Warsop Vale to regional Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) surface soil samples obtained up to 1 km from the spoil tips showed that thorium was the element most elevated above background. The radiometric data from the two <b>airborne</b> <b>surveys</b> correlate at the 99. 95...|$|R

5000|$|Alfred Ritscher was skipper of the [...] "German Arctic Expedition" [...] of 1912-1913, {{under the}} command of Herbert Schröder-Stranz, which {{departed}} from Tromsø in the motor vessel [...] "Herzog Ernst" [...] for a preliminary reconnaissance of a planned navigation of the Northeast Passage. He also took over the leadership of the <b>airborne</b> <b>survey</b> of the expedition and obtained a pilot licence. The expedition failed whislt attempting the crossing of the Nordaustlandet island in northeastern Spitsbergen archipelago, because of poor equipment, misjudged weather and starting too late in the year. Ritscher marched over 210 km in seven and a half days, to the settlement of Longyearbyen. Search expeditions were sent after his message about the fate of the Schroeder-Stranz expedition and saved six of the fourteen missing expedition members.|$|E
5000|$|The Geophysics {{department}} had {{just bought a}} small, portable geiger counter, which did respond well to the gamma rays coming from rock samples Cook had gathered from the Mauch Chunk camotite outcrop.

Recent studies have shown how spectroscopic techniques {{can be used to}} estimate soil properties and airborne spectroscopy could be an effective means to aid continuous mapping of soil properties across the landscape.
