40|$|The {{presence}} of Giardia genotypes {{was investigated in}} 18 raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and 80 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on one farm. To demonstrate Giardia cysts, fresh and trichrome stained smears were microscopically screened. Two molecular markers were used for Giardia genotyping: a fragment of the beta-giardin gene and a fragment of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene. All faecal samples obtained from red foxes were negative. [i]Giardia[/i] cysts were identified only in 2 of the 18 raccoon dogs. The result of genotyping and phylogenetic analysis showed that the G. duodenalis from both raccoon dogs belonged to the D assemblage. This finding of a new animal reservoir of G. duodenalis canids-specific genotypes is important in order to eliminate the risk of infecting other <b>animals</b> <b>bred</b> <b>for</b> <b>fur.</b> Further molecular analyses of Giardia isolates in raccoon dogs are required. The present study represents the first contribution to knowledge of G. duodenalis genotypes in raccoon dogs...|$|R

40|$|Rapid acute {{neuronal}} tolerance (RANT) to the depressant ef-fects {{of ethanol}} (EtOH) is a desensitization of EtOH-induced depression of neuronal firing that develops {{over the first}} 5 to 7 min of EtOH exposure.

50|$|The {{international}} trade in chinchilla fur {{goes back to the}} 16th century. Their fur is popular in the fur trade due to its extremely soft feel, which is caused by the sprouting of 60 hairs (on average) from each hair follicle. The color is usually very even, which makes it ideal for small garments or the lining of large garments, though some large garments can be made entirely from the fur. A single, full-length coat made from chinchilla fur may require as many as 150 pelts, as chinchillas are relatively small. Their use <b>for</b> <b>fur</b> led to the extinction of one species, and put serious pressure on the other two.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} sow and piglet traits and the relationship between them in <b>animals</b> <b>bred</b> <b>for</b> conventional production kept in organic outdoor and indoor environments. 40 sows were studied during a seven week lactation. In parity one and three the sows farrowed outdoors (April to September) in huts and were moved to family grazing paddocks two weeks post partum (pp). In parity two and four the sows farrowed indoors (October to March) in individual pens and were moved to family pens with deep straw bedding two weeks pp. High backfat and weight loss during lactation was related to low piglet mortality and the relationship was stronger outdoors than indoors. Large litters had lower piglet growth than small litters and the relationship was stronger indoors than outdoors. Sows with larger litters were thinner and lighter at weaning than sows with smaller litters and the relationships were stronger outdoors than indoors. Our interpretation is that the outdoor environment stimulates sows to mobilise their energy reserves and produce milk, to a larger extent than the indoor environment does...|$|R

The possible interactions between selected and excluded genes cannot be readily studied in transgenic or knockout animals but may be addressed by crossing <b>animals</b> <b>bred</b> <b>for</b> opposite traits and studying the F- 2 offspring. Ninety-seven percent of Wistar-derived rats selectively <b>bred</b> <b>for</b> their voluntary low-alcohol consumption display a mutated nuclear allele of aldehyde dehydrogenase Aldh 2 (2) that encodes an enzyme with a low affinity for NAD(+), whereas rats <b>bred</b> <b>for</b> high-alcohol consumption do not present the Aldh 2 (2) allele. This enzyme is inserted into mitochondria, where NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) regenerates NAD(+). The possible influence of complex I on ALDH 2 activity and voluntary ethanol intake was investigated. Homozygous Aldh 2 (2) /Aldh 2 (2) rats derived from a line of high-drinker F- 0 females (and low-drinker F- 0 males) showed a markedly higher ethanol consumption (3. 9 +/- 0. 5 g. kg(- 1). day(- 1)) than homozygous animals derived from a line of low-drinker F- 0 females (and high-drinker F- 0 males) (1. 8 +/- 0. 4 g. kg(- 1). day(- 1)). Mitochondria of F- 2 rats derived from high alcohol-consuming females were more active in oxidizing substrates that generate NADH for complex I than were mitochondria derived from low alcohol-consuming females, leading in the former to higher rates of acetaldehyde metabolism and to a reduced aversion to ethanol. This is the first demonstration that maternally derived genes can either allow or counteract the phenotypic expression of a mutated gene in the context of alcohol abuse or alcoholism...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{breed in}} the rabbit fur farming {{industry}} is the Rex (Castor Rex and Chinchilla Rex). Breeding animals are kept {{for up to}} 3 years, and usually give birth twice a year. The kits are taken from their mothers at 4 weeks old {{and put in a}} nursery with other kits. After this the mothers are kept separated from their kits, and they get put together only for feeding. When the kits are 7 to 8 weeks old, they are put in solitary cages, where they are kept for about 6-7 months, and are harvested after they have shed their winter fur. The rabbits are kept in bare wire mesh cages. A cage for one rabbit has the floor space of about two shoe boxes. The mortality rate for caged Rex is 10 - 15%, mostly from respiratory disease.
