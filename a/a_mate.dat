5|$|Some beetles have {{intricate}} mating behaviour. Pheromone {{communication is}} often important in locating <b>a</b> <b>mate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} cavity {{and begin to}} build nests {{in order to attract}} single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as <b>a</b> <b>mate.</b> The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting <b>a</b> <b>mate.</b> The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets live {{almost entirely}} below ground, digging tunnels of {{different}} kinds for the major functions of life, including feeding, escape from predators, attracting <b>a</b> <b>mate</b> (by singing), mating, and raising of young.|$|E

50|$|Reduce rate of {{offspring}} produced: Females {{can sometimes}} adjust rates of oviposition {{to determine the}} number of successful offspring a male's sperm will produce after <b>a</b> <b>mating</b> event. In the leaf-rolling frog, females can delay spawn times which determines the number of final offspring produced from <b>a</b> <b>mating</b> event.|$|R

5|$|Taking {{refuge from}} another angry mob in a crypt, the Monster spies Pretorius {{and his cronies}} Karl (Dwight Frye) and Ludwig (Ted Billings) {{breaking}} open a grave. The henchmen depart as Pretorius stays to enjoy a light supper. The Monster approaches Pretorius, and learns that Pretorius plans to create <b>a</b> <b>mate</b> for him.|$|E
5|$|The Ice Queen (voiced by Grey DeLisle)– The Ice Queen is the gender-swapped {{version of}} the Ice King. Much like her male counterpart, the Ice Queen is {{constantly}} scheming to kidnap <b>a</b> <b>mate</b> (her most frequent target being Prince Gumball).|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take <b>a</b> <b>mate.</b> Female leaders are inhibited from taking <b>a</b> <b>mate</b> or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations {{for the evolution of}} this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources. This divergence may have arisen {{because of a lack of}} competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems. The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract <b>a</b> <b>mate.</b> In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract <b>a</b> <b>mate,</b> the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia. It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} for non-dominant wolf males, OR-7 left the Imnaha Pack in the Wallowa Mountains near Joseph in September 2011, presumably in search of <b>a</b> <b>mate.</b> In November, {{he became the first}} wolf {{detected}} in western Oregon in more than 60 years when he was photographed east of Butte Falls by an automatic trail camera. This marked the first known wild wolf presence in southwestern Oregon since 1946.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Essling, Moustache was {{supposed}} to have found <b>a</b> <b>mate.</b> Upon joining the front lines, a fellow Poodle was spotted amongst the enemy. During the course of the battle, the two met and the female Poodle accompanied Moustache back to the French camp. This relationship lasted about a year and together the pair produced puppies which were looked after by the women of the camp.|$|E

50|$|In chess, <b>an</b> ideal <b>mate</b> is <b>a</b> checkmate {{position}} {{that is a}} special form of model <b>mate.</b> While in <b>a</b> model <b>mate,</b> each piece on the mating player's side (possibly excluding the king and pawns depending on context) participates in the <b>mate,</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mate</b> involves all {{the pieces of the}} mated player's as well, typically by blocking the mated king's field of movement so that it cannot escape. As in <b>a</b> model <b>mate,</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>mate</b> also involves the mating pieces attacking the vacant squares around the mated king's exactly once, and not attacking the mated player's other pieces occupying the king's field of movement.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the fourth series, Nikita is shown without <b>a</b> <b>mate</b> after the death of Hannibal. Nikita is {{impregnated}} by Seacrest, a Whiskers roving male, in the third episode of the fourth series. In the fourth, she accepts Whiskers rover Zorro as the groups dominant male, and allows his four brothers to join the group.|$|E
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as <b>a</b> <b>mate,</b> it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
5|$|Each morph {{accounts}} for 50% {{of the adult}} males, and they make {{the same number of}} attempts to court females, but using a different courting display. Before looking for <b>a</b> <b>mate,</b> a male spider spins a small, flat web on a surface and ejaculates into it. He then loads the semen into syringe-like receptacles in both palps, and then searches for a female.|$|E

5|$|In 1897 he {{made his}} first visit to Australia, as <b>a</b> <b>mate</b> on a schooner. On his return to Britain, Swannell joined the British Army and served in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where he was {{commissioned}} as a lieutenant in the 35th Battalion (Buckinghamshire) Imperial Yeomanry on 20 January 1902. He retained the rank of honorary lieutenant when he resigned his commission on 3 February 1903. It was reported that during his time in South Africa, he was personally recommended on the field for a commission by General Lord Methuen.|$|E
5|$|Once a male {{has found}} <b>a</b> <b>mate,</b> he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings {{close to his}} body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when <b>a</b> <b>mate</b> is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction {{may have contributed to}} the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E

30|$|A set of {{connections}} in the matrix M is called <b>a</b> <b>mating</b> for M. <b>A</b> <b>mating,</b> in turn, is called spanning if every possible path in M contains at least one connection included in this <b>mating.</b> Furthermore, <b>a</b> matrix is complementary if there exists <b>a</b> spanning <b>mating</b> for it. One of fundamental results for the connection calculus states that the formula F is a tautology {{if and only if}} M is a complementary matrix [3]. Furthermore, a necessary condition for the existence of <b>a</b> spanning <b>mating</b> for M is that M contains at least one positive column, i.e. a column consisting of positive literals only.|$|R
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{rituals of}} the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as <b>a</b> <b>mate,</b> the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.|$|E
5|$|The male {{calls from}} near the nest site in spring to {{proclaim}} ownership and attract <b>a</b> <b>mate.</b> He may also carry nest material into the nest hole. The display and nest building is repeated in autumn. The preferred locations for the autumn display are old Eurasian tree sparrow nests, particularly those where nestlings had hatched. Empty nest boxes, and sites used by house sparrows or other hole nesting birds, such as tits, pied flycatchers or common redstarts, are rarely {{used for the}} autumn display.|$|E
5|$|The movie {{starts as}} an {{immediate}} {{sequel to the}} events that concluded the earlier film, and is rooted in a subplot of the original Mary Shelley novel, Frankenstein (1818). In the film, a chastened Henry Frankenstein abandons his plans to create life, only to be tempted and finally coerced by his old mentor Dr. Pretorius, along with threats from the Monster, into constructing <b>a</b> <b>mate</b> for the Monster.|$|E
25|$|The tawny coster {{is one of}} a {{group of}} {{butterflies}} where females feature a sphragis (copulatory plug) which is formed after <b>a</b> <b>mating</b> session. After males produce the spermatophore, they pass an additional gland secretion (a waxy substance) that spills out of the female's copulatory opening, forming <b>a</b> <b>mating</b> plug that hardens within a few hours for the purpose of preventing further matings.|$|R
50|$|Use of <b>a</b> <b>mating</b> plug as <b>a</b> {{strategy}} for reproductive success {{can also be}} seen in a few taxa of Lepidoptera and other insects and is often associated with pupal mating. For example, male variable checkerspot butterflies pass <b>a</b> <b>mating</b> plug into the genital opening of females in order to prevent the females from remating and thus protecting their paternity.|$|R
