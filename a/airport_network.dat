5|$|Air Greenland A/S, {{also known}} as Greenlandair, is the flag carrier airline of Greenland, jointly owned by the SAS Group (37.5%), the Greenlandic Government and the Danish Government. It {{operates}} a fleet of 32 aircraft, including 1 airliner used for transatlantic and charter flights, 9 fixed-wing aircraft primarily serving the domestic network, and 22 helicopters feeding passengers from the smaller communities into the domestic <b>airport</b> <b>network.</b> Flights to heliports in the remote settlements are operated on contract {{with the government of}} Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1960 as Grønlandsfly, {{the airline}} started its first {{services}} with Catalina water planes {{and within the}} decade expanded to include DHC-3 Otters as well as Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, some of which remain in active service. The majority of operations were based on helicopters until the newly established Greenland Home Rule began investing in a network of short takeoff and landing airfields. These were very expensive to construct and Greenland's airport fees are still {{among the highest in}} the world; they also required a new fleet: DHC-7 turboprops uniquely suited to the harsh terrain and weather conditions in Greenland. The reliability of connections improved as the domestic <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> expanded in the 1990s: increasing use of the Dash 7s made the airline less restricted by inclement weather. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Air Greenland acquired a Boeing 757 and an Airbus A330, allowing it to open connections to Copenhagen, until then operated by SAS which also competed mid to late 2000s. In the 21st century, it competes with Air Iceland for international connections and small charter services domestically.|$|E

All services to the airport were suspended immediately after the incident. On 7 May, Widerøe stated that they would not use Værøy Airport, and that they would decline the concession to operate to Værøy if the island community did not receive a new airport. They commented that the restrictions caused by the wind forced the airline to terminate up to half the departures. The chairman of the Widerøe's Pilots' Union, Cpt. Helge Høvik, stated the same day that the airline might have to lower the number of calls at some other regional airports, namely Mosjøen Airport, Kjærstad, Mo i Rana Airport, Røssvold, Sandnessjøen Airport, Stokka and Sandane Airport, Anda. Høvik stated that he felt that many of the airports were located in the wrong place, for instance at the bottom of valleys, on top of hills and between mountains.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, air {{transport}} network in Soekarno-Hatta International Airport have become congested, leading to delays for business travelers, and freight shipments. One of the alternative solutions for this problem is to evaluate the hub-and-spoke <b>airport</b> <b>networks.</b> Hub-and-spoke <b>airport</b> <b>networks</b> enable carriers to supply transport services to many combinations of origin and destination zones at high frequencies and low costs. The disadvantage for the traveller is of course {{that they have to}} make a detour via the hub airport implying an extra stop. For many combinations of origin and destination zone, travellers can choose between more than one main carrier and airport. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analysis of hub-and-spoke <b>airport</b> <b>networks</b> in Java Island based on cargo volume and freight ratio. Based on freight ratio value, airport can be classified in four types: full passenger airport, freight interest airport, freight specialist airport, and mixed passenger and freight airport. This study shows that the flight route in Indonesia has not been fully developed in accordance with the concept of hubs-and-spokes. All of the six airports in Java Island (Soekarno-Hatta Airport Jakarta, Juanda Airport Surabaya, Adi Sucipto Airport Yogyakarta, Adi Sumarmo Airport Surakarta, Husein Sastranegara Airport Bandung, and Ahmad Yani Airport Semarang) for the domestic and international flight include in mixed passenger and freight airport type. Soekarno-Hatta Airport has the highest of freight ratio value, 8. 128 for domestic flight and 24. 738 for international flight. The percentage of cargo volume in Soekarno-Hatta Airport is 71. 898 % for domestic flight and 93. 330 % for international flight.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>airport</b> {{transportation}} <b>network</b> {{structure and}} its performance are key factors {{to benefit the}} local area or national transportation capability and economic development. This paper presents a method based on the weighted algebraic connectivity to optimize and analyze the network. The indispensability of the weighted adjacent matrix and weighted Laplacian matrix in <b>airport</b> transportation <b>network</b> performance study is emphasized in this paper. According to practical operational viability, we formulate the weighted algebraic connectivity application as the flight routes addition/deletion problems. The greedy perturbation heuristic by Ghosh and Boyd is analyzed and extended into the Modified Greedy Perturbation Algorithm (MGP) to provide a local optimum in a fast iterative manner. The unweighted tabu search applying algebraic connectivity to <b>airport</b> transportation <b>network</b> by Vargo and Kincaid is re-designed as the Weighted Tabu Search (WTS) to fit the new weighted flight routes addition/deletion problems, potentially offering a global optimum with much longer running time. The simulation results indicate the trade-off between the Modified Greedy Perturbation and the Weighted Tabu Search, {{with which we can}} decide the appropriate algorithm to be used for enhancing the performance of an <b>airport</b> transportation <b>network.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this degree's final project {{is the study of}} those {{parameters}} that determine, after their optimitzation, the properties of a network. We will focus on the optimitzation of the <b>airports</b> <b>network</b> of the United States of 2001. Each airports is represented by a node, which contains this information: name of the airport, coordinates and the total number of airport's operations during a year. The study is based on the creation of a random network. It has the same nodes but they are connected randomly. For this reason, its properties are very different to the real network properties. Hence, an optimitzation process should be apllied: threshold accepting. The algorithm performs an optimitzation to a certain cost function by making changes to the connections between nodes. Therefore, a final network with properties of small-world, a degree histogram which follows a potential law (both properties of real networks), etc, is achieved. Seven cost functions have been used and each of them is formed by one centrality. The centralities used are based on the paths between nodes, load models, etc. Moreover, the number of airport's operations and its coordinates have been took into account. To prove the correct performance of the algorithm, four reduced networks has been generated from the real network. Once the results are obtained, the optimization of the <b>airports</b> <b>network</b> of USA has been performed by using the cost functions that works properly for this case...|$|R
