5|$|Cory Edwards {{chose to}} {{approach}} the film predominantly as an action/comedy, instead of as a typical animated film, and wrote the script to appeal to <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> any age {{like many of the}} films produced by Pixar or Disney.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the initial impact {{of rock and}} roll on {{mainstream}} American culture waned as major record companies took a controlling influence and sought to market more conventionally acceptable recordings. Electric musical instruments (particularly guitars) and amplification were becoming more affordable, allowing young musicians to form small groups to perform in front of local <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> their peers; and in some areas there was a breakdown, especially among radio <b>audiences,</b> <b>of</b> traditional black and white markets, with more white teenagers listening to and purchasing R records.|$|E

5|$|British and European audiences {{typically}} followed {{concert hall}} behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances, {{and they were}} more reserved in their behaviour than were <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> other forms of rock. This confused musicians during US tours, as they found that American audiences were less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{emanating from}} World Rugby and its {{business}} partners have frequently touted the tournament's media growth, with cumulative worldwide television <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> 300 {{million for the}} inaugural 1987 tournament, 1.75 billion in 1991, 2.67 billion in 1995, 3 billion in 1999, 3.5 billion in 2003, and 4 billion in 2007. The 4 billion figure was widely dismissed as the global audience for television {{is estimated to be}} about 4.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|Aalborgs Kongres & Kultur Center, {{designed}} in a functional style by Otto Frankild, {{was completed in}} 1952. The centre's main component, the Aalborg Hall, {{can be divided into}} sections. The complex also contains a hotel, restaurant, bowling alley, and a number of meeting rooms. The smaller Europahallen was added in 1991, making the centre the largest in Scandinavia. With over 100 theatrical and musical presentations per year, it offers international stars, opera, ballet, musicals, classical concerts, productions for children as well as pop and rock concerts. It can accommodate <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> up to 2,500.|$|E

25|$|The 2015–16 season {{attracted}} {{an average}} <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> 1.13 million for each match in Australia this season, an 18% increase {{on the previous}} season. A cumulative <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> 9.65 million watched the matches in Australia, out of which 39% were females.

5|$|Dramatic performances, often {{accompanied}} by music, were popular in the markets. The actors were distinguished in rank by type and color of clothing, honing their acting skills at drama schools. Satirical sketches denouncing corrupt government officials were especially popular. Actors on stage always spoke their lines in Classical Chinese; vernacular Chinese that imitated the common spoken language was not introduced into theatrical performances until the subsequent Yuan dynasty. Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language, acting troupes commonly drew their membership {{from one of the}} lowest social groups in society: prostitutes. Of the fifty some theatres located in the pleasure grounds of Kaifeng, four of these theatres were large enough to entertain <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{felt that}} his {{approach}} to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach was not entirely successful. The Bard was about a supposed curse on the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> the time {{found it hard to}} understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.|$|E
5|$|Having already famously played Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice on the Yiddish {{stage at}} the People's Theater, he played the role again in a 1903 Broadway production, {{directed}} by Arthur Hopkins. In this production, Adler spoke his lines in Yiddish {{while the rest of}} the cast spoke in English. The New York Times review of Adler's performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> the period expected in a production of Shakespeare. Some other reviews (such as that in Theater magazine) were friendlier; in any event the same production was revived two years later.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, {{the festival}} {{gathered}} an <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> over 22,000 people, {{the record of}} the Sauna festival. The 2011 festival gathered a record <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> 26,000.|$|R

5|$|Icke became known, in particular, for his lengthy lectures. By 2006, he had lectured in {{at least}} 25 countries, {{attracting}} <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> several thousand each time. He lectured for seven hours to 2,500 people at the Brixton Academy, London, in 2008, and the same year addressed the University of Oxford's debating society, the Oxford Union. His book tour for Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More (2010) included a sell-out talk to 2,100 in New York and £83,000 worth of ticket sales in Melbourne, Australia. In October 2012, he delivered a 10-hour lecture to 6,000 people at London's Wembley Arena.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the {{criterion}} for the award was changed {{in an effort to}} further stimulate the Dutch film industry. Films released after January 1, 2003 had to reach paying <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> 100,000 to qualify for the Golden Film and 400,000 for the Platinum Film. All films that had received a Golden Film before 2003 would also have received a Golden Film under the new criterion. From 2003 until 2007, the percentage of cinema visitors in the Netherlands who watched a Dutch film was between 9.20% and 13.4%.|$|E
5|$|In the {{documentary}} {{of the film}} titled A World Unseen, Iñárritu has stated that for the main themes of the film he revisits the issues and concerns of intense parental and filial relations, which <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> his previous films readily recognize as a recurrent theme in his previous work. Regarding the theme of revenge seen throughout The Revenant, Iñárritu has stated that the approach of vengeance seen in the film needs to be significantly tempered by anyone {{who would want to}} see vengeance as either an effective or useful moral to be applied in life. In the end, Iñárritu states, there can only be disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life defining purpose.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, 13th Army Band {{personnel}} {{performed in}} the Super Bowl XLI pre-game show, before a live <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> over 74,000 and a television <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> over 93 million people.|$|R

5000|$|It {{is common}} for popular sports to attract large {{broadcast}} audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding {{large amounts of money}} for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football World Cup attracts a global television <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of millions; the 2006 final alone attracted an estimated worldwide <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> well over 700 million and the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final attracted an estimated <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> 135 million in India alone [...]|$|R
5|$|Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh {{had gained}} {{sufficient}} popularity over its run of 20 Merry-go-Round episodes {{to be given}} its own 39-week series beginning in January 1947. With the coming of peace, the supposed RAF station became a civil airport, and the show continued much as before, written by and starring Horne and Murdoch, with Sam Costa. Maurice Denham—described by Murdoch as a vocal chameleon—joined the cast and played over 60 roles. The programme became popular, with <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> 20 million, and ran for four series until September 1950.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda {{was adapted}} from a lenong (a Betawi oral {{tradition}} similar to a stage play) popular with ethnic Chinese and native <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> the time. The Ronda stories follow the Betawi bandit of the same name, who is skilled at silat (traditional martial arts) and reputed to take from the rich {{to give to the}} poor. The Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because of its potential action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.|$|E
5|$|The Bill {{has become}} a popular drama in the United Kingdom and in many other countries, most notably in Australia. The series {{attracted}} <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> up to six million viewers in 2008 and 2009. Ratings during 2002 peaked after the overhaul of the show which brought about the 2002 fire episode, in which six officers were killed and the 2003 live episode attracted ten million viewers- {{forty percent of the}} UK audience share. Immediately following The Bills revamping and time slot change, it was reported that the programme had attracted 4.5million viewers, 19% of the audience share, however, it lost out to the BBC's New Tricks with the Daily Mirror later reporting that ITV's schedule change was behind a two million viewer drop in ratings.|$|E

5|$|The {{successes of}} The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast {{established}} the template for future Disney releases during the 1990s: a musical-comedy format with Broadway-styled songs and tentpole action sequences, buoyed by cross-promotional marketing and merchandising, all carefully designed to pull <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> {{all ages and}} types into theatres. In addition to John Musker, Ron Clements, Kirk Wise, and Gary Trousdale, the new guard of Disney artists creating these films included story artists/directors Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff, Chris Sanders, and Brenda Chapman, and lead animators Glen Keane, Andreas Deja, Eric Goldberg, Nik Ranieri, Will Finn, and many others.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide variety}} of musical performances, {{whether or not they}} are artificially amplified (6, 7, 9, 10), all provide {{entertainment}} irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists (6), choral (2) or orchestral groups (5, 8), or ensemble (3). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (5, 8). Other <b>audiences</b> <b>of</b> live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate (7, 9). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately (10).|$|E
