40|$|In this report, we {{analyzed}} children's {{individual differences in}} shifts of pattern of play with three play-targets; toys, the mother and a peer in three situations at age 40 months. We related the play pattern to attachment type classified at 12 months of age and to temperamental disposition toward inhibition measured at 23 and 40 months of age. Children's patterns of play-target shift could be classified into five groups; two attachment-related,one temperament-related group and one attachment-temprament-interaction related group. Although the children who shifted play-target in an adaptive manner in each of three situations had been classified into <b>attachment</b> type <b>B,</b> they were only 1 / 3 of all B type children. While the children who showed difficulty in separating from the mother had temperamental disposition toward inhibition, they were only 1 / 3 of all inhibited children.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the association between adult mental representations of curly attachment relationships and eating disorders, and to compare attachment classifications between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The sample consisted of 62 women with eating disorders, divided between anorexia nervosa [restricting type (n= 20) and binge-eating/purging type (n=l 6) ], and bulimia nervosa (n= 26). The measures were (a) a structured interview based on the 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Diagnostic Survey for Eating Disorders 2 ̆ 2 (Johnson and Connors, 1987) and the DSM IV criteria for the classification of eating disorders, and (<b>b)</b> the Adult <b>Attachment</b> Interview (AAI) (George, Kaplan and Main, 1985). The AAI was audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and then scored by two independent scorers, following Crittenden (1998, 1999) 2 ̆ 7 s dynamic-maturational model of attachment. The hypotheses were: (a) women with eating disorders show a high proportion of insecure <b>attachment</b> classifications, (<b>b)</b> the insecure <b>attachment</b> patterns are different (dismissing versus preoccupied) between women with anorexia nervosa and women with bulimia nervosa, and (c) the mental representation of early attachment of women with eating disorders with their fathers is characterised by negativity.
