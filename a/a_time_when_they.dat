5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who heard a 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly {{took an interest in}} Sorabji's music.|$|E
5|$|For his {{selection}} of sailing master, Hall first turned to Sidney O. Budington, then to George Tyson, who both initially declined due to prior whaling commitments. When those commitments fell through, Hall named Budington as sailing master and Tyson assistant navigator. Budington and Tyson had decades of experience between them captaining whaling vessels. In effect, the Polaris now had three captains, a fact which would weigh {{heavily on the}} fate of the expedition. Further complicating matters, in 1863 Budington and Hall had quarrelled because Budington had denied permission for Hall to bring his Inuit guides, Joseph Ebierbing and Tookoolito, with him on an expedition at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were ill and in Budington's care.|$|E
5|$|Most of Final Fantasy IV {{takes place}} on Earth, {{also known as the}} Blue Planet, which {{consists}} of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally from a world which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> believe their kind can co-exist with humans. A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although it is never visited in the game.|$|E

Meant to promote ethnic Chinese rights at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were treated as second-class citizens and provide standardised formal education to ethnic Chinese students where the Dutch had not, the organisation {{was based on the}} teachings of Confucius and opened schools for both boys and girls. The THHK grew quickly and expanded into different fields, and Lie helped organise a debating club, sports club, and charity fairs and concerts. From 1903 to 1904 Lie was a managing member of the board, serving mainly as its treasurer.|$|E
5|$|As George tells Jerry {{that his}} girlfriend no longer {{wants to see}} him, Jerry tells George that he gave away his ticket to Horneck. Although Jerry offers George his own ticket, George does {{not go to the}} game with Horneck because he does not know Horneck. Jerry decides to give Horneck both tickets, {{claiming}} that he cannot make the game because he is tutoring his nephew. Later, the night of the Knicks game,Jerry is in his apartment talking to his ex-girlfriend Elaine. She jokingly tries to add to Jerry's list of excuses with which he avoids Horneck. He later discovers that Horneck took Kramer to the game and that Horneck is in the building. When Horneck meets Jerry and Elaine, Horneck invites them out to another Knicks game. They come up with more unusual excuses in an attempt to avoid going out. However, Horneck then gets out a newspaper and tries to organize <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> can all meet, weeks in advance.

5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver for weeks at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had never been together {{for more than a few}} days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E

5|$|Having left Thompson's tradition, Buczynski {{decided to}} form his own form of Wicca, which he claimed had {{actually}} dated {{back to the}} Palaeolithic and transmitted to him by a figure whose anonymity he had to protect. Referring to this new tradition as Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft or the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, it was heavily influenced by the Welsh mythology contained in texts like The Mabinogion and the Arthurian legends which fascinated him, despite his lack of Welsh heritage. It took as its basis {{the structure of the}} Gardnerian tradition, with its Book of Shadows being largely based upon that which he had obtained through his work with Thompson, accompanied by sections taken from the recently published Lady Sheba's The Book of Shadows. Officially founded in October 1972, later that year an outer court was founded through which to teach interested persons who were not yet initiated. Notably, he welcomed LGBT people and non-caucasians into his tradition at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were denied entry to most other Wiccan covens. Although taking an open attitude to spiritual seekers, Buczynski prevented the occult investigator, Hans Holzer, from entering the outer coven when the latter requested admission to undertake research for his book The Witchcraft Report; like many in the Pagan and occult community, Buczynski was wary of Holzer's intentions and the sensationalist claims he purported in his publications.|$|E
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company. He was only a toddler when he met Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} recall <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from balsa wood kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout. His boyhood home in New Concord has been restored as a historic house museum and education center.|$|E

5|$|Less {{concrete}} changes {{include the}} growing assertiveness of the Dominions within the British Empire. Battles such as Gallipoli for Australia and New Zealand, and Vimy Ridge for Canada led to increased national pride {{and a greater}} reluctance to remain subordinate to London. These battles were often portrayed favourably in these nations' propaganda as symbolic of their power during the war. The war released pent-up indigenous nationalism, as populations tried {{to take advantage of}} the precedent set by the introduction of self-determination in eastern Europe. Britain was to face unrest in Ireland (1919–21), India (1919), Egypt (1919–23), Palestine (1920–21) and Iraq (1920) at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were supposed to be demilitarising. Nevertheless, Britain's only territorial loss came in Ireland, where the delay in finding a resolution to the home rule issue, along with the 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals, and led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919.|$|E
5|$|One {{improvement}} {{that was}} completed was {{the construction of}} the New Junction Canal. This had been authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 28 July 1891 by the Aire and Calder Navigation, which specified that the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company would share the cost of construction and the ownership of the new waterway. No work could start until the company actually owned their canals, and they were required to raise £150,000 at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had just failed to raise the finance for the takeover of the original canals. However, three-quarters of the cost had been raised by 1903. The new canal leaves the original navigation at Bramwith Junction, runs over the River Don on an aqueduct, and continues in a straight line for , to join the Aire and Calder Navigation upstream from Goole. It provided a much more direct route from Sheffield to Goole, and was opened on 2 January 1905. The company had hoped to run compartment boats for the transport of coal along the canal, as the Aire and Calder did, but although straightening of the navigation was completed at Doncaster in April 1905 and at Sprotborough in late 1907, and Doncaster Town Lock was lengthened in 1909 and 1910, most of the locks could only hold three compartments at a time, and so there was little advantage to using this type of boat.|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} over 300 births to captive female gorillas {{revealed}} that older females tend {{to give birth}} to more male offspring as opposed to females under 8 years old.

In 1970, Segal wrote the best-selling novel Love Story, basing a character in the book—Davey, a captain of the hockey team—on Johnston.
