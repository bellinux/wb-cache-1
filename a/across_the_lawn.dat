5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} limestone quarry at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. Certainly they should be limited to finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E

500|$|Called [...] "a {{cemetery}} for the living", it {{was reported}} in 2007 that between 30 and 135 homeless people were squatting in the Grove Church Cemetery. An investigation had been brought on by a sexual assault of a woman, who was near the Bergenline Avenue Station of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail, and by knife-point was brought into the cemetery and assaulted. Upon searching the grounds, police found remnants of living activity, namely mattresses, pillows, and blankets, as well as garbage strewn <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawn.</b> Also, small shacks had been built along the perimeter. To the dismay of neighbors, who had complained about the noise and feeling unsafe, {{there was not much}} that the police could do to remove the people off of the premises; there is no law against loitering in public places. One victim, however, claimed that there were bronze urns stolen from his relative's tomb, and Reverend Douglas Shepler, the pastor of the Grove Reformed Church, reported a woman visiting a grave had her necklace ripped off and stolen by one of the men. In addition, the Reformed Grove Church had been supporting the homeless by providing them with meals, as it is within their rights and devotion to charity that they will not turn away anyone seeking help. It has a few times {{over the course of several}} years removed the homeless who were squatting there, but they manage to relocate there.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{building}} should also resolve a parking {{issue at the}} museum. [...] Kahn was deeply troubled by {{the negative impact of}} the automobile on city life; he once spoke of [...] "the destruction of the city by the motor car." [...] Fundamentally opposed to the idea of orienting buildings to the automobile, Kahn placed the main parking lot {{in the back of the}} building, intending for visitors to walk around the building and enter through carefully planned landscaping. [...] Most visitors, however, entered through the back door on the ground floor, missing the entry experience that Kahn had designed. [...] The {{new building}} will solve the problem with an underground parking garage. [...] After visitors ascend to the gallery level of the new building, they can exit it and walk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawn</b> and the courtyard to enter the original building as Kahn had intended.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1896, the Stimson House was {{the target}} of a bizarre bombing attack. [...] The {{headline}} in the Los Angeles Times read, [...] "DYNAMITE FIENDS: An Attempt [...] to Blow Up the Stimson Mansion; The Redstone Walls Resisted the Terrific Explosion." [...] A [...] "stick of giant powder" [...] was placed against the foundation of the house, directly under Stimsonâ€™s bedroom. [...] A large hole was torn {{in the side of the}} house by the explosion, but the thick foundation wall was not damaged. [...] Reports indicated that a frame house would have been shattered into fragments by the explosion, but the solid stone structure withstood the blast. [...] Two neighbors witnessed the culprit lighting the fire on the dynamite, grabbed their guns, ran <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawn,</b> and were thrown off their feet by the explosion. [...] On regaining their balance, the neighbors saw a man running away from the scene and fired several shots in his direction, but the man escaped.|$|E

60|$|Breakfast was a satisfaction. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> {{was visible}} in the {{distance}} {{through the open window}} an Indian well, with two oxen tramping leisurely up and down long inclines, drawing water; and out of the stillness came the suffering screech of the machinery--not quite musical, and yet soothingly melancholy and dreamy and reposeful--a wail of lost spirits, one might imagine. And commemorative and reminiscent, perhaps; for of course the Thugs used to throw people down that well when they were done with them.|$|R

A boy was discovered in Buckingham Palace. At first mistaken for a chimney-sweep, until he ran off <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawns,</b> he was apprehended by a policeman.

60|$|A blood-red October moon {{shed the}} fulness of its {{light on the}} silent houses, and the trees, still {{clinging}} to leaf, cast black shadows <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawns</b> and deserted streets.
