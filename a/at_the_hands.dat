5|$|In Parata Venpa, Aravan asks Krishna {{to grant}} him the boon of a heroic {{death on the}} {{battlefield}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of a great hero. Although Parata Venpa mentions only one boon, the overall Tamil tradition preserves {{a total of three}} distinct boons associated with Aravan. The single boon of Parata Venpa, according to Hiltebeitel, indicates an early (9th-century) effort to harmonize the Tamil tradition of Aravan's pre-battle sacrifice with the original Sanskrit account of his death during the battle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of Alambusha (Alampucan in Tamil).|$|E

40|$|Oscillatory {{motions of}} handles, seats, and floors produce complex {{patterns}} of sensations {{in the body}} with the detection of these motions dependent on {{the sensitivity of the}} body to the applied vibration. This study examined the effect of input location (<b>the</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>the</b> seat, and the foot) and vibration frequency (8 – 315 Hz <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> and foot; 2 – 315 Hz <b>at</b> <b>the</b> seat) on absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration in each of three axes (fore-and-aft, lateral, and vertical). Perception thresholds were determined with 96 males aged 20 – 29 years divided into eight groups of 12 subjects; each group received vibration <b>at</b> either <b>the</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>the</b> seat, or the foot in one of the three axes (one group experienced both lateral and vertical vibration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand).</b> A frequency dependence in the thresholds was apparent for each of <b>the</b> three directions <b>at</b> each of <b>the</b> three locations; U-shaped acceleration threshold contours at frequencies greater than 80 Hz suggest the same psychophysical channel-mediated high-frequency thresholds <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>the</b> seat, and the foot. Among the nine axes, sensitivity was greatest for vertical vibration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> seat <b>at</b> frequencies between 8 and 80 Hz, whereas sensitivity was greatest for vertical vibration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> frequencies greater than 100 Hz. Absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>the</b> seat, and the foot are not consistent with the relevant frequency weightings in current standards...|$|R
