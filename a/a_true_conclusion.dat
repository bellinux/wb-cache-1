My one object is to act justly toward you and toward her. I should never forgive myself if I made mischief between you, no matter how innocent of any evil intention I might be." [...] Romayne had understood him. It was Stella's misfortune ignorantly to misinterpret everything that Penrose said or did, for the all-sufficient reason that he was a Catholic priest. She had drawn the conclusion that her husband had deliberately left her alone with Penrose, to be persuaded or deluded into giving her sanction to aid the influence of the priest.

5000|$|In philosophy, {{the term}} formal fallacy {{is used for}} logical fallacies and defined {{formally}} as: a flaw {{in the structure of}} a deductive argument which renders the argument invalid. The term is preferred as logic is the use of valid reasoning and a fallacy is an argument that uses poor reasoning therefore the term logical fallacy is self-contradictory. However, the same terms are used in informal discourse to mean an argument which is problematic for any reason.A logical form such as [...] "A and B" [...] is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions. Logical form alone can guarantee that given true premises, <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>conclusion</b> must follow. However, formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false; the conclusion can be either true or false. Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee. Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a statement to be true.|$|E

Executive producer Jane Featherstone decided to end the series during its writing stage, stating [...] "It's very tempting to keep going, {{and we have had}} ongoing conversations with our partners at the BBC about it, but the heart of the show has become those two characters and Ruth and I feel they own it. We've followed the arc of their personal story and I think they've brought us to a natural end, which you will all see played out later this year." [...] It was also intended to end the series [...] "in its prime." [...] Writers Brackley and Vincent noted [...] "there was always a strong possibility of it being the end, so throughout the writing process we were looking for ways to infuse it with a sense of finality. We'd done a fair bit of writing before it was made definite by Kudos - but {{had plenty of time to}} plot <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>conclusion.</b> And crucially, by the time we began to write the final ep, we knew it would be the last." [...] They also stated; [...] "When Kudos asked for our opinion, we said we'd hate to see it cancelled on a cliffhanger - it just wouldn't be right, or fair on the fans. Call us suck-ups, but you have to really admire Kudos for having the confidence to kill off a very successful show - purely because it's the right thing creatively." [...] Firth believed the series is getting to a point where the producers were starting to run out of story ideas, as virtually every type of antagonists have been featured in past episodes.|$|E

5000|$|The Prior Analytics {{represents}} the first formal study of logic, where logic {{is understood as}} the study of arguments. An argument is <b>a</b> series of <b>true</b> or false statements which lead to <b>a</b> <b>true</b> or false <b>conclusion.</b> In the Prior Analytics, Aristotle identifies valid and invalid forms of arguments called syllogisms. A syllogism is an argument that consists {{of at least three}} sentences: at least two premises and a conclusion. Although Aristotles does not call them [...] "categorical sentences," [...] tradition does; he deals with them briefly in the Analytics and more extensively in On Interpretation. Each proposition (statement that is a thought of the kind expressible by a declarative sentence) of a syllogism is a categorical sentence which has a subject and a predicate connected by a verb. The usual way of connecting the subject and predicate of a categorical sentence as Aristotle does in On Interpretation is by using a linking verb e.g. P is S. However, in the Prior Analytics Aristotle rejects the usual form in favor of three of his inventions: 1) P belongs to S, 2) P is predicated of S and 3) P is said of S. Aristotle does not explain why he introduces these innovative expressions but scholars conjecture that the reason may have been that it facilitates the use of letters instead of terms avoiding the ambiguity that results in Greek when letters are used with the linking verb. In his formulation of syllogistic propositions, instead of the copula ("All/some... are/are not..."), Aristotle uses the expression, [...] "... belongs to/does not belong to all/some..." [...] or [...] "... is said/is not said of all/some..." [...] There are four different types of categorical sentences: universal affirmative (A), particular affirmative (I), universal negative (E) and particular negative (O).|$|R

30|$|As expected, {{for small}} finite systems, the DOS, LDOS, and the {{position}} of the Fermi energy depend on the number of atoms considered in the numerical calculation and on their characteristic geometries [21 – 23] and topology [24, 25]. The experimental results by Ritter and Lyding [5] give actually <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>conclusion</b> about the influence of edge structure on the electronic structures of graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons. A remarkable difference between CND and CNCs structures is the existence of a finite DOS above the Fermi level for nanocones. This clear metallic character of the DOS for nanocones is more robust for the two-pentagon CNC [22, 26]. This feature is a consequence of a symmetry break induced by the presence of topological defects in the CNC lattices, which generates new states above the Fermi energy not present in the CND structure. The contributions to the DOS coming from the apex atoms states are apparent in the LDOS of Figure 3 e,f. Also notice that for the two-pentagon case, {{in which there is a}} large topological disorder, the LDOS spectra exhibit significant differences depending on the point symmetry of the considered atom (cf. Figure 2).|$|E
