5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild <b>and</b> <b>hearty</b> sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E

25|$|Beaujolais wine can be {{paired with}} a variety of food {{according}} to the lightness and body of the wine. Beaujolais Nouveau is typically used as an apéritif with basic Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages doing well with light fare, like picnics and salads. The lighter Cru Beaujolais pair well with poultry and the heavier Crus pairing better with red meats <b>and</b> <b>hearty</b> dishes like stews. In Norway, Beaujolais is a favorite with cod and bacalhau dishes. According to Lyon chef Paul Bocuse, Beaujolais wine is used to make a traditional regional dessert involving a glass of sliced peaches, topped with blackcurrants and drenched in chilled Beaujolais wine.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the midwife}} {{received}} the infant, {{placed it in}} pieces of cloth, cut the umbilical cord, and cleansed the baby. The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call {{on whether or not}} an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for congenital deformities and testing its cry to hear {{whether or not it was}} robust <b>and</b> <b>hearty.</b> Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.|$|E
500|$|In 1882, {{seeking more}} {{professional}} orchestral experience, Elgar {{was employed to}} play violin in Birmingham with William Stockley's Orchestra, for whom he would play every concert {{for the next seven}} years and where he later claimed he [...] "learned all the music I know". On 13 December 1883 he took part with Stockley in a performance at Birmingham Town Hall of one of his first works for full orchestra, the Sérénade mauresque – the first time one of his compositions had been performed by a professional orchestra. Stockley had invited him to conduct the piece but later recalled [...] "he declined, and, further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine <b>and</b> <b>hearty</b> applause of the audience." [...] Elgar often went to London in an attempt to get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, [...] "My prospects are about as hopeless as ever ... I am not wanting in energy I think, so sometimes I conclude that 'tis want of ability. ... I have no money– not a cent." ...|$|E

Another single, [...] "All My Life", was featured in the promotional clips for the 2010 AFL grand final. Its music video was directed by Adrian Van de Velde and was shot in early October in Bangkok, Thailand.

500|$|After the Reformation, Muhammad {{was often}} portrayed {{in a similar}} way. Guillaume Postel {{was among the first}} to present a more {{positive}} view of Muhammad when he argued that Muhammad should be esteemed by Christians as a valid prophet. Gottfried Leibniz praised Muhammad because [...] "he did not deviate from the natural religion". Henri de Boulainvilliers, in his Vie de Mahomed which was published posthumously in 1730, described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker. He presents him as a divinely inspired messenger whom God employed to confound the bickering Oriental Christians, to liberate the Orient from the despotic rule of the Romans and Persians, and to spread the knowledge of the unity of God from India to Spain. Voltaire had a somewhat mixed opinion on Muhammad: in his play Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète he vilifies Muhammad as a symbol of fanaticism, and in a published essay in 1748 he calls him [...] "a sublime <b>and</b> <b>hearty</b> charlatan", but in his historical survey Essai sur les mœurs, he presents him as legislator and a conqueror and calls him an [...] "enthusiast." [...] Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his Social Contract (1762), [...] "brushing aside hostile legends of Muhammad as a trickster and impostor, presents him as a sage legislator who wisely fused religious and political powers." [...] Emmanuel Pastoret published in 1787 his Zoroaster, Confucius and Muhammad, in which he presents the lives of these three [...] "great men", [...] "the greatest legislators of the universe", and compares their careers as religious reformers and lawgivers. He rejects the common view that Muhammad is an impostor and argues that the Quran proffers [...] "the most sublime truths of cult and morals"; it defines the unity of God with an [...] "admirable concision." [...] Pastoret writes that the common accusations of his immorality are unfounded: on the contrary, his law enjoins sobriety, generosity, and compassion on his followers: the [...] "legislator of Arabia" [...] was [...] "a great man." [...] Napoleon Bonaparte admired Muhammad and Islam, and described him as a model lawmaker and a great man. Thomas Carlyle in his book Heroes and Hero Worship and the Heroic in History (1840) describes Muhammad as [...] " [...] silent great soul; [...] one of those who cannot but be in earnest". Carlyle's interpretation has been widely cited by Muslim scholars as a demonstration that Western scholarship validates Muhammad's status as a great man in history.|$|E

2500|$|History {{which showed}} James III {{in a bad}} light and was {{positive}} about Albany may have been pleasing to the courtiers of James IV and Albany's son, John, Regent Albany.

Other records such as the valuable [...] "golden charter" [...] on 16 November 1482 by which James III rewarded the town of Edinburgh with the customs duties of Leith contributed to this legend.

2500|$|In {{first-class}} cricket, Walker {{had three}} seasons {{where he has}} finished with a batting average of over fifty: in 1996, 2004 and 2006. 1996 saw Walker hit the highest score of his career to date, {{on his way to}} 606 runs at an average of 60.60. Against a Somerset attack without Andrew Caddick, Walker compiled 275 not out in nine-and-a-half hours before his captain Trevor Ward declared the innings at 616/7. The Daily Telegraph's Christopher Martin-Jenkins wrote of the innings: [...] "It was an innings of style and substance, memorable for powerful driving through the off-side <b>and</b> <b>hearty</b> pulling whenever a persevering but ordinary Somerset attack became impatient with line and length and tried to extract a spring in the pitch which simply was not there."

2500|$|In {{food and}} wine pairings, the most basic element {{considered}} is [...] "weight"-the balance between {{the weight of the}} food (a heavy, red sauce pasta versus a more delicate salad) and the weight or [...] "body" [...] of the wine (a heavy Cabernet Sauvignon versus a more delicate Pinot grigio). In wine tasting, body is determined primarily by the alcohol level of the wine and can be influenced by the perceptions of tannins (from the grape skins or oak) and extract (the dissolved solids in the wine derived from winemaking processes like extended maceration and sur lie aging). An oaked Chardonnay from a warm wine region, such as Australia will be [...] "heavier" [...] in body than a stainless steel fermented Chardonnay from a cooler wine region such as Chablis. Pairing heavy wines with light dishes or vice versa, can result in one partner overwhelming the other. The [...] "weight" [...] of a food can also be described in terms of the intensity of its flavors-such as delicate and more subtle flavors versus dishes that have more robust <b>and</b> <b>hearty</b> flavors. A key to pairing upon this principle is to identify the dominant flavor of the dish. Sauces can be the dominant flavor instead of the meat or main component. While poached fish is usually light bodied and better served with a light white, if the fish is served with a heavy cream sauce it could be better balanced with a fuller bodied white wine or light red.|$|E
