Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and puffing when approached.|$|E

25|$|The Roman general Messala and {{his troops}} {{have come to}} track down the British king Arvire and bring him captive to the Emperor Claudius in Rome. Princes Irvin and Vellinus enter and tell the Romans their search is in vain: in his hiding place on Mona, Arvire can never be caught. Messala replies that Arvire might be taken by cunning and asks the princes to help him: their mother, Queen Élfrida, has already become an ally of Rome. Vellinus agrees to betray Arvire, {{although}} Irvin is outraged at his brother's behaviour. The brothers leave as the Druids arrive to perform their sacred ritual. Modred, the Chief Druid, says they must do <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to protect Arvire from the Romans. Arvire enters, accompanied by his daughter Évélina. Arvire is in despair: after his defeat in battle, the Romans captured his wife. Some of the Druids bring in Irvin and Vellinus, whom they have found lurking nearby. Vellinus says they have come with news from their mother, the Queen of Lenox, who now wants to aid Arvire against the Romans. They must bring Arvire back with them to lead the army. Vellinus even claims that he himself has fought the Romans and freed Arvire's wife. Arvire is delighted and eagerly leaves with Vellinus.|$|E

Laws commented that Darren and Cindy's {{relationship}} is more about [...] "making money out of others’ misery" [...] rather than romance, and sarcastically commented that the pair were [...] "nice" [...] after they decide to con Hannah and Tony. On Darren and Cindy's intention to scam Tony the Daily Star wrote: [...] "Cindy and Darren are perfect for each other. They are both greedy money-grabbers and it isn’t long before {{they are looking for}} a way to fleece Tony for <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get". MSN said the sexual chemistry between Darren and Cindy was undeniable after Cindy's return.

Meanwhile, Carol safely lands his plane and rushes to greet Liz on set. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> muster on short notice is a polka band and a large cake with Fonzie on it—gifts that were intended to celebrate janitor Jadwiga's birthday. She proceeds to ruin the TGS goodnights and tear into the cake with her bare hands. In Jack's office, Liz and Jack share a drink as Liz's birthday wish. In the final scene, as Jack takes a drink, the program reverts to a pre-recorded segment and Jack says, [...] "That's more like it." [...] The episode ends with a live goodnight from the TGS stage by the cast of the episode, a la Saturday Night Live.|$|E
500|$|Republican {{newspapers}} painted Bryan {{as a tool}} of Governor Altgeld, who was controversial {{for having}} pardoned the surviving men convicted of involvement in the [...] Haymarket bombing. [...] Others dubbed Bryan a [...] "Popocrat". [...] On September 27, The New York Times published a letter by an [...] "eminent alienist" [...] who, based on an analysis of the candidate's speeches, concluded that Bryan was mad. [...] The paper editorialized on the same page that even if the Democratic candidate was not insane, he was at least [...] "of unsound mind". [...] For the most part, Bryan ignored the attacks, and made light of them in his account of the 1896 campaign. [...] Republican newspapers and spokesmen claimed that Bryan's campaign was expensively financed by the silver interests. [...] This was not the case: the mining industry was seeing poor times, and had little money to donate to Bryan. [...] In his account, Bryan quoted a letter by Senator Jones: [...] "No matter in how small sums, no matter by what humble contributions, let the friends of liberty and national honor contribute <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to the good cause." ...|$|E
500|$|The quest {{group is}} {{challenged}} to successfully recruit allies for the Regalians, and then journeys to find Gregor's dad emaciated and tortured {{in the personal}} prison of King Gorger. When the rat king discovers their rescue attempt, Henry reveals {{that he has been}} helping the rats all along, hoping to ally them with the Regalians and conquer the entire Underland. During the questers' attempt to escape, Gregor sacrifices himself to lure the rats' attack force — King Gorger and Henry among them — off the edge of a cliff. Henry's bat Ares, who had no knowledge of his bond's treachery, chooses to save Gregor rather than Henry as they fall. When the few remaining quest members make it back to Regalia, Luxa and her family are devastated, both because of Henry's treason and death and because Ares has been sentenced to banishment (essentially a death sentence in the Underland) for allowing his bond to die. Gregor saves his life by using his status as the [...] "warrior" [...] to form a new bond with him. When things have settled down somewhat and the Regalian doctors have done <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> for his father, Gregor and his family return to the surface.|$|E

2500|$|One line of Protestant {{thinking}} {{views the}} pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty. [...] This perspective is generally ascribed to Calvinist and Puritan theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves. [...] John Wesley was a strong proponent of wealth creation. [...] However, to avoid wealth becoming an obstacle to faith, Wesley exhorted his audiences to [...] "earn <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> save <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> and give away all they can." [...] Included among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound prosperity theology, teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws.|$|E

2500|$|Boorda was {{a product}} of an enlisted-to-officer {{commissioning}} program in the early 1960s. This program known as the Integration Program was designed to provide an opportunity for enlisted personnel who possessed outstanding qualifications and motivation for a naval career to obtain a commission. Boorda was the first Chief of Naval Operations to have risen from the enlisted rates, one of only four such modern service chiefs (the others being Air Force General Larry D. Welch, General Alfred Gray, USMC and Army General John Shalikashvili). Upon assuming this position, Boorda immediately re-established the historic program, naming it [...] "Seaman to Admiral", as part of a STA-21 initiative for young sailors to earn their commission and become naval officers. Boorda believed [...] "people should have the opportunity to excel, and be <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be, even if they don't get a perfect or traditional start." ...|$|E

The resolution called for the replacement of standing armies by the democratic organization of [...] "the armed people" [...] — which, it was claimed, [...] "would prove an effective means for making aggressive wars impossible". In the event of imminent war, the working class was mildly beseeched to [...] "do <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to prevent the breaking out of this war, using for the purpose the means which appear to them most efficacious". Should war nevertheless follow, the socialists were [...] "bound to intervene for its being brought to a speedy end" [...] and to make use of the economic and political crises created by the war [...] "to hasten the breakdown of the predominance of the capitalist class".|$|E
