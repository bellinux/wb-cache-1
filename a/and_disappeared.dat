5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in what is today South Dakota for several {{thousand}} years.

5|$|During December 1965, more {{submarine}} activity occurred 0.9km (0.56mi) {{southwest of}} Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, {{and over the}} following eight months it appeared <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70m (230ft) in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, after The Bell Jar was published, Plath {{began working}} on another {{literary}} work titled Double Exposure. It was never published <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> around 1970. Theories {{about what happened to}} the unfinished manuscript are repeatedly brought up in the book Sylvia Plath's Fiction: A Critical Study by Luke Ferretter. Ferretter also claims that the rare books department at Smith College in Massachusetts has a secret copy of the work under seal. Ferretter believes that the draft of Double Exposure may have been destroyed, stolen, or even lost. He presumes in his book that the draft may lie unfound in a university archive.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this success, it was clear the Blenheim was simply {{not going to work}} as a fighter.

5|$|White Plume Mountain {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The module is a dungeon crawl, precipitated by the theft of three magical, sentient weapons: a trident named Wave, a war hammer named Whelm, and a sword named Blackrazor (all three were introduced in this adventure). The weapons' former owners each received a copy of a taunting poem, instructing them that the weapons are located in White Plume Mountain. The poem is signed by the wizard Keraptis, who thirteen hundred years ago descended into the volcanic mountain with a company of gnomes <b>and</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The player characters goal is to follow the same path and retrieve the weapons from Keraptis' lair.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, the cyclone's eye {{soon began}} to fill and cool as {{weakening}} ensued. Defying previous forecasts, Hellen continued on a southeasterly track toward Madagascar {{and the likelihood of}} it making landfall became apparent. By the end of March30, Hellen's eye had collapsed <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> from satellite imagery, as the combination of dry air and land interaction took their toll on the storm. At about 0800UTC on March31, Hellen made landfall on Mitsinjo, and the previously unfavorable conditions coupled with land interaction to induce rapid weakening. The ridge to the east turned Hellen to a southwest drift over land. By early on April1, the convection largely dissipated as the center became difficult to locate, with peak winds dropping to 45km/h (30mph). As a result, Météo-France discontinued advisories that day, as did the JTWC. The remnants moved back over open waters, but were not expected to reorganize due to the poor nature of the convection. As the low continued to the west, the convection increased on April4 while approaching the coastline of Mozambique, although the system failed to redevelop before moving onshore.|$|E

5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> {{from the scene}} for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
5|$|An unusually small hurricane, with gale-force winds {{extending}} only 60mi (95km) {{from its}} center, Danny {{was prone to}} significant fluctuations in intensity, making forecasts particularly difficult. Indeed, the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non-existent upper-level wind shear. Low-level moisture wrapped around the circulation during this phase, mitigating {{the influence of the}} Saharan Air Layer. Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12:00UTC on August21 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125mph (205km/h) alongside a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa); 28.35inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase. The storm's eye became obscured by clouds <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> from satellite image late on August21.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook <b>and</b> <b>disappeared</b> in the thick woods.|$|E
