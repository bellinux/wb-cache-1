40|$|Education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} activity to be implemented in order to improve the competence of civil servants. A regulation governing the education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> of civil servants is the Indonesian Government Regulation Number 101 Year 2000 on Education <b>and</b> Job <b>Training</b> for Civil Servants. Improving the competence of civil servants through education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> become important in the career advancement of civil servants, education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> is often a requirement to fill a particular position. If the opportunity to participate in different training among civil servants of men and women, it will create different competencies, and in the end there are different opportunities for certain positions. The purpose of the research was to examine the perceptions of female civil servants (PNS) of their opportunities to participate in Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> at the Provincial Government of Bali. Respondents in this study were female civil servant who has held echelon positions of echelon 4 to 2 in all Local Government of Regencies / City and Province of Bali, which numbered 310 people. Samples were taken with a random sampling method. Data were collected through interviews and in-depth interviews. Data analysis technique used is descriptive statistic that comes with a descriptive analysis. The results showed the majority of respondents (over 90 %) of respondents have completed the Education <b>and</b> <b>Training,</b> both Leadership Education <b>and</b> <b>Training,</b> Functional, <b>and</b> Technical Education <b>and</b> <b>Training.</b> Respondents who have not followed Leadership Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> are civil servants who had served echelon 4, and immediately follow the Leadership Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> 4. Respondents perceive that the functional and technical Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> are directly benefitted and related to their duties as compared with Leadership Education <b>and</b> <b>Training,</b> <b>and</b> they also found that it is useful for their work. Based on the existing data and the opinions of respondents, it can be  seen that the higher the levels of leadership education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> the lower the chances of female civil servants to participate in the Leadership Education <b>and</b> <b>Training,</b> even for Leadership Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> I, the chance of female civil servants are very low.

(Adult and Community Education) The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996 : 13) {{stipulates}} {{that everyone has}} the right to Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> <b>and</b> to Further Education <b>and</b> <b>Training,</b> which the state through reasonable measures must make progressively available and accessible to all citizens. It has often been acknowledged that a well-developed Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> sector in the country could make a major contribution to South Africa's economic growth and general social development. The Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> Sector is meant to address the transformation of "night schools" into meaningful Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> centres. In 1997 the Department of Education adopted a framework for the implementation of Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training.</b> This multi-year plan, informed the development of Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> plans at provincial level. Therefore, the Gauteng Department of Education's Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> plan set out a multi-level programme of action for four years, (1997 - 2000), which plan has now been strengthened by the promulgation of Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> Act No. 52 of 2000. The plan strategy as stipulated by the Department of Education (1997 : 4) sought to provide strategic direction for the transformation of Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> Centres in order to respond to the Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> needs of the citizens of this country. The plan also identified priorities, including timeframes that guide the restructuring of the sector. The policy framework as stated above, is quite clear in terms of {{what needs to be done}} to restructure and transform Adult Basic Education <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> centres. However these centres remain untouched by the envisaged developments. The pace at which change is happening is very slow.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze how the enterprise education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> affect the quality of working life based on empirical results. This study contributes to deciding the directions for overall human resource development through examining workers perceptions related to enterprise education <b>and</b> <b>training.</b> The main finding of this paper is that the enterprise performance through the education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> is determined by the various factors that influence the acceptances and perceptions of workers who received the education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> provided by enterprises, regardless of investment and implementation of education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> programs provided by the enterprises. In other words, the highly positive and aggressive factors interact with the strain factor accompanied with pressure, anxiety, and stress. This paper finally concludes as follows: First, the intensive and specified study is needed in order to clarify influence of the strain factors on firm performance. Second, workers recognition and influence on the education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> outcomes depend on the types of education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> such as the firm-specific training or the general training. If the introduction and application of enterprise education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> program reflect on the evaluation of the program, the positive effects of the enterprise education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> for workers can not be expected. Third, all types of enterprise education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> based on the voluntary participation of workers positively affect enterprise performance. It means that the enterprise should implement the enterprise education <b>and</b> <b>training</b> for workers in order to expect high enterprise performance...|$|R
