5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, is being {{given a chance to}} prove her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> knack for arriving {{just in time to see}} his victims' final moments. What she does not expect, however, is for Death to play a role himself.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they may}} not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford {{developed}} <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> ability to communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths. They {{became one of the most}} successful double steal pairings in baseball history.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Blows, who {{had filled}} the glass, {{set it down}} on the table untasted; things seemed <b>a</b> trifle <b>uncanny.</b>|$|R

25|$|Some {{note the}} object in the drawing bears <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> {{similarity}} to the WW2 German design, the Horten Ho 229, sometimes further claiming it was captured German technology being tested. But there is no historical evidence of any kind supporting this.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} able to master {{difficult}} Lotus sportscar prototypes such as the Lotus30 and 40. Clark had <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> ability to adapt to whichever car he was driving. Whilst other drivers would struggle {{to find a good}} car setup, Clark would usually set competitive lap times with whatever setup was provided and ask for the car to be left as it was.|$|E
25|$|His {{personal}} {{warmth and}} charm were combined with <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> ability to inspire confidence {{in a wide}} range of people. No other Irish leader of the time matched his remarkable ability to recruit people of every kind to the movement, win their trust and loyalty, pinpoint their capacities and unite them in coordinated action that was of maximum value to the cause.|$|E

5000|$|The Marvel Comics {{character}} Gateway, an Aboriginal [...] "mutant" [...] {{that lives}} in the Outback and first appeared in <b>a</b> 1988 <b>Uncanny</b> X-Men comic, accesses Dreamland through his mutant powers, giving him precognition {{and the ability to}} teleport others from place to place.|$|R
60|$|The leader arched his wings, {{and with}} a dive swooped into the glade. He alighted near Deering's dead body. He was <b>a</b> dark, <b>uncanny</b> bird, with long, scraggy, bare neck, a wreath of white, grizzled feathers, a cruel, hooked beak, and cold eyes.|$|R
25|$|Jim Henson's Creature Shop {{was brought}} in to provide animal puppet figures for Sethi to act against, {{although}} none appear in the finished film. The animal puppets were performed by Artie Esposito, Sean Johnson, Allan Trautman, and April Warren. Favreau utilized motion capture with certain actors, expressing a desire to avoid overusing the technology in order to prevent evoking <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> valley effect.|$|E
25|$|Hodges is a lab {{technician}} with a BA from Williams College; he {{previously worked}} in the LAPD crime lab, where his superiors felt he had an attitude problem. Hodges has <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> sense of smell, {{and is able to}} identify many key chemical compounds by their scent alone. Although shown to be a loner throughout the series, he forms a close bond with Morgan Brody.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} 120 days in office, Castelli passed {{two pieces of}} {{legislation}}, {{the first of which}} was signed into law by Governor David A. Paterson as Chapter 294 of the Laws of 2010. Castelli showed <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> ability to pass his own prime-sponsored legislation despite {{being a member of the}} Assembly's minority, which has a reputation for legislative powerlessness amid the control of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.|$|E
5000|$|Becker wrote as {{a principled}} liberal.... Yet {{in some respects}} The Heavenly City {{presents}} <b>an</b> almost <b>uncanny</b> anticipation of the [...] "postmodern" [...] reading of the eighteenth century.

60|$|The {{two men had}} <b>an</b> almost <b>uncanny</b> {{understanding}} of one another--like brothers. They {{came from the same}} district, from the same class. Each might have been born into the other's circumstance. Like brothers, there was a profound hostility between them. But hostility is not antipathy.|$|R
50|$|A {{character}} whose {{appearance is}} similar to Loika appears in <b>an</b> issue of <b>Uncanny</b> X-Men, added in by Kris Anka.|$|R
25|$|There was <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> {{parallel}} between the early lives of Maria Hertogh and her mother. Adeline Hunter, born a Eurasian, was adopted by a Muslim family at a young age. She married Adrianus Hertogh {{at the age of}} 15, upon which she converted to Christianity. Maria would later go through the same conversion, at around the same age, albeit involuntarily. Moreover, both were eventually married to Dutch soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Timothy Hutton plays Archie Goodwin, and I can't see {{how anyone}} could do a better job. Not only does he catch Archie's snap-brim Thirties tone with sharp-eared precision, but he also bears <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> {{physical}} resemblance to the dapper detective-narrator I've been envisioning all these years. No sooner did Hutton make his first entrance in The Golden Spiders than he melded completely with the Archie of my mind's eye. I can no longer read a Stout novel without seeing him, or hearing his voice.|$|E
25|$|Phil Jaques, an Australian, was the {{dominant}} {{figure for the}} Yorkshire Phoenix in the Roses battle, scoring 72 from number three before being out to countryman Brad Hodge. That lifted the hosts to 165 for 7, {{but that was not}} enough to defend. Matthew Hoggard, the England Test bowler, showed <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> knack of being uneconomical, conceding 65 runs in his four overs, and despite two wickets he lost the game for the Phoenix. Brad Hodge ended with 64 not out for the visiting Lancashire Lightning as they won with seventeen balls to spare.|$|E
50|$|Auron {{states that}} readers of Musa Dagh {{will have a}} {{difficult}} time believing that the book was written before the Holocaust. Lionel Bradley Steiman writes:In hindsight, the book appears <b>an</b> almost <b>uncanny</b> adumbration of aspects of the later Nazi Holocaust in which the Jews of Europe perished.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come! come!" [...] urged Dave. [...] "That steer is coming! There he is now!" [...] And {{he pointed}} to {{the lower end of the}} ravine, where the animal had just bobbed up among the bushes, shaking his head from side to side in <b>a</b> queer, <b>uncanny</b> way.|$|R
60|$|The cave, lighted up by {{a blazing}} fire, {{appeared}} to me <b>a</b> forbidding, <b>uncanny</b> place. Small, peculiar round holes, and dark cracks, suggestive of hidden vermin, gave me a creepy feeling; and although not over-sensitive {{on the subject of}} crawling, creeping things, I voiced my disgust.|$|R
25|$|The Jain {{religion}} {{places a}} great deal of emphasis on purity of conduct and the ability of the soul to attain liberation through the highest level of meditation. However, there are not that many books on meditation written by the Jains. This automatically places this text in an exclusive category, along with Jinabhadra Gani's Dhyanashataka, Pujyapada's Samadhitantra, Haribhadra's Yogabindu and Yogadrshtisamuccaya, Jinasena's Adipurana, Amitagati's Yogasara Prabhrta and Shravakacara, Gunabhadra's Atmanushasana and Hemacandra's Yogashastra. There is <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> resemblance between this text and Hemacandra's ‘Yogashastra’. Clearly, one has influenced the other. Since Shubhacandra precedes Hemacandra, it is likely that Hemacandra is influenced by Shubhacandra.|$|E
25|$|Paley's {{recognition}} {{of how to}} harness the potential reach of broadcasting {{was the key to}} his growing CBS from a tiny chain of stations into what was eventually one of the world's dominant communication empires. During his prime, Paley was described as having <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> sense for popular taste and exploiting that insight to build the CBS network. As war clouds darkened over Europe in the late 1930s, Paley recognized Americans' desire for news coverage of the coming war and built the CBS news division into a dominant force just as he had previously built the network's entertainment division.|$|E
25|$|Prince's music {{synthesized}} a {{wide variety}} of influences, and drew inspiration from a range of musicians, including James Brown, George Clinton, Joni Mitchell, Duke Ellington, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Chuck Berry, David Bowie, Earth, Wind & Fire, Mick Jagger, Rick James, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Curtis Mayfield, Elvis Presley, Todd Rundgren, Carlos Santana, Sly Stone, Jackie Wilson,, Chicago and Stevie Wonder. Prince has been compared with jazz great Miles Davis in regard to the artistic changes throughout his career; Davis himself regarded Prince as <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> blend of Brown, Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, Stone, Little Richard, Ellington, and Charlie Chaplin.|$|E

50|$|He {{continued}} {{his work on}} X-Men, penciling the first installment, {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> one-shot <b>Uncanny</b> X-Men/Dark Avengers crossover Utopia in 2009. That same year, he contributed to the crossover miniseries Image United, penciling all the characters he created during his run at Image that featured in the story.|$|R
60|$|With {{a shrill}} scream Sheeta was after him--a scream which awoke <b>an</b> almost equally <b>uncanny</b> cry {{in the throat}} of the terror-stricken Chinaman.|$|R
25|$|He was {{a lateral}} thinker, a {{prolific}} reader, especially of military history, and a linguist who was proficient in several languages. A superb conversationalist {{known for his}} disarming charm and excellent social and people skills, he had <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> ability to establish rapport and win people over and achieve consensus. Sharaf could be obdurate, refusing {{to comply with the}} instructions of international border officials to postpone his travel till daylight and insisting on his right, as a diplomat, to free and unfettered movement across borders, only to be told of the impossibility of crossing the border at night due to dangers associated with the presence of active mine fields.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{a popular}} myth, the AMC V8 was not built by Ford or anyone else {{although}} it bears <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> resemblance to the later Buick V8 engines (400, 430, 455). It shares the same design employing a timing gear case that mounts both distributor and oil pump. It also shares the same oiling scheme employing a single passage to feed both cam and crank from the right lifter bank by tangentially intersecting the cam bore instead of two drilled passages, one from the cam to crank and another from the crank to the right lifter bank. Some electrical parts (starter and distributor) were shared with Fords, and some models used Motorcraft (Ford) carburetors, but {{the balance of the}} engine design is unique.|$|E
25|$|When Johnson {{arrived in}} a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or {{in front of the}} local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical {{associates}} have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day– and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>an</b> {{unusual and}} <b>uncanny</b> noise, {{and he stopped}} short to listen. It came from a clump of spruces to his left.|$|R
5000|$|... "Conductor Parry {{seems to}} have <b>an</b> almost <b>uncanny</b> insight into music of the bel canto school, {{particularly}} {{in the selection of}} tempos. He is rhythmically propulsive, always supportive of the singers, but not subject to their whims. Indeed, this is (as is so often true of Parry-led operas) a true ensemble effort." ...|$|R
