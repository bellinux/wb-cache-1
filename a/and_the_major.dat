5|$|Before {{the latter}} half of the 18th century, grain, timber and then coal were Plymouth's main imports. During this time the real source of wealth was from the {{neighbouring}} town of Plymouth Dock (renamed in 1824 to Devonport) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> employer in the entire region was the dockyard. The Three Towns conurbation of Plymouth, Stonehouse and Devonport enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th century and were enriched by a series of neo-classical urban developments designed by London architect John Foulston. Foulston was important for both Devonport and Plymouth and was responsible for several grand public buildings, many now destroyed, including the Athenaeum, the Theatre Royal and Royal Hotel, and much of Union Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Mexico {{operated}} {{two major}} garrisons within its Texas territory, the Alamo at San Antonio de Béxar and Presidio La Bahía near Goliad. Béxar was the political center of Texas, and Goliad laid halfway between it <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> Texas port of Copano. Military and civilian supplies and military personnel were usually sent by sea from the Mexican interior to Copano Bay and then could be transported overland to the Texas settlements.|$|E

5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains the feeding organs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli {{which may or may not}} be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E

5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{has also}} been criticized within Islamic circles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> {{opposition}} in the Indian subcontinent comes from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on da'wa tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.|$|E
5|$|The German birds {{wintering}} in British gardens rely on provided food, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> {{items are}} bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only Christmas cake. Fruit is also eaten, notably cotoneaster (41% {{of the fruit}} consumed), ivy and honeysuckle, and apple if available. Some birds have learned to take peanuts from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and blackbirds. Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.|$|E

Added safety measures are needed for when fuel does escape, mainly to prevent it forming a flammable vapour and stop pollutants from poisoning the environment.|$|E
5|$|The new {{parliament}} passed {{a set of}} measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry swore to uphold. These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then {{had the power to}} appoint England's justiciar, chancellor and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triennial parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> barons. More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year, {{in the form of the}} Provisions of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|The plug-in segment sales {{remained}} flat in 2014 with 30,390 units sold, and {{a market}} share of 1.06% of total new car sales in the country (kei cars not included). Sales totaled 24,660 units in 2015, consisting of 10,420 all-electrics and 14,190 plug-in hybrids. The {{rate of growth of}} the Japanese plug-in segment slowed down from 2013, with annual sales falling behind Europe, the U.S. and China during 2014 and 2015. The decline in plug-in car sales reflects the Japanese government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> domestic carmakers decision to adopt and promote hydrogen fuel cell vehicles instead of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} and the perceived conflict of interest faced by the baseball writers who scored games for MLB eventually led many major newspapers to end the practice for their employees. In 1958, The Washington Post prohibited their writers from scoring baseball games. Over {{the next two decades}} other major newspapers joined in the writer-scorer ban, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> daily newspapers published in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. In 1980, MLB resolved the conflict by directly hiring official scorers for each stadium.|$|E
5|$|As the Kingdom of Bosnia {{continued}} to expand, Tvrtko's attention {{shifted to the}} Adriatic coast. He gained control of the entire Pomorje <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> maritime cities of the area, established new settlements and started building a navy, but never succeeded in subjugating the lords of the independent Serbian territories. The death of King Louis and the accession of Queen Mary in 1382 allowed Tvrtko {{to take advantage of}} the ensuing succession crisis in Hungary and Croatia. After bitter fighting, from 1385 to 1390, Tvrtko succeeded in conquering large parts of Slavonia, Dalmatia, and Croatia proper. Following the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, his tenuous claim to Serbia became a mere fiction, as the Serbian rulers he sought to subdue became vassals of the victorious Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks also launched their first attacks on Bosnia during Tvrtko's reign, but his army was able to repel them. Tvrtko's sudden death in 1391 prevented him from solidifying the Kotromanić hold on Croatian lands.|$|E
5|$|By 2001 NFF was in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} new stadium requirements in the top leagues, and Briskeby would no longer be permitted to be used in the top tier. Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion of gravel and grass fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
