5|$|The Belgrade-based non-government {{organization}} Veritas lists 6,827 {{killed and}} {{missing from the}} Republic of Serbian Krajina, including 4,177 combatants and 2,650 civilians, and 307 JNA members who were from Croatia. Most of them were killed or went missing in 1991 (2,729) and 1995 (2,348). The most deaths occurred in Northern Dalmatia (1,605). The JNA has officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action. The <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> was probably considerably greater, since casualties were consistently underreported. In one example, official reports spoke of two slightly wounded soldiers after an engagement, however, according to the unit's intelligence officer, the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> was 50 killed and 150 wounded.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 {{the orphanage}} had an {{enrollment}} of 70 students aged 4 to 17. By 1898 enrollment stood at 200 students. By {{the time of}} Schneller’s death on 18 October 1896, 1500 students had passed through the orphanage’s doors. The <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> of graduates totaled 425 in 1885 and 1169 at the 50th anniversary of the orphanage in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 6,000 students had died, mostly from disease.|$|E

5|$|There are 37,000 known {{species in}} Croatia, but their <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia {{in the first half of}} the 2000s (decade) alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.|$|E
5|$|Between 950,000–1,000,000 of all {{described}} {{species are}} insects, so over 50% of all described eukaryotes (1.8 million) are insects (see illustration). With only 950,000 known non-insects, if the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> of insects is 5.5 million, they may represent over 80% of the total, {{and with only}} about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year, most insect species likely will remain undescribed, unless species descriptions greatly increase in rate. Of the 24 orders of insects, four dominate in terms of numbers of described species, with at least 670,000 species included in Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has 38,226 known taxa, 2.8% {{of which}} are endemic; the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> (including undiscovered species) is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The estimate is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in 2000–2005 alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in the Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species. Indigenous cultivars of plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous; they include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E

The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth; the fifth was published in 2012. More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. However, because of synonymy, the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> is probably closer to 18,000; only about 500 are in commercial production (470 in 2009–2010).|$|E
5|$|Incorporated {{municipalities}} in Florida may {{be called}} cities, towns, or villages, {{but there is no}} legal distinction between the different terms. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, more than 10million Floridians, 55% of the state's total population of 18,801,310, resided in incorporated municipalities. The remainder resided in unincorporated areas. However, 94% of the population lives in metropolitan areas. Of the remaining 6%, many live in smaller cities and towns, thus the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> of residents living in truly rural areas is small. There are ten counties in the state with just one incorporated municipality and ten counties with only two.|$|E

5|$|Over nine-tenths of {{the total}} biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence. More than 2 million species {{of plant and animal}} life have been {{identified}} to date, and estimates of the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> of existing species range from several million to well over 50million. The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis. The total number of species is in rapid decline.|$|E
5|$|Overclaiming in {{aerial warfare}} is not uncommon. During the Second World War, pilots often claimed more {{aircraft}} shot down than {{was actually the}} case. The Air Ministry released a press statement on 15 September that 175–185 German aircraft had been shot down. The <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> of aircraft destroyed was ⅔ lower and significantly less {{than the number of}} German losses on 15 and 18 August (The Hardest Day), in which the Luftwaffe lost 75 and 69 respectively.|$|E

5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} on 22 August 1984 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1984 and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1984. Under Article 39(1)(b) of the Constitution which {{was introduced by}} the constitutional amendment Act, {{the maximum number of}} NCMPs was set at six. However, the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> that could be declared elected at any general election was fixed at three, less the total number of Opposition MPs elected to Parliament. The President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, could order that between four and six NCMPs be declared elected for the purpose of a particular general election. Such an order ceased to have effect at the next dissolution of Parliament. On 1 July 2010, the need for a presidential order {{to increase the number of}} NCMPs was removed. Instead, the maximum number of NCMPs in Parliament was increased from six to nine, and the <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> that would be declared elected following a general election would be nine less the number of opposition MPs elected to Parliament.|$|E

The <b>actual</b> <b>number</b> of fish returning to the river each year to spawn, prior to European settlement, is uncertain {{due to the lack}} of records. During the first half of the 20th century, before damming, the fall chinook salmon run was estimated at anywhere between 19,000 and 75,500. The spring chinook and coho salmon runs were about 10,000 each and the annual steelhead run was about 50,000.|$|E
5|$|Two limited {{editions of}} the globe were made in Berlin in the mid 1930s, one for the Nazi Party and another for German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler himself.

Tweedbank station saw 183,918 journeys compared to a predicted 18,978, while Galashiels had 104,593 trips against a predicted 20,567.
