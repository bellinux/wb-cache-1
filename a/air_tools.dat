25|$|Incorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs; {{the disc}}'s {{retaining}} bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is simply sandwiched {{in place by}} the wheel, as on many cars) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of <b>air</b> <b>tools</b> to fasten lug nuts can be bad practice, unless a torque wrench is also used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force the bolts apply and tightening should be done with a torque wrench.|$|E
25|$|Currently NSW Ambulance {{operates}} six primary rescue {{units in}} rural NSW and employs over 200 rescue officers. The rural stations are located at Rutherford, Tamworth, Singleton, Cowra, Bomaderry and Wagga Wagga. Officers are trained for {{all forms of}} rescue including, road crash, vertical, confined space, swift water, trench, industrial, technical and domestic to name a few. They learn navigation skills, four wheel driving, urban search and rescue, and chemical biological and radiological procedures. Rescue training commences with the recruitment of up to 12 officers, who are selected to undergo a rigorous six week training course. On successful completion of the course, officers are then rostered to rescue units where training continues with a minimum eight hours of structured training per month. Officers are also required to undergo a recertification program.

5000|$|A {{pneumatic}} <b>tool,</b> <b>air</b> <b>tool,</b> air-powered tool or pneumatic-powered tool {{is a type}} {{of power}} tool, driven by compressed air, supplied by an <b>air</b> compressor. Pneumatic <b>tools</b> can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide (...) stored in small cylinders allowing for portability. Pneumatic tools are safer to run and maintain than their electric power tool equivalents, and have a higher power-to-weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task. General grade pneumatic tools with short life span are commonly cheaper and are also called disposable tools in tooling industries while industrial grade pneumatic tools with long life span are more expensive. In general, pneumatic tools are cheaper than the equivalent electric-powered tools.|$|R

50|$|MJTs are a {{relatively}} safe bolting method because only small hand or <b>air</b> <b>tools</b> {{are required for}} tightening. Other methods, including thermal tightening, crane wrenching, hydraulic wrenches and sledgehammers, can cause serious worker injuries due to heat, electricity, highly pressurized hydraulic fluid and brute force. Back and other injuries can also be avoided because no heavy tightening equipment needs to be lifted onto the bolt. Safety is also increased because MJTs prevent parts from becoming loose.|$|E
