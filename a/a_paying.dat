5|$|The WWE Hall of Fame is a {{hall of fame}} for {{professional}} wrestling personalities maintained by WWE. It was announced on the March 22, 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw where André the Giant, who had died nearly two months prior, was announced as the sole inductee. The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held {{in conjunction with the}} annual King of the Ring pay-per-view events. In 1996, the ceremony was held with the Survivor Series event, {{for the first time in}} front of <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> audience as well as the wrestlers, after which, the Hall of Fame went on hiatus.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>pay</b> cheque, also spelt pay check, is {{traditionally}} a paper document (a cheque) issued by <b>an</b> employer to <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> employee for services rendered. In recent times, the physical paycheck has been increasingly replaced by electronic direct deposits to the employee's designated bank account or loaded onto a payroll card. Employees may still receive <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> slip to detail the calculations {{of the final}} payment amount.|$|R
5|$|The movie {{industry}} {{was born in}} Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumière projected the first motion picture for <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> audience at the Grand Café on 28 December 1895. Many of Paris's concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Later, most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms. Paris's largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.Big multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Bibliothèque with 20 screens and UGC Ciné Cité Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.|$|E
5|$|When Jeanne Silberman {{felt that}} her son's {{potential}} {{was not being}} fully realized in Wisconsin, she sent him to Black-Foxe, a military institute in Hollywood, where he was bullied and sexually assaulted, primarily {{because he was the}} only Jewish boy in the school, according to his own account. After an unsuccessful short stay at Black-Foxe, Wilder returned home and became increasingly involved with the local theatre community. He performed {{for the first time in}} front of <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> audience at age 15, as Balthasar (Romeo's servant) in a production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves (9).|$|E
50|$|By 12 July 2009, Parlon and the Electrical Contractors Association {{had agreed}} to pay the {{striking}} electricians <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> increase of 4.9%, rather than <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> cut of 10% which he had publicly demanded. The pay increases had been due {{for a number of}} years.|$|R
25|$|In January 2015, when CY Leung {{reversed}} <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> freeze {{imposed on}} the CE and senior civil servants in 2012, {{he was accused of}} granting himself <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> rise by stealth and going against the trend of top politicians taking pay cuts instead of pay increases.|$|R

5|$|Sotomayor was {{an adjunct}} {{professor}} at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007. There she taught trial and appellate advocacy {{as well as a}} federal appellate court seminar. Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School in <b>a</b> <b>paying,</b> adjunct faculty position. While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work. She {{became a member of the}} Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011. In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove. On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.|$|E
5|$|The Who first {{performed}} the song {{live at the}} opening date {{of a series of}} Lifehouse related concerts in the Young Vic theatre, London on 14 February 1971. It has subsequently been part of every Who concert since, often as the set closer and sometimes extended slightly to allow Townshend to smash his guitar or Moon to kick over his drumkit. The group performed live over the synthesizer part being played on a backing tape, which required Moon to wear headphones to hear a click track, allowing him to play in sync. It was the last track Moon played live in front of <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> audience on 21 October 1976 and the last song he ever played with the Who at Shepperton Studios on 25 May 1978, which was captured on the documentary film The Kids Are Alright. The song was part of the Who's set at Live Aid in 1985, Live 8 in 2005, T4 on the Beach in 2008 and Capital FM's Summertime Ball concert in 2009, 2010 and 2015 and the radio station's Jingle Bell Ball concerts in 2009 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|While the {{scientists}} argued over classifications and nomenclature, they also returned west for more fossils. Marsh made his last trip backed by Yale in 1873, {{with a large}} group of thirteen students accompanying him, protected by a group of soldiers who wanted to make a show of force to the Sioux tribe. Due to concerns over his more lavish and expensive expeditions in years past, Marsh had the students pay their own way, and the trip cost Yale only $1857.50, far less than the $15,000 (over $200,000 in modern currency) that Marsh had claimed for the previous expedition. This excursion would prove to be Marsh's last: {{for the rest of the}} Bone Wars, Marsh preferred to enlist the services of local collectors. Though he had enough bones to study for years, the scientist's appetite for more would grow. Cope was even more prolific in his collecting that season than he was in 1872, although Marsh's penchant for cultivating collectors of his own meant that at Bridger his rival was persona non grata. Tired of working under Hayden, Cope found <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> job with the Army Corps of Engineers, but was limited by this federal association; while Cope had to tag along on surveys, Marsh could collect wherever he pleased.|$|E

5|$|The {{money that}} Callum won from the casino is missing, and Samantha finds it with Jenny {{and her husband}} Dean (Tom Pelphrey), after they stole it. Jenny and Dean are brought into {{question}}ing; however Jenny tells Megan that Callum was giving it to her, to go on an art course. Samantha talks to Frank again, but when they question him about Irina {{but he does not}} know her. They find out that Irina was Callum's nurse, for his arthritis and that Callum was going to help Irina get her son from Belgrade to the US. Irina confesses that she did cut up Callum, but did not kill him. Irina found Callum dead, so cut him up so that she could forge the last immigration document to get her son to her as Callum had not finished it. Irina tells Megan where the head is, and they find a fracture on his head. Megan and Samantha go back to Callum’s apartment, and Megan demonstrates why Irina couldn’t have killed Callum due to the mark on the wall being too high to be Irina. Megan traces metal to Callum's landlord, Mike Walsh (Kelly AuCoin). Samantha infers that because Cal was under rent control, Mike killed him so <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> client could stay in the apartment. Meanwhile, Lacey Fleming (Mary Mouser) asks if she can go to Megan's work, for a school project. Lacey arrives, and speaks with Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), discussing her work. Lacey tries to get Kate to allow her to see the body, however she refuses. Lacey speaks to Ethan, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and later Megan, who shows her pictures of bodies, telling her about her job.|$|E

25|$|With the {{bankruptcy}} of the aristocracy and new social orders throughout Europe, composers increasingly had to make money by selling their compositions and performing concerts. They often gave subscription concerts, which involved renting a hall and collecting the receipts from the performance. Increasingly, they wrote chamber music not only for rich patrons, but for professional musicians playing for <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> audience.|$|E

25|$|Following the engagement, Diana {{left her}} {{occupation}} as a kindergarten teacher and {{lived for a}} short period at Clarence House, which was the home of the Queen Mother. She then lived at Buckingham Palace until the wedding. Diana was the first Englishwoman to become the spouse of an heir apparent in 300 years, and she was also the first royal bride to have <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> job before her engagement. She made her first public appearance with Prince Charles in a charity ball in March 1981 at Goldsmiths' Hall, where she met the Princess of Monaco.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Bougainville's published account, Baret's story figures in three other surviving memoirs of the expedition: a journal kept jointly by Commerson and Pierre Duclos-Guyot; a journal by the Prince of Nassau-Siegen, <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> passenger on the Boudeuse; and a memoir by François Vivès, surgeon on the Étoile. Vivès {{has the most}} to say about Baret, but his memoir is problematical because he and Commerson were on bad terms throughout the voyage, and his account – largely written or revised after the fact – is full of innuendo and spiteful comments directed at both Commerson and Baret.|$|E
25|$|By 1859 most of {{the extreme}} {{clippers}} had been dismasted more than once after half {{a decade or more}} of relentless hard driving. All were in a leaky condition, and {{most of the}}ir owners were by then in dire financial straits and could not afford expensive repairs to clippers that could not find <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> cargo to justify such expenses. Their masts were cut down, their yards shortened and their sails reduced as they were refitted and re-rigged with the new Howes rig to make them easier to handle by smaller crews. Other less fortunate clippers were discarded outright and sold for a pittance.|$|E

25|$|The five {{foundation}} senior {{clubs in}} the Melbourne metropolitan area were Albert-park, Carlton, Hotham (later North Melbourne), Melbourne and St Kilda. Provincial clubs were also eligible for senior representation on the Association, even though most seldom played matches against the metropolitan teams; Geelong, the nearest provincial club to the metropolis, was the most prominent provincial club, joining the Association in 1877 and playing regularly against metropolitan clubs by 1880. There was no formal system of promotion and relegation between the senior and junior levels, with it largely at a club's discretion {{whether or not it}} joined the Association as <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> senior member. The affiliation fee for senior clubs was initially set at one guinea.|$|E
25|$|Pay What You Want – In 2013 comedian Bob Slayer {{introduced}} a new model to the Fringe, at his Heroes of Fringe venues, where punters could 'Buy a ticket in advance to guarantee a seat or Pay What You Want on exit'. The model {{is a mixture of}} Paid and Free and enables performers to find <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> audience without risking large marketing spend. Phil Kay, Tom Binns and Miss Behave were amongst the first established acts to embrace this model along with Adrienne Truscott who won the Edinburgh Comedy Awards Panel Prize with a PWYW. Adam Hess was nominated for best newcomer in 2015. Other promoters such as Just the Tonic, Pleasance and C-Venues have since introduced the model to their venues. In 2016, Gilded Balloon adopted PWYW for the Counting House venue, which was previously a Free Festival venue.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} cinema in Germany {{can be traced}} back to the years shortly after the medium's birth. On November 1, 1895 Max Skladanowsky and his brother Emil {{demonstrated}} their self-invented film projector the Bioscop at the Wintergarten music hall in Berlin. A 15-minute series of eight short films, it was the first screening of films to <b>a</b> <b>paying</b> audience in Europe. This performance pre-dated the first paying public display of the Lumière brothers' Cinematographe in Paris on December 28 of the same year, a performance that Max Skladanowsky attended and at which he was able to ascertain that the Cinematographe was technically superior to his Bioscop. Other German film pioneers included the Berliners Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe, two of several individuals who independently in 1896 first used a Geneva drive (which allows the film to be advanced intermittently one frame at a time) in a projector, and the cinematographer Guido Seeber.|$|E
