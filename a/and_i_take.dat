25|$|My idea {{suggested}} to that gentleman {{was to write}} a story in which the principal character should be a miser, who had a daughter, and that the struggles of feeling between the love for his child and his love of money, should produce certain effects and results; and as all my ancestors were mixed up in the Rebellion of '45, I suggested that the story should be of that date, in order that I might introduce some scenes and circumstances connected with that great party struggle, and also wishing to let the public of the present day have a peep at the places of public amusement of the period, I took considerable pains to give correct views and descriptions of those places which are now copied and produced upon the stage; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> this opportunity of complimenting my friend Halliday for the very excellent and effective manner in which he has dramatised the story.|$|E

[...] "Disi water is purer than bottled water <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> full responsibility for what I’m saying,” [...] the Minister said during a press conference.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his return}} from the Middle East, Jackson was briefly an {{instructor}} at No.1 Service Flying Training School, based at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. He wrote to his wife, [...] "I just loathe this joint. This training is a tough job <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> my hat off to the boys who {{have been doing it}} since war broke out... every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas, but I doubt if they have any chance of ever getting there—they are so valuable here." [...] In January 1942, he was posted to No.4 Squadron, which operated Wirraways in Canberra.|$|E

500|$|Writing in Variety, {{the sister}} of Parker's alleged victim {{discussed}} the immense pain that Parker's The Birth of a Nation brought to her and her family, [...] "As her sister, the thing that pains me most of all is that in retelling {{the story of the}} Nat Turner slave revolt, they invented a rape scene. The rape of Turner’s wife is used as a reason to justify Turner’s rebellion. [...] This is fiction. I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape. [...] Given what happened to my sister, and how no one was held accountable for it, I find this invention self-serving and sinister, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> it as a cruel insult to my sister’s memory." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title is}} derived from Big Boi's long-time moniker [...] "Sir Lucious Left Foot". In several interviews, he has {{explained}} part {{of it as a}} reference to the Southern slang phrase [...] "gettin’ out on the good foot", while describing the entire moniker as an indication of maturity, noting it as [...] "my real grown-man persona" [...] and [...] "like my Luke-Skywalker-becoming-a-Jedi persona. Like, I'm just really serious about my craft, I've mastered it, and I'm very skilled at it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> pride in making this music". He incorporated the nickname [...] "Chico Dusty" [...] to the album's title as a dedication to his late father, Tony Kearse, who gained it while serving as a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force and Marines. The spelling of luscious in the album's title, Big Boi's moniker, is intended to reflect on its distinctive pronunciation [...] "loo-shuss", which according to Big Boi, is not [...] "the girl name; you call a girl luscious, along the lines of voluptuous".|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} to Powell increased Lombard's fame, while {{she continued to}} please critics with her work in Up Pops the Devil <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Take</b> this Woman (both 1931). In reviews for the latter film, which co-starred Gary Cooper, several critics predicted that Lombard was set to become a major star. She went on to appear in five films throughout 1932. No One Man and Sinners in the Sun were not successful, but Edward Buzzell's romantic picture Virtue was well received. After featuring in the drama No More Orchids, Lombard was cast as {{the wife of a}} con artist in No Man of Her Own. Her co-star for the picture was Clark Gable, who was rapidly becoming one of Hollywood's top stars. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Wes Gehring writes that it was [...] "arguably Lombard's finest film appearance" [...] to that point. It was the only picture that Gable and Lombard, future husband and wife, made together. There was no romantic interest at this time however, as she recounted to Garson Kanin: [...] " [...] did all kinds of hot love scenes... and I never got any kind of tremble out of him at all".|$|E

500|$|York's run of two {{straight}} losses ended after drawing 0–0 {{at home to}} Portsmouth, in which Brunt missed a header from fouryards in the third minute of stoppage time. Sheffield United's 19-year-old striker Diego De Girolamo, an Italy under-20 international, joined on a one-month youth loan {{as a result of}} injuries to Coulson, Fletcher and Hyde. De Girolamo scored seven minutes into his debut away to Newport County with a low finish, but after Penn was sent off for a second bookable offence the home team scored three goals in the second half, York losing the match 3–1. With York one place above the relegation zone Worthington resigned as manager, and was quoted saying [...] "In recent weeks, performances have not been up to my high standards <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> full responsibility for this". Steve Torpey, who was Worthington's assistant manager, took over as caretaker manager before Russ Wilcox was appointed as manager two days after Worthington's departure. Wilcox had been sacked as Scunthorpe United manager a week earlier with them second from bottom in the League One table, having led them to promotion the previous season as League Two runners-up.|$|E
500|$|For the costumes, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{designer}} Marlene Stewart. She expanded {{on the idea}} of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from [...] "True Blue", [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita". For [...] "Open Your Heart", Madonna reused the Stewart designed black bustier worn by her in the video, complete with tassels, golden tips and ribbing with fishnets on leg. Stewart's other designs included a Flamenco style dress for [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and a gold lamé jacket for the [...] "White Heat" [...] sequence. On the medley sequence, Madonna used a dress that was visually amusing and, according to Madonna, was for [...] "anyone that takes me too seriously, or imagined <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> myself too seriously." [...] Inspired by Dame Edna Everage, the dress consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits, flowers and feathers, jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy, black frames, a ruffled skirt and a bodice covered with objects such as watches and dolls and fishnets. The knickers were inscribed with the word [...] "Kiss". Continuing her tradition of message clothes, she spelt out the phrase [...] "You Can Dance" [...] on her jacket, using the letter U, a can of soup and the word [...] "dance" [...] at the back.|$|E
500|$|Four {{weeks after}} the Rebel, Oxbow entered his last preparatory race before the Triple Crown campaign, the Grade I Arkansas Derby, held on April 13. This race {{marked the first time}} Oxbow was ridden by 50-year-old Stevens, who was Oxbow's seventh jockey in nine races. The horse was the {{favorite}} at 3–1, but once again drew an unfavorable, far-outside post at ten. Oxbow came out ninth at the break and was almost seven lengths behind the leader at the start. He had developed a reputation for running in front and wearing out his exercise riders, so Stevens unsuccessfully attempted to rate Oxbow and make him run off the pace, behind other horses. Oxbow, described by observers as [...] "very rank", and by Stevens as [...] "pissed off... upset with me that he didn't get the running style he wanted", was tossing his head and fighting Stevens into the clubhouse turn. After running last {{at one point in the}} race, Oxbow improved his position and finished fifth, less than a length behind second-place Frac Daddy. [...] Oxbow earned a speed figure of 90, the same as in his maiden win. Stevens viewed his attempt to make Oxbow run off the pace as a mistake. [...] "It just turned out to be a nightmare trip <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> full (responsibility) for that", he said. Lukas agreed, stating, [...] "That will not be in [...] grandchildren's highlight film".|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E

At 1 p.m. on October 4, when pursuit would have been most effective, Rosecrans rode along his line to deny in person a rumor that he had been slain. At Battery Robinett he dismounted, bared his head, and told his soldiers, [...] "I stand in the presence of brave men, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> my hat off to you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1970 Florida Gators {{featured}} All-American {{defensive end}} Jack Youngblood, {{and he pulled}} {{off one of the}} most remarkable plays in Florida football history.

[...] "They ran a lead play to my side, and I cut it off", Youngblood said. [...] "I'm standing there holding the ballcarrier <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> the ball away from him, and gave it back to our offense." [...] Gators quarterback John Reaves and wide receiver Carlos Alvarez then connected for two touchdown passes in the final 5:13 to rally the Florida Gators to a 24–17 victory.|$|E
