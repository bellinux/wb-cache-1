5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not {{prove to be}} the {{opportunity}} as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E

5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Barton Fink is {{loosely based on}} Clifford Odets, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the Group Theatre, a gathering of dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski's system of <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! and Waiting for Lefty (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward the familial realism of Eugene O'Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.|$|E

5|$|Three main installments, {{as well as}} one online game, were {{published}} for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). The 2001 title Final FantasyX introduced full 3D areas and voice <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> the series, and was the first to spawn a direct video game sequel (Final Fantasy X-2, published in 2003). The first massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) in the series, Final FantasyXI, was released on the PS2 and PC in 2002, and later on the Xbox 360. It introduced real-time battles instead of random encounters. Final Fantasy XII, published in 2006, also includes real-time battles in large, interconnected playfields. The game is also the first in the main series to utilize a world used in a previous game, namely the land of Ivalice, which had previously featured in Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story.|$|E
5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's mother was not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult as she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with good grades. Considering <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> be a natural fit for her, she turned down several offers for modelling assignments at the time. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, during which she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg {{launched}} the NYC Media Lab to promote innovations in New York's media industry.

The Lab is modeled after similar ones at MIT and Stanford. A $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation was used to establish the NYC Media Lab. Each year, the lab will host a range of roundtable discussions between {{the private sector and}} academic institutions. It will support research projects on topics of content format, next-generation search technologies, computer animation for film and gaming, emerging marketing techniques, and new devices development. The lab will also create a media research and development database. Columbia University will coordinate the long-term direction of the media lab as well as the involvement of its faculty and those of other universities.|$|E

5|$|Tales of Rebirth {{is set in}} a {{world where}} humans (called Huma) and beast people (Gajuma) coexist in {{relative}} peace. The world's magical power is called Force, which manifests in various people as control over an element or aspect of the physical laws. In ancient times, after a war sparked when Huma attempted to enslave Gajuma, both races joined forces to found the kingdom of Karegia. An unspecified time before the events of the game, Geyorkias, the ruler of a spirit race called the Sacred Beasts, sought to destroy the Huma as their dark emotions were fueling a primordial destructive force known as Yuris: the other Sacred Beasts put a stop to Geyorkias' plan by sealing him away, then <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> nullify Yuris' threat. The story opens with the death of Karegia's king, Ladras Lindblum, poisoned by the royal adviser Zilva Madigan: during his final moments, he releases his power into the world, causing many humans to become possessed by Force, including Veigue, Annie and Tytree. As the king has failed to name a successor, Karegia enters an interregnum at his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from the Ozarks into the Northeastern United States, <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the risk area. At the surface, a weak {{area of low pressure}} initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April9 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an arching warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest surface heating ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values to reach 1,000–1,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s °F across the Enhanced risk area. Winds at 850 mb (4,781ft) strengthened at or above 45mph (75km/h) below winds of 70mph (110km/h) at 700 mb (9,882ft), creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds was expected to be less than ideal as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics, but {{contained within the}} reviews were often criticism on {{the execution of the}} story and plot. A review in the The Moving Picture World was positive to the moral lesson the film asserted and found the <b>acting</b> <b>to</b> be satisfactory. Walton of the The Moving Picture News criticized the type of film as invoking sudden and unnatural changes in character {{for the sake of a}} moral lesson. The child's influence and ability to bring sense to her father was seen as cheap theatrics, but ended with the assertion that the film was not second rate for employing such theatrics. The New York Dramatic Mirror was positive, but said that the scene upon which the little girl follows her father was not believable because she was unaware of her father's intentions to kill himself. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
