Across the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam had experienced deadly flooding in the week before Nepartak's approach, and the typhoon initially raised concerns about worsening the situation. Officials made preparations to minimize potentially exacerbating factors, and the cyclone remained far enough east to avoid seriously impacting the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the award Braham was out celebrating at a pub. He attempted {{to drive home}} whilst intoxicated and crashed into a traffic island. Although drinking and driving was not a criminal offence, the police charged him with damaging public property and fined him £5, {{the equivalent of a}} weeks wages. It was his third car crash. His success did not <b>abate.</b> A Ju 88 and Do 217 were claimed off the English coast on the nights of the 26 and 31 October 1942.|$|E

5|$|Robert Kurrle (February 2, 1890 – October 27, 1932), {{also known}} as Robert B. Kurrle, was an American cinematographer during the silent and early talking film eras. Prior to {{entering}} the film industry, he was already experimenting with aerial photography. Considered a very prominent cinematographer, even his early work received notice and praise from both critics and other industry professionals. The advent of sound film did not <b>abate</b> his continued rise, and he became the top director of photography at Warner Brothers by 1932.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to <b>abate</b> while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E

5|$|By 1905 the {{previously}} fragmented Buginese and Torajan lands had united into four major areas, {{one of which}} was under Tiku. In July of that year the king of Gowa, a nearby state, began collecting soldiers to fight off the invaders and prevent the remainder of the Torajan lands from conquest. Ma'dika Bombing, a leader from a southern state, approached Tiku for his assistance. A month after the messengers had dispersed, the leaders gathered at Gowa to make a plan of action. The result was that the local lords were to stop warring amongst themselves and focus on the Dutch, who had superior strength; these internal conflicts, however, did not completely <b>abate.</b> By the time the meeting adjourned, the Dutch had already begun making advances on Luwu. Tiku, tasked with diverting the Dutch from the indefensible town of Rantepo, began to build his army and work on his defences.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 2008, Behan was {{questioned}} by the Carabinieri (Italian military police) {{in connection with the}} murder of a 72-year-old woman, Silvana <b>Abate</b> Francescatti, at her home on Monte Amiata, Arcidosso, in Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy. The woman was found on 11 July with 13 stab wounds, including a fatal throat wound, but was believed to have died the previous day. Behan, who had been resident in Arcidosso for part of the year since 2006, was arrested after seeking treatment twice at a hospital near Arcidosso for a cut on his thigh. In an interview with The Irish Times, he claimed he had first gone to the hospital on 10 July after cutting himself in the thigh while unpacking furniture and other objects delivered from the USA. However, hospital staff had mistakenly decided he had been acting suspiciously due to his poor spoken Italian, {{and the fact that he}} had expressed annoyance at how the hospital was managed and its bad signage.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1997, the {{prosecution}} {{began to call}} more witnesses. Although attendance did not <b>abate,</b> most observers were police officers or paid spectators. One witness, {{who claimed to have}} participated in a sting operation to arrest Sumaji, was arrested for perjury. An officer who investigated Sumaji reported that he had pursued the driver based on instinct, not evidence. Wuryanto, while presenting his account, was contemptuous towards the defence and ordered by the judge several times to answer truthfully. On 3 November, {{the prosecution}} withdrew its case. Under Indonesian law, the judges had the right to find the subject guilty despite the prosecution's withdrawal; after further consideration, on 27 November, the tribunal acquitted Sumaji. Following the acquittal, Bantual police refused to investigate Udin's murder further; several of Yogyakarta's police chiefs stated that the department had fulfilled its duty by arresting a suspect and sending him to trial.|$|E

5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to <b>abate</b> the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, <b>abate</b> noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E
