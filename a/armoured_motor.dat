5|$|The 5th Light Horse Brigade {{with the}} 2nd Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Battery, had {{advanced}} quickly along the Tulkarm-to-Nablus road {{to attack the}} last resistance outside Nablus and capture the town, between 800 and 900 prisoners and two field guns. The Régiment Mixte de Marche de Cavalerie, with two armoured cars, entered Nablus while the 14th Light Horse Regiment linked with the 29th and 30th Brigades (10th Division, XX Corps) at Balata.|$|E
5|$|Supported by two {{armoured}} cars of the Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Battery, Macpherson {{decided to}} attack Tiberias {{without waiting for}} the rest of his brigade. While one of his troops rode into the town, the armoured cars closed in from the west, the squadron from the 8th Light Horse Regiment attacked from the north–west, and the squadron from the 12th Light Horse Regiment attacked from the south–west. During this coordinated attack the 12th Light Horse Regiment troops captured a machine gun post at the gallop. The town and 100 members of the Tiberias garrison were captured by 15:00, including 20 Germans and 13 machine guns.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Cavalry Division {{consisted}} of the 10th, 11th and 12th Cavalry Brigades, the 5th Cavalry Division {{was made up of}} the 13th, 14th and 15th Cavalry Brigades and the Australian Mounted Division was made up of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Light Horse Brigades. The 5th Light Horse Brigade, was temporarily attached to the 60th Division for the Battle of Tulkarm. These mounted units were supported by machine gun squadrons, three artillery batteries from the Royal Horse Artillery or Honourable Artillery Company, and light armoured car units; two Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Batteries, and two Light Car Patrols.|$|E
50|$|The T-12 entered {{service in}} 1961, {{replacing}} the BS-3 100 mm field gun. It was typically {{deployed in the}} anti-tank units of <b>armoured</b> and <b>motor</b> rifle regiments to protect flanks against counter-attacks during rapid advances.|$|R

25|$|It was {{intended}} to form an armoured division in the plans for 1940, 1941 and 1942. However, the Indian armoured formations suffered {{from a lack of}} equipment. The shortage of tanks in 1940 was reflected in the organisation of 31st Armoured Division, which first had one <b>armoured</b> and two <b>motor</b> brigades. At the end of 1940, this was changed to two <b>armoured</b> and one <b>motor</b> brigade. When the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade was sent to Egypt, the British armoured division organisation of two armoured brigades and a Support group was adopted.|$|R
5|$|Before {{they could}} deploy, the two mounted {{divisions}} of Desert Mounted Corps had to ride between , {{to bring them}} {{within striking distance of}} Beersheba at dawn on 31 October. Chauvel arrived at the Asluj Desert Mounted Corps headquarters during the afternoon of 30 October, when arrangements were completed for the continuation of the marches by the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions. The Anzac Mounted Division was at Asluj, the Australian Mounted Division was at Khalasa (three hours' march behind) and the 7th Mounted Brigade was at Bir el Esani. The No. 11 Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Battery (LAMB) was sent ahead of the Anzac Mounted Division to a position on the north slopes of the Gebel el Shereif to guard their flank as they moved forward. The divisional headquarters at Asluj closed at 17:30, and the last Anzac divisional troops left the railway station a half-hour later.|$|E
5|$|Each mounted {{division}} of about 3,500 troopers, {{consisted of three}} brigades, each brigade being made up of three regiments. Five of the six brigades of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions, most of which had recently arrived from France, consisted of one British yeomanry regiment and two British Indian Army cavalry regiments, {{one of which was}} usually lancers, including the Indian Princely States' 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade of three lancer regiments. Some of the cavalry regiments were armed in addition to their Lee–Enfield rifles, bayonets and swords, with lances. The Australian Mounted Division consisting of three light horse brigades, each with three regiments, containing a headquarters and three squadrons. With 522 men and horses in each regiment, they were armed in addition to their rifles and bayonets with swords. The mounted divisions were supported by machine gun squadrons, three artillery batteries from the Royal Horse Artillery or the Honourable Artillery Company, and light armoured car units—two Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Batteries, and two Light Car Patrols.|$|E
5|$|With the 11th Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Battery and 1st Light Car Patrol attached, the 4th Cavalry Division watered at the 'Auja River {{before moving}} to the {{south-east}} of Jlil, close behind the infantry and the front line. From here, a divisional pioneer party reached the front line at 07:00 on 19 September to cut a gap and flag a path through the Ottoman wire. By 08:40 permission was given by the 7th (Meerut) Division, which had attacked the western sector of the Tabsor defences, for the 4th Cavalry Division, accompanied by three horse artillery batteries which had rejoined the division after taking part in the bombardment and creeping barrage {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Sharon, to pass through the gap in the Ottoman front line defences created by their attacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{armoured}} reconnaissance regiment {{was equipped}} with medium tanks, bringing the armoured divisions to a strength of 246 medium tanks (roughly 340 tanks in total) {{and by the end}} of the Battle of Normandy the divisions started to operate as two brigade groups, each of two combined arms teams, each in turn of one tank regiment and one infantry battalion (The armoured reconnaissance regiment was matched with the <b>armoured</b> brigade's <b>motor</b> battalion to provide the fourth group).|$|R
25|$|After Operation Substance Melbourne Star {{returned}} independently to Gibraltar {{and then}} crossed the Atlantic to Trinidad, where she arrived on 17 November 1941. 12 days later she left and sailed independently back to Liverpool, where she arrived on 29 November. She {{seems to have}} spent Christmas 1941 and New Year 1942 in Liverpool, where she loaded a cargo for South Africa of <b>armoured</b> vehicles, <b>motor</b> transports, artillery, stores and two aircraft. She joined Convoy WS 15, which left on 10 January and reached Freetown on 25 January. Melbourne Star continued south, reaching Durban on 13 February.|$|R
50|$|Afghan forces {{achieved}} {{success in}} the initial days of the war, taking the British and Indians by surprise in two main thrusts as the Afghan regular army was joined by large numbers of Pashtun tribesmen {{from both sides of}} the border. A series of skirmishes then followed as the British and Indians recovered from their initial surprise. As a counterbalance to deficiencies in manpower and morale, the British had a considerable advantage in terms of equipment, possessing machine guns, <b>armoured</b> cars, <b>motor</b> transport, wireless communications and aircraft and it was the latter that would prove decisive.|$|R
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{divisions}} {{was made up of}} three brigades, each with three regiments. The 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions which had transferred from France, consisted of one British yeomanry regiment and two British Indian Army cavalry regiments, one of which was usually lancers. Except the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade which had three regiments of Indian Imperial Service Troops lancers. Some of the cavalry regiments were armed, in addition to their Lee–Enfield rifles, bayonets and swords, with lances. The 5th Cavalry Division, consisted of three lancer regiments. The Australian Mounted Division consisting of three light horse brigades, each of three regiments consisting of a headquarters and three squadrons; 522 men and horses in each regiment, was armed with swords, Lee–Enfield rifles and bayonets, while the Anzac Mounted Division detached to Chaytor's Force, was, and remained throughout the war, only armed with rifles and bayonets. These divisions were supported by machine guns, three batteries from the Royal Horse Artillery or Honourable Artillery Company, and light armoured car units; two Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Batteries, and two Light Car Patrols.|$|E
5|$|At Homs, {{the brigade}} rested {{for two days}} and on 19 October headed for Er Rastan, with orders to repair a bridge over the River Orontes, which had been {{destroyed}} by retreating Turkish forces. The next day, assisted by No. 5 Field Squadron Royal Engineers, was spent repairing the bridge, after which the brigade advanced, reaching Hama on 21 October. The brigade had expected to rest there for several days but were ordered to continue the advance to Aleppo. The brigade was preceded by seven light armoured cars, but {{the remainder of the}} division was following a day behind. On 24 October the armoured cars' advance was stopped by Turkish defences near Khan Tuman. The Turkish held a strong defensive line on a ridge line to the south and west of Aleppo. The brigade was ordered to occupy a position on the Aleppo-Alexandretta road and to clear Turkish trenches on the ridge to the west of Aleppo, but when they reached the ridge line on 26 October, the position had been evacuated. Intelligence from locals suggested that a force of 1,000 men with two small artillery guns were heading north out of Aleppo, so the brigade set off in pursuit. At 11:00, the leading two Jodhpur Lancers squadrons and a machine-gun section reached a position overlooking Haritan to the north of Aleppo when they came under Turkish small arms fire. Harbord ordered an immediate brigade attack; the Mysore Lancers would move around to the east of the ridge and charge the village, followed by the other two Jodhpur Lancer squadrons while the remainder of the brigade machine-gun squadron would move onto the ridge to provide covering fire, with the two other Jodhpur squadrons. The armoured cars of No. 12 Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Battery arrived at 11:30 and were ordered along the main road to support the attack.|$|E

50|$|The {{nature of}} the Western Front {{gave rise to the}} need for {{motorized}} machine gun units. Canada's first <b>armoured</b> unit, 1st <b>Motor</b> Machine Gun Brigade, was formed and equipped with armoured cars. By the war's end it had earned 21 battle honours. The 6th Duke of Connaught's Royal Canadian Hussars perpetuates the 1st Motor Machine Gun Brigade and shares its battle honours.|$|R
50|$|Soon after 3rd Canadian Tank Brigade {{assumed the}} {{designation}} in summer 1943 {{of the original}} 2nd Canadian Tank Brigade, the new 2nd Tank was redesignated and reorganized as 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. Although reorganized as an <b>armoured</b> brigade, no <b>motor</b> battalion served under its command. The brigade {{was assigned to the}} British 2nd Army in January 1944 to train for the upcoming amphibious assault in Normandy.|$|R
25|$|The 5th Cavalry Division's {{fighting}} {{strength of}} 2,500 included the strongest column of armoured cars so far {{employed in the}} theatre. These included the 2nd, 11th and 12th Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Batteries and the 1st (Australian), 2nd and 7th Light Car Patrols.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{units were}} attached to the Australian Mounted Division for their attack on Es Salt: the 1st Light Horse Brigade from the Anzac Mounted Division, the Mysore and Hyderabad lancers, from the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, the Dorset and Middlesex Yeomanry from the 6th, the 8th Mounted Brigades, the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Artillery Battery and the 12th Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Battery.|$|E
25|$|Following its {{reorganisation}} in {{the summer}} of 1918, 75th Division joined General Allenby's final offensive (the Battles of Megiddo). At the Battle of Sharon (19 September), 75th Division was given the task of taking Miske and the trench system around the village of Et Tire, held by the Turkish 49th Division. Palin had under his command 'A' Squadron (Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry) of the Composite Corps Cavalry Regiment and 2nd Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Battery, Machine Gun Corps.|$|E
2500|$|During the Battle of Normandy, the 7th Armoured Division {{instituted a}} {{flexible}} structure {{prior to the}} Battle of Villers-Bocage in early June 1944. Similar structures would not be adopted by the other armoured divisions until after Operation Goodwood, when Lieutenant-General Richard O’Connor ordered the Guards and 11th Armoured Divisions to organise themselves similarly. The divisions operated from then on as two brigade groups; each of two combined arms teams, both made up of one tank regiment and one infantry battalion; the armoured reconnaissance regiment was matched with the <b>armoured</b> brigade’s <b>motor</b> battalion to provide the fourth group. Towards {{the end of the}} Normandy campaign, the 11th Hussars, an armoured car regiment, was placed back under the command of the 7th Armoured Division.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{creation}} of the Irish Free State, the name Slievenamon was unofficially given {{to one of the}} 13 <b>armoured</b> Rolls Royce <b>motor</b> cars which were handed over to the new Free State army by the outgoing administration. Slievenamon was escorting the army's commander-in-chief, Michael Collins, when he was ambushed and killed near Béal na Bláth. The car, since renamed to the Irish Sliabh na mBan, has been preserved by the Irish Defence Forces.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} {{usage of}} draisines concerned, first of all, armoured draisines. They were light <b>armoured</b> rail <b>motor</b> vehicles, intended for reconnaissance, scouting, track patrolling, and other auxiliary combat tasks, usually belonging to armoured trains. Early vehicles {{of this kind}} were built in Russia during World War I. Later, often armoured cars were used as armoured draisines, after exchanging their wheels to railroad ones, or fitting them with additional retractable railroad rollers. Some countries, however, manufactured purpose-built armoured draisines between the wars, such as the USSR and Czechoslovakia. Peculiar vehicles were Polish armoured draisines - they were tanks or tankettes fitted with special rail chassis, able to be used on rails or on the ground, leaving the rail chassis on the rails. Some countries developed railtrack armoured draisines, with retractable tracks railroad wheels; they were not widely used, however. Different armoured draisines were used during the Second World War, starting from the invasion of Poland carried out by Nazi Germany.|$|R
25|$|This force which {{conducted}} the pursuit {{was made up}} of Prince Fisal's Sherifial Force; one column of 1,500 commanded by Colonel Nuri Bey and a second column of 1,500 commanded by Sherif Nasir, the 2nd, 11th and 12th Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Batteries and the 1st (Australian), 2nd and 7th Light Car Patrols consisting of 24 armoured cars, and the 5th Cavalry Division's 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade which accompanied the armoured cars to Hamma on 21 October, while the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades followed in support.|$|E
25|$|At about 14:00 the Middlesex Yeomanry {{came up on}} {{the left}} and took up a line north of the Umm esh Shert track in the plain which was {{continued}} by the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment to the bank of the Jordan River. The line was covered by the Berkshire Battery and the 17th Machine Gun Squadron when they arrived. At 14:45 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment and the 11th Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>Motor</b> Battery , were withdrawn from the 60th (London) Division's infantry still fighting the Ottoman garrison at Shunet Nimrin, to reinforce Chaytor's force.|$|E
25|$|The 7th (Meerut) Division {{began their}} march to Beirut in three columns. The leading column {{consisted}} of the Corps Cavalry Regiment, one company of infantry and the 2nd Light <b>Armoured</b> <b>motor</b> Battery.

25|$|The attack {{started on}} the night of 30 August, taking {{advantage}} of a full moon. From the start, things went wrong for Rommel; the RAF spotted the Axis vehicle concentrations and unleashed several air attacks on them. Fairey Albacores of the Royal Navy dropped flares to illuminate targets for Vickers Wellington medium bombers and for the artillery; also, the minefields that were thought to be thin turned out to be deep. The British units covering the minefields were the two brigades of the 7th <b>Armoured</b> Division (7th <b>Motor</b> and 4th <b>Armoured),</b> whose orders were to inflict maximum casualties before retiring. This they did, and the Axis losses began to rise. They included General Walther Nehring, the Afrika Korps commander, wounded in an air raid, and General Georg von Bismarck, commander of the 21st Panzer Division, killed by a mine explosion.|$|R
