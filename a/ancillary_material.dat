5000|$|The basic {{ability to}} {{naturally}} develop Deryni powers is hereditary in nature, passing from parent to child and thus {{from generation to}} generation. Although several characters in the novels refer to Deryni-nonDeryni hybrids as [...] "half-breeds" [...] or [...] "half-Deryni," [...] the inherent nature of Deryni powers enables them to be passed to a child even if only one parent is Deryni. (Throughout the novels and <b>ancillary</b> <b>material,</b> nonDeryni humans are referred to simply as [...] "humans," [...] although it is unspecified whether this exclusionary terminology was originally positive or negative.) However, the natural strength of the Deryni bloodline tends to become weakened if succeeding generations continue to breed with full-blooded humans. The exact rate of this genetic [...] "dilution" [...] is not specified, and several half-Deryni characters (such as Alaric Morgan and Duncan McLain) display significant levels of arcane strength. An appendix {{to one of the}} early books speculates that the usual Deryni powers are carried on the X-chromosome (thus explaining why Morgan and Duncan, who have Deryni mothers, can have full powers), while the [...] "Haldane potential" [...] (also seen in several other families), is carried on the Y-chromosome. However, this is not borne out by later genealogies and seems to have been dropped as an explanation by Katherine Kurtz.|$|E
5000|$|The fourth, {{revised edition}} of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) diagnoses DID {{according}} to the diagnostic criteria found in section 300.14 (dissociative disorders). It has also been found difficult to diagnose the disorder in the first place, due to there not being a universal agreement {{of the definition of}} dissociation. The criteria require that an adult be recurrently controlled by two or more discrete identities or personality states, accompanied by memory lapses for important information that is not caused by alcohol, drugs or medications and other medical conditions such as complex partial seizures. While otherwise similar, the diagnostic criteria for children also specifies symptoms must not be confused with imaginative play. Diagnosis is normally performed by a clinically trained mental health professional such as a psychiatrist or psychologist through clinical evaluation, interviews with family and friends, and consideration of other <b>ancillary</b> <b>material.</b> Specially designed interviews (such as the SCID-D) and personality assessment tools may be used in the evaluation as well. [...] Since most of the symptoms depend on self-report and are not concrete and observable, there is a degree of subjectivity in making the diagnosis.
