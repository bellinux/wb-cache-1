40|$|International audienceThe final <b>slopes</b> of <b>a</b> French {{open pit}} mine of the "Charbonnage de France" Company which final depth will be 300 metres, have been {{designed}} after a Standard geotechnical survey. This one has taken into account the geomechanical, hydrogeological, structural parameters äs well äs the" decohesion", induced by former mining subsidence. However some slopes can locally present risks of slipping (increasing with {{the depth of the}} pit) induced by old Underground mining. A methodology has been defined concerning the slope auscultation and its behaviour including the use of numerous measuring tools (topographic measurement, inclinometer, equipped cable bolts [...] .). Two auscultation cases are presented, one on <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> <b>slipping,</b> another one on a potential slide. In the first case, the instrumentation checked that the reinforcement is satisfactory. In the second case, the instrumentation allows to analyse that the correct measures have been taken to prevent any risk...|$|R

40|$|Back-analysis of slope {{failure is}} often {{performed}} to improve one's knowledge on parameters of <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> stability analysis model. In <b>a</b> failed <b>slope,</b> the <b>slip</b> surface may pass through {{several layers of}} soil. Therefore, several sets of model parameters need to be back-analyzed. To back-analyze multiple sets of slope stability parameters simultaneously under uncertainty, the back-analysis can be implemented in a probabilistic way, in which uncertain parameters are modeled as random variables, and their distributions are improved based on the observed slope failure information. In this paper, two methods are presented for probabilistic back-analysis of <b>slope</b> failure. For <b>a</b> general <b>slope</b> stability model, its uncertain parameters can be back-analyzed with an optimization procedure that can be implemented in a spreadsheet. When the slope stability model is approximately linear, its parameters can be back-analyzed with sensitivity analysis instead. A feature of these two methods {{is that they are}} easy to apply. Two case studies are used to illustrate the proposed methods. The case studies show that the degrees of improvement achieved by the back-analysis are different for different parameters, and that the parameter contributing most to the uncertainty in factor of safety is updated most...|$|R

60|$|The bird I {{speak of}} is the Charadrius dominicanca, which breeds in Arctic America and migrates in August and September to {{the plains of}} La Plata and Patagonia, so that it travels about sixteen {{thousand}} miles every year. In appearance it is so like our golden plover, Charadrius pluvialis, as to be hardly distinguishable from it. The birds were quite tame: all our wild birds were if anything too tame, although not shockingly so as Alexander Selkirk found them on his island--the poet's, not the real Selkirk. The birds being so scattered, {{all he could do}} was to lie flat down and fire with the barrel of his fowling-piece level with the flock, and the result was that the shot cut through the loose flock to a distance of thirty or forty yards, dropping thirty-nine birds, which we put into the sack, and remounting our pony set off home at a fast gallop. We were riding barebacked, and as our pony's back had <b>a</b> forward <b>slope</b> we <b>slipped</b> further and further forward until we were almost on his neck, and I, sitting behind my brother, shouted for him to stop. But he had his gun in one hand and the sack in the other, and had lost the reins; the pony, however, appeared to have understood, as he came to a dead stop of his own accord on the edge of a rain-pool, into which we were pitched headlong. When I raised my head I saw the bag of birds at my side, and the gun lying under water at a little distance; about three yards further on my brother was just sitting up, with the water streaming from his long hair, and a look of astonishment on his face. But the pool was quite clean, with the soft grass for bottom, and we were not hurt.|$|R

40|$|AbstractProbabilistic slope {{stability}} analysis typically requires an optimisation technique {{to locate the}} most probable slip surface. However, for many slopes particularly those containing many different soil layers or benches several distinct critical slip surfaces may exist. Furthermore, in large <b>slopes</b> these critical <b>slip</b> surfaces may be located at significant distances from each other. In such circumstances, finding and rehabilitating the most probable failure surface is of little merit, as rehabilitating that surface does not improve {{the safety of the}} <b>slope</b> as <b>a</b> whole. Unfortunately, existing slip surface search techniques were developed to converge on one global minimum. Therefore, to implement such methods to evaluate the stability of <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> with multiple failure mechanisms requires the user to define probable slip locations prior to calculation. This requires extensive engineering experience and places undue responsibility on the engineer in question. This paper proposes the use of a locally informed particle swarm optimisation method which is able to simultaneously converge to multiple critical slip surfaces. This optimisation model when combined with a reliability analysis is able to define all areas of concern within <b>a</b> <b>slope.</b> <b>A</b> case study of <b>a</b> railway <b>slope</b> is presented which highlights the benefits of the model over single objective optimisation models. The approach is of particular benefit when evaluating the stability of large existing slopes with complicated stratigraphy as these slopes are likely to contain multiple viable slip surfaces...|$|R
50|$|In {{physical}} geology, {{aspect is}} the compass direction that <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> faces.

The term aspect can also be used to describe the shape or alignment of a coastline. Here, the aspect is the direction which the coastline is facing towards the sea.

40|$|Abstract: The Cambrian {{dolomite}} reservoir is {{an important}} target in oil and gas exploration. The Penglaiba section in the Keping area is typically examined in studies dealing with the Cambrian dolomite reservoirs of northwestern Tarim Basin. Based on sedimentological, petrographic, and geochemical data, lithofacies and fluids are identified as the major factors that control the dolomite reservoir {{in the study area}}. Lithoacies are fundamental to reservoir evolution because they provide suitable channels for dolomitization and dissolution of fluids that, in turn, facilitate the formation of high quality reservoirs. The lithofacies which could form high-quality reservoirs in the study area are: <b>slope</b> <b>slip</b> (collapse) facies, gypsum related facies, and algae dolomite facies. The sources of fluids include seawater, meteoric freshwater, diagenetic/hydrocarbon fluid, and hydrothermal fluid. These fluids lead to dolomitization, penecontemporaneous meteoric dissolution, hypergene dissolution, organic acid dissolution and hydrothermal dissolution that result in secondary porosity, and as such, they have a significant contribution to reservoir evolution...|$|R

Because the frame {{structure on}} <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> connects with the ground on different elevation level, it is evidently different from general frame structure in seismic design.
