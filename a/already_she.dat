25|$|In the 1990s, Hingis was {{sponsored}} by Sergio Tacchini. She sued the company in 2001, demanding $40 million for making allegedly defective shoes that injured her feet. In 1998 <b>already</b> <b>she</b> suffered a foot injury, and she withdrew from the Wimbledon doubles competition in 1999; Hingis alleged that a Tacchini-appointed specialist recommended her shoes be changed, a recommendation which was ignored by the company, which had fired her as spokeswoman in April 1999 due to an alleged breach of contract. She was then sponsored by Adidas from 1999 until 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, a widow, Peggy Appiah never {{considered}} leaving Ghana, telling anyone who asked {{her when she}} was [...] "going home," [...] that she was home <b>already.</b> <b>She</b> moved into a smaller house, which she built in a compound with a house for her daughter Abena, continued to work for her church, and went on studying Akan folklore. She visited her son and her daughters in the United States, Namibia and Nigeria, and was visited in turn by her children and sons-in-law, and her six grandsons, Kristian, Anthony and Kojo, children of Ama (Isobel) and Klaus Endresen; and Tomiwa, Lamide and Tobi, children of Adwoa and Olawale Edun. In the house next to her, with her daughter Abena, were her two grandchildren, Mimi and Mame Yaa.|$|E
2500|$|A {{chorus of}} local people on boats proclaims the {{upcoming}} wedding of Isoletta, daughter of Montolino, to Count Arturo of Ravenstal: (Men: Voga, voga, il vento tace........e l'alma pace / Messaggiera dell'amor / [...] "Row, row, {{the wind has}} dropped......this blessed peace is the message of love".) But, together on the shore, Isoletta tells Baron Valdeburgo that she fears her Arturo has changed his attitude toward her and believes that he has {{fallen in love with}} a mysterious woman living as a hermit in a hut by the lake: (Duet: Isoletta to Valdeburgo: Agli atti, al volto / non mortal, divina imago / [...] "From her gestures, her expression, she {{did not appear to be}} mortal, but rather a divine image". Valdeburgo, to himself: Giovin rosa, il vergin seno / schiudi appena al ciel sereno / [...] "A newly bloomed rose has scarce opened / her virgin breast to the serene sky, / and <b>already</b> <b>she</b> wilts in pallor".) In the distance a crowd is heard following [...] "La straniera" [...] who has been seen from the lake shore. [...] They curse her as a witch.|$|E
5000|$|Krystal Miller (Morino Kinoko) is {{the most}} self-centered. <b>She</b> <b>already</b> knows <b>she</b> {{is going to become}} a movie star and {{therefore}} gives signed autographs away.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She must,' said Tom. 'She must {{just hate}} and detest the whole set-out of us. They'll bother her head off, I think, {{before they have}} done with her. <b>Already</b> <b>she's</b> getting as pale as wax, and as heavy as - I am.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go then, {{make your}} {{bow to the}} Queen, {{and give her a}} tune. You know she's quite in love with your pipe--or yourself--and has been asking me about it <b>already.</b> <b>She's</b> in the {{verandah}} just now, and they are lighting the torches there." ...|$|R

60|$|But <b>already</b> <b>she</b> had {{interrupted}} {{him with a}} loud cry of overwhelming horror.|$|E
60|$|She seemed {{scarcely}} to {{have heard}} him. <b>Already</b> <b>she</b> was well on her way shoreward.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} could, but we decided not to. Matthew took a fancy to her. And I must say I like her myself--although I admit {{she has her}} faults. The house seems a {{different}} place <b>already.</b> <b>She's</b> a real bright little thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "White?" [...] exclaimed Sellers. [...] "It's gone like a flash; 'twasn't serious. <b>Already</b> <b>she's</b> {{as red as}} {{the soul}} of a watermelon! Sit down, dear, sit down--goodness knows you're welcome. Did you have a good time? We've had great times here--immense. Why didn't Miss Belle come? Mr. Tracy is not feeling well, and she'd have made him forget it." ...|$|R

60|$|But <b>already</b> <b>she</b> had {{recovered}} herself a little, and Lakatos Andor's somewhat dictatorial tone grated upon her sensitive ear.|$|E
60|$|But <b>already</b> <b>she</b> had {{interrupted}} him, speaking {{quietly in}} that even, contralto voice of hers which {{he loved to}} hear.|$|E

5000|$|She {{has been}} working here for two years <b>already</b> and <b>she</b> is happy. (The action is still in progress).|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head and looked at him. His teeth came {{together}} hastily. It {{seemed to him that}} <b>already</b> <b>she</b> was on her guard.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I must {{kiss you}} again too, Stephen!' If Lady de Lannoy hadn't loved the sweet little thing <b>already</b> <b>she</b> {{would have loved}} her for that! ...|$|E
60|$|Already a vital {{conflict}} had set in, which frightened them both. But he was alone, whilst <b>already</b> <b>she</b> {{had begun}} to cast round for external resource.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wants a moosical eddication," [...] {{finished}} up Crooked Jack, [...] "and, by jingo, she orter have it, for {{anything like the}} voice of her I never heerd. She sung for us that evening after supper and I thought 'twas an angel singing. It just went through me like a shaft o' light. The Spencer young ones are crazy over her <b>already.</b> <b>She's</b> got twenty pupils around here and in Grafton and Avonlea." ...|$|R
60|$|Sogrange {{suddenly}} {{opened the}} door of the car in which they were <b>already</b> seated. <b>She</b> leaned back and half closed her eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{called the}} waiter {{and asked for}} the bill for his dinner. Hers <b>she</b> had <b>already</b> paid. <b>She</b> rose to her feet.|$|R

60|$|As {{he moved}} away Una reveled in having refused his half-hearted invitation, but <b>already</b> <b>she</b> {{was aware that}} she would regret it. She was shaken with woman's {{fiercely}} possessive clinging to love.|$|E
60|$|And Dea Flavia smiled because <b>already</b> <b>she</b> guessed--or {{thought that}} she guessed--what would follow the tying of her shoe--a humble kiss upon her foot, the natural homage of a man to her beauty and to her power.|$|E
60|$|This was a {{point on}} which Florence was {{convinced}} <b>already</b> and <b>she</b> did {{not in the least}} object to his mentioning it.|$|R
6000|$|... "My pupil is his {{daughter}} Clementina. I dearly love her <b>already.</b> <b>She's</b> a delicate thing--dresses always in white; and the sweetest, simplest manners!

Now, smooth out that wrinkle between your brows, dear, and let's have a nice supper." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 7 August 1974, Castellanos died in Tel Aviv from {{an unfortunate}} {{electrical}} accident. Some {{have speculated that}} the accident was in fact suicide. Mexican writer Martha Cerda, for example, wrote to journalist Lucina Kathmann, [...] "I believe she committed suicide, though <b>she</b> <b>already</b> felt <b>she</b> was dead for some time.". There {{is no evidence to}} support such a claim, however.|$|R
60|$|She {{opened her}} lips, hesitated and closed them again. <b>Already</b> <b>she</b> had {{recognised}} {{the fact that}} this was not a man to be snubbed. Neither had she, notwithstanding her momentary irritation, any real desire to do so.|$|E
60|$|Was she close enough? <b>Already</b> <b>she</b> was, I won't say in {{the shadow}} of the land, but in the very {{blackness}} of it, already swallowed up as it were, gone too close to be recalled, gone from me altogether.|$|E
60|$|At first Lydie {{only saw}} Gaston {{as he turned}} to face the intruders. His face was flushed, and he muttered a quickly-suppressed oath. But <b>already</b> <b>she</b> had guessed, even before Lady Eglinton's strident voice had set her every nerve a-tingling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, {{put on my}} poncho," [...] {{said the}} youth, riding {{suddenly}} up to the girl's side and unceremoniously flinging his ample garment over the slight poncho <b>she</b> <b>already</b> wore. <b>She</b> drew it round her at once, and silently accepted the offering {{with a smile and}} an inclination of her small head which, even in these uncomfortable circumstances, were full of grace.|$|R
5000|$|Eva is Max's sister. <b>She</b> once <b>already</b> said <b>she</b> saw a Sno-Grr in Mount Roarsome. She {{was also}} {{mentioned}} by Gertie, but not discerned.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's an actress: it's her profession. Don't you {{remember}} her {{that day at}} Peter's in Paris? <b>She's</b> <b>already</b> a celebrity; <b>she</b> has great talent; she's engaged at a theatre here and is making a sensation. As I tell you, I saw her last night." ...|$|R
