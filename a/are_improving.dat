5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival <b>are</b> <b>improving.</b> Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E
5|$|Today {{there are}} dozens of sites with {{substantial}} temple remains, although many more once existed, and none of the major temples in Lower or Middle Egypt are well preserved. Those that are well preserved, such as Karnak, Luxor, and Abu Simbel, draw tourists from around the world and are therefore a key attraction for the Egyptian tourist industry, which is a major sector of the Egyptian economy. Three temple sites—Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis, Memphis and its Necropolis, and the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae—have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. The Egyptian government is working to balance the demands of tourism against the need to protect ancient monuments from the harmful effects of tourist activity. Archaeological work continues as well, as many temple remains still lie buried and many extant temples are not yet fully studied. Some damaged or destroyed structures, like the temples of Akhenaten, are even being reconstructed. These efforts <b>are</b> <b>improving</b> modern understanding of Egyptian temples, which in turn allow better understanding of ancient Egyptian society as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Silkworm {{breeding}} {{is aimed}} at the overall improvement of silkworm from a commercial point of view. The major objectives <b>are</b> <b>improving</b> fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage, shorter larval duration (shorter larval duration lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced {{are directly related to}} the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors including genetics.|$|E
25|$|Opponents to the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties {{feared that}} {{efficiency}} and maintenance would suffer following the U.S. {{withdrawal from the}} Panama Canal Zone; however, this has been proven {{not to be the}} case.

Canal Waters Time (CWT), the average time it takes a vessel to navigate the canal, including waiting time, is a key measure of efficiency; according to the ACP, since 2000, it has ranged between 20 and 30 hours. The accident rate has also not changed appreciably in the past decade, varying between 10 and 30 accidents each year from about 14,000 total annual transits.

The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. However, critics say that the separators are not mandatory in some states of the United States. The critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Recently it {{has been}} shown that the quality of protein contact {{prediction}} from evolutionary information can <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> significantly if direct and indirect information is separated.

However, since the first studies contact prediction methods have improved. Here, we ask how much the final models <b>are</b> <b>improved</b> if <b>improved</b> contact predictions <b>are</b> used. Results: In a small benchmark of 15 proteins, we show that the TM-scores of top-ranked models <b>are</b> <b>improved</b> by on average 33 % using PconsFold compared with the original version of EVfold. In a larger benchmark, we find that the quality <b>is</b> <b>improved</b> with 15 - 30 % when using PconsC in comparison with earlier contact prediction methods.
