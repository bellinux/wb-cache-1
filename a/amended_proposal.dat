Judge Miller ruled that the University's <b>amended</b> <b>proposal</b> {{satisfied}} environmental and seismic safety requirements. Judge Miller also ruled that her previous injunction against construction on the site would be lifted in seven days, on July 29, 2008, allowing the university to remove the trees and begin construction. Judge Miller ruled that the plaintiffs would have to pay 85% of the university's court costs, split evenly among the three parties, not including attorney fees.|$|E

Avro's submission in May 1960 was the Phase 6 Vulcan, which if built {{would have been the}} Vulcan B.3. The aircraft was fitted with an enlarged wing of [...] span with increased fuel capacity; additional fuel tanks in a dorsal spine; a new main undercarriage to carry an all-up-weight of and reheated Olympus 301s of [...] thrust.

500|$|A third {{programme}} {{of expansion}} was initially mooted in 2008. The {{aim of this}} programme was to expand the stadium into an all-embracing [...] "sports village", replete with an ice rink, indoor golf course, restaurants and shops. Gateshead Council invited tenders in August 2008 from commercial organisations interested in undertaking the development. A formal draft development brief was compiled and published in November 2009. A report to Council in December 2009 noted {{that there had been}} [...] "a reasonable level of interest at the preliminary stage" [...] from private investors, but that only one detailed proposal had been submitted, which had been declined by the Council on financial grounds. The report also noted concerns that the original centrepiece of the proposed village, the ice rink, may have been deterring investors and that a similar proposal to redevelop land at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland was detracting from what councillors had hoped to be a unique feature of the proposed village. The result was that a fresh proposal was raised to remove the ice rink from the brief in an attempt to [...] "stimulate the market". A public consultation was undertaken and in May 2010 the council reported that 327 of the 375 responses received were in favour of the <b>amended</b> <b>proposal.</b> As a result, notice was given to developers that the council intended to market the site and ten responses were received.|$|E
500|$|Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona {{proposed}} an amended bill that removed the commitment procedures in title I of the House bill {{and stated that}} [...] "Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the transfer to Alaska, pursuant to any agreement or otherwise, of any mentally ill person {{who is not a}} resident of Alaska." [...] In effect, this eliminated the bill's most controversial element—the provision for the transfer of mental patients from the lower 48 states to Alaska. The final recommendation of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs followed Goldwater's lead that the bill be amended to strike all the controversial [...] "detailed provisions for commitment, hospitalization, and care of the mentally ill of Alaska" [...] included in title I of the original House bill. [...] This <b>amended</b> <b>proposal</b> left only the transfer of responsibility for mental health care to the territory of Alaska and the establishment of land grants to support this care. The committee stressed that they were not invalidating the title I provisions of the original bill but that they had been misunderstood, a recurrent theme in supporters of the bill:However, the proposed provisions were misunderstood by many persons in parts of the country other than Alaska. Partly {{as a result of this}} misunderstanding, but more because the members of the committee are convinced that the people of Alaska are fully capable of drafting their own laws for a mental health program for Alaska, the committee concluded that authority should be vested in them in this field comparable to that of the States and other Territories.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, the Obama {{administration}} {{organized a}} Task Force {{to deal with}} the status issue, and Ferrer named Hernández Mayoral as the official representative of the PPD, while free association was defended by PROELA. During the public hearings for H.R. 2499, a group of lobbyists led by Ferrer managed to convince US Rep. Virginia Foxx to present a amendment that would include the territorial Commonwealth (described as [...] "status quo") in the project, essentially neutralizing its intention to pursue [...] "non territorial options". The subsequent approval of this <b>amended</b> <b>proposal</b> in the US House of Representatives was not supported by the soberanistas of the PPD. ALAS also criticized it as an [...] "attempt to prolong the anguish of the colony represented by the current Commonwealth". As the project moved to the Senate, the PPDCsoberanistas insisted on a Constituent Assembly, while ALAS endorsed it. On June 4, 2010, Miranda Marín died from complication of cancer, with conservative José Varela presenting an aborted candidature before the Municipal Committee, being revoked and later defeated by the former mayor's son in an ideological campaign.|$|E

50|$|His great work, however, was {{the share}} {{he took in}} the {{judicial}} reform during the ten years 1867 to 1877. The codification of the law during this period is attributable more to him than to any other single individual.

50|$|The {{plans were}} {{submitted}} to Brisbane for government appraisal. The government engineer, J B Henderson, thought them unsuitable.

On 26 May, the Boards of Waterford Foods plc and Waterford Co-operative Society met to consider <b>amended</b> <b>proposals</b> from Avonmore Foods plc and Avonmore Creameries Ltd. The merger proposals provoked serious debates at numerous shareholder meetings throughout Waterford and Avonmore. Some shareholders had strong reservations and among their concerns were issues such as perceived loss of identity, dominance by one party over another, relative valuations of the two organisations, size and scale of the new entity, representation and weakening of farmer control. However, {{the overwhelming majority of}} shareholders believed that the merger was the right option for both organisations.|$|R

5000|$|In November 2007, Paska faced {{a motion}} of no {{confidence}} in parliament. The opposition parties wanted Paška to be fired for his handling of a controversial law. The opposition took issue with Paska's interference in the amendment to the social insurance law, approved by the parliament in a chaotic vote with two contradictory <b>amending</b> <b>proposals.</b> The draft bill was supposed to be published on the internet within three days after the vote. Paška admitted that he ordered the legislative department to ignore parliament’s vote and publish a version that did not the original proposal. Katarína Kližanová Rýsová, spokesperson from the Smer-SD party called the motion to dismiss Paska [...] "ridiculous". On 27 November Paska survived the motion. Out of 111 MPs present in 150-member parliament, 59 supported the motion. The opposition would have needed 76 votes to succeed in its attempt to oust the Speaker of Parliament.|$|R
