5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} {{organized}} at Monte Ne under {{the sponsorship of}} the Benton County Baptist Association {{as a result of}} a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although it was not as active <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> was, the old filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.|$|E

5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not as intense <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E
5|$|Activision Publishing chief {{executive}} Mike Griffith, {{in response to}} questions about Activision's approach to the Guitar Hero market, noted that Guitar Hero continues to outsell the Rock Band series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model. Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce that number to 10 in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> was. Activision later opted to put future development of the series on hold in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from boxing, a decision forced on {{him by his}} ailing knee, Dyer focused on his theatre appearances. His voice though, was not <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> was, and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began to dry up. Dyer then refocussed on boxing, but this time as a manager. In the 1920s he moved to London, where he set himself up as a physical culture expert and ran a small stable of fighters. The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham. Kirby {{went on to become}} the British flyweight champion when he took the title from Jackie Brown in 1930. Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand, which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American Packey McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army. The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, Roosevelt's {{international}} role as {{spokesperson for}} women {{led her to}} stop publicly criticizing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), although she never supported it. In the early 1960s, she announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA {{was no longer a}} threat to women <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if they wanted it. In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, Esther Peterson proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission, with Peterson as director. This was Roosevelt's last public position. She died just before the commission issued its report. It concluded that female equality was best achieved by recognition of gender differences and needs, and not by an Equal Rights Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the River Rother {{no longer}} follows its ancient course, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> flowed across Romney Marsh {{and joined the}} sea at Dungeness. It is widely {{asserted}} that in 1287 a hurricane, known as the Great Storm, caused large quantities of shingle and mud to be deposited on the port of Romney and {{the mouth of the}} river. The water from the river created a new channel, joining the River Brede and the River Tillingham near Rye, where the combined rivers flow into the sea. However, Tatton-Brown has argued that patterns of occupation on Romney Marsh suggest that the change of route took place at least a century before that date. Rye became part of the Cinque Ports in the thirteenth century, and although it is situated some distance from the sea, its harbour is still visited by commercial shipping and has a fleet of fishing boats.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{inherent}} danger of its venom, B. schlegelii is frequently {{available in the}} exotic animal trade, and is well represented in zoos worldwide. It is frequently captive bred for color and pattern. Exporting from the wild is not as common <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> was, but is not unknown. In general they make hardy captives, readily feeding on provided mice.|$|E

Philippe Graton admitted that the draftsmanship isn't as rigorous <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> was.|$|E

Unfortunately for the station's influence, alternative rock became the decade's dominant genre and so CFNY did not sound as distinctive compared to other radio stations <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> had.|$|E

Nonetheless, Socialist Alternative, and National Labor Students (NLS) are still very active, with both the SRC and Union President typically coming from NLS. La Trobe student organisations (both SRC and Union) were largely run by NLS over previous years, in coalition with various independent groupings.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the rise}} of thin client {{computing}} using HTML as an intermediate format has reduced the need for ODBC. Many web development platforms contain direct links to target databases – MySQL being very common. In these scenarios, {{there is no direct}} client-side access nor multiple client software systems to support; everything goes through the programmer-supplied HTML application. The virtualization that ODBC offers is no longer a strong requirement, and development of ODBC is no longer as active <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> was.|$|E

25|$|President Hafez al-Assad, {{who came}} to power in 1970, relied on support from the {{business}} class in Damascus. This gave Damascus further advantage over Aleppo, and hence Damascus came to dominate the Syrian economy. The strict centralization of the Syrian state, the intentional direction of resources towards Damascus, and the hegemony Damascus enjoys over the Syrian economy made it increasingly hard for Aleppo to compete. Hence, Aleppo is no longer an economic or cultural capital of Syria <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> used to be.|$|E
25|$|This {{practice}} {{is not as}} widely held by Brethren <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>once</b> was. Many assemblies throughout the world have developed to leave questions of head coverings, levels of female participation and responsibility to {{the discretion of the}} individual. But there are still some Brethren assemblies that seek to be completely untouched by changing attitudes within society regarding the role of women. They view the abandonment of the traditionally practised doctrine of Headship as evidence of an overall apostasy (or moral deterioration) within Christendom and as leading to disorder and eventual anarchy within their fellowships.|$|E
25|$|Former U.S. presidents, such as James K. Polk, William H. Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt Harry S. Truman, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, gave {{campaign}} {{speeches in}} Taunton.
