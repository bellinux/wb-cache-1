When Sandé was 16 years of age, her parents took her to Alicia Keys Songs in A Minor Tour and she said she always wanted Keys to hear her music. She spoke on why she likes Keys so much; [...] "I'd read about her background and identified with her on so many levels. She was mixed race like me, a great student who'd been top of her class, who played piano and loved Nina Simone. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in the pop charts, yet with songs that had a message. I saw 16,000 people hanging on her every word and thought, [...] "I want this kind of attention. I want Alicia to know my music." [...] The pair met when Sandé had just came back from New York and just began a second songwriting stint, but this time involved with Keys. The pair sat at a piano and played for hours {{trying to come up with}} a good track. She said that she wanted the songs on her debut album to be fresh and she wanted to try and take it back how she wrote songs at the beginning of her career. Sandé had classical music training as a songwriter in her teens and learnt to play the piano at an early age, and getting across that she played, made and wrote her own music was very important to her. She said on the album, she wanted people to see every side of her as an artist, so it was important to have songs there where there could be a real connection with the lyric, rather than there just be throwaway pop music. Joni Mitchell and Lauryn Hill were also major influences for the album.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You must forgive her, {{for it was}} {{the little}} one's desire!

60|$|The {{sight of}} the {{turnovers}} made Jo sober again; and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother's face.

6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] {{answered}} Caleb carelessly.

60|$|Out {{went all}} {{the lights in the}} new palace, and {{everything}} was as silent as death and as black as ink.

60|$|Then, with a {{fleeting}} self-conscious motion, {{she wondered if}} she would be very much surprised, on rising in the morning, to realise that her hair had turned white.

50|$|Magdalena de la Cruz (1487-1560) was a Franciscan nun of Córdoba in Spain, who {{for many}} years was honored as a living saint.

60|$|A stormy scene {{took place}} {{between her and her}} mother, Julia boldly avowing that she was the author of the scheme which had had so fatal a termination.

50|$|It is Elsa and Andor that {{everyone}} is watching. He is tall and broad-shouldered with the supple limbs of a young stag, and the mad irresponsible movements of a young colt. The young couple dread the next day, which comes all too soon. They are at the station now, the last bell has sounded. For each lad only one girl, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{at the foot of}} the carriage steps, a corner of her ribbon, or handkerchief or cotton petticoat stuffed into her mouth to prevent herself from bursting into sobs.

[...] "Other sculptors, with a classical subject like mine, limit themselves to the ideal classical face, and never think of aiming at individual character. Now I do precisely the reverse of that. I get my handsome daughter, Maddalena, to sit for Minerva, and I make an exact likeness of her. I may lose in ideal beauty, but I gain in individual character. People may accuse me of disregarding established rules; but my answer is, that I make my own rules. My daughter looks like a Minerva, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> exactly as <b>she</b> looks." ...|$|R
