The results indicate that schooling and local language ability increase participation in local nonfarm <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> migration. Schooling also is found to increase nonfarm income at the household level but not farm income. We also find that farm household members from low-potential agricultural areas are more likely to participate in local nonfarm <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> migration than those from high-potential agricultural areas. Thus, the results suggest that local nonfarm <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> migration offer employment opportunities for workers from low-potential agricultural areas. Indeed, the nonfarm <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> migration is likely to provide an important pathway to reduce poverty in low-potential agricultural areas in East Africa.
