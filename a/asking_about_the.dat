25|$|The instant {{appeal of}} the Daleks caught the BBC off guard, and {{transformed}} Doctor Who from a Saturday tea-time children's educational programme to a must-watch national phenomenon.

25|$|By not <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> horses, Confucius {{demonstrates}} that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius, as an exemplar of human excellence, serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of humanism.|$|E

The group found that Board agents and other staff at 22 of 29 offices gave the wrong information.

What Welles did film was an 80-minute question-and-answer session in 1981 with film students <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film. The footage was kept by Welles's cinematographer Gary Graver, who donated it to the Munich Film Museum, which then pieced it together with Welles's trailer for the film, into an 83-minute film which is occasionally screened at film festivals.|$|E
25|$|Snape's {{memories}} then {{reveal that}} Dumbledore had impetuously {{tried to use}} the Gaunt ring which had been cursed by Voldemort, and had been suffering from a powerful curse. Snape's knowledge of the Dark Arts enabled him to slow {{the spread of the}} curse from Dumbledore's hand through his body, but he would have died within a year. Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, had asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> impact of such an action on his own soul, Dumbledore implied that this kind of coup de grâce would not damage a human's soul in the same way murder would. Snape agreed to do as the Headmaster requested. Snape's memories also provide Harry with the information he needs to ensure Voldemort's final defeat, in the form of conversations Snape had with Dumbledore.|$|E

500|$|Although {{nearly all}} users {{understand}} that the Slender Man is not real, they suspend that disbelief {{in order to become}} more engrossed when telling or listening to stories. This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend dialectic. This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, George Noory's Coast to Coast AM, a radio call-in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Slender Man. Two years later, an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune described his origins as [...] "difficult to pinpoint."

[...] Both Victor and Decca went into their vaults to find their masters of the record and began pressing them for southern United States sales. As disk jockeys in other parts of the US began obtaining copies of the record and playing it, the demand for [...] "Heartaches" [...] went from coast to coast.

[...] Others accused Sullivan of blatant copying. The Athenaeum wrote that the music [...] "was arranged and composed by Mr A. S.

One critic thought that the duet for Sparkeion and Nicemis, [...] "Here far away from all the world", was one of the [...] "single best items of the piece".

500|$|... "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{played a}} major role in the slow build of {{interest}} that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded with phone calls <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success One Fierce Beer Coaster was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick [...] "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point where I had to tell Madonna that I couldn’t put her on the phone with Jimmy Pop." [...] The band eventually signed a record deal with Geffen Records.|$|E
