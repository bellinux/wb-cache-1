5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the airway is patent so that the patient can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the <b>artificial</b> <b>airway.</b> Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E

Existing airway devices clearly failed to form this junction; the face-mask sealed against the face, and the endotracheal tube penetrated too far so that the junction was created within the trachea, instead of at its beginning. Dr Brain wrote in his diary in May 1981, [...] "Better, use a loop fitting into the anatomical loop of space surrounding the larynx, with a projection downwards into the oesophagus, which could be hollow, to drain regurgitant fluid." ...|$|E

50|$|While {{working at}} the Stanford University Sleep Disorders Clinic in 1972, Guilleminault became keenly {{interested}} in reports published by Italian sleep researcher Elio Lugaresi who had reported that nocturnal hypertension was present in patients who snored. Guilleminault persuaded cardiologists John Shroeder and Ara Tilkian to spend nights in the hospital's clinical research center monitoring the systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure in sleeping patients. The team observed that when patients fell asleep and began snoring, prolonged pauses in their breathing (apneas) were noted that corresponded with dramatic elevations in their resting blood pressure, simulating strenuous exercise as if the patient were lifting weights. Guilleminault {{then went on to}} publish several articles illustrating dramatic improvements and reversal of sleep apnea following tracheostomies. Tracheostomy proved curative in these patients, and demonstrated reversal of cardiac arrhythmias and blood pressure abnormalities during sleep; temporarily capping these <b>artificial</b> <b>airways</b> would re-capitulate the changes of sleep apnea, further establishing the causative relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular abnormalities.|$|R
30|$|In vitro and {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} performed to optimize aerosol lung deposition [2, 3]. Many factors related to the device, the <b>artificial</b> <b>airways</b> and the respiratory pattern inherent to invasive mechanical ventilation influence lung deposition [4]. Most of them should be controlled to deliver high doses of concentration-dependent drugs such as antibiotics. Vibrating-mesh nebulizers ensure currently the best drug output, ergonomy and practical use in the ICU [5, 6]. Applying a constant inspiratory flow pattern with a slow inspiratory flow rate improved aerosol delivery as compared to a decelerating inspiratory flow pattern with a higher peak inspiratory flow rate [7]. This mandates volume-controlled ventilation modality and a deep depression of the respiratory drive with sedatives [8]. Conversely, reducing sedation is promoted in ICU {{in order to preserve}} the diaphragmatic function through a spontaneous breathing activity and hence to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation [9, 10]. The decelerating inspiratory flow pattern and the spontaneous breathing activity of the patient (uncontrolled respiratory rate, inspiratory flow rate) related to the pressure support modality may affect aerosol delivery to the lungs. The comparison of pressure support ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation regarding aerosol administration has not been investigated.|$|R

30|$|Automatic tube {{compensation}} (ATC) compensates the imposed WOB due to <b>artificial</b> <b>airway.</b> ATC {{adjusts the}} pressure inside the endotracheal tube therefore {{we hypothesized that}} when ATC is added to PSV, this compensation becomes better.|$|E
40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>airways</b> {{bypass the}} {{physiological}} mechanism of humidification and filtration of the inspired air, increasing, therefore, {{the possibilities of}} copious secretions production. Copious secretions increase the danger for atelektasis and respiratory infections. Moreover, clots can be shaped {{in the interior of}} the endotracheal tube or thracheostomy, resulting in increased work of breathing (WOB) and reduced odds of successful extubation. It is also possible to lead progressively to complete obstruction of the endotracheal tube. Thus, the choice of a suitable humidification device during mechanical ventilation is of distinguished importance. There are various types of humidifiers. However, hydroscopic Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HMEs) with filter and Heated Humidifiers (HHs), which provide humidity in form of water vapors, are currently used. When they are used correctly, and not in the cases where they are contraindicated, HMEs’ do not have complications and they decrease the cost of hospitalization as well as the staff workload. HMEs are better choice for short duration of intubation (< 96 hours) and during transports. HHs are preferred for patients with persisting hypercapnia, chronic respiratory failure and difficulty in ventilator weaning. HHs should be used for patients with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation or patients that HMEs are contraindicated for. Neither HMEs nor HHs have been accused for increased incidences of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) ...|$|R

40|$|Mucociliary {{clearance}} (MCC) is {{an important}} defence system, giving protection for the body against inhaled pathogens {{with the potential to}} incite infection. During mechanical ventilation patients often receive therapy with the premise that a deficiency in MCC exists. To effectively administer therapy to individuals receiving mechanical ventilation it is necessary to determine if a deficit in MCC is present. Physiotherapy research into treatment of ventilated patients tends to be inconclusive in determining if physiotherapy decreases complications, length of ventilation time and stay in ICU. By determining the factors which may affect MCC physiotherapy research can be better targeted to those populations which are shown to have decreased MCC. A literature review was undertaken of Medline and PEDro databases using key terms of mucociliary clearance, <b>artificial</b> <b>airways,</b> ventilated and mucoregulating. The search was limited to articles published within the last twelve years: eighty-seven articles were found which met the search strategy. MCC was found to depend upon cilia beat frequency, mucous rheology and load, and the properties of the periciliary fluid layer. Important factors which affect MCC include medications, temperature, air pressure, osmolarity, age, humidity, pH, high oxygen concentrations, disease state and sleep. When researching the effectiveness of physiotherapy techniques on adult ventilated patients, researchers should document and/or stratify for the factors noted above. This is likely to demonstrate that physiotherapy does decrease ventilator time, pulmonary complication rates and length of stay in ICU...|$|R
