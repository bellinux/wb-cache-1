5|$|Production {{began on}} 3 August 1943. Many {{details about the}} performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of {{time in order to}} not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve {{suspense}} on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is gazing out the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé {{is dressed in a}} thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, {{lying on the}} floor of a gas chamber. Three men, dressed in black uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> room in which Rihanna sits at a table with her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, they take it turns holding to their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night standing in the middle of a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat. The video ends with her lover apparently committing suicide with the revolver placed between them.|$|E

25|$|Hundreds {{of snakes}} cover {{the walls and}} ground and a large audio-animatronic cobra (Frighto) appears {{to the right of}} the vehicle, {{striking}} at the riders. The transport heads back to return across the rope bridge and flashes its headlights at an oncoming transport about to cross. The transport turns sharply to the right, behind the giant stone carving of Mara's face, and crosses a wooden bridge under the rope bridge. The transport stalls near a hanging tree root, where many rats are seen climbing across it and falling off into the car before a burst of speed sends the car through the tree root, which vaporizes like mist. The transport careens through <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> tunnel with paintings of spear-wielding skeletal warriors adorning the walls. Blasts of air hit the riders and darts are heard striking the transport as it rolls over the trigger stones between the skeletal warriors.|$|E

25|$|Halfway to Sanity is {{the tenth}} studio album by American punk band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on September 15, 1987 by Sire Records and was produced by Daniel Rey. Recording sessions began in April 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, and the band began recording instruments before vocals as a method to learn songs more quickly. Band members tended to disagree on many things at this time, and Rey described them to be impatient. The album's front cover was shot by previous Ramones' photographer George DuBose in Chinatown, New York City. The short lasted session resulted in <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> album cover which guitarist Johnny Ramone said was good because it helped make them look younger. The band toured around the world following the album's release, but certain show dates were cancelled after drummer Richie Ramone left the band due to financial conflicts with the band. Clem Burke of Blondie was hired as Elvis Ramone to fill the drummer's spot for two shows, then was replaced the band's ex-member Marky Ramone, and the tour would continue with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the intense}} weather conditions, Kivilo {{believed}} that the overcast skies created a [...] "gray, somber, stark look." [...] Kivilo also chose not to use any lighting for daytime exterior scenes. For exterior scenes shot during sunnier filming days, computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used to re-create the overcast skies and counter any inconsistencies caused by the falling snow. In depicting the shootout in Lou's home, Kivilo's intent was to [...] "keep things quite sketchy in the lighting and not be clear about exactly what was happening." [...] The camera department lit a China ball from the ceiling to depict <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> kitchen light that would reveal Nancy holding a shotgun. Flash photography guns were used to depict the muzzle flashes during the shootouts.|$|E

Some scenes show the singer in a shadow and darker settings, while others are light and colourful. For most of the video, Lewis ponders {{about being able to}} escape her cage and experience freedom. At the end of the video, she realises that the cage is in fact unlocked and she is able to leave her confine, and leaves. Lucy Buckland for the Daily Mail felt that Lewis looks [...] "positively mournful" [...] in the video, and that while {{it may not be the}} best advert for feminism, she looks [...] "beautiful".|$|E

Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: [...] "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit,</b> all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression. At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.|$|E

500|$|Sednaoui {{experimented with}} a variety of {{cinematography}} techniques including wide-angle lenses, shots from below the subjects, superimposition, vertically cut screens displaying different angles of the same shot, reverse film effects, multiple lighting situations and flashy clothing to convey his concept. Frusciante noted the feeling of the video to be extremely vibrant and over the top: [...] "When it was us just painting ourselves silver and wearing these big silver boots and stuff, I mean it felt like glam rock or something." [...] The video begins with a wide-angle shot of Flea in a desert setting wearing pants with several gold colored horns protruding from each leg. The bassist is standing in a meditative stance and brings his arms together above his head when the music begins to play. The video then transitions between a variety of shots edited together that consist of the four band members standing with their eyes closed; the band dancing around in <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> setting; a ground view of Frusciante playing a reflective silver Fender Stratocaster in between his legs while wearing pants made up entirely of small pieces of mirror; the band members moving around with full makeup on; and the band members dancing frenziedly. Kiedis adopted a deliberately outlandish wardrobe which incorporated gold lipstick, thinly braided hair, revealing meshed shorts and bright silver boots.|$|E
500|$|Back in the tunnels, Doggett {{notices a}} green glow on Bianco in <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> former subway station. As such, {{he refuses to}} allow the {{lieutenant}} to leave. Bianco runs away, forcing Doggett to give chase. He learns from Scully that Karras has gone ahead of plan and allowed the passengers onto the platforms and the subway will start back up, despite the danger. After analyzing various water samples found at the scene, Scully meets with Dr. Kai Bowe, a marine biologist, who explains that the sample contains a unique microscopic sea creature called a medusa which are made out of calcium and are bioluminescent. However, Bowe does not know why the electrical reaction happens. When Doggett finds the wounded Bianco, he finds that his condition has gotten worse. Doggett then carries Bianco {{on his back and}} helps him continue through the tunnels. They soon encounter a boy with no signs of the luminous green substance on him. Scully realizes that sweat is causing the chemical electrical reaction since it is conductive to calcium ions. The boy does not have well developed sweat glands yet so the medusas are not affecting him. Doggett follows the boy to a major leak from the bay with the green glow on all the walls. Suddenly, an oncoming subway approaches the group—Karras has allowed the subway to resume schedule. Doggett uses Bianco’s gun as a electrical conductor between the third rail and the water, hence the electric current generated from friction between the subway wheels and the rail passes through Bianco’s gun into the water, killing [...] the medusas and preventing further exposure.|$|E

A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the Border strip zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has been listening to the conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop on her knees and lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through <b>a</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him.
