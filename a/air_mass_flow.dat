50|$|Propeller engines handle larger <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flows,</b> {{and give}} them smaller acceleration, than jet engines.

50|$|The {{combustion}} efficiency of most aircraft gas turbine engines {{at sea level}} takeoff conditionsis almost 100%. It decreases nonlinearly to 98% at altitude cruise conditions. Air-fuel ratio ranges from 50:1 to 130:1. For any type of combustion chamber there is a rich and weak limit to the air-fuel ratio, beyond which the flame is extinguished.

50|$|Engines {{that use}} a MAP sensor are {{typically}} fuel injected. The {{manifold absolute pressure}} sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine's <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{turbojet}} aircraft propulsion units to accelerate rapidly to high thrust operation when emergencies arise in slow speed flight has restricted {{their use in}} aircraft applications, and has also concentrated considerable attention upon their acceleration characteristics {{in an effort to}} produce better results. This thesis presents a method of computing the acceleration of a particular turbojet by making use of complete performance curves of the component parts of the turbojet. The method presented here does not permit computation of the acceleration for a particular operating condition as determined by those variables usually considered independent; namely, (1) Flight conditions of velocity, density, pressure, and temperature, (2) Engine rotor speed (3) Fuel rate of flow, and (4) Tail cone area ratio. Computation using these four independent variables was originally attempted in preparation of this thesis. However, extreme complication in the computations dictated that turbine inlet temperature and <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> rate of <b>flow,</b> which are normally dependent variables, should be considered independent. Fuel rate of flow and tail cone area ratio are therefore considered dependent. Therefore, in order to match a particular operating condition it is necessary to make a family of computations for various turbine inlet temperatures (constant for each set) over a range of assumed <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flows.</b> Computations have been performed for the Westinghouse X 19 B axial flow turbojet to illustrate application of the method and to show qualitative and quantitative effects of variation of tail area ratio, at two different turbine inlet temperatures. ...|$|R
