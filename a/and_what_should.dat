5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>should</b> be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} the series' setting became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. Starting with the second game, the series {{localization}} direction has been handled by Janet Hsu; One of the first decisions {{she had to make}} was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the idea}} that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>should</b> be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed.|$|E

Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E

25|$|Since 1972, {{however, the}} U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found {{primarily}} in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or collude to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant {{position in the}} market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, {{and in some cases}} they also face a cause of action in tort. A huge issue in the E.U. is whether to follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent anti-competitive conduct. In other words, the question is what should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of Courage Ltd v Crehan) <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>should</b> be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent to impose penalties. In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.|$|E

The series usually has a dark atmosphere, though production purposefully created a contrasting appearance for certain episodes.

The narrative follows series protagonist Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) who finds himself in an alternate reality after a confrontation with a djinn [...] The creature appears to have fulfilled Dean's greatest wish: {{that his mother had}} not been killed when he was a child. Dean is happy in the new world until it becomes apparent that his previous work as a hunter of supernatural creatures has been undone.

Kripke wanted Adrianne Palicki to reprise her role of Jessica MooreSam's deceased girlfriendbut she was busy filming for the Texas-based television series Friday Night Lights.

500|$|Problems during {{production}} sometimes arose. For his scenes as the yellow-eyed demon Azazel {{throughout the}} season, Fredric Lehne wore hard, colored contact lenses that greatly obscured his vision. The production crew placed sandbags {{on the floor}} to help him locate his marks. Lindsey McKeon, who portrayed a Reaper briefly possessed by Azazel in [...] "In My Time of Dying", also experienced the same problem. Her scene—she touches Ackles' forehead—took nine takes to film because she kept missing. Filming for [...] "What Is <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>Should</b> Never Be" [...] was interrupted in order to accommodate the busy Adrianne Palicki. Production shifted to the following episode after five days of filming, and resumed when Palicki became available for the final three days.|$|E
500|$|The season's {{cast and}} crew {{received}} the attention of multiple award programs.

With its mysterious atmospherics, [...] "Ramble On" [...] helped develop hard rock's association with fantasy themes, which had been partly derived from the psychedelic rock genre of {{two to three years}} before, but also from Plant's personal interest in the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien. This musical direction would later culminate on Led Zeppelin IV (and countless subsequent groups would later carry the influence to further extremes). Conversely, the instrumental [...] "Moby Dick" [...] features an extended drum solo by John Bonham, which would be extended further during Led Zeppelin concert performances sometimes for as long as half an hour.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist.

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "What Is <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>Should</b> Never Be" [...] was viewed by an estimated 3.11 million viewers, {{one of the}} lowest ratings for the season. Conversely, writer Raelle Tucker won the Constellation Award for [...] "Best Overall 2007 Science Fiction Film or Television Script" [...] for her work on the episode, and the episode garnered positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide [...] "adored" [...] the episode, and considered it to be Jensen Ackles' best performance of the series. She experienced an [...] "emotional roller coaster the entire hour", finding Dean's monologue at his father's grave to be [...] "crushing" [...] but the lawnmower scene to be [...] "hilarious". Likewise, Diana Steenbergen of IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.2 out of 10, praising the quick pace, [...] "heavy" [...] character development, and [...] "ton and a half of angst". She, too, felt that Ackles [...] "hits the ball out of the park", and noted that the episode's humor stemmed from Ackles' willingness to be a [...] "big goofball". Actresses Samantha Smith and Adrianne Palicki were [...] "a treat", although Steenbergen would have liked Jeffrey Dean Morgan to return.|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} {{returned from}} the first year. Actor Jim Beaver made multiple appearances as hunter Bobby Singer, an old family friend of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season guest appearance in [...] "Devil's Trap" [...] to be a [...] "one-shot deal", and was surprised {{when he was asked}} to return. Adrianne Palicki reprised her role as Sam's deceased girlfriend Jessica in the alternate-reality episode [...] "What Is <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>Should</b> Never Be", as did Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode, [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One". And though at first reluctant because of his role on Grey's Anatomy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan returned as John Winchester in the season premiere and finale. However, the character dies in the premiere because the writers worried that having him separated from his sons again—Sam and Dean spend much of the first season tracking him down—would [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing". As a demon, the villain Azazel periodically switches hosts, and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first-season finale. The reins passed to Fredric Lehne for the second-season premiere, and the show's producers enjoyed his performance so much they brought him back for the two-part finale.|$|E
