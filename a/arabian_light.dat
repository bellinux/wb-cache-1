Marked degradation of both n-alkanes and isoprenoïds (using 17 α 21 β C 30 hopane as “internal standard”) has been evidenced.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{efficiencies}} of 3 {{commonly used}} chemical dispersants in Saudi Arabia {{were tested in}} the laboratory.

40|$|A new gravel-contact assay using rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, embryos was {{developed}} to assess the toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other hydrophobic compounds. Environmentally realistic exposure conditions were mimicked with a direct exposure of eyed rainbow trout embryos incubated onto chemical-spiked gravels until hatching at 10 °C. Several endpoints were recorded including survival, hatching delay, hatching success, biometry, developmental abnormalities, and DNA damage (comet and micronucleus assays). This bioassay was firstly tested with two model PAHs, fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene. Then, the method was applied to compare the toxicity of three PAH complex mixtures characterized by different PAH compositions: a pyrolytic extract from a PAH-contaminated sediment (Seine estuary, France) and two petrogenic extracts from <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> and Erika oils, at two environmental concentrations, 3 and 10 μg g− 1 sum of PAHs. The degree and spectrum of toxicity were different according to the extract considered. Acute effects including embryo mortality and decreased hatching success were observed only for Erika oil extract. <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> and pyrolytic extracts induced mainly sublethal effects including reduced larvae size and hemorrhages. <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> and Erika extracts both induced repairable DNA damage as revealed by the comet assay versus the micronucleus assay.

To better understand the deleterious effects of these compounds, the toxicity of water-accommodated fractions (WAF) from two different oils (brut <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> and Erika heavy fuel oils) were used in this study. Zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) were exposed during 96 hours at three WAF concentrations (1, 10 and 100 % for <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> and 10, 50 and 100 % for Erika) in order to cover a wide range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations, representative of the levels found after environmental oil spills. Several endpoints were recorded at different levels of biological organization, including lethal endpoints, morphological abnormalities, photomotor behavioral responses, cardiac activity, DNA damage and exposure level measurements (EROD activity, cyp 1 a and PAH metabolites). Neither morphological nor behavioral or physiological alterations were observed after exposure to <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> fractions. In contrast, the Erika fractions led a high degree of toxicity in early life stages of zebrafish. Despite of defense mechanisms induced by oil, acute toxic effects have been recorded including mortality, delayed hatching, high rates of developmental abnormalities, disrupted locomotor activity and cardiac failures at the highest PAH concentrations (Σ TPAHs= 257029 ± 47231 ng.

40|$|Introduction: Clinical {{education}} {{is considered a}} significant part of the learning process for nursing students. There is, however, no research that has explored this area of learning in Saudi Arabia. Theoretical Framework: Informed by a symbolic interactionist framework, this research explored the role of nurse educators in student clinical education in Saudi Arabia. Method: Using Glaserian grounded theory methods the data were derived from 14 face-to-face interviews with nurse educators from both hospital and faculty settings in King Abdu-Aziz University (KAU) and King Abdu-Aziz University Hospital (KAUH). Findings: The findings of the research are represented in the core category Redefining Identity Work and its two constituent categories Questioning the Situation and Creating Role Identity. The core and sub- categories were generated through a theoretical exploration of the identity work of nurse educators in Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: The social identity of the nurse educators was mediated culturally and socially within the hospital and university contexts and Saudi <b>Arabian</b> culture. In <b>light</b> of an increased understanding of the identity and role of nurse educators in clinical education in Saudi Arabia, the research presents implications and recommendations that may contribute to the development of nursing education as a coherent health care profession that is perceived as a desirable career option for Saudi women and men...|$|R
40|$|This work revisits the enchanted and magical {{world of}} the classic <b>Arabian</b> Nights in <b>light</b> of current events in the Middle East, {{highlighting}} in particular some intriguing parallels between the time-wasting narratives deployed by the crafty Shahrazad to distract her King-consort from taking her life, and some other equally engaging ???narratives??? that circulate in Western culture, serving a rather more convoluted agenda. As research, 1001 Nights provides {{a significant contribution to}} the debate on ???liveness??? in mediatised performance: liveness cannot be understood either as an intrinsic property of media (e. g. Phelan, 1993), or as an historically-determined factor (e. g. Auslander, 1999). Instead, 1001 Nights shows that liveness is a relational concept: what matters is the particular structural relationship between media in a given artwork ??? the same content may be classed as ???live??? or not depending on how it functions semantically within the work, i. e. how it participates in the construction and communication of meaning. 1001 Nights includes video projections that simulate live computer interactions: the vocalist-actress is seen on stage operating a computer; the audience follows her actions relayed on a giant screen. The fact that such computer interactions are in reality pre-produced videos becomes totally irrelevant for assessing their ???live??? status. This is because that particular theatrical action, in that particular structural context, is in effect articulating facts related to the present moment: what the audience is watching is not merely a video ??? they are witnessing the specific theatrical action showing a character (vocalist-Shahrazad) who, at that very moment, is performing the action of operating a computer. This shows that context is crucial in determining the nature of media as either ???live,??? articulating the ???here and now,??? or as mechanical re-production of past events. It shows, further, how such relationships can be purposefully manipulated by an author to construct meaning...|$|R

The use of selective media containing sucrose (10 g. L- 1) and <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> oil (2 g.

The biosurfactant production was assayed by kerosene, gasoline and <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> Emulsification activity and the bacterial growth curve was determined by bacterial quantification. The parameters analyzed for biosurfactant production were the growth curve, salinity concentration, flask shape and oxygenation. All bacteria consortia screened were able to emulsify the petroleum derivatives tested. Biosurfactant production increased according to the incubation time; however the type of emulsification (non-aqueous phase or aqueous phase) did not change with time but with the compound tested.

40|$|In aquatic environments, {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) mostly occur as complex mixtures, for which risk assessment remains problematic. To better understand the effects of PAH mixture toxicity on fish early life stages, this study compared the developmental toxicity of three PAH complex mixtures. These mixtures were extracted from a PAH-contaminated sediment (Seine estuary, France) and two oils (<b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> and Erika). For each fraction, artificial sediment was spiked at three different environmental concentrations roughly equivalent to 0. 5, 4, and 10 μg total PAH g− 1 dw. Japanese medaka embryos were incubated on these PAH-spiked sediments throughout their development, right up until hatching. Several endpoints were recorded at different developmental stages, including acute endpoints, morphological abnormalities, larvae locomotion, and genotoxicity (comet and micronucleus assays). The three PAH fractions delayed hatching, induced developmental abnormalities, disrupted larvae swimming activity, and damaged DNA at environmental concentrations. Differences in toxicity levels, likely related to differences in PAH proportions, were highlighted between fractions. The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Light</b> and Erika petrogenic fractions, containing {{a high proportion of}} alkylated PAHs and low molecular weight PAHs, were more toxic to Japanese medaka early life stages than the pyrolytic fraction.
