40|$|Abstract—Ontology {{and related}} {{technologies}} {{have been introduced}} into the Ambient Intelligence domain {{as a mean to}} provide declarative formal representations of the domain knowledge. The range of devices available in the scope of an <b>Ambient</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>space</b> becomes increasingly heterogeneous {{and at the same time}} ubiquitous. Hence there is a need to link the discovery, description and deployment of these ambient devices and their services with context and domain knowledge representations in order to facilitate an <b>Ambient</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>space</b> experience. The contribution of this work is an approach for bridging the gap between the non-semantic description mechanisms of XML based devices description protocols, such as UPnP, and the AmI domain knowledge representation. For this we design a prototype ontology-based representation for UPnP devices and services that provide a semantic linking between human-centric abstract description, and the software-centric concrete description that derives from the UPnP descriptors and is necessary to remotely execute method calls on devices. We also demonstrate the benefits of its use with a prototype implementation. Keywords-ontology; semantics; ubiquitous computing; service description; device description; UPnP I...|$|E

Unlike traditional robot-like scenarios dedicated to industrial applications with repetitive tasks, the current focus of attention is on applications that require close human interactions. One of the main fields of such applications concerns assisting and rehabilitating of dependent/elderly persons. In this study, the state-of-the-art of the main research advances in lower-limbs human assistance is presented. This includes a review on research covering mainly lower-limb actuated exoskeletons. Some case studies related to full-limb exoskeletons are presented as well. Lower-limb movement restoration using functional electrical stimulation and treadmill-based rehabilitation devices is also investigated.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} a {{learning}} technique {{to provide an}} <b>Ambient</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (smart <b>space)</b> system with the capacity of predicting variation events in its own internal state is presented. The system and the interacting users are modeled through the instantaneous state vectors obtained as output of two trained Self Organizing Map-based classifiers. The information processed by the system are collected by two sensors sets monitoring several internal and external system variables. Starting from {{the hypothesis that the}} user actions have a direct influence on internal system state variables (e. g. work load on personal computers computation or storage devices in a University laboratory, in our current test implementation) we developed a statistical voting algorithm for inferring cause/effect relationships in these instantaneous variations. Logical connections are obtained in unsupervised mode with no a priori information and leads to the definition of a knowledge base the system can exploit to predict its own near future internal state variations, given the observation of the lab users. 1...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{many forms}} of art are {{influenced}} by the emergence of interactive technologies, including the mixing of physical media with digital technology for forming new hybrid works of art and the usage of mobile phones to create art projected on public spaces. Many artists and painters use digital technology to augment their work creatively and technically.

The research work described in this paper contributes towards supporting, through the use of <b>Ambient</b> <b>Intelligence</b> technologies, traditional painters’ creativity, as well as methods and techniques of art masters. The paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of an intelligent environment and its software infrastructure, to form a digitally augmented Art Workshop.

40|$|We {{live in an}} {{increasingly}} networked world. We conduct our daily activities moving through physical spaces, negotiating social and personal identities. At {{the same time we}} negotiate electronically mediated personalities, tasks and spaces. More often than not, these parallel worlds present insuperable conflicts that we are asked to resolve in ad-hoc ways. Moreover, we are confronted by challenges such as information overload, attention demanding machines and unusable interfaces while we move through information space. Physical space and our social behaviour in it, is eroded by new and emerging practices in our management of information. While traditional HCI research deals with measurable quantities such as usability, error return and task completion, and cryptography with encryption algorithms and standards in the construction of information worlds, interfaces for privacy in AmI (<b>Ambient</b> <b>Intelligence)</b> <b>space</b> cannot be resolved with these methodologies alone. Ethnography and cognitive psychology have recently been added to the disciplines directly involved in the design of computer-mediated worlds.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the metaphorical}} imaginative discourse created around the various inventions and technical breakthroughs {{in the field}} of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), focussing namely in the Internet. By examining such technologies in their physical and metaphorical components, the article explains how the former has been perceived, understood and even shaped by the images and representations of the latter. The paper, by emphasizing the intrinsic cognitive, prospective and creative characteristics of metaphors, aims at demonstrating how the powerful, imaginative and self-enforcing metaphorical terminology (composed by visions and imagined concepts such as "giant brains", "information highways", "metaverse", "cyberspace" and "ambient intelligence") has been not only accompanying but also driving the incessant pace of technology, contributing to its social acceptance and implementation. In this way, the metaphorical terminology enterprise keeps re-inventing itself, providing continuously additional terms and notions to express the new realities that the emerging technological machinery is fabricating. Within the historical and the future evolution of the Internet (as well as of its metaphorical counterpart cyberspace) proposed by this article, the latter introduces the next technological scenario in the pipe-line - the so-called <b>Ambient</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (AmI) <b>space</b> - and announces {{the emergence of a new}} "wave" of metaphors and images that are being created to capture the prospective realities promised by the novel generation of ICTs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to bring {{together}} the two newly elaborated concepts of Digital Territories (DT) and Design Construction Continuum (DCC) in order to approach the design of evolving - intelligent environments. Digital Territories is a concept elaborated 2005 by a Core Expert Group, conceived as an ephemeral  <b>Ambient</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (AmI) <b>space.</b> DTs formed through the interconnection of physical objects embedding digital technologies, postulate {{the integration of the}} physical and the digital world, searching for operative definitions of new evolving in time functionalities. In DTis, bridges between the physical and the digital are discrete elements disposing of certain autonomy in their conception and internal structure. Bridges have to be designed and located. The DCC proposes to relate design, fabrication and construction through information networks (it is in fact a DT). Through the DCC approach, design information is becoming construction information and industrial fabrication information. The DCC has to integrate interaction design and respond to questions posed by DTs design.   DTs are integrated to DCC by constituting an intermediate level between building programming and design. Intelligent  Building Components, that is AmI components operating as bridges between the physical and the digital in Digital Territories formations, cooperating to develop swarm intelligence applications to architectural space, are elements managed by the DCC. DTis are about spaces communicating and the DCC is about communicating (design) space...|$|R
