25|$|The wine's color {{when young}} is often {{compared}} to that of garnet, frequently being much lighter than that of other red wines. This is entirely natural and not a winemaking fault as Pinot noir has a lower skin anthocyanin (coloring matter) content than most other classical red / black varieties. Callistephin, the 3-O-glucoside of pelargonidin, an orange colored <b>anthocyanidin,</b> is also found in the berry skins of Pinot Noir grapes.|$|E
25|$|The {{anthocyanins}}, anthocyanidins {{with sugar}} group(s), are mostly 3-glucosides of the anthocyanidins. The anthocyanins are subdivided into the sugar-free <b>anthocyanidin</b> aglycones and the anthocyanin glycosides. As of 2003, more than 400 anthocyanins had been reported, while later literature in early 2006, puts the number {{at more than}} 550 different anthocyanins. The difference in chemical structure that occurs in response to changes in pH, {{is the reason why}} anthocyanins often are used as pH indicators, as they change from red in acids to blue in bases.|$|E
25|$|Other {{compounds}} {{found in}} passion flowers are coumarins (e.g. scopoletin and umbelliferone), maltol, phytosterols (e.g. lutenin) and cyanogenic glycosides (e.g. gynocardin) which render some species, i.e. P. adenopoda, somewhat poisonous. Many flavonoids and their glycosides {{have been found}} in Passiflora, including apigenin, benzoflavone, homoorientin, 7-isoorientin, isoshaftoside, isovitexin (or saponaretin), kaempferol, lucenin, luteolin, n-orientin, passiflorine (named after the genus), quercetin, rutin, saponarin, shaftoside, vicenin and vitexin. Maypop, blue passion flower (P. caerulea), and perhaps others contain the flavone chrysin. Also documented to occur at least in some Passiflora in quantity are the hydrocarbon nonacosane and the <b>anthocyanidin</b> pelargonidin-3-diglycoside.|$|E
5000|$|... 31 monomeric <b>anthocyanidins</b> {{have been}} {{properly}} identified, {{most of the}} anthocyanins are based on cyanidin (30%), delphinidin (22%), and pelargonidin (18%), respectively. Altogether 20% of the anthocyanins {{are based on the}} three common <b>anthocyanidins</b> (peonidin, malvidin, and petunidin) that are methylated. Around 3, 3, and 2% of the anthocyanins or <b>anthocyanidins</b> are labeled as 3-desoxyanthocyanidins, rare methylatedanthocyanidins, and 6-hydroxyanthocyanidins, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Anthocyanins are polyphenolic ring-based flavonoids, and are {{widespread}} in {{fruits and vegetables}} of red-blue color. Epidemiological investigations and animal experiments have indicated that anthocyanins may contribute to cancer chemoprevention. The studies on the mechanism have been done recently at molecular level. This review summarizes current molecular bases for <b>anthocyanidins</b> on several key steps involved in cancer chemoprevention: (i) inhibition of <b>anthocyanidins</b> in cell transformation through targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and activator protein 1 (AP- 1) factor; (ii) suppression of <b>anthocyanidins</b> in inflammation and carcinogenesis through targeting nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κ B) pathway and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX - 2) gene; (iii) apoptotic induction of cancer cells by <b>anthocyanidins</b> through reactive oxygen species (ROS) / c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) -mediated caspase activation. These data provide a first molecular view of <b>anthocyanidins</b> contributing to cancer chemoprevention. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Like most <b>anthocyanidins,</b> it is pH sensitive, {{and changes}} from red to blue as pH rises because <b>anthocyanidins</b> are highly {{conjugated}} chromophores. When the pH is changed, {{the extent of}} the conjugation (of the double bonds) is altered, which alters the wavelength of light energy absorbed by the molecule. (Natural <b>anthocyanidins</b> are most stable in a very low pH environment; at pH 8.0, most become colorless.) At pH 2.0, peonidin is cherry red; at 3.0 a strong yellowish pink; at 5.0 it is grape red-purple; and at 8.0 it becomes deep blue; unlike many <b>anthocyanidins,</b> however, it is stable at higher pH, and has been isolated as a blue colorant from the brilliant [...] "Heavenly Blue" [...] morning glory (Ipomoea tricolor Cav cv).|$|R

5000|$|<b>Anthocyanidins</b> {{are common}} plant pigments.
