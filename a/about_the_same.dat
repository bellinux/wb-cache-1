5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain.

This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

The control room was modernised in 1952, becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls.|$|E

Altgens and his wife Clara died in 1995 at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time in their Dallas home. Both had suffered from long illnesses, and police said poisoning by a malfunctioning furnace also {{may have contributed to}} their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Another {{charter of}} Theobald's from about 1152 shows the usual {{household}} staff that surrounded him.
