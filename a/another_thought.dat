25|$|The further {{development}} of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative.

25|$|Bohr was {{compelled}} to modify {{his understanding of the}} uncertainty principle after <b>another</b> <b>thought</b> experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see EPR paradox) published an analysis of widely separated entangled particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} period, Walker also {{suggested}} to the British parliament that the Queen should annually spend {{an equal amount}} of time in each of her realms. Lord Altrincham, who in 1957 criticised Queen Elizabeth II for having a court that encompassed mostly Britain and not the Commonwealth as a whole, was in favour of the idea, but it did not attract wide support. <b>Another</b> <b>thought</b> raised was that viceregal appointments should become trans-Commonwealth; the Governor-General of Australia would be someone from South Africa, the Governor-General of Ceylon would come from New Zealand, and so on. The prime ministers of Canada and Australia, John Diefenbaker and Robert Menzies, respectively, were sympathetic to the concept, but, again, it was never put into practice.|$|E

500|$|Several writers at Famitsu {{praised the}} demon fusion mechanic, {{with one of}} them calling it the best aspect of the game. Kalata and Snelgrove noted that the series was unusally simplistic for the Megami Tensei series, but still found its {{gameplay}} to have more depth than Pokémon, and that it was able to challenge the player. On the other hand, GameSpot's Frank Provo said that it was not [...] "nearly as fun or diverse", in his review of Light Version and Dark Version. Reviewing White Book, one writer at Famitsu said that the tempo of the game was good, allowing for a stress-free experience playing the game, while <b>another</b> <b>thought</b> that the enemies were too strong at the beginning, forcing the player to repeatedly fuse their demons to make any progress at all.|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals were {{a source}} of {{disagreement}} between some critics. Extended Play's Matthew Keil wrote that the game's visuals are the [...] "most notable improvement" [...] over Rogue Squadron. Mirabella agreed {{and went on to}} call Battle for Naboo [...] "one of the prettiest games to grace the N64." [...] Both Keil and Mirabella praised the game for being less dependent on distance fog and [...] "vastly" [...] improving the draw distance over Rogue Squadron. Davis, however, wrote that [...] "the graphics in Battle for Naboo are exactly the same as those of Rogue Squadron, flaws and all", and Nintendo Powers Andy Meyers cited [...] "drab backgrounds and dry cinemas". EGM enjoyed the game's models and lighting, but thought the environments looked [...] "blurry". Reviewers' opinions on the game's music and sound effects were generally less divided. Keil stated that the game showcases Factor 5's audio talents, and Mirabella and Davis described the audio as [...] "atmospheric" [...] and [...] "immersive", respectively. [...] One EGM reviewer lamented [...] "the low-quality cartridge EpisodeI music", but <b>another</b> <b>thought</b> the sound was impressive.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've been in that place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's shit and trying to love yourself at the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly." [...] When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, [...] "I was so happy when I could let it go. I didn't give it <b>another</b> <b>thought</b> when it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing of}} the pilot was criticized as [...] "ponderous", and having [...] "familiar, {{conventional}} plots". One critic claimed it did not offer much [...] "to inspire an actor", while <b>another</b> <b>thought</b> it had the [...] "worst {{writing of the}} new season". The dialogue was described as [...] "groan-inducing". Tom Shales of The Washington Post criticized the series creators' decision to make St. John a private investigator, and felt that they [...] "appear eager to avoid what makes their show unique". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times saw promise in the series, but remarked it got [...] "lost between concept and execution, and instead of suspense we get silliness, as if the creators were determined to use only the clichés of both genres". The acting of the pilot was criticized as [...] "sub-par" [...] and [...] "woeful". Robert Bianco of USA Today felt that Moonlight had a [...] "less adept cast" [...] than Angel. Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe depreciated the chemistry between O'Loughlin and Myles as [...] "artificial", {{and said that they}} [...] "exchange lines of dialogue with a stilted rhythm and no natural flow". O'Loughlin was described as a [...] "flatliner", and [...] "passable in the lead role", while Sossamon's appearance was said to be [...] "preposterously not-scary". Travis Fickett of IGN praised the actors, however, and felt that O'Loughlin did [...] "a decent job", and that Myles was [...] "perhaps the most promising aspect of the show". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune commended Myles as [...] "reasonably good".|$|E
