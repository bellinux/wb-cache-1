5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> to recover the original information. Without access to <b>a</b> <b>template,</b> cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Her first book, The Epigenetics Revolution, {{describes}} how epigenetic modifications allow the same DNA to express different characteristics; she likens DNA to a script for a play rather than <b>a</b> <b>template.</b> The same script can produce different productions of the play.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence to be used as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as <b>a</b> <b>template.</b> DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E

5|$|Allocators are {{required}} to supply <b>a</b> <b>template</b> class member template [CODE] which enables the possibility of obtaining a related allocator, parameterized {{in terms of a}} different type. For example, given an allocator type IntAllocator for objects of type int, a related allocator type for objects of type long could be obtained using IntAllocator::rebind::other.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} first involves transcription, {{in which}} DNA {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>template</b> to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is RNA {{that has}} a coding region that acts as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> for protein {{synthesis}} (translation). The rest of the mRNA, the untranslated regions, tune how active the mRNA is. There are also many RNAs that are not translated, called non-coding RNAs. Like the untranslated regions, many of these non-coding RNAs have regulatory roles.|$|E

5|$|The biopolymers that {{comprise}} DNA, RNA and (poly)peptides are linear polymers (i.e.: each monomer {{is connected to}} at most two other monomers). The sequence of their monomers effectively encodes information. The transfers of information described by the central dogma ideally are faithful, deterministic transfers, wherein one biopolymer's sequence is used as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> {{for the construction of}} another biopolymer with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{question is}} {{which of the}} areas developed first and created <b>a</b> <b>template</b> for subsequent development. Haas rejects suggestions that maritime development at sites immediately adjacent to the coast was initial, pointing to contemporaneous development based on his dating. Moseley remains convinced that coastal Aspero is the oldest site, and that its maritime subsistence served {{as a basis for}} the civilization.|$|E
5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E

5|$|Two {{books were}} {{released}} {{related to the}} original series: Mr. Bean's Diary in 1992 and Mr. Bean's Pocket Diary in 1994. The two books have identical content and differ only in the format {{in which they are}} printed. The content of both is <b>a</b> <b>template</b> diary with handwritten content scrawled in by Mr. Bean. They provide some additional information on the setting: for example, they establish that Mr. Bean lives in Highbury and rents his flat from a landlady named Mrs. Wicket.|$|E
5|$|When {{only one}} of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other strand can be used as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> to guide the {{correction}} of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA strand.|$|E

The song was recorded in a caravan {{in the middle of}} mayhem. Wilson and Watkins doggedly worked on it with whichever of the group's members were available from the filming set at any given point. A considerable amount of production work was required afterward before the track reached its final form.|$|E

5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics came {{as the result of a}} series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eug√®ne Scribe. Scribe wanted to create <b>a</b> <b>template</b> for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template {{in the field of}} literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides <b>a</b> <b>template</b> by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en sc√®ne, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|Paid in Full is {{credited}} as a benchmark album of golden age hip hop. Rakim's rapping, which pioneered {{the use of}} internal rhymes in hip hop, set {{a higher standard of}} lyricism in the genre and served as <b>a</b> <b>template</b> for future rappers. The album's heavy sampling by Eric B. became influential in hip hop production. The record has sold over a million copies and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it platinum in 1995. In 2003, the album was ranked number 228 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.|$|E
