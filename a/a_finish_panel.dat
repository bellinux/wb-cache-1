50|$|Mosaic {{was a minor}} art, {{though often}} on a very large scale, {{until the very end}} of the period, when late-4th-century Christians began to use it for large {{religious}} images on walls in their new large churches; in earlier Roman art mosaic was mainly used for floors, curved ceilings, and inside and outside walls that were going to get wet. The famous copy of a Hellenistic painting in the Alexander Mosaic in Naples was originally placed in a floor in Pompeii; this is much higher quality work than most Roman mosaic, though very fine panels, often of still life subjects in small or micromosaic tesserae have also survived. The Romans distinguished between normal opus tessellatum with tesserae mostly over 4 mm across, which was laid down on site, and finer opus vermiculatum for small panels, which is thought to have been produced offsite in a workshop, and brought to the site as <b>a</b> <b>finished</b> <b>panel.</b> The latter was a Hellenistic genre which is found in Italy between about 100 BC and 100 AD. Most signed mosaics have Greek names, suggesting the artists remained mostly Greek, though probably often slaves trained up in workshops. The late 2nd century BC Nile mosaic of Palestrina is a very large example of the popular genre of Nilotic landscape, while the 4th century Gladiator Mosaic in Rome shows several large figures in combat.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} making raised panel doors begins with gluing up panels, and then moves into cutting and {{preparing}} the frame parts. Next, the panels are cut to size and shaped. Parts and panel are sanded before construction. It is also common to apply <b>a</b> <b>finish</b> to <b>panels</b> prior to assembly so that raw wood is not visible if the panel shrinks. The joints are glued and set into clamps. If the frame and panel items are paint grade they are sometimes nailed at the frame joints on the reverse side. The door then moves on to finish sanding where it is brought to its final thickness, and the outside profile is added if required.|$|R

These came in different confiurations over time: in one version the speakers were side by side with a flip-out control panel that became flush with the back of the cabinet when not in use; a vertical speaker configuration with a flip out panel; and a vertical configuration with <b>a</b> wood <b>finish</b> slanted <b>panel</b> like the guitar amps. The final models were simply labeled [...] "Bass" [...] without a number. The last run was apparently solid state instead of tube driven.|$|R

5|$|The Doni Tondo or Doni Madonna, {{sometimes}} called The Holy Family, {{is the only}} <b>finished</b> <b>panel</b> painting by the mature Michelangelo to survive. Now in the Uffizi in Florence, Italy, and still in its original frame, the painting was probably commissioned by Agnolo Doni to commemorate his marriage to Maddalena Strozzi, {{the daughter of a}} powerful Tuscan family.

5000|$|The British Empire Panels were {{commissioned}} in 1924 {{as a means}} of commemorating the First World War. Brangwyn, who had worked as an official war artist, was selected by the sponsor, Lord Iveagh, an Irish peer. He chose to create a [...] "decorative painting representing various Dominions and parts of the British Empire", and five <b>finished</b> <b>panels</b> were displayed in 1930. The work was completed in 1932, but the House of Lords had already rejected it as too colourful and spirited.|$|R
50|$|The Coronet {{and similar}} Plymouth Belvedere {{received}} complete redesigns in 1968, {{as did the}} Dodge Charger, which shared the B-body platform. There was a mild facelift in 1970. Trim levels initially included the base Coronet, Coronet Deluxe, Coronet 440, Coronet 500 and Coronet R/T. The Coronet Super Bee was introduced in early 1968 as a companion to the Plymouth Road Runner. In keeping with Dodge's position as a step above Plymouth, the Super Bee shared the Charger's Rallye instrument cluster and the Coronet 440's rear <b>finish</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of preserved mummy portraits were painted on boards or panels, made from different imported hardwoods, including oak, lime, sycamore, cedar, cypress, fig, and citrus. The wood was {{cut into thin}} rectangular panels and made smooth. The <b>finished</b> <b>panels</b> were set into layers of wrapping that enclosed the body and were surrounded by bands of cloth, giving {{the effect of a}} window-like opening through which the face of the deceased could be seen. Portraits were sometimes painted directly onto the canvas or rags of the mummy wrapping (cartonnage painting).|$|R
50|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen the rise of {{independent}} builders making printed circuit boards, kits, and <b>finished</b> <b>panels</b> available to the musician at prices that reflect the original spirit that Serge Tcherepnin brought to the field back in the 1970s. These builders are sending royalties back to Tcherepnin for each module or panel sold. Ken Stone {{was the first to}} open these floodgates and makes many of the PC boards available for purchase. Sometimes the circuitry has been redesigned to reflect available parts as well as optimizing circuit layout. He also makes his own compatible designs available as well as the designs of others.|$|R

50|$|But 3-D comics had {{challenges}} {{all their}} own. A 3-D {{view of a}} flat drawing would still look flat. For the view to look otherwise, the drawing had itself to be a 3-D object. This required more labor than 2-D comics did. A 2-D panel had only to be penciled and inked. A 3-D panel had to have its elements separated according to which visual plane or level (fore-, middle- or background) the elements were intended to occupy. The elements had to be drawn on clear acetate cels corresponding to those levels, with the solid parts of the elements opaqued. Then the cels had to be stacked and aligned to assemble the <b>finished</b> <b>panel,</b> with enough separation between the cels to produce the desired 3-D effect.|$|R

A new grille featured dual side-by-side headlights, {{a change in the}} rear trunk <b>finish</b> <b>panel</b> and taillights included multiple horizontal ribs. New horizontal aluminum trim at the lower body crease with lower silver paint gave all 1967 Satellites essentially a two-tone paint scheme. For 1966 and 1967, the interior vinyl seats and door panels were treated to a unique 'Western Scroll' design which mimicked tooled leather in appearance. This was the 'premium' interior shared with the GTX in 1967. For 1966 and 1967 the Satellite was again offered only in 2-door hardtop and convertible models and was powered by V8 engines.

5000|$|Branded the Lifeguard, Wayne's new conventional-style {{school bus}} design used the company's {{roll-forming}} presses to make single steel stampings that extended {{the entire length}} of the bus body. The concept was that by reducing the number of joints, the number of places where the body could be anticipated to separate in a catastrophic impact was reduced in a like amount. The [...] "Lifeguard" [...] design reduced overall body weight, the number of fasteners used, and man-hours required for assembly. However, the roll-form presses were very large, requiring special equipment to handle the <b>finished</b> <b>panels.</b> <b>A</b> more practical problem was the panels had to be cut to exact length for each bus body order, which varied with seating capacities and from state-to-state specifications. This created a marketing disadvantage as the Wayne factory required greater manufacturing lead time than in the past whereas the previous technology allowed for more interchangeability and customization in orders.|$|R
