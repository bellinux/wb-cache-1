25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> and contains an Otis passenger elevator and freight elevator. The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the freight elevator measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In {{the back of the house}} is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located on the right side of the hallway and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near the end of the hall are service rooms, service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a breakfast room. A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At the end of the hall are two parlors and a large drawing room. The second floor contains three bedrooms, two baths, and a service area. One of the bedrooms, the master suite, contains a separate staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The third floor contains bedroom suites and a playroom in the southeast corner. The fourth floor contains additional bedrooms and servants' quarters.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{smelting}} {{and refining}} of iron, coal {{and to a}} lesser degree coke produced inferior iron than charcoal because the impurities in coal, at least until solutions to contamination were developed. Use of coal in smelting started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir Clement Clerke and others from 1678, using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture, reducing the oxide to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an <b>air</b> <b>furnace.</b> (The foundry cupola is a different (and later) innovation.) ...|$|E

50|$|The company's main {{business}} was producing cast-iron goods. Molten iron for this foundry work {{was not only}} produced from the blast furnaces, but also by remelting pig iron in <b>air</b> <b>furnaces,</b> {{a variant of the}} reverberatory furnace.

40|$|Effects {{of rapid}} heat {{transfer}} using a fluidized bed on the heat-treating response of Al-Si-Mg alloys (both unmodified and Sr modified) were investigated. The heating {{rate in the}} fluidized bed is greater than in conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnaces.</b> Particle size analyses of eutectic Si showed that the high heating rate during fluidized bed solution heat treatment causes faster fragmentation and spherodization of Si particles compared to conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnaces.</b> The mechanism of Si fragmentation through fluidized bed processing is through both brittle fracture and neck formation and its propagation. In contrast to this, the mechanism of Si fragmentation using a conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace</b> is through neck formation and propagation. The Sr-modified D 357 alloy showed a faster spherodizing rate than the unmodified alloy. Thermal analyses showed an exothermic reaction during solution heat treatment using a fluidized bed due to recrystallization, and coarsening of eutectic Al grains. Whereas the alloy solutionized using a conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace</b> showed two exothermic reactions, one due to annihilation of point defects and the other due to recrystallization, and coarsening of the eutectic grains in the aluminum matrix. The recrystallization temperature of the alloy solutionized in the fluidized bed is lower {{than those in the}} conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace.</b> Both tensile strength and elongation of fluidized bed solutionized alloys are greater than those solutionized using the <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace.</b> The optimum heat-treatment time for T 4 temper using a fluidized bed for unmodified and Sr-modified alloy was reduced to 60 and 30 minutes, respectively...|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} architecture was traditional “Main Line Gothic” in style, but {{the interior}} of the mansion was considered very modern for its time, with several hot <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> and hot running water. Gibson was an art collector and board member of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts for two decades and his mansion was accordingly adorned with fine art, antiques, rugs, and furniture collected from his travels all over the world.|$|R
50|$|The Ducane Products Company {{started out}} as the Ducane Brothers Metal Fabricating in 1946. It moved three years later to Little Ferry, New Jersey, where they {{manufactured}} warm <b>air</b> <b>furnaces.</b> In 1968, the name was changed to The Ducane Company and moved the base of operations to Barnwell, SC. And in 1975, they started making Ducane Gas Grills. However, Ducane filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and was partially acquired by Weber-Stephens at a bankruptcy sale in 2004 for $13.6 million.|$|R
50|$|Functioning in {{a similar}} manner as a {{conventional}} forced <b>air</b> <b>furnace,</b> systems provide heat by recirculating conditioned building air through solar collectors. Through the use of an energy collecting surface to absorb the sun’s thermal energy, and ducting air to come in contact with it, a simple and effective collector can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications.|$|E
50|$|William Strutt {{designed}} a new mill building in Derby {{with a central}} hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> in 1793, although the idea had been already proposed by John Evelyn almost a hundred years earlier. Strutt's design consisted of a large stove that heated air brought from the outside by a large underground passage. The air was ventilated through the building by large central ducts.|$|E
50|$|In the 1690s, they (or associates) {{applied the}} reverberatory furnace (in this case {{known as an}} <b>air</b> <b>furnace)</b> to melting pig iron for foundry purposes. This was used at Coalbrookdale and various other places, but became {{obsolete}} {{at the end of}} the 18th century with the introduction of the foundry cupola, which was a kind of small blast furnace, and a quite different species from the reverberatory furnace.|$|E
50|$|Liquid-to-air {{heat pumps}} (also called water-to-air) output forced air, and are most {{commonly}} used to replace legacy forced <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> and central <b>air</b> conditioning systems. There are variations that allow for split systems, high-velocity systems, and ductless systems. Heat pumps cannot achieve as high a fluid temperature as a conventional furnace, so they require a higher volume flow rate of air to compensate. When retrofitting a residence, the existing duct work {{may have to be}} enlarged to reduce the noise from the higher air flow.|$|R
50|$|Reverberatory {{furnaces}} (in this context, {{usually called}} <b>air</b> <b>furnaces)</b> were formerly {{also used for}} melting brass, bronze, and pig iron for foundry work. They were also, for the first 75 years of the 20th century, the dominant smelting furnace used in copper production, treating either roasted calcine or raw copper sulfide concentrate. While they have been supplanted in this role, first by flash furnaces and more recently also by the Ausmelt and ISASMELT furnaces, as they are very effective at producing slags with low copper losses.|$|R
5000|$|William Brownrigg and Anthony Bacon (a London {{merchant}} born in Whitehaven) leased {{the mines}} in 4000 acre at Merthyr Tydfil. Wood {{was brought in}} to build a forge for them there and he reached Merthyr in April 1766. The forge had six races leading off the river Taff, for a clay mill, two stampers, two hammers, and a chafery. [...] In addition there were <b>air</b> <b>furnaces,</b> in which the iron was heated during the refining process. A drying shed for the pots and other buildings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second step}} in the {{quenching}} process is soaking. Workpieces can be soaked in air (<b>air</b> <b>furnace),</b> a liquid bath, or a vacuum. The recommended time allocation in salt or lead baths is up to 6 minutes. Soaking times can range a little higher within a vacuum. As in the heating step, {{it is important that}} the temperature throughout the sample remains as uniform as possible during soaking.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1720s, Eyre became {{involved}} in the ironmaking project of William Wood, whose son had obtained a patent for a method of making iron in an <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> using mineral coal in 1727. This was followed by another to Wood himself in 1728 for something similar, but the enterprise collapsed because Wood was unable to perform what he promised. [...] How deeply Eyre was involved is not clear, but in 1736, he took out a similar patent in his own name.|$|E
5000|$|What {{was known}} as the [...] "gentleman's {{boarding}} hall," [...] or [...] "Academy Hall," [...] to Delhi residents consisted of a kitchen, dining room, and laundry on the first floor. The second floor or the main floor housed the principal's family, administrative offices, and a reception parlor, with a Chickering piano. The third floor was where the scholars resided. These boys were divided up into two dormitory rooms. The building was heated by a hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> and had primitive plumbing, and only two or three bathtubs.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> (such as reverberatory furnaces) are {{naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|R
40|$|In general, gallium {{cells can}} be {{realised}} in any water thermostatic bath, however, some manufactures have developed <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> or heat-cooling ovens (with peltier cells and heating resistors) to avoid mechanic vibrations, electromagnetic interference, {{and to allow}} for easier and dedicated operation mode. Generally, all of these devices are dedicated and they are used with only one cell. As we want to compare two different gallium cells, we have developed a water thermostatic bath, which allows realising simultaneously two or more gallium melting points, with cells up to 50 cm long...|$|R

50|$|Part of {{the reason}} for lax {{enforcement}} {{may be due to the}} involvement of Colonial Officials in iron works. Virginia Governors Gooch and Spotswood were both deeply involved in iron manufacture. Gooch was a part owner of the Fredericksville Ironworks. Spotswood owned Tubal Ironworks (a blast furnace and probably finery forge) and the double <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> at Massaponnax. Other prominent members of the Virginia aristocracy and House of Burgesses involved in the iron industry included John Tayloe (Bristol Ironworks, near Fredericksburg; Neabsco Ironworks; and Occoquan Ironworks), Augustine Washington, George's father (Accoceek/Potomac Ironworks), and Benjamin Grimes (Grimes Recovery and a bloomery near Fredericksburg).|$|E
50|$|Sir Clement {{apparently}} guided many {{of these}} developments; though he probably did not personally benefit from them financially, his sons probably did. Sir Clement is certainly to be credited with the practical application of the reverberatory furnace (or cupola) to several metallurgical processes. Until the introduction in the late 18th century of the foundry cupola (which {{is a sort of}} small blast furnace), his <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> was the normal way of remelting pig for foundry purposes. The cupola (reverberatory furnace) long remained in use for smelted copper and lead, and was applied by Robert Lyddall to tin.|$|E
50|$|A heating {{ventilation}} and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) home inspection reviews the heating and cooling system of a home from a performance perspective. The inspection usually does not inspect or compare to codes or manufacturer requirements. Heating is provided typically by a forced <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> distributed by duct work or a water/steam boiler using radiators or convectors, but space heaters, heat pumps and other methods are also in use. The energy source is usually natural gas, fuel oil, or electric, but other sources include butane, wood and Geo-thermal. Cooling {{can be described as}} a split system, packaged unit, fan coil, heat pump, an evaporative cooler, or window/through-the-wall a/c unit.|$|E
25|$|In cold climates heating air {{and water}} is a major demand on {{household}} energy use. By investing in newer technologies in the home, significant energy reductions are possible. Heat pumps are a more efficient alternative to using electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water. A variety of efficient clothes dryers are available, and the classic clothes line requires no energy, only time. Natural gas condensing boilers and hot <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> increase efficiency over standard hot flue models. New construction implementing heat exchangers can capture heat from waste water or exhaust air in bathrooms, laundry and kitchens.|$|R

5000|$|An {{existing}} {{house was}} expanded in 1927 for Edward T. Stotesbury {{as a summer}} [...] "cottage", and was designed by architects Magaziner, Eberhard & Harris. The resulting 80-room mansion had a 30-room servants’ wing and was heated by 56 electric wall heaters, five hot <b>air</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and 26 hand-carved marble fireplaces imported from Europe. The house had 28 bathrooms and 52 telephones with 23 extensions. Stotesbury's wife, Eva Roberts Cromwell Stotesbury, was {{an active member of}} society in Bar Harbor. The home was demolished in 1953 {{to make way for the}} Canadian National Bluenose ferry terminal. It is now the location of the Marine Atlantic Terminal.|$|R
50|$|A simple solar air {{collector}} {{consists of an}} absorber material, sometimes having a selective surface, to capture radiation {{from the sun and}} transfers this thermal energy to air via conduction heat transfer. This heated air is then ducted to the building space or to the process area where the heated air is used for space heating or process heating needs. Functioning in a similar manner as a conventional forced <b>air</b> <b>furnace,</b> solar-thermal-air systems provide heat by circulating air over an energy collecting surface, absorbing the sun’s thermal energy, and ducting air coming in contact with it. Simple and effective collectors can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications.|$|E

50|$|Older {{versions}} of the 1:25000 Ordnance Survey map show a trig point at the summit of Calver Hill but all there is now is a pile of rubble and mining spoil to form a summit cairn. The fell is littered with signs of Calver Hill’s industrial past; {{there is a large}} disused quarry 500 metres north-west of the summit cairn, there are also disused tips, pits and shafts from former lead mines. Lead mining reached its heyday in the 19th century in this area and they were some of the most productive mines in Yorkshire. Calver Hill was a Bole hill a place where the lead from the mines was smelted in an open <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> which used the prevailing wind to increase the heat. Burnt stones and a scattering of slag show the locations of these furnaces.|$|E

5000|$|Gas fired forced <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> have {{a burner}} in the furnace fuelled by natural gas. A blower forces cold air through a heat {{exchanger}} {{and then through}} duct-work that distributes the hot air through the building. [...] Each room will have an outlet from the duct system, often mounted in the floor or low on the wall - some rooms will also have an opening into the cold air return duct. Depending on {{the age of the}} system, forced <b>air</b> gas <b>furnaces</b> use either a pilot light or a solid state ignition system (spark or hot surface ignition) to light the natural gas burner. The natural gas is fed to buildings from a main gas line. The duct work supplying the hot air (and sometimes cool air if an AC unit is tied into the system) may be insulated. A thermostat starts and stops the furnace to regulate temperature. Large homes or commercial buildings may have multiple thermostats and heating zones, controlled by powered dampers. A digital thermostat can be programmed to activate the gas furnace at certain times. For example, a resident may want the temperature in their dwelling to rise 15 minutes before returning from work.|$|R
