Andrew Orloff, the episode's visual effects supervisor, strived to makes the parasitic worms look <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> {{possible with the}} help of the actors and camera angles. It featured one-time guest stars Tzi Ma, Colby Paul, Ingrid Torrance and Jack Yang.|$|E
5|$|Val Guest, who had {{directed}} The Quatermass Xperiment, returned for Quatermass 2. Guest once again sought {{to create a}} film that felt <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> possible, using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film's climactic scenes. Guest planned each day’s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots {{he wanted to make}} that day.|$|E

There are {{two different types of}} synthetic dreadlocks. The first is dread extensions, in which other hair can be infused with the wearer's own hair. The second is dreadfalls, in which one dread is tied into another with either elastic or lace. Both of these methods are used to make dreads look better and more appealing, and to achieve the desired effect of longer hair.|$|E
25|$|Taliesin was a British poet, or bard, of the 6th Century. The {{details of}} his life are sketchy and come only from his own poetry, so Bond filled in {{specific}} elements to suit her story. As mentioned in the book, Bedd Taliesin does mean 'Taliesins' grave', but his actual burial site is unknown. Although later mythology places him {{in the court of}} King Arthur, Bond wanted Taliesin to appear <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> possible, to help ground the fantasy sections of the book in reality.|$|E
25|$|James is {{also known}} for his radical {{empiricism}} which holds that relations between objects are <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> the objects themselves. James was also a pluralist in that he believed that there may actually be multiple correct accounts of truth. He rejected the correspondence theory of truth and instead held that truth involves a belief, facts about the world, other background beliefs, and future consequences of those beliefs. Later in his life James would also come to adopt neutral monism, {{the view that the}} ultimate reality is of one kind, and is neither mental nor physical.|$|E

500|$|Capcom's Resident Evil (1996) was {{announced}} during development. Since {{it was also}} a horror game and the visuals were impressive, the team challenged themselves to develop higher quality graphics and outshine Resident Evil. According to Kono, Clock Tower was developed with a [...] "material comes first" [...] mindset, as opposed to the [...] "game system" [...] given priority with the [...] "material" [...] superimposed on top. The team used 3D graphics and extensive animation as they sought to portray murders <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> possible in both normal and surreal settings. Kono was pleased with their 3D engine, as it allowed him to use camera angles effectively. The music was composed with a theme of [...] "noise and silence", placing sounds in obscure places and not playing sound when there should be some.|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, Collins read the Book of Revelation. As well, Collins has said he {{somewhat}} based his character around his younger brother, who has something [...] "angelic about him", as he [...] "has this way of, very calmly, just staring into someone's eyes" [...] making one feel [...] "like he can get into your soul." [...] To avoid the biblically toned dialogue from sounding too [...] "campy", Collins does his best to [...] "play it <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> possible". Because Castiel's true voice shattered windows in his premiere episode, Collins decided to use a [...] "gruff, resonant voice" [...] for the character. However, when portraying the angel's host Jimmy Novak, he tried to create {{a distinction between the}} two characters, providing different physical and personality traits, as well as using a [...] "more boyish kind of sound" [...] for Jimmy's voice.|$|E
500|$|Ross was {{impressed}} with the in-camera effects achieved for the series, but he would always propose visual effect alternatives to these on set because [...] "you have to embrace what VFX can do for you. The cost of spending half a day on a special scene has got to be worth it, or else you can just shoot a plate and do the rest in post and save yourself all that production time". Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works. [...] us a starting point for building our new shots. And whether they are all-CG or just elements, we are always dealing with Noah’s aesthetic of making it look <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> possible." ...|$|E
500|$|David Sims, also {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, {{called it a}} fitting end to the season, [...] "leaving {{absolutely}} everyone salivating for season two." [...] Writing for the Star-Ledger, Jenifer Braun praised the episode for its set dressing ("I have to say, it’s a pleasure {{just to look at}} all the shiny stuff the HBO set dressers came up with for Tywin Lannister's tent") and the authenticity of the baby dragons ("And wow, HBO, seamless special effects here. Baby Dragon looks every bit <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> the series’ dogs"). HitFix said it [...] "Wrapped up its terrific first season...it was damned entertaining along the way--with the finale as possibly the most entertaining so far--and we know that at least one more season is coming. And if the creative team can keep up this level of quality, it's hard to imagine HBO shutting things down anytime soon, even with a budget that only figures to get higher. Dragons aren't cheap, but they're also amazing." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{sometime}} during Summer 2008. Miller wanted to style the filming {{as if the}} cameras are following the team like in a documentary. The first day was spent in the [...] "Ottawa Bravo" [...] safe house set, where Connie reveals the threat. Throughout the shoot, Gemma Jones had hip problems. Concerned, the producers set up a body double on hand. However, Jones insisted she could do everything herself, {{and in the end}} the double was not used. During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly. It's a weird thing. I'm not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody's hands something strange happens. It's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of the film; he gave it 3½ stars out of four, praising it as a [...] "technical milestone" [...] while conceding that its [...] "nuts and bolts" [...] story lacked [...] "the intelligence and daring of, say, Steven Spielberg's A.I." [...] He noted that while he did not once feel convinced Aki Ross was an actual human being, she was [...] "lifelike", stating her creators [...] "dare us to admire their craft. If Aki is not <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> a human actress, she's about as human as a Playmate who has been retouched to glossy perfection." [...] He also expressed a desire for the film to succeed in hopes of seeing more films made in its image, though he was skeptical {{of its ability to}} be accepted. Peter Bradshaw gave a more negative review, stating that while the animation was brilliant, the [...] "solemnly realist human faces look shriekingly phoney precisely because they're almost there but not quite", concluding [...] "The story is adequate, if familiar, but after half an hour relapses into cliche." ...|$|E
500|$|Marissa Higgins, {{writing for}} xoJane, {{contended that the}} show [...] "didn't {{accomplish}} anything with their portrayal of sexual assault" [...] {{and said that she}} disliked the way that the story ended with Doggett effectively quitting her job as van driver in order to avoid further contact with Coates. Emma Eisenberg, of Salon, criticized the scenes depicting Doggett growing up in Waynesboro as being [...] "riddled with excessive Appalachian clichés". She went further by calling Doggett's mother unrealistic in her attitude towards sex: [...] "the mothers I met [...] wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices". Eisenberg claimed that, therefore, Doggett's mother's speech about sex − [...] "it’s like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening" [...] − was not representative of people in Waynesboro at that time. Chloe Stillwell completely disagreed with Eisenberg and insisted that the character of Doggett was realistic: [...] "Eisenberg's argument completely misses the point that perhaps the show is trying to be <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> possible, and acknowledging that there are real life Pennsatuckies in this world isn't to disenfranchise Appalachia." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios {{tried to make}} the {{parasitic}} worms look <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> possible. He explained, [...] "...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest." [...] Orloff continued, [...] "And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible, so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Man Trap" [...] {{appeared}} in Gene Roddenberry's original pitch for Star Trek {{as the title}} of a show with a different plot: the crew face several apparitions that are [...] "wish-fulfilment traps which become <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> flesh and blood"; the traps increase in subtlety until the crew struggle to differentiate between apparition and reality. Lee Erwin, who had previously worked on The Lieutenant with Roddenberry, was commissioned to produce a treatment; an outline featuring a salt-devouring vampire was handed in on April 8, 1966. Meanwhile, George Clayton Johnson had been assigned a storyline, tentatively titled [...] "Chicago II", in which the crew of the Enterprise visit a planet where the culture was that of 1920s mob-era Chicago. Johnson was hired after story editor John D. F. Black recommended him to the producers. Johnson decided to use the 1953 science fiction novel The Syndic by Cyril M. Kornbluth {{as the basis for the}} story. Roddenberry felt that Johnson's treatment did not match his vision for Star Trek, but did not want to lose him entirely, and asked him to write [...] "The Man Trap". Erwin was paid in full for his version, and given a separate [...] "kill fee" [...] because it would not be used.|$|E
500|$|Boyd has {{previously}} {{written about the}} 20th century through two characters: The New Confessions was a fictional memoir, and Nat Tate a spoof biography. In Any Human Heart, Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from: [...] "I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could seem almost <b>as</b> <b>real</b> <b>as</b> the real ones and whose life followed a similar pattern: boarding school, university, Paris in the 20s, the rise of Fascism, war, post-war neglect, disillusion, increasing decrepitude, and so on—a long, varied and rackety life that covered most of the century." [...] Boyd sets Mountstuart's life within its context, tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by depiciting Mountstuart as swept along {{in the flow of}} history - he serves in World War II, sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s, and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world. Rather than being re-told in hindsight, their importance in context, historical events are seen through the petty lens of every-day living. For example, in an entry from the 1920s, Mountstuart notes [...] "Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena. She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes. We talked a little stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to note how much better informed she was than I." ...|$|E
