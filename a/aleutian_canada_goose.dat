40|$|The current {{endangered}} species list has its administrative beginnings in 1964 when the Department of the Interior 2 ̆ 7 s Committee on Rare and Endangered Wildlife Species published a preliminary list of 62 species at risk of extinction (Goble, forthcoming). Following {{the enactment of the}} Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 (ESPA), the secretary of the interior in 1967 published the first official list of 78 2 ̆ 2 native fish and wildlife threatened with extinction 2 ̆ 2 (ESPA sec. l(c); U. S. Department of the Interior 1967; Wilcove and McMillan, this volume). By the time the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was adopted in 1973, there were 392 species on the list (Yaffee 1982). These first lists included only vertebrate species. On the thirtieth anniversary of the ESA, the number stood at 1, 260 domestic species and 558 foreign species (USFWS 2003 a), with plant and invertebrate species outnumbering vertebrates. This chapter presents a graphical summary encapsulating thirty years of species protection and restoration under the ESA. The summary reveals both gains and losses. For some species, such as the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> (Branta canadensis leucopareia), the process worked as it was meant to, reversing decline and restoring populations to healthy levels (USFWS 2001 a); for others, such as the dusky seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens), the process failed, and despite being listed the species continued to spiral toward eventual extinction (USFWS 1983; Walters 1992). What follows is an assessment of the state of species protection as it has evolved under the ESA. This includes the taxonomie and demographie distribution of listed species, and the number of critical habitat designations.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2009. Major: Wildlife Conservation. Advisor:David E. Andersen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 170 pages. The distribution and abundance of breeding lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in northern Manitoba, Canada have expanded considerably {{during the last}} 30 years, and snow geese now use areas where they did not previously occur and were traditionally used solely by breeding Eastern Prairie Population (EPP) <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> (Branta canadensis interior). Breeding and migrating snow and Ross's geese (Chen rossii) have dramatically altered sub-arctic vegetation along Hudson Bay, but the direct or indirect effects of these growing populations on other species, particularly sympatric nesting EPP <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> is not well documented. To better understand relationships between snow <b>geese</b> and EPP <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> I evaluated factors influencing survival and spatial distribution of <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nests {{across a range of}} spatial and temporal scales. I employed nest distribution data, 2001 - 2007, and spatial point-pattern analyses to assess (1) whether nesting <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> exhibited territoriality, (2) whether current spatial patterns of <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest distribution were evolutionarily stable, and (3) whether spatial patterns of <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest fate were associated with the density of nesting snow geese. In addition, I employed logistic-exposure models to evaluate factors influencing within- and among-year variation in the probability of nest survival for <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nests from 2005 - 2007 in areas with different histories and densities of snow goose nesting. Specifically, I tested the apparent-competition hypothesis and the nesting-association hypothesis as mechanisms to describe interactions between nesting <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> and snow geese. I examined factors influencing the spatial distribution of nesting EPP <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> in a coastal tundra landscape between 1976 and 2007, and assessed whether associations with these factors have changed in light of changes to the coastal salt marsh vegetation from snow goose herbivory. Lastly, I modeled <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest count data collected during range-wide aerial breeding population surveys conducted annually for EPP <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> in northern Manitoba, Canada, 1987 - 2008. I employed mixed-effects Poisson regression to (1) quantify spatial relationships between nesting lesser snow <b>geese</b> and <b>Canada</b> geese; (2) assess factors influencing the distribution of nesting <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> at a range-wide spatial scale (101, 500 km 2); and (3) evaluate how well local (i. e., nest or study area) spatial-scale associations predict range-wide distribution patterns. Point-pattern analyses indicated territoriality among nesting <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> and that changes in snow goose nest proximity and density may influence <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest fate. However, logistic-exposure models did not support the apparent-competition or nesting-association hypotheses as mechanisms governing associations among <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest survival and nesting snow geese; particularly relative to the strong effects of collared lemming (Dicrostonyx richardsoni) and arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) population dynamics. <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest density was negatively associated with increasing distance to coastal salt marsh brood-rearing habitat; however, from 1976 to 2007, this relationship appeared to be changing to where in more recent years increased distance to salt marsh was positively associated with density of nesting <b>Canada</b> <b>geese.</b> Three models of <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest counts from range-wide aerial surveys [...] all containing factors related to previous <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest density (representing recruitment), distance to Hudson Bay, general habitat type, and lesser snow goose nest density [...] had the lowest mean-squared error among all models considered and were unbiased. The relationship between <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nests and snow goose nest density suggested that the abundance of nesting <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> and snow geese varied similarly across habitats throughout the entire EPP breeding range (e. g., both abundant near the coast), but that very high snow goose abundance may have negative impacts on <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest density. My analyses of data from multiple spatial and temporal scales suggested that associations between the distribution of <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nests and nesting snow geese was likely related to alteration of coastal salt marshes from snow goose foraging, and subsequent changes in the distribution of <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> brood-rearing habitat use; rather than influences related to <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> nest survival. My analyses highlight that a continuing shift in the spatial distribution of nesting snow geese along western Hudson Bay will have implications for the spatial distribution of sympatric nesting <b>Canada</b> <b>geese...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, 1980 A {{study to}} {{determine}} the migration and wintering ground distribution, ecology, and population status of the endangered <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> (Branta canadensis leucopareia) was conducted from October 1975 to May 1978. Field investigations extended from the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, to the. Central Valley of California. Prior to and during the study, 536 Aleutian geese were banded to document movement and survival. It was determined that the geese use traditional migration and wintering areas away from Alaska, returning to virtually the same fields annually. During September, Aleutian Canada geese migrate along the Aleutian Island chain from Buldir Island near the western end to the easternmost island of Unimak and then apparently shift southeast on a transoceanic flight. The geese arrive in California in early October; some stop near Crescent City, but most birds continue to the Sacramento Valley where over 95 {{percent of the population}} uses a small agricultural area in the Butte Sink. From mid-November to early December the geese move southward via the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to the grasslands of the upper San Joaquin Valley. Most of the birds are present as a single flock near Modesto from at least late December to early February. They begin shifting southward to an area near Los Banos in mid-January, and some are present until mid-March. Aleutian geese start moving northward to the Crescent City staging grounds as early as mid-January, with most of the birds arriving during March. They peak in number there in late March and early April when nearly the entire known iv population is present. In mid-April, geese begin to leave Crescent City to the breeding grounds, and by late April or early May all have left. Although a few Aleutian Canada geese have been reported near the mouth of the Columbia River, Washington, most apparently make a transoceanic flight to the eastern Aleutians. There, they continue westward to Buldir where they have been seen as early as the first week of May. During the study, hunting and avian cholera were found to be the main sources of winter mortality. Closure on Canada goose hunting enacted in three areas of California {{at the onset of the}} study has reduced mortality from an estimated preclosure rate of 22. 5 percent annually to approximately 11. 5 percent during winters 1975 - 76 and 1976 - 77. This winter mortality may comprise the majority of the annual loss. The spring population increased 45. 6 percent, from 790 in April 1975 to 1150 in March 1977. Management needs on the migration and wintering grounds include continuation of protection of the geese through hunting closures and maintenance of suitable habitat conditions on their major use areas...|$|E
