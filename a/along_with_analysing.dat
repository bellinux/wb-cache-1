40|$|If the {{hypothesis}} that people live longer and in better health is true, it could be expected that {{the changes in the}} health of the elderly have important consequences for the further demand for health services, the need for long-term care and also for the development of health expenditures. But other trends could also be essential to determining the extent and structure of the demand for health care and health expenditures. In the case of long-term care, there are other important effects that concern the structure of health care and institutional settings. Most long-term care recipients currently live in households and their caregivers are predominantly members of the family – especially daughters, daughters-in-law and spouses. The increasing labour force participation of women may affect the future supply of informal family care-giving and may increase the demand for professional home care and institutional care. In all EU countries family structures are changing: the proportion of elderly persons living with their children has fallen. Projections on the use of health care and the need for long-term care require an analysis of the current situation in each EU country and a study of the determinants for using both (especially the influence of health). This paper, produced as part of the ENEPRI AGIR project, presents the results of data collection and analyses for EU countries that participated in the study – Belgium, France, Finland, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK and Germany. Additionally, data are provided for Denmark. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysing</b> the data provided, DIW has investigated the relationships between health care utilisation, health status and age respectively with long-term care-giving at home, based on the European Community Household Panel (ECHP).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} buyer {{supplier}} relationships {{and the role}} of various constructs in the kids wear market in India. It focuses on the budding unorganized segment of the kids wear industry. The purpose of the study is to analyze the changes within the industry and its effects on the unorganized segment. It primarily concentrates on the growing importance of the buyer supplier relationship in this sector and factors contributing to strengthen it. This paper aims to contribute to the existing literature on buyer supplier relationship by pondering on this untouched segment. Concentrating on the kids wear industry the dissertation focuses on how to establish and maintain long term relationships with the big retail stores. The retail giants, who focus on reducing costs and enhancing supplier-buyer-customer relationships, make it a challenging job for the manufacturers to reach their specifications. Hence my research concentrates on the importance of setting up relationship with the big buyers, the problems faced in doing so and features which enhance the relationship as well. The aim {{of this paper is to}} attempt to understand how relationship building helps both the suppliers and buyers <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysing</b> the importance of each construct in the relationship from a supplier perspective. In order to reach our purpose semi structured interviews were used, which comprised of interviews with suppliers and surveys focusing on suppliers as well as buyers.

40|$|The reverberations of Wall Street {{had to be}} felt {{across the}} global banking system. Last September, the world economy seemed to be hurtling down {{in a way that}} had {{initially}} raised the spectre of the Great Depression in America of the late 1920 s. This is based largely on the performance of stock markets which are supposed to reflect future trends in the real economy. However, such knowledge embedded in the markets can be imperfect, as we have learnt by now. In some ways, the global financial crisis and its fallout are forcing economic agents to acquire new knowledge in regard to what might happen in the future. It was difficult to explain rationally why the stock markets were furiously running up even as company balance sheets were still bleeding. A few years ago, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were a distant possibility. Today, the reality is far different. We are in a dramatic shift that is fast making IFRS the most widely accepted accounting model in the world. As the business environment becomes increasingly global and companies routinely list on stock exchanges in many countries, the need for consistent worldwide reporting standards intensifies. IFRS clearly addresses this issue; its goal is to create comparable, reliable, and transparent financial statements that will facilitate greater cross-border capital raising, trade and better corporate governance practices. Thus acceptance of IFRS is gaining momentum across the globe. IFRS transition program for any organization will have multi –dimensional effect because of differences which exist between IFRS and Local GAAPs. The objectives of the paper is to highlight the nature of such differences with examples <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>analysing</b> the provisions of IFRS, comparative analysis of IFRS with Indian GAAP system, benefits, and major issues in first time adoption of IFRS in Indian companies with the help of case study of Indian corporate...|$|E

40|$|Patterns of {{participation}} in higher education (HE) in the UK, as elsewhere, have been marked by social inequalities for decades. UK Governments have responded with a plethora of policies and agendas aimed at addressing this broad social issue.

Interviews with a range of ‘policy actors’ <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>analyses</b> of institutional ‘widening access’ policy documents, reveal divergences between HEIs in how this policy agenda is interpreted and delivered.
