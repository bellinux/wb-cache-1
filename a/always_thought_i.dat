500|$|When he was eighteen, Littleton {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan to study physics. His choice of major was influenced by his father, who wanted one of his children to follow him in his profession (Littleton’s oldest sibling Martha was an industrial psychologist; his oldest brother Jesse chose medicine as a career; and his brother Joe became a Vice President of Corning’s Technical Products Division). According to Littleton, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would be a physicist like my father".|$|E
500|$|Welles's biographer Simon Callow has {{compared}} Falstaff to Welles's father Richard Head Welles, {{stating that}} like Falstaff, Welles's father was [...] "a drunkard, a trickster, a braggart, a womanizer, a gentleman and a charmerand he is {{rejected by the}} person he loves the most." [...] Welles's father was an alcoholic and womanizer who would often take a teenage Welles along {{with him when he}} was indulging in his vices. Welles observed his father much like Falstaff is observed by Hal and depends on his young protégé to bail him out of trouble. The love triangle between Prince Hal and his two father figures, Henry IV and Falstaff, is also similar to Welles's relationships with his father and the two men who became surrogate fathers to him: family friend Dr. Maurice Bernstein and Todd School for Boys headmaster Roger Hill. Both of Welles's surrogate fathers disapproved of Richard Welles's lifestyle and negative influence on Welles. When the younger Welles turned fifteen, he took the advice of Roger Hill and told his father that he would not see him again until he cleaned up his act and stopped drinking; Welles's father died shortly afterwards, alone and lonely, and Welles always blamed himself for his father's death, stating, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> killed him." ...|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E
2500|$|Wilder's and Brackett's estrangement during Double Indemnity {{was not a}} {{permanent}} one. Years later Wilder would characterize their time apart as just another kind of adultery: [...] "1944 was 'The Year of Infidelities, he said. [...] "Charlie produced The Uninvited...I wrote Double Indemnity with Raymond Chandler... I don't think he ever forgave me. He <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> cheated on him with Raymond Chandler." [...] Brackett spun the breakup in a decidedly different light, saying, [...] "Billy got so despondent at being without me that we did The Lost Weekend, a depressing film about a writer who has trouble writing." [...] Lost Weekend was a distinguished offspring for the reconciled couple – they left Oscar night with three Awards: Best Picture for producer Brackett, Best Director for Wilder, and a shared pair of statuettes for both for Best Screenplay. They worked together through Sunset Boulevard in 1950, then split for good.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Saddington {{provided}} three {{tracks for}} the album, Women 'n Blues, with other tracks by Kate Dunbar, Sally King, Jeannie Lewis and Margret RoadKnight. In August 2012 Saddington appeared on celebrity musician quiz show, RocKwiz, on SBS-TV, where she performed Simone's [...] "Backlash Blues". In December that year she recalled her career [...] "I'm not into legacies ... I usually {{get a job}} once in a blue moon ... I guess it is by choice in a way. But {{at the same time}} I have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{would have liked to have}} earned a living at it". She believed that Krishna Consciousness had [...] "saved my life", reviewing her life as a heavy drinker [...] "I honestly think if I had gone on with that, it would have ended up like Janis Joplin. Too fast; not good enough; too soon, you know, bang". In March 2013 she was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, Wendy Saddington died on 21 June 2013, aged 63.|$|E

2500|$|Lightbody had a [...] "long-term ambition" [...] {{of making}} a country album and {{revealed}} the project's existence in May 2009. In the interview, he expressed his love for country music, which {{he said he had}} loved for a long time: [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had a country album in me and it turns out I did." [...] The rest of Snow Patrol expressed excitement for their band-mate, [...] "delighted that [...] getting to exercise all his crazy ideas." [...] In October 2009, Lightbody in his blog on Snow Patrol's website revealed the members of the group to be Richard Colburn (of Belle & Sebastian), Iain Archer, singer Miriam Kaufmann (Archer's wife), and Jacknife Lee. He talked about two more members whom he was very excited about, but didn't name them. He also stated that the album won't be country as was being reported, but would be [...] "country-tinged". In January 2010, Hot Press reported Peter Buck (of R.E.M.) {{to be a member of}} the group. Lightbody described Buck as one of his [...] "all-time heroes" [...] and admired his talent for playing a variety of instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Kylie Christmas is Minogue's first Christmas studio {{album and}} her thirteenth overall studio album. Minogue {{previously}} released the Christmas track [...] "Santa Baby", which appeared on her 2000 single, [...] "Please Stay"; {{a recording of}} [...] "Let It Snow" [...] in 2010; and two Christmas extended plays in 2010, A Kylie Christmas and A Christmas Gift. Speaking with Idolator's Mike Wass, Minogue stated [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would do a Christmas album, {{it was just a}} case of when... I mentioned it to a couple of people on my team and they were saying, 'What {{do you want to do}} for the rest of the year? What do you want to do next?' I said, 'I'm thinking about a Christmas album, actually.' Some of that stems from last Christmas." [...] Minogue said that she had Christmas in Los Angeles, California in 2014, and her friend suggest recording a Christmas album; [...] "They just assumed I had done one, and when I said I hadn't done an entire album they just started, 'You've got to do it. It would be amazing. We just want to see your little outfits.'" [...] Kylie Christmas was recorded at Angel Studios and Sarm Music Village, and features a mix of both classical Christmas songs and new original material. American guitarist and producer Nile Rodgers and Minogue's sister Dannii Minogue were reported to be working on the album, while The Sun claimed she had recorded [...] "half of the album".|$|E
