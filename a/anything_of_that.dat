500|$|A {{few months}} after Mitchell's trial, Galle and Mitchell split a $750,000 {{settlement}} in the civil suit. The nurses, who both live in Jal, New Mexico, were unable to find employment in nursing after being terminated from WCMH. After signing the settlement, Wiley reinforced his support of Arafiles, saying, [...] "He’s {{done a lot of}} good in this county. If you have a heart attack or <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nature in the emergency room, he is definitely the doctor that you {{want to take care of}} you." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, U.S. presidential {{candidate}} George W. Romney said the following regarding the White Horse Prophecy: [...] "I {{have always felt}} that they meant that sometime {{the question of whether}} we are going to proceed {{on the basis of the}} Constitution would arise and at this point government leaders who were Mormons would be involved in answering that question." [...] In 2007, U.S. {{presidential candidate}} Mitt Romney, George's son, told the Salt Lake Tribune that [...] "I haven't heard my name associated with [...] or <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nature. [...] That's not official church doctrine.... I don't put that at the heart of my religious belief." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1904, George Clinch {{published}} {{a note on}} the Medway Megaliths in the Royal Anthropological Institute's journal, Man, in which he referred to the Coldrum Stones as [...] "at once the most remarkable and the least known of the whole series." [...] Suggesting that its design indicates that it was built during [...] "a late date in the neolithic age", he compared the workmanship in producing the megaliths to that at Stonehenge, although noted that they differed in that the Coldrum Stones clearly represented [...] "a sepulchral pile". Ultimately, he ended his note by urging for the site to be protected under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900. In that same issue, Lewis included an added note in which he rejected the idea that the monument had once been covered by an earthen tumulus because he could see [...] "no evidence that <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind ever existed", and instead he interpreted the site as a stone circle, comparing it to the examples at Avebury, Arborlow, and Stanton Drew, suggesting that the central chamber was a shrine.|$|E
500|$|The {{ferocity of}} Shakur's raging vocals, as said by long-time {{collaborator}} and producer of [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] Johnny [...] "J", was entirely authentic. He explained that Shakur was initially fueled by his anger against Biggie and Bad Boy Records for {{the belief that}} they had a role in the November 30, 1994 ambush and attack on Shakur. He claimed that Biggie and his crew knew of his shooting and wanted him dead. Shakur used this fury, which Johnny [...] "J" [...] described as [...] "superhuman", to attack Biggie and other East Coast rappers. Johnny [...] "J" [...] also stated that he had never seen Shakur so angry and that the words he rapped were in no way an act, describing the recording process as the most [...] "hard-core he had ever done." [...] Although he was very happy with the work he had put into it and the resulting song, Johnny [...] "J" [...] {{went on to say that}} he had no desire to work on <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> magnitude again.|$|E
500|$|The three {{charities}} {{that were}} to benefit were prisoners' debt relief, the Mercer's Hospital, and the Charitable Infirmary. In its report on a public rehearsal, the Dublin News-Letter described the oratorio as [...] "...far surpass <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> Nature which has been performed in {{this or any other}} Kingdom". Seven hundred people attended the premiere on 13 April. So that the largest possible audience could be admitted to the concert, gentlemen were requested to remove their swords, and ladies were asked not to wear hoops in their dresses. [...] The performance earned unanimous praise from the assembled press: [...] "Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring and crouded Audience". A Dublin clergyman, Rev. Delaney, was so overcome by Susanna Cibber's rendering of [...] "He was despised" [...] that reportedly he leapt to his feet and cried: [...] "Woman, for this be all thy sins forgiven thee!" [...] The takings amounted to around £400, providing about £127 to each of the three nominated charities and securing the release of 142 indebted prisoners.|$|E

500|$|At the Johor UMNO {{convention}} that same month, Johor Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), Abdul Ghani Othman, criticised the Bangsa Malaysia and [...] "meritocracy" [...] policies. Ghani described Bangsa Malaysia {{as a threat}} to the Malays and their Constitutional position, suggesting it could [...] "threaten national stability" [...] as well. Ghani insisted that the policy [...] "be applied in the context ... with the Malays as the pivotal race", and described meritocracy as a [...] "form of discrimination and oppression" [...] because rural Malay students could not compete with their urban counterparts. In the resulting controversy about his remarks, several federal ministers criticised Ghani, with one saying that Bangsa Malaysia [...] "has nothing to do with one race given a pivotal role over others", and another arguing that [...] "It does not impinge on the rights of Bumiputeras or other communities." [...] Ghani stood by his comments, declaring that the proponents of Bangsa Malaysia were also advocating a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia", as Lee Kuan Yew had, even though [...] "the government has rejected it from the start." [...] Najib, the Deputy Prime Minister, suggested that any effort to define Bangsa Malaysia politically would be fruitless, and as such the debate was unnecessary; he also insisted that [...] "It does not question the special rights of the Malays, our quota or <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort." [...] The UMNO Annual General Assembly that year was the first to be televised in full; it became a subject of controversy when delegates such as Hashim Suboh made speeches utilising heavy racial rhetoric; Hishammuddin, who had brandished the kris again, was asked by Hashim when he would [...] "use it". After the assembly, Hishammuddin insisted that the kris was not a symbol of Malay supremacy.|$|E
2500|$|By 6 January, the {{day before}} the final vote, de Valera {{acknowledged}} the deep division within his cabinet: [...] "When these Articles of Agreement were signed, the body in which the executive authority of this assembly, and of the State, is vested became as completely split as it was possible for it to become. Irrevocably, not on personalities or <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind or matter, but on absolute fundamentals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tensions grew {{following}} the Jane-Dally murders. Special Houghton County Prosecutor George E. Nichols warned Moyer {{that he would}} hold him accountable if strikers attacked the Alliance parades. Moyer {{was said to have}} acted [...] "promptly and creditably in joining with the prosecutor in an effort to prevent <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind." [...] The night before the meetings, Moyer told strikers at Red Jacket to avoid violence, and that the Alliance was looking for any opportunity to make trouble. Organizers Thomas Strizich, Yanko Terzich, Mor Oppman and Ben Goggin translated his message to the strikers.|$|E

The message is for Muslim countries to return to Islamic values." [...] DePaul University history professor Thomas Mockaitis stated that [...] "I have not seen any evidence they have engaged in violent activity in the U.S." [...] and that the group's views and goals, while controversial, did not warrant its labeling as a terrorist group.|$|E
2500|$|Unable {{to reclaim}} his {{railroad}} job [...] Gage {{was for a}} time [...] "a kind of living museum exhibit" [...] at Barnum's American Museum in New York City. (This was not the later Barnum's circus; {{there is no evidence}} Gage ever exhibited with a troupe or circus, or on a fairground.) Advertisements have also been found for public appearances by Gagewhich he may have arranged and promoted himselfin New Hampshire and Vermont, supporting Harlow's statement that Gage made public appearances in [...] "most of the larger New England towns". Years later Bigelow wrote that Gage had been [...] "a shrewd and intelligent man and quite disposed to do <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sort to turn an honest penny", but had given up such efforts because [...] " [...] sort of thing has not much interest for the general public".|$|E
