40|$|THE Borborema metallogenetic {{province}} in north-eastern Brazil, extending over parts of Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte states, {{is well known}} due to its mineral riches. This note sums up studies made on the bismuth minerals found there. Mineralization of bismuth is observed both in the pegmatites that cut the mica schists of the Serido formation, and in the skarnites and tactites of the Middle Parelhas formation, both of them belonging to the Cears series of the <b>Algonkian</b> <b>period.</b> The minerals include native bismuth, bismuthinite, bismutite, bismutotantalite, bismoclite, arseno-bismite, and some doubtful species. Native bismuth is found as masses in pegmatites and as an accessory in tactites, recovered in the latter during the concentration of scheelite in Brejui Mine near Currais Novos, Rio Grande do Norte state. Masses weighing up to 13 Kg {{have been found in}} the Boqueir~o pegmatite near Parelhas in the same state. The characteristic association of this mineral in tactites is with molybdenite and scheelite, while in pegma-tires it is noted with quartz. I t is seen to alter or with a sulphide capping in tactites. The mineral is pure with no special features. Bismuthinite is found both in the pegmatites and tactites, with a whitish to dark metallic grey colour and a distinct tabular habit. Samples from the Boqueir~o pegmatite have shown needles of aphrizite (black tourmaline) as inclusions along the cleavages. Its association i Brejui mine is with molybdenite. Some samples that have doubtful characters have been X-rayed and the presence of some other sulphid...|$|E
