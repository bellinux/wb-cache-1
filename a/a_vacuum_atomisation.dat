40|$|ABSTRACT: ER gel {{exhibits}} various adhesive characteristics {{according to}} the applied electric field. This characteristic is called the EA effect. The results of a recent study reveal that the EA effect also occurs in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Therefore, {{it is expected that}} ER gel can be applied to a chucking or damping device in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> process. However, the characteristics of ER gel in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> have not been sufficiently clarified. The {{purpose of this study is}} to experimentally evaluate the characteristic of ER gel in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> The performance of an ERG fixture element used for a silicon wafer in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> is evaluated through shearing tests. The experimental results indicate that the ER gel demonstrates satisfactory performance in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Moreover, the outgas released from the ER gel in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> is evaluated, and the influence of the degassing time on the outgas is investigated.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>vacuum</b> is {{initially}} created by connecting a closed container to <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> pump. After achieving <b>a</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the container can be sealed, or the vacuum pump {{can be left}} running. Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as vacuum tubes, including cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and vacuum insulated panels, which must maintain <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> for <b>a</b> long time. This is because the inner surfaces of the container release absorbed gases {{for a long time}} after the vacuum is established. The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced. Even in systems which are continually evacuated by <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> pump, getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve <b>a</b> higher <b>vacuum</b> than the pump could achieve alone. Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> pump.|$|R
