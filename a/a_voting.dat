He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.|$|E

5|$|The Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Album of the Year is {{an honor}} {{presented}} annually by American television network Univision at the Lo Nuestro Awards. The accolade was established to recognize the most talented performers of Latin music.

However, since 2004, the winners are selected through an online survey. The trophy awarded is shaped {{in the form of}} a treble clef.|$|E
5|$|The sixteen contestants {{were divided}} into two tribes of eight: Tagi and Pagong. Both tribes fared equally in {{challenges}} but differed in organisational structure. Pagong was dominated by the younger, more carefree members, whereas four contestants on Tagi—Kelly, Richard, Rudy, and Susan—formed an alliance, choosing to vote as <b>a</b> <b>voting</b> bloc to ensure their safety. When ten players remained—five from each tribe—the tribes merged into one, named Rattana. The alliance strategy proved to be successful, and the four took advantage of the other contestants' lack of voting strategy to gain dominance. There was dissension in the alliance as Kelly was deemed untrustworthy, but she won four consecutive immunity challenges and was ineligible for elimination.|$|E

5000|$|The UML party, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Bhandari, won all but one seat in the Himalayan capital in 1991 elections, the country's first free elections in more than three decades.

5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised {{her hand in his}} defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member of}} the church, she was not <b>a</b> <b>voting</b> member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{was born}} in Buenos Aires, the fourth child of Italian {{businessman}} Domingo Belgrano y Peri and Josefa Casero. He {{came into contact with}} the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment while at university in Spain {{around the time of the}} French Revolution. Upon his return to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, where he became a notable member of the criollo population of Buenos Aires, he tried to promote some of the new political and economic ideals, but found severe resistance from local peninsulars. This rejection led him to work towards a greater autonomy for his country from the Spanish colonial regime. At first, he unsuccessfully promoted the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to become a regent ruler for the Viceroyalty during the period the Spanish King Ferdinand VII was imprisoned during the Peninsular War (1807–1814). He favoured the May Revolution, which removed the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros from power on 25 May 1810. He was elected as <b>a</b> <b>voting</b> member of the Primera Junta that took power after the ouster.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} <b>a</b> <b>voting</b> custom {{that dates}} {{to at least}} around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and {{has been described as}} an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the rural-to-urban ratio {{had been almost}} {{completely}} reversed from 1856. Around two-thirds of the state's population lived in the Adelaide urban area, yet the rural overweighting effectively resulted in <b>a</b> rural <b>vote</b> being worth at least double <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> in Adelaide. In {{one of the more}} extreme cases, <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> in the rural seat of Frome was effectively worth ten times <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> in the urban seat of Enfield.|$|R
