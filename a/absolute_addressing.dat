50|$|On many RISC machines, {{register}} 0 {{is fixed}} at the value zero. If register 0 {{is used as}} the base register, this becomes an example of <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing.</b> However, {{only a small portion}} of memory can be accessed (64 kilobytes, if the offset is 16 bits).|$|E
50|$|The {{language}} {{provides for}} (limited) single-processor concurrency (monitors, coroutines and explicit transfer of control) and for hardware access (<b>absolute</b> <b>addresses,</b> bit manipulation, and interrupts). It uses a nominal type system.|$|R
5000|$|In the Amiga, {{the only}} <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> {{in the system}} is hex $0000 0004 (memory {{location}} 4), which contains the start location called SysBase, a pointer to exec.library, the so-called kernel of Amiga.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} example {{describes an}} indirect {{way to address}} to a memory location in the format of segment:offset. For example, assume we want to refer to memory location 0xF867. One way {{this can be accomplished}} is by first defining a segment with beginning address 0xF000, and then defining an offset of 0x0867. Further, we are also allowed to shift the hexadecimal segment to reach the final <b>absolute</b> memory <b>address.</b> One thing to note here is that we can reach our final <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> in many ways.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the branch}} {{instructions}} using <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing</b> used all 15 {{bits of the}} address field as address. Using such a branch instruction was, therefore, {{the only way to}} set the two bits in the page register (controlling bits 14 and 13 of the address bus) and changing the current 8 KB page.|$|E
5000|$|NAR 1 {{processor}} has a 5-bit {{address bus}} (32 bytes of addressable memory) and 8-bit data bus. Machine instructions were single-byte with three most significant bits specifying the opcode and 5 least significant bits the parameter - memory address. A single 8-bit accumulator register was available {{and there were}} no flags or flag registers. Only <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing</b> mode was available and all others were achieved by self-modifying code.|$|E
50|$|While {{embedded}} instruction sets such as Thumb {{suffer from}} extremely high register pressure {{because they have}} small register sets, general-purpose RISC ISAs like MIPS and Alpha enjoy low register pressure. CISC ISAs like x86-64 offer low register pressure despite having smaller register sets. This {{is due to the}} many addressing modes and optimizations (such as sub-register addressing, memory operands in ALU instructions, <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing,</b> PC-relative addressing, and register-to-register spills) that CISC ISAs offer.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{relative}} addressing scheme, {{to obtain an}} <b>absolute</b> <b>address,</b> the relevant base address is taken and offset (aka displacement) is added to it. Under this type of scheme, the base address is the lowest numbered address within a prescribed range, to facilitate adding related positive-valued offsets.|$|R
50|$|Bit 9, Change Fields, {{inhibits}} the <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> from referencing {{a different}} field thanthe one containing the instruction. When bit 8 is 1, the upper accumulator K is used withthe instruction, otherwise the lower accumulator J is used. When bit 7 is 1, indirectaddressing is used, otherwise direct addressing is used.|$|R
50|$|In simple layouts, {{programs}} {{begin their}} execution at the beginning, which {{is common in}} scripting languages, simple binary executable formats, and boot loaders. In other cases, the entry point is at some other fixed point, which is some memory address than can be an <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> or relative address (offset).|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Forbes went to {{work for}} Microsoft, and Microsoft's cabinet archiver was {{enhanced}} to include the LZX compression method. Improvements included a variable search window size; Amiga LZX was fixed to 64kB, Microsoft LZX could range on powers of two between 32 and 2048 kilobytes. A special preprocessor was added to detect Intel 80x86 [...] "CALL" [...] instructions, converting their operands from relative addressing to <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing,</b> thus calls to the same location resulted in repeated strings that the compressor could match, improving compression of 80x86 binary code.|$|E
5000|$|The Elliott 503, the Elliott 803, and the Apollo Guidance Computer {{only used}} <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing,</b> {{and did not}} have any index registers.Thus, {{indirect}} jumps, or jumps through registers, were not supported in the instruction set. Instead, it could be instructed to add the contents of the current memory word to the next instruction. Adding a small value to the next instruction to be executed could, for example, change a [...] into a , thus creating the effect of an indexed jump. Note that the instruction is modified on-the-fly and remains unchanged in memory, i.e. it is not self-modifying code. If the value being added to the next instruction was large enough, it could modify the opcode of that instruction as well as or instead of the address.|$|E
50|$|Short {{branches}} are 2-byte instructions, and use 256-byte range, single byte address, page <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing</b> in {{the range}} 0 to 255 (hex FF). There is no relative branching. Therefore, {{care must be taken}} when attempting to cross page boundaries, which is impossible using short branches, except in two cases. There can be 'side effects', or known usage, when performing a short branch and the short branch instruction or the address byte is the last byte on the page. In this instance, because the PC is incremented after retrieving the byte address, or when the address byte is the first byte of the next page, the PC now points to the next page, not the page in which the branch instruction/byte address is located, so the branch will be in that next page.|$|E
50|$|A one byte offset, {{such as the}} {{hexadecimal}} ASCII {{value of}} a character (e.g. X'29') {{can be used to}} point to an alternative integer value (or index) in an array (e.g. X'01'). In this way, characters can be very efficiently translated from 'raw data' to a usable sequential index and then to an <b>absolute</b> <b>address</b> without a lookup table.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, ZPAQ {{will use}} an E8E9 {{transform}} {{to improve the}} compression of x86 code typically found in [...]exe and [...]dll files. An E8E9 transform scans for CALL and JMP instructions (opcodes E8 and E9 hex) and replaces their relative <b>addresses</b> with <b>absolute</b> <b>addresses.</b> Then it inserts code into the PCOMP section to perform the inverse transform.|$|R
50|$|The 8061 had a 240-byte {{internal}} register file, from address 0010H to 00FFH.I/O addresses {{were from}} 0002H to 000FH. Throughout the 8061 family, address 0000H {{was reserved for}} a constant ZERO register. This permitted use of relative <b>addressing</b> to access <b>absolute</b> <b>addresses.</b> The stack pointer was at 00010H.8061 could address 64K of memory.Reset was to 2000H.Interrupt vectors were at 2010H.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{integrated}} photonics is a {{key technology}} in quantum information processing (QIP) but achieving all-optical buses for quantum networks with efficient integration of single photon emitters remains a challenge. Photonic crystals and cavities are good candidates but do not tackle how to effectively address a nanoscale emitter. Using a nanowire nanowaveguide, we realise an hybrid nanodevice which locally excites a single photon source (SPS). The nanowire acts as a passive or active sub-wavelength waveguide to excite the quantum emitter. Our results show that localised excitation of a SPS is possible and is compared with free-space excitation.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{spreadsheets}} {{has shown that}} a visual representation of a two-dimensional array greatly facilitates solving certain problems. However, spreadsheets are not a general-purpose programming environment and are not suited to many problems that might naturally be solved using multi-dimensional arrays. Furthermore, spreadsheets employ a textual notation for cell references in formulas. This notation, which adds to the programmerâs burden by distinguishing relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing,</b> can be dificult to understand and is error-prone even for the most experienced users. In this paper we present a user-interface for multi-dimensional arrays within Formulate, a form-based visual programming language. This implementation avoids textual array notation and supports the application of formulas to logical regions of an array, rather than just to individual elements. 1...|$|E
40|$|The J-Machine {{network is}} a 3 -D mesh {{employing}} wormhole routing and virtual channels to provide two network priorities. Each network channel is 9 bits wide and operates at 32 MHz. Each J-Machine node contains network routers that guide messages between the six bidirectional channels incident on each node, {{and a network}} interface that handles messages originating or terminating at the node. The router is fully synchronous, uses <b>absolute</b> <b>addressing,</b> and performs dimension-order routing. A novel pad design permits the bidirectional channels to reverse direction each cycle without danger of conduction overlap. 1. 0 Introduction The J-Machine network is a 3 -D mesh that provides a low latency communication fabric for up to 64 K Message Driven Processor nodes. An MDP node is connected to each of its six nearest neighbors by a bidirectional channel transmitting data at 36 MB/sec. All message routing and delivery is performed autonomously by the network logic, requiring no processor intervention. [...] ...|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} engineering and low-level programming (such as assembly language), an offset usually denotes {{the number of}} address locations added to a base address {{in order to get}} to a specific <b>absolute</b> <b>address.</b> In this (original) meaning of offset, only the basic address unit, usually the 8-bit byte, is used to specify the offset's size. In this context an offset is sometimes called a relative address.|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{of the call}} stack mechanism is the increased cost of a procedure call and its matching return. The extra cost includes incrementing and decrementing the stack pointer (and, in some architectures, checking for stack overflow), and accessing the local variables and parameters by frame-relative <b>addresses,</b> instead of <b>absolute</b> <b>addresses.</b> The cost may be realized in increased execution time, or increased processor complexity, or both.|$|R
