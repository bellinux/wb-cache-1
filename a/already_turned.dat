5|$|At {{the time}} of his last stand against the Lancastrians, Richard was a widower without a {{legitimate}} son. After his son's death, he had initially named his nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick, Clarence's young son and the nephew of Queen Anne Neville, as his heir. After Anne's death, however, Richard named another nephew, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, the son of his elder sister Elizabeth. However, he was also negotiating with John II of Portugal to marry his sister, Joanna, a pious young woman who had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> down several suitors because of her preference for the religious life.|$|E
5|$|In July 1915, the Truxtun {{was on its}} way to Alaska when {{it broke}} down and was unable to {{continue}} its mission. Initially, the blame fell on Callaghan, who had apparently ordered incorrect parts for the condenser. He was suspended from duty and ordered to appear before a court-martial. Subsequent investigation, however, found that another man was responsible for the error and Callaghan received a full acquittal and was reinstated. A few months later, he was appointed as commanding officer of the Truxtun, but the stress of his trial appeared to have left its mark—at the age of 25 years, his hair had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> gray.|$|E
5|$|That season, McNichol {{scored a}} hat-trick against {{eventual}} runners-up Reading, which {{caught the eye}} of manager Ted Drake. Shortly before the next season started, he became Drake's first signing for his new club, Chelsea, at a fee of £12,000 plus the player Jimmy Leadbetter, a club record fee received for Albion. He had scored 39 goals in all competitions from 165 appearances. Although scouts from bigger clubs had been watching the player since soon after his arrival at the club he had apparently <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> down moves to Manchester City, Everton and Huddersfield Town Brighton's supporters were disappointed, seeing his sale as a backward step.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 10 May, {{elements}} of the VC 1st Regiment attacked Ngok Tavak, and they successfully overran much of the outpost. By dawn, the 11th MSF Company was devastated, but they later received reinforcements which {{came in the form of}} the 12th Mobile Strike Force Company. Despite having received assurances that further reinforcements would arrive to relieve the outpost, the commander of the 11th MSF Company decided to evacuate his troops and move towards Khâm Đức. By that time, however, the VC 1st Regiment had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> their attention to the main target at Khâm Đức, and they only left behind some local force units to destroy allied reinforcements. Meanwhile, elements of the Americal Division had been airlifted into Khâm Đức as part of Operation Golden Valley, to bolster the strength of the Special Forces Camp there. On the morning of 11 May, the North Vietnamese 2nd Division surrounded Khâm Đức, and they gradually forced United States-led forces into their bases after several outposts were overrun. Westmoreland then ordered Khâm Đức to be evacuated, so the 834th Air Division was told to make an all-out effort to extract all the people in Khâm Đức, both military and civilian. By the time the evacuation was completed, nine U.S. military aircraft had been shot down, including two C-130s. On 12 May, the North Vietnamese were in complete control of Khâm Đức.|$|E

25|$|Trailing the Wildcats 6-0 {{and having}} <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> {{the ball over}} on downs with two minutes to play, Ohio State threw an {{interception}} on what was apparently the last play of the game, but a penalty gave the Buckeyes an extra play after time had expired. That too was stopped and again negated by penalty. The Bucks then tied the game on a pass, {{only to have the}} try for extra point blocked. Again a penalty negated the play, and on the fourth extra play of the game the Buckeyes made the conversion and won 7-6.|$|E

In October 1568, he was again called to lead the 5000-strong Fifth Army, made up of troops from Lan Na and Kengtung, to put down rebellions in southern Siam and Lan Xang. Southern Siam's rebellion was put down in August 1569 but Lan Xang remained at large. Like in 1565, his army {{participated in the}} 1569 invasion of Lan Xang.|$|E

25|$|At around 23.40 large {{ships were}} again sighted and Allen {{attempted}} to challenge. Before {{he could do}} so, the German battleship SMS Westfalen sent her own recognition signal and then turned on searchlights. Broke attempted to fire torpedoes, but the range was very short, {{in the region of}} 150 yards, and the German ship opened fire first. The effect was devastating so that within a couple of minutes 50 crew were killed and another 30 injured, disabling the guns and preventing any effective activity on deck. The helmsman was killed at the wheel, and as he died his body turned the wheel causing the ship to turn to port and ram Sparrowhawk. Both ships had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> to port from line ahead to line abreast to fire torpedoes.|$|E
25|$|Ørsted Pedersen {{was born}} in Osted, near Roskilde, on the Danish island of Zealand, {{the son of a}} church organist. As a child, Ørsted Pedersen played piano, but from the age of 13, he started {{learning}} to play upright bass and at the age of 14, while studying, he began his professional jazz career in Denmark with his first band, Jazzkvintet 60 (Danish for 'Jazz Quintet 60'). By the age of fifteen, he had the ability to accompany leading musicians at nightclubs, working regularly at Copenhagen's Jazzhus Montmartre, after his debut there on New Year's Eve 1961, when he was only 15. When seventeen, he had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> down an offer to join the Count Basie orchestra, mainly because he was too young to get legal permission to live and work as a musician in the United States.|$|E
500|$|This {{successful}} {{collaboration with}} Cartier and Kneale resulted, four years later, in him once again being offered {{the role of}} Professor Bernard Quatermass for the pair's third serial in the series, Quatermass and the Pit, although on this occasion another actor [...] Alec Clunes [...] had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> them down. This time Morell accepted the part, and is regarded by several critics as having provided the definitive interpretation of the character. Morell personally found that in later years it was the role {{for which he was}} most often remembered by members of the public.|$|E

500|$|After the {{two novels}} were published, Disraeli {{declared}} that he would [...] "write no more about myself". He had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> his attention to politics in 1832, during the great crisis over the Reform Bill. He contributed to an anti-Whig pamphlet edited by John Wilson Croker and published by Murray entitled England and France: or a cure for Ministerial Gallomania. The choice of a Tory publication was regarded as strange by Disraeli's friends and relatives, who thought him more of a Radical. Indeed, he had objected to Murray about Croker's inserting [...] "high Tory" [...] sentiment: Disraeli remarked, [...] "it is quite impossible that anything adverse to the general measure of Reform can issue from my pen." [...] Moreover, at the time Gallomania was published, Disraeli was electioneering in High Wycombe in the Radical interest.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{depictions of}} the Battle of Issus are few. Battle of Issus, a fresco by Philoxenus of Eretria, is {{probably}} the first such. It was painted sometime around 310BC for Cassander (c. 350–297BC), {{who was one of}} Alexander the Great's successors. Alexander and Darius – each within a lance's length of the other – are pictured among a wild fray of mounted and downed soldiers. While Alexander maintains an aura of unshaken confidence, fear is etched in Darius' face, and his charioteer has <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> to rein his horses and escape. Roman author and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder claimed that Philoxenus' portrayal of the battle was [...] "inferior to none". Some modern critics posit that Battle of Issus might not have been the work of Philoxenus, but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece, she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the Temple of Peace during the time of Vespasian.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Bagnères-de-Bigorre conference, Rossi had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> his {{attention}} toward the astrophysical implications of cosmic ray phenomena, particularly extensive air showers. [...] After Rossi's recognition, in Eritrea, that these events exist, they were extensively studied by Pierre Auger, and by Williams. [...] At this time, the extremely fast response of the newly developed scintillation counters offered a new way to study the structure of air showers. [...] To do this, Rossi enlisted his student, George W. Clark, who completed a PhD in 1952, and Piero Bassi, who was a visitor from the University of Padua. [...] Because solid scintillating material was unavailable, they decided to use terphenyl dissolved in benzine, which is an efficient liquid scintillator. [...] With the aid of three counters deployed {{on the roof of the}} MIT Physics building during the winter of 1952/53, they found that shower particles arrived within only one or two meters of a disk, which travels at nearly the speed of light in the direction of the shower axis.|$|E
500|$|By 1916, Hand {{realized}} that the Progressive Party had no future, as the liberal policies of the Democratic government were making much of its program redundant. Roosevelt's decision not {{to stand in the}} 1916 presidential election dealt the party its death blow. Hand had <b>already</b> <b>turned</b> to an alternative political outlet in Herbert Croly's The New Republic, a liberal magazine which he had helped launch in 1914. Hand wrote a series of unsigned articles for the magazine on issues of social reform and judicial power; his only signed article was [...] "The Hope of the Minimum Wage", published in November 1916, which called for laws to protect the underprivileged. Often attending staff dinners and meetings, Hand became a close friend of the gifted young editor Walter Lippmann. The outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 had coincided with the founding of the magazine, whose pages often debated the events in Europe. The New Republic adopted a cautiously sympathetic stance towards the Allies, which Hand supported wholeheartedly. After the United States entered the war in 1917, Hand considered leaving the bench to assist the war effort. Several possible war-related positions were suggested to him. Nothing came of them, aside from his chairing a committee on intellectual property law that suggested treaty amendments for the Paris Peace Conference.|$|E
