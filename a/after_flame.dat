6000|$|Well, {{we were to}} {{have the}} miracles at all events {{and we were in}} a perfect state of mind to receive them. There were more of us every day, and we thought highly even of our friend's odd jobs and pot-boilers. The Beacon had had no successor, but he found some quiet comers and stray chances. Perpetually poking the fire and looking out of the window, he was {{certainly}} not a monster of facility, but he was, thanks perhaps to a certain method in that madness, a monster of certainty. It wasn't every one however who knew him for this: many editors printed him but once. He was getting a small reputation as a man it was well to have the first time; he created obscure apprehensions as to what might happen the second. He was good for making an impression, but no one seemed exactly to know what the impression was good for when made. The reason was simply that they had not seen yet The Major Key that fiery-hearted rose as to which we watched in private the formation of petal after petal and flame <b>after</b> <b>flame.</b> Nothing mattered but this, for it had already elicited a splendid bid, much talked about in Mrs. High-more's drawing-room, where at this point my reminiscences grow particularly thick. Her roses bloomed all the year and her sociability increased with her row of prizes. We had an idea that we [...] "met every one" [...] there--so we naturally thought when we met each other. Between our hostess and Ray Limbert flourished the happiest relation, the only cloud on which was that her husband eyed him rather askance. When he was called clever this personage wanted to know what he had to [...] "show;" [...] and it was certain that he showed nothing that could compare with Jane Highmore. Mr. Highmore took his stand on accomplished work and, turning up his coat-tails, warmed his rear with a good conscience at the neat bookcase in which the generations of triplets were chronologically arranged. The harmony between his companions rested on the fact that, as I have already hinted, each would have liked so much to be the other. Limbert couldn't but have a feeling about a woman who in addition to being the best creature and her sister's backer would have made, could she have condescended, such a success with the Beacon. On the other hand Mrs. Highmore used freely to say: [...] "Do you know, he'll do exactly the thing that I want to do? I shall never do it myself, but he'll do it instead. Yes, he'll do my thing, and I shall hate him for it--the wretch." [...] Hating him was her pleasant humour, for the wretch was personally to her taste.|$|E

40|$|The dissociative {{adsorption}} of {{ethylene glycol}} (EG) on Pt(1 0 0) electrode surface cooled in air <b>after</b> <b>flame</b> annealing was investigated by using programmed potential step technique and in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The stable adsorbates derived from EG dissociative adsorption on Pt(1 0 0) {{were determined by}} in situ FTIR spectroscopy as linear- and bridge-bonded CO. The quantitative results demonstrated that the average rate of dissociative adsorption of EG on Pt(I 0 0) surface varies with electrode potential, yielding a volcano-type distribution with a maximum value located near 0. 10 V versus SCE. From the variation of the quantity of CO adsorbates generated in EG dissociative adsorption with the adsorption time t(ad), the initial rate (v(i)) of this surface reaction was evaluated quantitatively. The maximum value of v(i) has been determined to be 2. 64 x 10 (- 11) mol cm(- 2) s(- 1) in a solution containing 2 x 10 (- 3) mol L- 1 EG. The influence of the surface structure of Pt(1 0 0) electrode obtained by different pretreatment {{as well as of}} the specific adsorption of (bi) sulfate anions on the kinetics of EG dissociative adsorption has been also investigated and discussed. In comparison with a Pt(I 0 0) surface cooled in air atmosphere <b>after</b> <b>flame</b> treatment, the Pt(1 0 0) surface cooled in an Ar-H, stream or subjected to a treatment of fast potential cycling decreased significantly the initial rate v(i) of EG dissociative adsorption. Similar effect was also observed for the specific adsorption of (bi) sulfate anions. However, the maximum attainable coverage (theta(DA) (S)) of adsorbates derived from EG dissociative adsorption is not affected either by the surface structure of Pt(1 0 0) or by (bi) sulfate anions adsorption.

40|$|The {{combustion}} of flammable {{material in}} a sealed chamber invariably leads to an initial pressure rise in the volume. The pressure rise {{is due to the}} increase in the total number of gaseous moles (condensed fuel plus chamber oxygen combining to form gaseous carbon dioxide and water vapor) and, most importantly, the temperature rise of the gas in the chamber. Though the rise in temperature and pressure would reduce with time <b>after</b> <b>flame</b> extinguishment due to the absorption of heat by the walls and contents of the sealed spacecraft, the initial pressure rise from a fire, if large enough, could lead to a vehicle over-pressure and the release of gas through the pressure relief valve. This paper presents a simple lumped-parameter model of the pressure rise {{in a sealed}} chamber resulting from the heat release during combustion. The transient model considers the increase in gaseous moles due to combustion, and heat transfer to the chamber walls by convection and radiation and to the fuel-sample holder by conduction, {{as a function of the}} burning rate of the material. The results of the model are compared to the pressure rise in an experimental chamber during flame spread tests as well as to the pressure falloff <b>after</b> <b>flame</b> extinguishment. The experiments involve flame spread over thin solid fuel samples. Estimates of the heat release rate profiles for input to the model come from the assumed stoichiometric burning of the fuel along with the observed flame spread behavior. The sensitivity of the model to predict maximum chamber pressure is determined with respect to the uncertainties in input parameters. Model predictions are also presented for the pressure profile anticipated in the Fire Safety- 1 experiment, a material flammability and fire safety experiment proposed for the European Space Agency (ESA) Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV). Computations are done for a range of scenarios including various initial pressures and sample sizes. Based on these results, various mitigation approaches are suggested to prevent vehicle over-pressurization and help guide the definition of the space experiment...|$|E

40|$|Flame {{treatments}} on {{polymeric materials}} improve {{surface free energy}} (SFE) and consequently the wettability and adhesion of coatings, metallizations, varnish and glues. In this paper, using a statistical methodological approach based on DoE technique and multivariate analysis of flame treatment process parameters, a mathematical model of SFE and wettability is obtained. Contact angle experimental technique was applied to measure the improvement of wettability and SFE. In order to study the oxygen diffusion within the polymer, morphological variation and change of its structure, analyses of treated surface sample were carried out on micro and nano scales. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, performed before and <b>after</b> <b>flame</b> treatment, showed the O-radical group improvement on a polymeric surface.

40|$|Abstract. Flame {{retardant}} fabrics {{have been}} broadly used for protective clothing, which have strictly requirements on both flame retardancy and thermal protection. Usually, domestic laundering {{will be carried}} out frequently to clean these protective garments. However, little research on the performance durability of this type of fabrics after domestic laundering has been reported. This paper selected fabrics of 8 types of cotton and its blend fibers, which were treated with flame retardants Pyrovatex CP, Proban, CFR- 201, SCJ- 968 respectively. The damaged length, <b>after</b> <b>flame</b> time, after glow time, TPP value, thermal resistance value, weight, thickness, air permeability and water vapor permeability (WVP) of the samples were measured before and after 15 cycles domestic laundering cycles. Results show that the flame retardancy of the 8 fabrics reduce with launderings as measured by the increase in damaged length and after glow time. The TPP increase probably resulted from the increase in the thickness and thermal resistance of the finished fabrics. Domestic laundering resulted in only a slight change in the comfort properties of the fabrics. ...|$|E

A sample of unroasted material was included for each grain. Evaluation as non-ruminant feeds was done using a rooster bioassay. For ruminants, DM and crude protein degradation in the rumen and intestinal digestibility were estimated. Roasting {{had little effect on}} any non-ruminant estimate of utilization but it decreased (P< 0. 05) effective rumen degradation and rumen degradation rates of DM and crude protein for all grains, although the effect was least for maize. Total tract digestibility in ruminants was not affected by roasting, except for oats and wheat, which was reduced at the highest level of roasting. For ruminant diets, heat treatment by roasting of wheat and barley may be beneficial, resulting in a slower release of nutrients in the rumen and allowing more DM and crude protein to escape degradation in the rumen and be digested in the small intestine. ...|$|E
