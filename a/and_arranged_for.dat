He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as possible so that he could take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Hazelton had {{a studio}} {{at the old}} Harcourt Building in Boston in 1904, when a severe fire burned the life's work of several artists {{including}} Hazelton, Joseph DeCamp, and William M. Paxton. In the aftermath, a group of artists planned for a new building, which became Fenway Studios (30 Ipswich Street). Hazelton was among the initial group of artists that signed up, <b>and</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>for</b> studio 304. From 1906 to 1940, she had a studio at Fenway.|$|E

5|$|The {{school is}} known for its annual musicals, which often sell out. The school also reaches out to {{professionals}} who volunteer their time; the assistant director at the Studio Theater (also the son of Frances G. Wills) ran a workshop on proper casting and auditions for the students <b>and</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>for</b> Children of Eden creator Stephen Schwartz to visit the school during its 2002 production of his musical.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was {{travelling}} in England.

5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 <b>and</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>for</b> Plasmodium falciparum {{cases to}} be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} he joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia, Đurišić was very {{critical}} of Mihailović's leadership, and argued strongly for all the remaining Chetnik troops {{to move to the}} area of the Ljubljana Gap in modern-day Slovenia. At this point Ostojić and Baćović were also questioning Mihailović's plans. When Mihailović remained unconvinced, Đurišić decided to move to the Ljubljana Gap independent of Mihailović, <b>and</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>for</b> Dimitrije Ljotić's forces already in the Ljubljana Gap to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. When he left Mihailović, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić and the Chetnik detachments commanded by Ostojić and Baćović as well as a large number of refugees.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, {{after four}} years in the workhouse, Merrick {{contacted}} a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr agreed <b>and</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>for</b> a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man. After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on Whitechapel Road which was rented by showman Tom Norman. Norman's shop, directly {{across the street from the}} London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be examined and photographed. Soon after Merrick's visits to the hospital, Tom Norman's shop was closed by the police, and Merrick's managers sent him to tour in Europe.|$|E

There, Tang mentored younger artists and informed them about artistic developments {{in other parts of the}} world.

5|$|In April 1951, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted {{orders for}} MacArthur authorizing nuclear attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese {{launched}} airstrikes originating from there against his forces. The next day Truman {{met with the}} chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, <b>and</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>for</b> the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control. Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Magdalen Scholarship he had a scholarship from Hampshire County Council worth £50 a year. After arriving he made a favourable impression on Sir Herbert Warren, the President of Magdalen College, who upgraded the exhibition to a Demyship of £80 a year <b>and</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>for</b> the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to give Denning a £30 a year scholarship. Despite military training {{in the early morning}} and evening, Denning worked hard at his studies, and obtained a First in Mathematical Moderations, the first half of his mathematics degree, in June 1917.|$|E

Some of these recordings on which Waldron played were released under his name. He also wrote scores for modern ballet in the 1950s and started writing film scores in the following decade. His writing for the film The Cool World (released in 1964) was described in The Oxford Companion to Jazz {{as one of the}} first attempts to stress improvisation rather than composition in a jazz-based film score.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{reported}} that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires by train with tango singer Agustín Magaldi. However, biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser maintain {{that this is}} unlikely, {{as there is no}} record of the married Magaldi performing in Junín in 1934 (and, even if he had, he usually traveled with his wife). Eva's sisters maintain that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires with their mother. The sisters also claim that Doña Juana accompanied her daughter to an audition at a radio station <b>and</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>for</b> Eva to live with the Bustamante family, who were friends of the Duarte family. While the method of Eva's escape from her bleak provincial surroundings is debated, she did begin a new life in Buenos Aires.|$|E
