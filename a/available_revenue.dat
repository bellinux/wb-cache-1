40|$|This paper simulates {{alternative}} {{distributions of}} general purpose state aid to local governments under {{different combinations of}} criteria: tax capacity, effort, and revenue needs. Revenue needs are based on Tobit estimates {{of the costs of}} providing average levels of 16 categories of services. Segmenting the sample into high and low population jurisdictions provided a more realistic set of cost estimates. <b>Available</b> <b>revenues</b> or capacity are determined by multiplying each jurisdiction's tax bases by standard tax rates. A Need-Capacity gap, the difference between needed <b>revenues</b> and <b>available</b> <b>revenues,</b> is used as a needs-based distribution strategy for general purpose aid. Finally an effort gap, based on above average tax efforts was added to the Need-Capacity gap to define a Need-Capacity-Effort strategy.

50|$|By the mid-seventeenth century Ottoman Hungary {{contained}} approximately 130 fortresses {{of varying}} size and strength, ranging from small castles {{of less than}} a hundred men to major strongholds with garrisons in the thousands. The most heavily manned were those on the border, while interior forts often contained no more than a token garrison. During the seventeenth century, Buda's garrison ranged from a low of 2,361 in the peaceful years after Zsitvatorok to a high of 5,697 during the third quarter of the century when war with the Habsburgs again resumed. By the 1660s, the total number of men serving in Hungarian garrisons reached as high as 24,000, split between some 17,450 local troops and 6,500 janissaries. These forces were supplemented by local timariots as well as the private armies of Ottoman governors. These numbers, however, constitute wartime levels. During peacetime the garrison sizes would frequently be reduced in order to cut costs. While {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century the Hungarian fortress network was financially self-sufficient, and the local governors were even able to remit surplus revenue to Istanbul, this had deteriorated by the seventeenth century such that the administrative border of the province of Buda needed to be extended south of the Danube in order to increase its <b>available</b> <b>revenue.</b> Nevertheless, the Ottoman financial system was in better shape than that of the Habsburgs, who continually struggled to raise the revenue needed to maintain their own defense network.|$|E
30|$|Probably not {{far from}} this {{alternative}} interpretation provided by Baumol (2012), the second relevant literature strand rests on Bowen (1980) and his insights with respect to drivers of education costs, in particular, higher education costs. Bowen argues that <b>available</b> <b>revenues</b> are the only constraint on how much to spend on education. In his view, schools maximize ‘education excellence, prestige and influence’, only facing a revenue constraint. To provide and empirical support for his theory, Bowel points at both the increase in disposable income {{and the increase in}} education costs experienced by the developed countries over the last decades (see also Kane, 1999; Fernandez and Rogerson, 2001; Archibald and Feldman, 2008). It should be noted however that this second explanation of raising education cost looks less appealing from a theoretical perspective, resting mainly on available empirical evidence at that time.|$|R

Perhaps the most significant change in school issues, however, has been a gradual shift from proposals for a simple increase in educational programs to policies that imply a major redistribution of school resources.

40|$|Economic supply {{networks}} can {{be viewed}} as complex systems composed of multiple, independent, interacting agents. Agents (companies) form relationships with one another by trading goods for other goods, services, or money. This paper presents a model for supply networks composed of a fixed number of discrete tiers of companies. Each company has mutable parameters (product quality, information integrity, profit sharing) that determine specific aspects of the company’s behavior. After describing the model we apply it to investigate the global behavior of multi–tiered supply networks. In particular we are interested in how information integrity and product quality change under various circumstances, and how these parameters influence and are influenced by the global structure of a supply network. Preliminary experiments concentrated on finding parameter values that encouraged stability and found complex relationships among <b>available</b> <b>revenue,</b> profit sharing by individual companies, and initial wealth of new companies. Further investigations have revealed a few subtle trends, but they have emphasized the difficulty in finding more precise, yet globally applicable, data analysis techniques...|$|E

The key process that the analysis of power will help to explain is the division of the <b>available</b> <b>revenue</b> stream flowing up the chain from the buyer's customers.

I begin {{with a discussion of}} Dynamic Pricing models, and select a mixed integer programming formulation as most applicable to the available systems and data of the target company. Cost formulations are built through a detailed analysis of current cost allocations within the company and actual costs when <b>available.</b> <b>Revenue</b> and price elasticity models are built from existing formulations. The continuous functions are then discretized through piece-wise approximations and input into a mixed integer program using production and pricing as the decision variables. The results were not entirely conclusive as sensitivity around the base values, particularly the price elasticity value, can create very different price path solutions. Greater stability is achieved through tightening the price ranges, but the suggested policy of always charging the maximum allowable price is not practical within the company's existing policies. For actual implementation, a much more thorough understanding of the price elasticity mechanism would be required. by William M. Driegert. Thesis (M.

40|$|The {{financing}} {{of higher education}} throughout the world has seen {{dramatic changes in the}} last decades of the 20 th and {{the first decade of the}} 21 st centuries. 1 In the main, these changes in financing are responses to a worldwide phenomenon of higher educational costs tending to rise at rates considerably in excess of the corresponding rates of increase of <b>available</b> <b>revenues,</b> especially those revenues that are dependent on taxation. The consequence in most of the world has been a shortage of revenue to accommodate both the increasing costs of instruction and research as well as (and exacerbated by) the increasing revenue needs of rising enrollments. These diverging trajectories—of very rapidly increasing resource needs and more static or even faltering revenues from state budgets—must, in turn, be met by solutions either (or both) on the cost side or on the revenue side. The cost-revenue squeeze itself as well as some of the so-called solutions thereto can have a deleterious impact on both quality and capacity of universities and other institutions of postsecondary education and thus on the goal in virtually all countries to expand higher educational participation and accessibility.
