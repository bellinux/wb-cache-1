5|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals.

The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
