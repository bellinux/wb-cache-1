2500|$|Each piston transmits power {{directly}} through a connecting rod (Main rod in the US) and a crankpin (Wristpin in the US) on the driving wheel (Main {{driver in the}} US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the steam chest is controlled {{through a set of}} rods and linkages called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow reversing the engine, <b>adjusting</b> <b>valve</b> travel and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a steam port, [...] "cutting off" [...] admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn reduces fuel and water consumption. The reversing lever (Johnson bar in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off therefore performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile – maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{numerical}} investigation aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the real-time control RTC of valves in reducing leakage in water supply networks. The investigation was carried out considering the head-driven simulation of a network under successive steady conditions. A literature bench-test case-study was used for the simulations enabling the comparison with other methodologies proposed by previous writers and based on the use of optimization algorithms. The performance of RTC was evaluated in terms of pressure and leakage reduction with respect to uncontrolled conditions in the network. Further elaborations showed the better flexibility of RTC, with respect to optimization algorithms, in <b>adjusting</b> <b>valve</b> regulation under variable daily water demand conditions...|$|E
40|$|Reciprocating-piston devices {{can be used}} as high-efficiency {{compressors}} and/or expanders. With {{an optimal}} valve design and by carefully <b>adjusting</b> <b>valve</b> timing, pressure losses during intake and exhaust can be largely reduced. The main loss mechanism in reciprocating devices is then the thermal irreversibility due to the unsteady heat transfer between the compressed/expanded gas and the surrounding cylinder walls. In this paper, pressure, volume and temperature measurements in a piston-cylinder crankshaft driven gas spring are compared to numerical results. The experimental apparatus experiences mass leakage while the CFD code predicts heat transfer in an ideal closed gas spring. Comparison of experimental and numerical results allows one to better understand the loss mechanisms in play. Heat and mass losses in the experiment are decoupled and the system losses are calculated over a range of frequencies. As expected, compression and expansion approach adiabatic processes for higher frequencies, resulting in higher efficiency. The objective {{of this study is to}} observe and explain the discrepancies obtained between the computational and experimental results and to propose further steps to improve the analysis of the loss mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|A circuit generates {{an analog}} voltage {{proportional}} to an angle, {{in response to}} two sinusoidal input voltages having magnitudes proportional to the sine and cosine of the angle, respectively. That is to say, given input voltages proportional to sin(Omega(t)) sin(Theta) and sin(Omega(t)) cos(Theta) [where Theta denotes the angle, mega denotes 2 (pi) x a carrier frequency, and t denotes time], the circuit generates a steady voltage proportional to Theta. The output voltage varies continuously from its minimum to its maximum value as Theta varies from - 180 deg to 180 deg. While the circuit could accept input modulated sine and cosine signals from any source, {{it must be noted}} that such signals are typical of the outputs of shaft-angle resolvers in electromagnetic actuators used to measure and control shaft angles for diverse purposes like aiming scientific instruments and <b>adjusting</b> <b>valve</b> openings. In effect, the circuit is an analog computer that calculates the arctangent of the ratio between the sine and cosine signals. The full-circle angular range of this arctangent circuit stands in contrast to the range of prior analog arctangent circuits, which is from slightly greater than - 90 deg to slightly less than + 90 deg. Moreover, for applications in which continuous variation of output is preferred to discrete increments of output, this circuit offers a clear advantage over resolver- to-digital integrated circuits...|$|E

The features of such task are defined by plenty of control systems structural parameters, complication of quality indices formalization and calculation, the systems models high order. The greatest difficulty of the control system synthesis is optimization models and methods design.

The ECU can also sense {{when there is a}} high amount of NOx and SOx (Sulfur oxide) emission and change the timing to make the Exhaust gas hotter or cooler. Since the engine is run electronically and not mechanically, camless engines can be updated to meet new emission regulations without mechanical modifications.|$|R

The influence of outdoor temperature could be compensated by modulating fuel consumptions, but the influences of solar radiation and indoor heat gains could not be ignored. Then, one-week operational states were simulated with actual meteorological data exerted and validated. And then, different control strategies were implemented and the one-week operational situations were simulated, respectively. The smallest indoor temperature variations could be achieved if the fuel, the primary piping network and radiator water flow rates were jointly controlled. However, the least amount of energy was consumed if the fuel consumption was controlled in terms of boiler supply temperature jointly with primary piping network flow rate controlled in terms of indoor temperature...|$|R
