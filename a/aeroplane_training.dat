5000|$|A brand's [...] "extendibility" [...] {{depends on}} how strong consumer's {{associations}} are to the brand's values and goals. Ralph Lauren's Polo brand successfully extended from clothing to home furnishings such as bedding and towels. Both clothing and bedding are made of linen and fulfill a similar consumer function of comfort and hominess. Arm & Hammer leveraged its brand equity from basic baking soda into the oral care and laundry care categories. By emphasizing its key attributes, the cleaning and deodorizing properties of its core product, Arm & Hammer was able to leverage those attributes into new categories with success. Another example is Virgin Group, which was initially a record label that has extended its brand successfully many times; from transportation (<b>aeroplanes,</b> <b>trains)</b> to games stores and video stores such as Virgin Megastores.|$|R

2500|$|The TGV {{opened to}} the public between Paris and Lyon on 27 September 1981. Contrary to its earlier fast services, SNCF {{intended}} TGV service for all types of passengers, with the same initial ticket price as trains on the parallel conventional line. To counteract the popular misconception that the TGV would be a premium service for business travellers, SNCF started a major publicity campaign focusing on the speed, frequency, reservation policy, normal price, and broad accessibility of the service. This commitment to a democratised TGV service was enhanced in the Mitterrand era with the promotional slogan [...] "Progress means nothing unless it is shared by all". The TGV was considerably faster (in terms of door to door travel time) than normal <b>trains,</b> cars, or <b>aeroplanes.</b> The <b>trains</b> became widely popular, the public welcoming fast and practical travel.|$|R
25|$|Some smaller {{vehicles}} were also produced alongside model track workers, passengers, station staff and other O scale track side accessories (Meccano Dinky 1934 p.332). All {{of these early}} cars were inaccurate representations and had die-cast metal bodies, chassis and wheels with rubber tyres. By August 1935 there were around 200 different products in the Dinky Toys range which included die-cast ships, <b>aeroplanes</b> and small <b>trains.</b> Dinky Toys model cars were available individually in trade packs of 6 cars per pack.

5000|$|English {{was born}} in Bicester, Oxfordshire in 1941, {{the son of an}} RAF flying officer. His early {{childhood}} was spent moving around England with long holidays spent in the South West of Ireland where his mother came from. Throughout his childhood, he developed a fascination with drawing, often technical subjects such as <b>aeroplanes</b> and <b>trains</b> both of which remained a fascination throughout his life. His 'Machine Paintings' in the late 1970s and 1980s are a testament to this. In 1962 he entered Ealing College of Art where he took Roy Ascott's radical Groundcourse which had a major impact on his thinking. His work included commissioned paintings for both private individuals and public organisations, advertising art for companies such as Porsche and stamp series for the Royal Mail such as the 'British Buses' or 'British Motorcycles' [...] He lived in London with his wife, Jaki, and continued to work right up until his death in 2009 following a long illness.|$|R

40|$|CASPER Project Deliverable no. D 4. 6 (Merged from D 4. 2, D 4. 3 and D 4. 5). The {{purpose of}} this report was to provide {{applications}} and research results {{for the improvement of}} child protection systems. As well as considering the effect any CRS improvements would have on policies or any legislation that would need to be created or improved. The issue of cost and subsidies for child restraints is considered. Research on the effectiveness of interventions is reported and recommendations on future policies are made. Results from the sociological survey carried out as part of the CASPER project proved to be an extremely valuable resource as many of the proposed solutions are based on information gathered in the survey. As child safety is of global importance the CASPER project gathered data relevant to child safety laws and regulations from a large array of countries this data is displayed in this report. Recent statistics show that a large percentage of CRS are misused, this project aims to reduce this figure by implementing innovative designs and creating new legislation. To list some of the ways CRS are being misused: they are being incorrectly installed i. e. putting a rearward facing device in a forward facing position or incorrectly fastening the seatbelt to the device. Parents {{play a key role in}} child safety and this is researched in great depth within this project. Research was carried out in to ways of preventing these types of CRS misuse as well as researching other problems with CRS such as the issue with transporting children with disabilities. The proposed solutions are presented alongside any issues that might occur. One of the key areas of CRS improvement is Car-to-CRS communication, this ties in with integrated CRS as the idea is to make CRS fully homologated for the car. ISOFIX involves having anchors built into the car which CRS can fix onto. The next step is to develop Car-to-CRS communication so that the CRS can benefit from the cars safety features. Car manufacturers can also build CRS directly into the car creating integrated CRS which are also considered in this document. At the moment CRS are predominantly used in cars, however they could also be used in <b>aeroplanes,</b> <b>trains</b> and busses. Although they would have to be optimised for each of the different situations, for example the CRS for aeroplanes would focus more on preventing injuries caused by turbulence than crashing. During this project the CASPER consortium investigated and evaluated the systems which are currently available or currently being developed. This was done by analysing the demands and applications in terms of research, development and approval of CRS for child protection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a review on {{the applicability of}} scheduling techniques in practice. Both the operations research and the artificial intelligence research communities have produced a number of reports on the applicability of techniques, often in isolation from each other, although the problems encountered seem largely similar in each case.

40|$|Background: Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{can occur}} in SCUBA divers. DCS is treated with oxygen, preferably given under hyperbaric conditions. Although Paris (France) is located {{at a distance from}} the sea or lakes, some injured divers require hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) in this city, sometimes within a specific time frame. Thus, this study investigated the epidemiolo-gy and outcomes of such urban divers. Aim: We conducted an observational study of SCUBA divers admitted to the Raymond Poincaré Hyperbaric centre near Paris from 1993 to 2003. Mater ia ls and methods: We prospectively enrolled 69 consecutive SCUBA divers presenting DCS. Common risk factors were reported, especially <b>aeroplane</b> flight and <b>training</b> dives. Symp-toms are very often atypical (63 %) and onset time of symptoms is often too long (59 % after 2 h) due to denial of symptoms. First aid is generally inadequate, with only 23 % of victims receiving oxygen, fluid loading and aspirin together. HBOT was given for 42 (61 %) patients although their examination results were considered as normal. Conclusions: Diving pits and diving travel agencies should do more to warn divers of the need for treatment with normobaric oxygen and hydration pending HBOT. Moreover, hyperbaric physicians should better clarify HBOT indications for both symptoms of late onset and atypical presentations...|$|R
40|$|In today's life style, daily tone’s {{of goods}} and {{products}} are produced and they are carried or transported {{from one place to}} another. The journey of transportation of the products can be form a mile to 1000 's of miles. For transporting the goods or products, some source of mobile things like trucks, trolley, carriage, ship, <b>train,</b> <b>aeroplane</b> etc, are required to carry those items. Some goods weigh's some kilo's to some of the goods to tonnes which are transported as per the requirement of the user. Some of the transportation aid's are automatic like trucks, train, ship etc, while some of the transportation aid's are manual based like trolleys, carriage, rickshaws etc, which require the manual help to pull or push them over the journey of the transportation. As per today's life style time is money in some words, so time of transportation is directly proportional to the cost of products and profit gained from. Thus to achieve short time period transportation journey the carrier should be sufficiently able to provide as much as low time period, thus it should be more advance and more comfortable to the user. In present work, the focus is given on the time period, comfort, advancement, low cost, and mainly manual work is aimed to be reduced as much as possible. The model here made aims on providing automatic motion to the user with the help of some external sources so that the time of transportation can be reduced so as to increase the efficiency of carrier and to increase the profit. An attempt is made here in this work on enlargement of the space of the platform so that more and more goods can be transported at one time. But the enlargement of platform made here is portable i. e. can be increased or decreased as per the requirement of the user and quantity of the goods. Further emphasis is given on the weight of the trolley so that the motion can be executed with ease and in less time period user can perform the work. The design is validated by developing digital mock up generated in CATIA V 5 and are assembled to form a final product. Physical prototype including the structure and functionality is developed using wood and ABS materia...|$|R
40|$|The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) {{has become}} a {{familiar}} {{part of the world}} of work. And as technology in general becomes increasingly sophisticated, ICT is in most cases, a means by which organisations and employers attempt to get everyday workplace tasks carried out more efficiently, saving on time and resources, and very often replacing some of the tasks carried out by experts themselves. I used ethnographic research methods to explore firsthand how my respondents, from a diverse range of professional backgrounds, use ICT in the workplace, to either replace or enhance, the jobs that they do. My thesis draws upon the philosophy of Heidegger, by using his theoretical ideas to investigate how my respondents encounter ICT at work in various ways. The application of Heidegger's ideas to this modern context, has enabled me to develop two fundamental arguments in this thesis. My first argument is that experts have a practical grasp of the jobs they do at work. Following Heidegger, and others, I call this kind of practical understanding know-how. I argue that know-how demonstrates the kind of understanding that is fundamental for my respondents to carry out their jobs, and is one which cannot simply be extracted and programmed into or replaced by an ICT system. In fact, attempts to extract expertise, I argue, result in a deficient mode of understanding and can ultimately be inferior in carrying out the tasks at work. The second argument in this thesis also draws upon Heidegger's philosophy, but in this case focuses on the way in which my respondents communicate via mediating technology (various forms of ICT specifically used for communicating with others). Here, mediating technology seemingly replaces or enhances how workers are able to communicate with others in the workplace, by using for example, email, telephones and video conferencing, rather than communicating with them face-to-face, whereby they are bodily-present with others. I argue that contemporary advances in ICT have had varying effects, on work environments and experiences of work because of distancing in communicative processes. My arguments drawing on Heidegger's ideas, are supported by the primary data I gathered from a series of ethnographic interviews with my nine respondents and from participant observation with one respondent in particular (a commercial aeroplane pilot), who took me to an aviation base to fly on a small aeroplane, and also aboard a simulated <b>aeroplane</b> used for <b>training</b> pilots.
