40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology on the inventory control practices of a small-to-medium retailer using a proof of concept (PoC) approach. The exploratory study was conducted using a single case study of a hardware retailer stocking 5000 product lines provided by 110 active suppliers. To analyze the present mode of operation, procedural documents, semi-structured interviews and a participant observation was conducted. The basis for the proof of concept was a future mode of operation using a quasi-experimental design. Results indicate that in a small-to-medium retail environment, RFID technology could act as <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> mechanism, an enabler for locating misplaced stock, and make {{a significant contribution to}} the overall improvement of the delivery process...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate product shrinkage in the retail supply chain, and to consider how radio frequency identification (RFID) could act as a partial solution toward a retailer’s loss prevention strategy. The research uses semi-structured interviews to collect data, and a qualitative content analysis to present the results. Given that the number of RFID deployments in the retail supply chain is limited, RFID vendors, resellers, and associations are instead used to gather the current value propositions. Representatives from nine Australian RFID vendors and associations were interviewed in August and September of 2006. The results indicate that RFID can be used to minimize losses in the supply chain significantly and particularly address product authentication issues. For RFID to be adopted as <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> mechanism, however, organizations must have some visibility of what constitutes product shrinkage in their retail supply chain, and the resultant monetary losses ensuing. All too often, return on investment (ROI) calculations on the adoption of RFID in retail, is calculated only on known sources of product shrinkage, while unknown sources are unaccounted...|$|E
40|$|In Phase 2 of this {{empirical}} observation study, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} determine whether a designed loss prevention program can be optimized to minimize the loss-producing incident rate. In Phase 1, a statistically significant mathematical relationship was proposed between the incident rate and interventions implemented to reduce that rate. In this phase, the primary objective is to use the Phase 1 mathematical function to formulate a mathematical model that calculates a minimized incident rate. Evaluating 81 application rate level combinations of four intervention categories and subjecting them to management constraints accomplished this. The resulting model provides insight into the design of <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> program that will prescribe the appropriate amount of human resource time that should be assigned to specific safety-related intervention activity. The secondary objective of Phase 2 is to use actual verification data in conjunction with Phase 1 data to test the adequacy and accuracy of the optimization model. Findings indicate that the model predicts with reasonable accuracy, intuitively expected results. The verification data show that the model’s “optimum” intervention application rate was within the actual observed lower incident rate range...|$|E

40|$|Appellant Moore {{was convicted}} of {{fraudulent}} use of a credit card based on an incident {{that took place in}} a Las Vegas Wal-Mart. His suspicious behavior 2 while shopping attracted the attention of <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> <b>prevention</b> specialist. The loss prevention specialist suspected Moore might attempt to purchase goods with a credit card, and instructed a cashier to contact management if Moore presented a credit card without proper identification. Moore brought over $ 300 worth of goods to the cashier’s register and presented a credit card. When Moore could not produce identification, the cashier summoned a manager who took the credit card to the loss prevention specialist for examination. The loss prevention specialist discovered that the credit card was reported stolen and detained Moore. Moore claimed to have the cardholder’s consent to use the credit card, which was not verified. Moore was subsequently arrested and charged with one count of fraudulent use of a credit card, one count of possession of a credit card without the cardholder’s consent, and one count of burglary. A jury found him guilty on all counts, and the court adjudicated him as a small habitual criminal. Moore appealed his conviction on all counts. The Nevada Supreme Court upheld the convictions for burglary and possession of a credit card without the cardholder’s consent and the adjudication as a small habitual criminal on those counts, but reversed the conviction for fraudulent use of a credit card. The court determined that a stolen credit card must be processed and charged to constitute fraudulent use. Since Moore’s attempt to obtain goods with a stolen credit card failed, he did not actually “use” the stolen card and could not be convicted...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to predict}} the {{responses}} of ecosystems and their provided services to management practices under changing environmental conditions via ecosystem models and use tools to compare the estimated provided services between the different scenarios. However, scientific articles have covered a limited amount of estimated ecosystem services and have used tools to aggregate services that contain a significant amount of subjective aspects and that represent the final result in a non-tangible unit such as ‘points’. To resolve these matters, this study improves and applies tools to assess the environmental impact (e. g. on human health) in physical units and ecosystem services, based on monetary valuation (including ecosystem disservices with associated negative monetary values). These approaches and improvements, relevant to all ecosystems, are demonstrated using a Scots pine stand from 2010 to 2089 for a combination of three environmental change and three management scenarios. The environmental change scenarios considered interannual climate variability trends and included alterations in temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, wind speed, Particulate matter (PM) concentration and CO 2 concentration. The addressed flows/ecosystem services, including disservices, are as follows: particulate matter removal, freshwater loss, CO 2 sequestration, wood production, NOx emissions, NH 3 uptake and nitrogen pollution/removal. The monetary ecosystem service valuation yields a total average estimate of 361 - 1242 euro ha- 1 yr- 1.

40|$|For a {{sustainable}} future, we must sustainably manage {{not only the}} human/industrial system but also ecosystems. To achieve the latter goal, we need to predict the responses of ecosystems and their provided services to management practices under changing environmental conditions via ecosystem models and use tools to compare the estimated provided services between the different scenarios. However, scientific articles have covered {{a limited amount of}} estimated ecosystem services and have used tools to aggregate services that contain a significant amount of subjective aspects and that represent the final result in a non-tangible unit such as 'points'. To resolve these matters, this study quantifies the environmental impact (on human health, natural systems and natural resources) in physical units and uses an ecosystem service valuation based on monetary values (including ecosystem disservices with associated negative monetary values). More specifically, the paper also focuses on the assessment of ecosystem services related to pollutant removal/generation flows, accounting for the inflow of eutrophying nitrogen (N) when assessing the effect of N leached to groundwater. Regarding water use/provisioning, evapotranspiration is alternatively considered a disservice because it implies a loss of (potential) groundwater. These approaches and improvements, relevant to all ecosystems, are demonstrated using a Scots pine stand from 2010 to 2089 for a combination of three environmental change and three management scenarios. The environmental change scenarios considered interannual climate variability trends and included alterations in temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, wind speed, Particulate matter (PM) concentration and CO 2 concentration.

The participants were interviewed and had their hearing tested in 2005 and 2006. Results: seventy-one {{percent of the participants}} were found to have normal hearing. Tinnitus was present in 16 % of the males and in 9 % of the females. Mean noise exposure length was 7 years and noise levels ranged from 86 to 91 dBA (48 %). Bilateral tinnitus (46 %) of the hissing type (40 %) and moderate intensity (49 %) was the most prevalent. Symptoms began to be observed within one to five years after initial exposure to noise (67 %) and manifested themselves in weekly episodes (41 %) that bothered the patients mostly at night (34 %). A significant correlation was observed between the frequency of tinnitus episodes and the noise levels to which workers were exposed.
