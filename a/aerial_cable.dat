25|$|Barcelona {{is served}} by a {{comprehensive}} local public transport network that includes a metro, a bus network, two separate modern tram networks, a separate historic tram line, and several funiculars and <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> cars. Most of these networks and lines form a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM), although they are operated {{by a number of}} different bodies. This integrated public transport is divided into different zones (1 to 6) and depending on usage various Integrated Travel Cards are available.|$|E
25|$|Another company, TRAMMET, {{operates}} the city's two modern tram networks, known as Trambaix and Trambesòs. The historic tram line, the Tramvia Blau, connects the metro (L7, operated by FGC) to the Funicular del Tibidabo (operated by TMB). The Funicular de Tibidabo climbs the Tibidabo hill, {{as does the}} Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC). The Funicular de Montjuïc (TMB) climbs the Montjuïc hill. The city has two <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car (to the Montjuïc castle) and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port.|$|E
25|$|Torres's {{experimentation}} in {{the area}} of cableways and cable cars began very early during his residence in the town of his birth, Molledo. There, in 1887, he constructed the first cableway to span a depression of some 40 metres. The cableway was some 200 metres across and was pulled by a pair of cows, with one log seat. This experiment was the basis for the request for his first patent, which he sought in the same year: an <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> car with multiple cables, with which it obtained a level of safety suitable for the transport of people, not only cargo. Later, he constructed the cableway of the Río León, of greater speed and already with a motor, but which continued to be used solely for the transport of materials, not of people.|$|E
50|$|For {{reasons of}} {{electromagnetic}} interference <b>aerial</b> <b>cables</b> running along power lines {{are most often}} of fibre optic types. As these are dielectric, it is even possible to install them directly in the conductors - see optical ground wire. <b>Aerial</b> <b>cables</b> are also used sometimes for power transmission from the transmitter building to the antenna at radio stations.|$|R
50|$|Due to Hurricane Katrina damage, BellSouth {{replaced}} {{most of the}} <b>aerial</b> <b>cabling</b> in 2005.|$|R
50|$|A {{compromise}} between undergrounding and using overhead lines is installing air <b>cables.</b> <b>Aerial</b> <b>cables</b> are insulated cables spun between poles {{and used for}} power transmission or telecommunication services. An advantage of <b>aerial</b> <b>cables</b> is that their insulation removes the danger of electric shock (unless the cables are damaged). Another advantage is that they forgo the costs - particularly high in rocky areas - of burying. The disadvantages of <b>aerial</b> <b>cables</b> are {{that they have the}} same aesthetic issues as standard overhead lines and that they can be affected by storms. However if the insulation is not destroyed during pylon failure or when hit by a tree, there is no interruption of service. Electrical hazards are minimised and re-hanging the cables may be possible without power interruption.|$|R
25|$|In 1890 he {{presented}} his cableway in Switzerland, a country {{very interested in}} that transport owing to its geography and which was already coming to use cable cars for bulk transport, but Torres's project was dismissed, allowing certain ironic commentary from the Swiss press. In 1907, Torres constructed the first cableway suitable for the public transportation of people, in Monte Ulía in San Sebastián. The problem of safety was solved {{by means of an}} ingenious system of multiple support cables. The resulting design was very strong and perfectly resisted the rupture of one of the support cables. The execution of the project was the responsibility of the Society of Engineering Studies and Works of Bilbao, which successfully constructed other cableways in Chamonix, Rio de Janeiro, and elsewhere. But it is doubtless the Spanish Aerocar in Niagara Falls in Canada which has gained the greatest fame in this area of activity, although from a scientific point of view it was not the most important. The cableway of 580 meters in length is an <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> car that spans the whirlpool in the Niagara Gorge on the Canadian side, constructed between 1914 and 1916, a Spanish project from beginning to end: devised by a Spaniard, constructed by a Spanish company with Spanish capital (The Niagara Spanish Aerocar Co. Limited); a bronze plaque, located on a monolith at the entrance of the access station recalls this fact: Spanish aerial ferry of the Niagara. Leonardo Quevedo Torres (18521936). It was inaugurated in tests on 15 February 1916 and was officially inaugurated on 8 August 1916, opening to the public the following day; the cableway, with small modifications, continues to run to this day, with no accidents worthy of mention, constituting a popular tourist and cinematic attraction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, in the German-language {{programme}} [...] "fünf vor zwölf" [...] (At {{the eleventh}} hour), Manser and Jacques Christinet used auxiliary cable to drop themselves down 800 meters onto the Klein Matterhorn <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> car and hung sizable banners there. They reached the dangerous speed of 140 kilometers per hour while riding on a self-made rider with steel wheels and ball bearings.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. {{the word}} tram {{frequently}} {{refers to a}} special-purpose bus used as a shuttle (and often not designed for use on public roads), such as for parking lot shuttles at theme parks and major events or transportation within theme parks. Other common North American English meanings of the term tram include <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> cars and short-distance, rubber-tired people-movers (such as at certain airports). [...] Tourist buses that {{have been given the}} appearance of a vintage streetcar (i.e. trolley-replica buses) are most commonly referred to, ambiguously, simply as trolleys by the companies or entities operating them or selling them, but may be referred to as trams or streetcars.|$|E
