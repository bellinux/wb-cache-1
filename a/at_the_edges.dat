5|$|Asplenium montanum is {{globally}} secure, but threatened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of its range. It {{is known}} only historically from Missouri, and NatureServe considers it critically imperiled in Indiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont, imperiled in New Jersey, and imperiled to vulnerable in Connecticut and New York. The principal threat to New York populations is rock climbing.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} known from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, southeastern Mexico, and western Panama. It lives in humid {{evergreen}} forests that are sometimes interspersed with pine trees. It {{can be found}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of these forests typically {{in the middle and}} higher levels within these trees. It is also normally found only where cloud forest is uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{mountain}}eers dressed in Alpine costumes used {{to climb the}} mountain in early years, and eight divers between the ages 17 and 24 would dive off the waterfall. In the second season, all eight were Canadians who had competed in major diving competitions. Their schedule was six shows a day on every other day. The dive is 58 feet, and the pool is 13 feet deep in the centre and only 7 feet deep <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> At {{the end of the}} dive, they were descending at 40 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of lakes and ponds; this enables the clam {{to find the best}} position for filter feeding.|$|E
5|$|Another modern {{development}} (in {{use in the}} Netherlands) is {{the creation}} of housing communities <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of wetlands with floating structures, restrained in position by vertical pylons. Such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.|$|E
5|$|Tehama started life some 600,000 years ago. At {{its peak}} activity, it reached {{approximately}} 3,350meters (11,000ft) high, with a basal diameter of approximately 12kilometers. Volcanic activity then declined 400,000 years ago, with other volcanic lava domes forming <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of Mount Tehama later on, {{the largest and}} best known of which is Lassen Peak. A combination of continued hydrothermal activity and erosion, particularly by glaciers during ice ages, removed the central cone of the volcano, leaving a large caldera, {{the northern edge of}} which can still be seen.|$|E

40|$|The first {{evidence}} of an electrostatic potential well <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of plasmas confined in a reversed field pinch configuration is reported, based on measurements made on the RFX experiment. The radial width of the well decreases with plasma current, whereas the potential drop is a few times <b>the</b> electron temperature <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge,</b> almost independent of plasma current. The resulting radial electric field points inward <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and this behavior has been related to finite Larmor radius losses as in tokamaks. Because of the spatial structure of the plasma potential, a naturally occurring double velocity shear layer has been identified <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> with a shear value {{comparable to that of}} tokamaks and stellarators...|$|R
5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become brittle. The brittle titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time the engine was powered up and brought to operating temperature and finally broke open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where {{there is very little}} flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges,</b> making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|Both Crex crakes {{are mainly}} active during the day, {{especially}} at dawn, dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain. The African crake is less skulking {{and easier to}} flush from cover than other crakes, and is often seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of roads and tracks, but the corn crake {{is a much more}} difficult bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation and rarely emerging into the open. Both crakes are territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat displays involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the wings, flanks and belly like a fan. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking.|$|E
5|$|Food Circus: The Food Circus was a {{food court}} in the former armory, later named the Center House, and {{recently}} renamed The Armory (2012) as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current arrangement with a stage and a large open space for dancing, events, and temporary booths, many food booths {{were in the middle}} of the room as well as <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges.</b> There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E

5|$|Group-living species {{tend to be}} {{communal}} group breeders. In {{addition to}} these species, a number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds, although they tend to stay <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of these groups. Joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate. Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species the roost will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they have separate functions; the grey-and-buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its nesting site. Most birds roost alone and will oust intruders from their chosen site, but the Magellanic woodpecker and acorn woodpecker are cooperative roosters.|$|E
5|$|Rymdkapsel is a 2013 minimalist {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} by indie developer Grapefrukt, the studio of Martin Jonasson. Players build {{a space station}} using tetromino pieces while managing resources and minions, defending against attacks, and extending the base towards four monoliths <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the level. The game was built over {{a year and a}} half and was inspired by the base-building aspects of the Command & Conquer series. It was Jonasson's first full game as an indie developer. Rymdkapsel was released on May 7, 2013 for PlayStation Mobile, and was later ported to iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. Reviewers gave the game generally favorable reviews, where they appreciated its simplicity and challenge, but not its brevity and slow start.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of {{the lake}} produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used {{in the production of}} magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore {{of the lake}}, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{undergoes a}} molt {{in the spring}} and autumn. It is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year. During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male. The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the short, notched tail. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
