The proteolytic enzymes, subtilisin A and the glycoside hydrolase cellulose, were covalently attached onto poly(ethylene [...] maleic) anhydride copolymer films. A comparison between active and heat-inactivated surfaces showed that while the activity of immobilized cellulase reduced the <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> by 67 %, it {{had no effect on}} the <b>attachment</b> <b>of.</b> Immobilized subtilisin A had opposite effects: the active enzyme had no effect on the <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> but reduced the <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> by 44 %.

40|$|LL. M. (International Commercial Law) The main {{exploration}} {{of this paper}} is whether a breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> as a ground for jurisdiction is sufficient for a court in England or South Africa to exercise jurisdiction. This question seems straightforward in England, but not so much in South Africa. England enacted their Civil Procedure Rules to make provision for a court to exercise jurisdiction when a plaintiff who is in England wants to sue a foreign defendant in England. 1 The breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> must occur in the jurisdiction before an English court will permit service out of the jurisdiction. South Africa’s laws on jurisdiction are derived from Roman law. 2 A foreign peregrinus may sue in South Africa either where the incola is domiciled or resident or where the cause of action arises. Breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is allowed in this circumstance. It is necessary for an incola plaintiff to attach property of a foreign peregrinus defendant when he wants to sue the foreign peregrinus in a South African court. This may be done where the <b>attachment</b> founds jurisdiction <b>of</b> the court, ie where the incola sues in the area where he is domiciled or resides, or where the attachment confirms the jurisdiction of the court, ie where the cause of action arises. The cause of action in relation to contracts includes the conclusion <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> or the performance <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> in the jurisdiction if the plaintiff sues where the cause of action arises and not where the plaintiff is domiciled or resident. The matter of whether a breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> can be regarded as a ratio jurisdictionis is seldom approached by South African courts. In Natal, courts allowed <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the defendant’s properties where there were no rationes jurisdictionis [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Based on {{dissection}} studies, Nimura et al.(Nimura et al. 2012) {{showed the}} wide <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the articular capsule {{at the border}} between the infraspinatus and the teres minor. Moreover, the <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the posterosuperior capsule may contribute to the stability of the glenohumeral joint.(Nimura and Akita 2013) Recently, it has been though that anatomical knowledge regarding the relatively wide <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the joint capsule could be helpful for the understanding the joint stabilizing in other joints.(Nasu et al. 2017; Nimura et al. 2014; Sato et al. 2018; Shimura et al. 2016) However, the anterior and inferior <b>attachments</b> <b>of</b> the articular capsule, which is generally referred as the inferior glenohumeral ligament, on the humerus has been remained controversial. Furthermore, the relationship between the width <b>of</b> the capsular <b>attachment</b> and the thickness of the corresponding midsubstance of the capsule has not been assessed. If the wide <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the capsule were shown to correspond to the thick capsule in the whole capsule, the anatomical significance <b>of</b> the wide <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the capsule could be understood and useful for the selection of the operative procedures.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} an electroactive mask that permits the patterning of two different cell populations to a single substrate. This mask is based on a self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiolates on gold that could be switched from a state that prevents the <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> cells to a state that promotes the integrin-mediated <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> cells. Monolayers were patterned into regions having this electroactive monolayer and a second set of regions that were adhesive. After Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts had attached to the adhesive regions of this substrate, the second set of regions was activated electrically to permit the <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> a second population of fibroblast cells.
