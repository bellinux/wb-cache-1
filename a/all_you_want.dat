25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E

Patrick's emotional outbreak was originally written only for the first season episode [...] "Valentine's Day", where SpongeBob and Sandy try to give Patrick a Valentine's Day gift, and [...] "was supposed to be a one-time thing". However, according to episode writer Jay Lender, [...] "when that show came back it felt so right that his dark side started popping up everywhere. You can plan ahead <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> but the characters eventually tell you who they are." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between both managers was evidently hostile to begin with. Ferguson noted that Wenger {{was the only}} manager he came across in the league not to share a drink with after matches – an English football [...] "tradition". In a joint interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, Wenger said his discourtesy was mistaken for mistrust and managers [...] "cannot be completely friendly and open up." [...] When asked {{if this was the}} reason he avoided the post-match drink, he replied: [...] "Most of the time, yes. What can you say if you have won? And if you have lost <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do is get home and prepare for the next game." ...|$|E

500|$|He was a {{part-time}} leg break bowler, taking 57wickets in first-class cricket at a useful average of 32.21. Barnes's leg break spun very little, {{but he had}} a topspinner which hurried onto the batsman and yielded him many wickets. Barnes was also a substitute wicket-keeper and a versatile fieldsman. During his career, he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires. On the 1948 tour of England, after an Australian appeal was turned down by umpire Alec Skelding, he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to Skelding, stating: [...] "Now <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> is a white stick". A complex character, Barnes, [...] "rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn. Stocky, with blue eyes and powerful wrists, he had a passion for physical fitness, and was an enthusiastic big-game fisherman and golfer".|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{asked her}} {{to play the role}} because he had seen her {{previous}} work and liked it. Saldana had never seen the original series, though she had played a Trekkie in The Terminal (2004), but agreed to play the role after Abrams complimented her. [...] "For an actor, that's all you need, that's <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> To get the acknowledgment and respect from your peers," [...] she said. She met with Nichelle Nichols, who explained to her how she had created Uhura's background and had named the character. Saldana's mother was a Star Trek fan and sent her voice mails during filming, giving advice on the part. Sydney Tamiia Poitier also auditioned for the part. The film officially establishes the character's first name, which had never been previously uttered on TV or in film. It also establishes (in an officially discreet manner) that Uhura and Spock are, in fact, lovers and had been romantically linked for some time during the film.|$|E
500|$|The band {{said that}} while {{producing}} the song, they attempted to find out [...] "how to make dance music" [...] without turning themselves into a dance act. Armstrong {{said it was the}} first time the band had written a dance song. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter. It blows your mind and pisses you off. It’s a song about being drunk, going through this chaos, feeling fucked up and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do is get more drunk".|$|E

500|$|When [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in late 2002, critics and the public had speculated that Beyoncé and Jay-Z were having a mutual affair. Despite widespread rumors, they remained silent about their relationship. According to critics, the title itself of the album sounded [...] "more intriguing" [...] with Beyoncé singing personal songs. Though love is the theme Beyoncé had incorporated in the album, [...] "most the material is vague enough to be about any relationship"; however, there are songs that suggested affirmation of their relationship. In the song [...] "Signs", Beyoncé sings about being {{in love with a}} Sagittarius, [...] which coincidentally is Jay-Z's zodiac sign. In response to the persistent rumors about them, Beyoncé stated, [...] "People can come to whatever conclusion they like... That's the beauty of music... I'm a singer, I'll talk about writing songs <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> But when it comes to certain personal things any normal person wouldn't tell people they don't know, I just feel like I don't have to [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava {{was used as the}} director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical. It's a new approach that I would have to let [...] explain. It's new territory." [...] During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied [...] "my feet repel them dahling." [...] When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed her feet were [...] "in agony" [...] and said [...] "My high heels had left my feet bleeding. Laugh <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> my feet hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|Barnes {{returned}} for the subsequent fixture against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately, {{and put on}} an opening partnership of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued {{to build on the}} foundation laid by the top order and were eventually bowled out for 632. Bradman’s bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian appeals had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by umpire Alec Skelding, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball [...] "wouldn't have hit another set of stumps" [...] and telling the umpire to get a guide dog. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then [...] presented to Skelding stating: [...] "You must need a dog. You're blind when you give those decisions [...] not out" [...] and [...] "Now <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> is a white stick". Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena. Barnes later wrote [...] "Strange how I suggested he find himself a canine companion at ...|$|E

500|$|Although its {{gameplay}} {{was mainly}} well received, the game's long loading times were criticised. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb noted Wipeout 2048 technical issues, particularly its loading times. IGN's Cam Shea called the 30-second loading times frustrating [...] "when <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{to do is}} race", and Gameplanet's Adam Goodall also described the long loading times as awful, though he felt they were {{not enough to make}} the game a failure and assured the overall gameplay experience [...] "deeply satisfying". GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey said that the game's online mode was well-executed, highly accessible and a [...] "credit to Wipeout." [...] She said that its user interface appeared clean and shiny, and called the touchscreen-based menu system [...] "a pleasure to behold". The Guardian Simon Parkin criticised the game's protracted loading times; a pause at least twenty seconds too long had a negative effect in the era of [...] "insta-fix mobile gaming on the rival platforms". Willington found the lengthy load times an issue which plagues the game, [...] "totally at odds" [...] with the normal pace of gameplay. Gaston said that the loading times were [...] "simply unforgivable"; he routinely waited over 50 seconds after selecting a race to start it, which minimised the ability to comfortably play the game [...] "on the go". Walton also found the long loading times infuriating in a handheld game, and said that having to wait more than 40 seconds to start a race was far longer than it should have been. Although Furfari found that the game had one of the longest loading times on the PlayStation Vita, it was not a [...] "deal breaker" [...] and Wipeout 2048 {{was one of the few}} racing titles for the console that he recommended. Although Haley noted the game's substantial loading times, he said that was a common feature in PlayStation Vita launch titles.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing as Test captain, Waugh led {{the team}} to a 2–1 victory in South Africa to retain Australia's ranking as the number one team. Australia crushed the hosts in the First Test by an innings and 360 runs, won the Second Test by four wickets, before losing the last. His own form was poor, with 95 runs at 19.00. He left the tour once the ODI series began. Arriving in Australia alone, he faced media {{questioning}} over his playing future. Waugh's reply was, [...] "We've just beaten the next {{best team in the}} world 5–1, and <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to talk about is getting me out of the team." ...|$|E
2500|$|His ready wit on {{the field}} saw him held in great affection, but his {{reputation}} was always underpinned by respect, as {{he was one of}} the most accomplished umpires of his day. In one match a batsman who had been celebrating a special event the previous evening was rapped on the pad by a ball. At once the bowler asked: [...] "How is he?" [...] Said Alec, shaking his head sadly: [...] "He's not at all well, and he was even worse last night." [...] Occasionally the joke went against Alec. In a game in 1948 he turned down a strong appeal by the Australian touring team. A little later a dog ran onto the field, and Sid Barnes captured it, carried it to Skelding and said: 'Here you are. <b>All</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> now is a white stick!' ...|$|E

2500|$|Between {{the two of}} them, Powell and Rothe began {{a series}} of reforms which were {{targeted}} at updating the facility. [...] They began to abolish the [...] "con-boss" [...] system, improved inmate food quality by instilling a [...] "Take <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> but eat all you take" [...] policy and by supplying condiments on the tables. [...] They also sought {{to crack down on the}} rampant drug use and black market inside the walls and began performing exhaustive background checks on the prisoners, a practice that was not standard operating procedure until Powell's tenure. [...] A training regimen for the guards was also instilled, which bettered communication between shifts and cut back on guard contributions to the black market. Something they were unable to initiate until too late was the removal of firearms from the cellblocks; Powell and Rothe wanted to completely sweep both cellblocks of the rifles the guards carried on the catwalks. [...] They saw the [...]30-30 Winchester rifles' presence as an instigator for inmate uprising, but the guards refused to surrender the guns.|$|E
2500|$|Caitlin White {{writing for}} MTV News {{felt that the}} version [...] "more than exceeds our expectations" [...] and added that it managed to expand [...] "flawlessness beyond women at this juncture". Nadeska Alexis of the same {{publication}} wrote that Beyoncé sounded [...] "extra fearless" [...] together with Minaj. Pitchfork Media's Evan Minsker referred to the remix as [...] "like {{a gift from the}} heavens" [...] as it featured the two singers together on a song. Vulture's writer [...] E. Alex Jung called the pair's first collaboration [...] "epic". Melinda Newman, a writer of HitFix, felt that the reworked version [...] "brings... up to speed" [...] compared to the original, but noted that Minaj's lyrics discussing Jackson's doctor would likely upset his fans. Slate editor Sharan Shetty described it as [...] "excellent", praising the duo as a [...] "powerful pair". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine praised Beyoncé's line addressing the elevator accident as a highlight of the remix. Time reviewer Nolan Feeney deemed the remix a [...] "feistier, more aggressive take" [...] on the original, while also adding that it had a different message, [...] "talk <b>all</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> you'll never wake up like them". A writer of Rap-Up magazine felt that Minaj delivered one of [...] "her best verses yet". Sasha Frere-Jones, a critic of The New Yorker felt that unlike the original version, the remix is [...] "flawless... because it is conceptually coherent and ferocious, and neither performer makes a mistake", noting that Beyoncé outshined Minaj's performance. He concluded his review by stating that [...] "the synergy of the 'Flawless' remix hits a peak of cultural importance". Time Magazine, in its year-end [...] "Top Ten" [...] series, named Flawless (Remix) the Best Song of 2014. The song was placed at number seven on Billboards 10 Best Songs of 2014 list. Entertainment Weekly also included the single on their ranking of the best songs of 2014 at number 2, while Spin at number 36.|$|E
