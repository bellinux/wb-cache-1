5|$|The game {{takes place}} within the fictional {{universe}} in which prior Traveller releases are also set. The most significant power in this universe is the human-dominated Imperium which predominates across thousands of inhabited solar systems. Bordering the regions controlled by the Imperium are other interstellar powers including the Zhodani Consulate. The Imperium and the Zhodani {{have a long history}} of tense relations and, as the game begins, rumors of another frontier war are circulating. Against this backdrop, a security agent working for Sharushid, a large corporation active throughout the Imperium, discovers that a company sub-sector chief named Konrad Kiefer is secretly aiding the Zhodani by smuggling <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> the border into the hands of dissidents in preparation for an uprising within the Imperium to be coordinated with a Zhodani attack. This security agent encounters five experienced adventurers in a bar on the planet Efate and entrusts them with evidence of Kiefer's treachery. These adventurers are tasked with delivering the evidence to a second Sharushid agent located in another solar system and ultimately with stopping Kiefer and his conspiracy against the Imperium. The player assumes control over the party just after the security agent entrusts it with the evidence against Kiefer.|$|E
25|$|The Basques – Kingdom of Navarre and the Basque Provinces ("Biscay") – had {{supported}} the king against the Habsburg pretender, and initially retained their home rule (fueros). However, the centralising drive of the Spanish Crown did not spare them. In 1718, following Philip V's attempt to suppress home rule by bringing customs {{to the coast}} and the Pyrenees, Basques in Gipuzkoa and the seigneury of Biscay rose up in <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> coastal areas. Philip V sent over troops and the uprising (matxinada) was quelled in blood. Despite his military success, eventually Philip V backed down on his decision, brought customs back to the Ebro river (1719). The Basques managed to keep their traditional institutions and laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{that marked the}} turning point of Indo-LTTE relationship occurred in early October. On 4 October 1987, the Sri Lankan Navy captured an LTTE boat off Point Pedro with seventeen Tigers, including some high-profile leaders of the movement, on board. The Colombo govt alleged the boat was involved in smuggling <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> the Palk Straits and on the grounds denied immunity to these captured Tiger rebels. The LTTE denied this claiming the rebels movement {{were in accordance with}} the truce, being in the process of transferring documents for shifting the Tigers Headquarters from Madras to Jaffna. The Sinhalese government intended to bring a number of the rebels captured, including Pulendran, Kumarappa and others, to trial in Colombo for allegedly masterminding the massacre of a hundred and fifty civilians. The Tigers, who were at the time still in negotiation with the Indian authorities, appealed for enforcement of protection by the IPKF. The rebels were at this time in IPKF custody at Palali Airbase pending transfer to Sinhalese authorities. Although the Indian authorities insist that they had explained the possible repercussions of such an action on the fragile truce and exerted considerable pressure on the Sinhalese authorities to desist from proceeding, ultimately the IPKF withdrew allowing the Sri Lankan forces to proceed with transferring the captured rebels to Colombo. The detainees however, attempted mass suicide by swallowing cyanide- a common LTTE practice when faced imminent capture. The night of 5 October saw large scale slaughter of Sinhalese people who had returned to Jaffna, including eight troops of the Sri Lankan Army who were at the time being held hostages by the LTTE. These coincided by armed confrontations between the Tiger Cadres and the Indian Troops in and around Jaffna. On 8 October, the LTTE carried out a number of mortar attacks and ambushes on the IPKF.|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Banks shot a {{music video}} for [...] "Wallace" [...] {{in front of}} a green screen in New York. It was {{directed}} by Rob Soucy and Nick Ace, who previously directed the video for Banks' 2014 single [...] "Heavy Metal and Reflective". On June 4, 2014, Banks uploaded two clips from the shooting to her Instagram account. More than a year later, a 25-second teaser for [...] "Wallace" [...] was uploaded on Banks' YouTube channel, with the full video being released on March 11, 2015, via Banks' official website. The video was produced by consultancy firm Collins, who used the Google Cloud Platform during development. In the interactive [...] video we see Banks in a blank background, and as the watcher maneuvers their <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> the screen, Banks' positioning changes, and certain reactions take place, including Banks blinking, smiling, and rotating. Banks talked about the collaboration with Google, stating, [...] "I’m such a huge fan of technology and creative new ways of interacting and engaging with fans, so this collaboration was perfect for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{opens with}} an inter-title that reads [...] "Poor little rich girl has {{no one to}} play with" [...] and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of {{children}} play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party {{set up on the}} yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen {{from the middle of the}} street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the umpire}} makes an {{incorrect}} signal, he may revoke it. [...] To do so, he crosses his <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> his chest, then makes the corrected signal. A revocation {{may be made}} if the umpire discovers an incorrect application of the laws, such as, signalling [...] "out" [...] before realising that the other umpire signalled a no-ball. Also, an umpire may revoke if he accidentally signals a four though he intended to signal six. See [...] With {{the implementation of the}} Decision Review System, a signal may also be revoked if the Third Umpire reports that his review supports reversing the call.|$|E

50|$|A {{simplified}} ceilidh {{variation of}} the popular version does not required the Gay Gordons method of holding hands {{in the first half}} of the routine.

The toe-steps are performed as usual and they pivot and turn, whereupon the man puts his left <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> the small of the woman's back and she uses her right arm. The rest of the routine is as per the popular version.|$|R

50|$|If a batsman scores four when he {{hits the}} ball across the {{boundary}} (not by actually running them), the umpire signals this by waving his arm {{back and forth in}} front of the chest. This signal varies a lot between umpires, from two short, restrained, waves finishing with the <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> the chest, to elaborate signals that resemble those of a conductor of an orchestra.
