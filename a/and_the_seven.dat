5|$|Following {{successful}} exclusive runs at Radio City Music Hall in New York City and {{a theater}} in Miami in January 1938, RKO Radio Pictures put the film into general release on February 4. It {{became a major}} box-office success, making four times more money than any other motion picture released in 1938. In its original release, Snow White <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Dwarfs grossed $3.5 million in the United States and Canada, and by May 1939 its total international gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful sound film of all time, displacing Al Jolson's The Singing Fool (1928) (Snow White <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Dwarfs was soon displaced from this position by Gone with the Wind in 1940). By {{the end of its}} original run, Snow White <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Dwarfs had earned $7,846,000 in international box office receipts. This earned RKO a profit of $380,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{shortly after}} the success of Snow White <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Dwarfs, Walt Disney became {{interested}} in making an animated film based on The Tale of Peter Rabbit. However, Beatrix Potter refused to give the rights to Disney because of marketing issues.|$|E
5|$|Noted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised Snow White <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Dwarfs as {{a notable}} {{achievement}} in cinema; Eisenstein {{went so far}} as to call it the greatest film ever made. The film inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy film, The Wizard of Oz, in 1939. Another animation pioneer, Max Fleischer, decided to produce his animated feature film Gulliver's Travels in order to compete with Snow White. The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, directed by Bob Clampett, parodies Snow White <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seven</b> Dwarfs by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.|$|E
