5|$|In Asia Minor, Conrad {{decided not}} {{to wait for the}} French, and marched towards Iconium, capital of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the {{authority}} of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads. Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and <b>anyhow</b> assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case. Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road. The king led one of these, which was almost totally destroyed by the Seljuqs on 25 October 1147 at the second battle of Dorylaeum.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and <b>anyhow,</b> it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

25|$|The {{refurbishing}} of the 1970s gave to {{the facade}} forms of Modern architecture. <b>Anyhow,</b> its general shape reveals its old roots (gables type for instance), in a way similar {{to one of the}} old house in Gdańska Street (N°37).|$|E
25|$|In 1882, {{with the}} inauguration of the Gotthard Railway Tunnel, the travel time between Altdorf and Biasca was reduced {{dramatically}} to only hours, though often accompanied with overnight stays in huge Fin de siècle-hotels, for example in Biasca. These days, it still was an adventure {{and it was only}} affordable to the very rich <b>anyhow.</b>|$|E
25|$|Locals who {{captured}} a runaway were given rewards. It is {{also said that}} Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die <b>anyhow</b> from the severely cold winters. In such cases prisoners who did escape without getting shot were often found dead kilometres away from the camp.|$|E
25|$|A slight {{reduction}} in annual profit rates on capital invested due to more expensive productive equipment {{may not seem}} such a problem to business <b>anyhow,</b> if it is compensated {{by an increase in}} profit volume (profit margins) through increased sales and market shares. The yield on capital might decline somewhat in percentage terms, while total net income from the increased capital holding increases.|$|E
25|$|On 27 December 1971, two PAVN battalions {{closed in}} on Paksong. The two guerrilla battalions on Phou Thevada withdrew into the town. The guerrillas from north of town rushed in after taking 11 killed. Although the Royalist {{defenders}} outnumbered the attacking Vietnamese, they fled westward <b>anyhow</b> down Route 23 toward home. Four howitzers, five trucks, and smaller equipment were abandoned to the victors.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} barbarian peoples, {{such as the}} Vandals, Visigoths, Ostrogoths and Huns, which played an {{important}} part in Rome's loss of the western provinces, the Sueves—establishing themselves in Gallaecia and northern Lusitania, which were remote and extra-Mediterranean areas—seldom posed a threat to Rome and to Rome's interests; in fact, at times where we have more detailed knowledge of their history through a diversity of sources, that is precisely when they became a challenge, as it was under the reign of Rechila. <b>Anyhow,</b> all along their history as an independent nation, they maintained an important diplomatic activity, most notably with Rome, the Vandals, the Visigoths, and, later, with the Franks. Again, they become an important player during the reign of Miro, in the last third of the 6th century, when they were in coalition with other Catholic powers—the Franks and the Eastern Romans—in support of Hermenegild, and against the Visigothic king Leovigild. <b>Anyhow,</b> because of their relative isolation and remoteness, sources about the Suevi people are limited, with the number translated into English even fewer.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 the Chicharros left Levante {{and moved}} to Madrid; {{it is not clear}} whether the change was <b>anyhow</b> related to {{political}} tension or was rather due to financial issues, as reported by some sources; In the capital he started to practice as a lawyer and apparently became fairly successful, as in the early 1930s he grew to member of Junta de Gobierno of the Madrid Congregacion de los Abogados.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anyhow</b> the heresies are at best novelties, {{and have}} no {{continuity}} with the teaching of Christ. Perhaps some heretics may claim Apostolic antiquity: we reply: Let them publish the origins of their churches and unroll the catalogue of their bishops till now from the Apostles or from some bishop appointed by the Apostles, as the Smyrnaeans count from Polycarp and John, and the Romans from Clement and Peter; let heretics invent something to match this.|$|E
25|$|They all got {{together}} {{up there and}} there was a bloody massacre because I think they shot about three hundred natives all in one hit {{and there was a}} hell of a row over it. It was all published in the papers and somebody let the cat out of the bag and <b>anyhow</b> the government and the judges in those times they realised what the trouble was and the whole thing was hushed up you see.|$|E
25|$|Resorts may ban persons {{convicted of}} sex, drug, or violent crimes. Policies vary, but might include doing a {{criminal}} record check or checking a sex offender registry. However, minor crimes related to naturism are usually excluded, even {{if the person is}} required by law to register. (Requirements vary substantially from one jurisdiction to the next.) An example would be someone who thought they were in a secluded area while nude bathing with no lewd intent, but were charged with a crime <b>anyhow.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another core idea of M-Theory {{is close}} in spirit to {{ideas from the}} field of {{compressed}} sensing. An implication from Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma says that a particular number of images can be embedded into a low-dimensional feature space with the same distances between images by using random projections. This result suggests that dot product between the observed image and some other image stored in memory, called template, {{can be used as a}} feature helping to distinguish the image from other images. The template need not to be <b>anyhow</b> related to the image, it could be chosen randomly.|$|E

Also after the War, Intelligence activity needs engagement of the fleet. A normal search yielded no results, but the two brothers Rudolf Nikitovich Yurasov and Nikolai Nikitovich Yurasov stood out particularly. In the 1950s they were kids, and from 1990-s to 2000-s they occupied very high positions in the Navy and the government. According to their patronymic, their father's name was Nikita Yurasov.|$|E
25|$|His fielding {{was almost}} a minus quality. Hassett would be saddled with the {{difficult}} task of hiding him away from busy corners all day long. But the fielding of the team as a whole was thought to be brittle. Moroney...would never be accused of being a mobile unit of the out-cricket, and Ian Johnson was, in my opinion, <b>anyhow,</b> a very doubtful quantity especially as a slip-fieldsman, where he seemed likely to do duty...I sympathized with Hassett over the big job he faced in getting good fielding done with the quality of the manpower as his disposal. There were only five good fieldsmen in the group of twelve chosen. These were Harvey, Miller, Morris, Loxton and Archer, and Archer was the supernumerary.|$|E
25|$|Zelena, Snow, David, and Hook {{soon find}} {{themselves}} in a new realm, but Zelena has no way to return as her wand broke upon arrival. The four come across a frightened groundsman who warns them they shouldn’t be there, only to have another man appear and use magic to knock the unwanted visitors out. Hours later, they wake up in a cage of enchanted bars and are greeted by the warden, who believes that the Dark One must have sent them; they are enemies. They convince the warden that Gold is their enemy as well, and their arrival was an accident on his part in trying to wake Belle; however, the warden keeps them prisoner <b>anyhow.</b> The groundsman then visits the four, and agrees to help them if they will take him to Storybrooke.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anyhow,</b> {{a fierce}} story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American {{character}} with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) {{is only half}} Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well {{down the road from}} Eli Sunday's church—and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness, the movie can't be beat—nor for brilliance.|$|E
25|$|After the Russian {{administration}} {{took hold}} of Iranian Armenia, the ethnic make-up shifted, and thus {{for the first time}} in more than four centuries, ethnic Armenians started to form a majority once again in one part of historic Armenia. Some 35,000 Muslims of over 100,000 emigrated from the region, while some 57,000 Armenians from Iran proper and Turkey (see also; Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829) arrived after 1828. Due to these new significant demographic shifts, in 1832, the number of Armenians had matched that of the Muslims. <b>Anyhow,</b> it would be only after the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, which brought another influx of Turkish Armenians, that ethnic Armenians once again established a solid majority in Eastern Armenia. Nevertheless, the city of Erivan remained having a Muslim majority up to the twentieth century. According to the traveller H. F. B. Lynch, the city was about 50% Armenian and 50% Muslim (Azerbaijanis and Persians) in the early 1890s.|$|E

500|$|In November 1868, {{he wrote}} a letter to his daughter, which {{revealed}} that butter was scarce and that he doubted he would get a supply for the winter, but that [...] "when we have spare ribs, sausages & crackilin bread, we can do without butter. The fact is I begin to consider butter a luxury <b>anyhow,</b> that poor people have no business with." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{wrote to}} his {{mistress}} {{of the time that}} [...] " [...] told [...] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic.

500|$|Studio heads, now {{forced into}} {{unprecedented}} decisions, decided {{to begin with}} the actors, the least palatable, the most vulnerable part of movie production. It was such a splendid opportunity, <b>anyhow,</b> for breaking contracts, cutting salaries, and taming the stars.... Me, they gave the salary treatment. I could stay on without the raise my contract called for, or quit, [...] Schulberg said, using the questionable dodge of whether I'd be good for the talkies. Questionable, I say, because I spoke decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater. So without hesitation I quit.|$|E
500|$|Green {{wrote that}} Campbell [...] "enjoyed taking the 'devil's advocate' {{position}} {{in almost any}} area, willing to defend even viewpoints with which he disagreed if {{that led to a}} livelier debate." [...] As an example, he wrote, Campbell [...] "pointed out that the much-maligned 'peculiar institution' of slavery in the American South had in fact provided the blacks brought there with a higher standard of living than they had in Africa... I suspected, from comments by Asimov, among others– and some Analog editorials I had read– that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks." [...] Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that [...] "rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete <b>anyhow.</b> It would have been better for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Shades of Gray" [...] for Tor.com, and {{admitted}} that he hadn't seen the episode since the original broadcast. He said that it was a [...] "trainwreck" [...] and even worse than he remembered, because other shows such as [...] and Stargate SG-1 had since done much better clip shows. DeCandido summed it up by saying that [...] "In all honesty, they’d have been better off doing one fewer episode — the season was shortened by the writers strike <b>anyhow</b> — and upping the budget on one of the other 21. Just an awful, awful episode." [...] He gave the episode a score of zero out of ten. Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, describing the script as [...] "god-awful" [...] and the episode as [...] "forced".|$|E
500|$|... "I Can't Explain" [...] {{became popular}} with pirate radio {{stations}} such as Radio Caroline. Pirate radio {{was important for}} bands as there were no commercial radio stations in the UK and BBC Radio played little pop music. The group gained further exposure when they appeared on the television programme Ready Steady Go! Lambert and Stamp were tasked with finding [...] "typical teens", and invited the group's regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club. Enthusiastic reception on television and regular airplay on pirate radio helped the single slowly climb the charts in early 1965 until it reached the top 10. The follow-up single, [...] "Anyway, <b>Anyhow,</b> Anywhere", by Townshend and Daltrey, features guitar noises such as pick sliding, toggle switching and feedback, which was so unconventional that it was initially rejected by the US arm of Decca. The single reached the top10 in the UK and {{was used as the}} theme song to Ready Steady Go! ...|$|E
500|$|Gleeson was an {{advisor to}} men {{of all faiths}} in the {{regiment}} and kept careful records of their names and addresses {{so that he could}} write to the families of those that died. He ended each letter with the words [...] "They paid a great sacrifice", which was later used as the title of a book published in 2010 that details the wartime service records of men from Cork. [...] Much of his time was spent answering letters from families in Ireland concerned about the wellbeing of their sons and husbands. [...] At times the task almost overwhelmed him and this is evident in his personal diary when he wrote, in June 1915, [...] "I got 12 letters today; just after reading them. What answering they will take tomorrow. I like to give these poor people all the solace I can, <b>anyhow,</b> but still there’s no limit to the sorrowing inquiries. The tragedy of these letters".|$|E
500|$|The {{main battery}} turrets and {{ammunition}} magazines {{were also the}} subject of intense scrutiny; among the tests conducted was a trial to see how fast the magazines could be flooded—the result was 12 minutes. The gunnery school HMS Excellent ran loading trials on the main battery guns. It {{was found that the}} guns could be prepared to fire in 23 seconds, 13 seconds faster than in the s. The ship's watertight bulkhead and underwater protection systems also particularly interested the inspection team; they paid close attention to the ship's pumping and counter-flooding equipment. Commander W M Phipps Hornby, who lived on board Baden for weeks during the examination, wrote to the naval historian Arthur Marder in 1969 that it was his [...] "considered opinion—which I know coincided with that of others engaged on the same job—that, considered as a fighting machine, <b>anyhow</b> on balance the Baden was markedly in advance of any comparable ship of the Royal Navy".|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{youngest}} brother, Prince John, {{died at the}} age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after {{a severe}} seizure. John suffered from epilepsy, and Edward, who was 11 years older than his brother and had hardly known him, saw his death as [...] "little more than a regrettable nuisance". He wrote to his mistress of the time that [...] " [...] told [...] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. 's been practically shut up for the last two years <b>anyhow,</b> so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else." [...] He also wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost. She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: [...] "I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who hardly knew him... I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Hooker's vocal {{alternates}} between sung {{and spoken}} sections. [...] Commenting on Hooker's vocal sections, music historian Ted Gioia notes, [...] "The song has almost no melody. [...] Even less harmony. [...] In fact, {{it is hard}} to call it a song. [...] It's more like a bit of jive steam of consciousness in 4/4 time." [...] Some of the lyrics are borrowed from earlier songs that date {{back to the beginning of}} the blues. [...] The opening line [...] "My mama she didn't allow me to stay out all night long" [...] has origins in [...] "Mama Don't Allow", an old dance song. [...] Several songs were recorded in the 1920s with similar titles. [...] "Boogie No. 3" [...] by boogie-woogie pianist Cow Cow Davenport has sung and spoken sections and includes the lines, [...] "I don't care what Grandma don't allow, play my music <b>anyhow,</b> Grandma's don't 'llow no music playin' in here". Hooker's first and second takes of the song include similar verses and the narrative about Henry's Swing Club, but do not include the crucial mid-song hook [...] "Boogie, chillen'!" [...] before the guitar break, which gives the song its lyrical identity.|$|E
500|$|Nando Di Fino of Mediaite also {{complained that}} the episode may have gone too far, and {{compared}} it to previous episodes in the series that had been banned from airing on television, noting, [...] "The show has dipped into sensitive material before, and Fox has actually refused to air two episodes — one dealing with abortion, the other with heavy Jewish themes. Sunday night's episode, if reaction to {{it can be used}} as a good measure, may have been better joining those two episodes in exile." [...] Whitney Jefferson of Jezebel, a website centered on women's issues, also strongly criticized the episode for its storyline involving Brenda and her boyfriend, Jeff: [...] "Personally, I'm way beyond being offended by the show — I've long been numbed to shock-value offensiveness — and had stopped watching years ago <b>anyhow.</b> But being a sucker for a Halloween-themed episodes, I tuned in to Fox's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] comedy block last night. What I saw was seriously awful." [...] Jefferson ended her review of the episode by stating that the show was [...] "Definitely the scariest Halloween special we've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared in the}} subsequent press conference where Alonso said {{that the decision to}} run a shorter second stint than Kubica (between the first and second pit stops) was his decision: [...] "Sometimes you can do it, sometimes you can't but today the car was perfect and I was able to do it." [...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling I have now is that we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but <b>anyhow,</b> that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E
500|$|On October 19, 1951, Josephine Baker made {{charges of}} racism against the Stork Club. [...] Baker visited the club on October 16 as {{the guest of}} Roger Rico and his wife; both entertainers were at the Stork after their theater performances. Baker said she ordered a steak and was {{apparently}} still waiting for it an hour later. [...] The controversy grew when Baker accused Walter Winchell {{of being in the}} Cub Room at the time and not coming to her aid. [...] Winchell was at the club; he said he had greeted Baker and vocalist Roger Rico as the two left their Cub Room table. Winchell said he was not aware of there being any problem, and left for a late screening of the film [...] The next morning, Winchell's rumored failure to assist Baker was big news, and he received countless telephone calls. The incident blew into a major scandal and was widely publicized on the radio and newspapers. Mrs. Rico, who was part of the Baker party with her husband, said that Baker's steak was waiting for her at the table after she returned from her phone call, but the entertainer chose to make a stormy exit from the Stork <b>anyhow.</b> News accounts show conflicting statements from the Ricos.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated [...] "Director Peter Jackson, at {{home with}} all kinds of excess in New Zealand, keeps {{everything}} spinning nicely, not even losing a step when the mood turns increasingly disturbing." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times enjoyed The Frighteners, but [...] "walked out the theater with mixed emotions," [...] she commented that [...] "Peter Jackson deserves more enthusiasm for expert, imaginative effects than for his live actors <b>anyhow.</b> These lively touches would leave The Frighteners looking more like a more frantic Beetlejuice if Jackson's film weren't so wearyingly overcrowded. The Frighteners is not immune to overkill, even though most of its characters are already dead." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News praised the acting in the film, with the performances of Fox and Alvarado in particular, but said that there were also [...] "bits that push the taste barrier too far and which grind things to a screeching halt", and that if [...] "Jackson had used the restraint he showed in Heavenly Creatures, the movie could have [...] "been the best of its kind". Critic Christopher Null praised the film, as he described it as a mixture between Ghostbusters and Twin Peaks. Michael Drucker of IGN said that although the film wouldn't make Jackson's top five of movies, it [...] "is a harmless and fun dark comedy that you'll enjoy casually watching from time to time". The Frighteners received mixed reviews from critics from Jackson's native country, New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Patton's {{conduct in}} this {{campaign}} met with several controversies. When Alexander sent a transmission on July 19 limiting Patton's attack on Messina, his chief of staff, Brigadier General Hobart R. Gay, claimed the message was [...] "lost in transmission" [...] until Messina had fallen. On July 22 he shot and killed a pair of mules that had stopped while pulling a cart across a bridge. The cart was blocking {{the way of a}} U.S. armored column which was under attack from German aircraft. When their Sicilian owner protested, Patton attacked him with a walking stick and pushed the two mules off of the bridge. When informed of the massacre of Italian prisoners at Biscari by troops under his command, Patton wrote in his diary, [...] "I told Bradley that it was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell the officer to certify that the dead men were snipers or had attempted to escape or something, as it would make a stink in the press and also would make the civilians mad. <b>Anyhow,</b> they are dead, so nothing can be done about it." [...] Bradley refused Patton's suggestions. Patton later changed his mind. After he learned that the 45th Division's Inspector General found [...] "no provocation {{on the part of the}} prisoners... They had been slaughtered" [...] Patton is reported to have said: [...] "Try the bastards." [...] Patton also came into frequent disagreements with Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and acquiesced to their relief by Bradley.|$|E
