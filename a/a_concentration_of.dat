During a five-year project, from 2008 to 2012, selected chemical parameters in 11 water supply networks of the Siedlce County were studied.

In accordance with the results of cluster analysis, all water networks were put into three groups of different water quality. <b>A</b> high <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> chlorides, sulphates, and manganese and <b>a</b> low <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> copper and sodium was found in the water of Group 1 supply networks.
