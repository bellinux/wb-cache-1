This may refer to the Prohibition in the 1920s, when the U.S. government decided to ban all alcohol.

Third party logistics services {{has been more}} widely accepted and adopted.

However the way to achievement for foreign third party logistics providers in China is not easy or successful.

This research is to investigate the current situation of foreign third party logistics providers in China. It examines their position, service quality and features in Chinese logistics market comparing with Chinese domestic third party logistics providers. Relevant issues, like the acceptance of third party services and future development of foreign providers are studied in a wider field. Concepts and knowledge in this research involve possible reasons of choosing or rejecting third party logistics services and the criteria of choosing providers. Questionnaire survey is used to collect primary data from foreign and domestic shippers and providers. The survey results present not only the general view but also the comparisons of attitudes from different groups by using statistic methods.

25|$|Contemporary chroniclers are of {{the opinion}} that since Purandar Singha had passed his {{childhood}} through economic hardships during his father‚Äôs exile in Bengal, he was very much attracted to money and wealth. This explains the accusations which he had faced during both of his reigns. During his first reign, Purandar Singha and his father Brajanath Gohain, after being defeated by Burmese, fled to Guwahati taking all the valuables from the Royal treasury worth 3.5 million rupees, due to which the next ruler Chandrakanta Singha faced economic hardships in gathering mercenaries and maintaining the army to fight Burmese. During his second reign, as tributary prince under British, it was found that Purandar Singha was busy gathering personal wealth, instead of taking care of administration, which resulted in the growth of corruption among his officials. Some historians also stated his character as stubborn and firm from the fact that he refused to accept any pensions or grants from British Government. His son, Kameswar Singha also refused to accept pension from the British Government. Some sources said that it was actually Maniram Dewan who advised both father and son, not to accept any pension, as it might weaken their petition to restore their kingdom. After the fall of Ahom kingdom by Burmese invasion and subsequently by British occupation, Purandar Singha got <b>an</b> <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> to restore Ahom rule in Upper Assam, but he ruined the chance by failing to pay the annual tribute of 50,000 rupees, resulted in the annexation of his kingdom by British, putting an end of 600 years of rule by Ahom dynasty.|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} the Harvard Pigeon Lab {{is a history of}} two periods of {{remarkable}} productivity, the first under Skinner's leadership and the second under Herrnstein's.

40|$|One key {{objective}} of the EU Constitutional Treaty was to democratize the Union, through the twin process of constitutionalization and parliamentarization. As such, these two developments {{might be seen as}} steps in the right direction. But, contrary to their democratizing intention, this paper will argue that both constitutionalization and parlamentarization are in fact aggravating the existing deficits in foreign policy and in defence. This is a dimension that has been much less noticed in the (academic) literature, which has tended to focus on the ratification problems. Thus, by failing to democratize the CFSP, the new Treaty represents <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> lost <b>opportunity.</b> In addition, by bringing in the national parliaments, it is worsening the current lack of democratic scrutiny, because national foreign policies also suffer from their own respective democratic gaps. Finally, by extending the CFSP‚Äôs competence to defence, the situation becomes even more problematic: defence policy is notorious for its lack of democratic scrutiny. It is not the objective of this paper to argue against constitutionalization or parliamentarization. But it is its objective to signal their negative implications for the democratic scrutiny of an expanding EU foreign, security and defence agenda...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the first}} wave of planes struck at 7:50, Nevada, moored near Arizona, had partial steam up. At 8:03, the ship took a torpedo hit near frame 40 and began to list.

25|$|In spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched {{with a large}} army {{against the}} Albanians and their leader, Skenderbeg, who had long {{resisted}} the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy. For the Albanians, {{the outbreak of the}} Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War offered <b>a</b> <b>golden</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reassert their independence; for the Venetians, the Albanians provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of Durazzo and Scutari. The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of Elbasan, allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically sited fortress, at the lowlands {{near the end of the}} old Via Egnatia, cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skenderbeg's base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south. However, following the Sultan's withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid. On his return in early 1467, his forces sallied from the highlands, defeated Ballaban Pasha, and lifted the siege of the fortress of Croia (Kruj√´); they also attacked Elbasan but failed to capture it. Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania. He energetically pursued the attacks against the Albanian strongholds, while sending detachments to raid the Venetian possessions to keep them isolated. The Ottomans failed again to take Croia, and they failed to subjugate the country. However, the winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance. Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus (Lezh√´), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage. The Albanians were left to their own devices and were gradually subdued over the next decade.|$|E
