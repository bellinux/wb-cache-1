25|$|White {{police on}} the Cleveland force reacted bitterly toward Stokes after the Glenville shootout, blaming him for {{supporting}} radicals like Evans and for providing him with the funds to arm himself. Police began anonymously taunting Stokes and hurling racial epithets <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>over</b> police radios. At a police union meeting on August 1, 600 police voted overwhelmingly to demand the resignation of Public Safety Director James McManamon. In an attempt to turn the police department around, Stokes agreed in September 1968 to establish Cleveland's first SWAT unit, so that the police could deal with situations like the Glenville shootout {{in which there was}} heavy gunfire and entrenched gunmen. He also agreed to hire 500 new police officers, purchase 164 new patrol cars, and establish a police training academy. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People began urging African Americans to apply for the new positions, and Police Chief Blackwell agreed to racially integrate all police patrols in the Glenville neighborhood.|$|E

500|$|Alaphilippe {{said after}} the race {{that he had not}} been {{intending}} to go for the sprint {{at the end of the}} race; the team's plan was to set up Kwiatkowski. He started sprinting only after his directeur sportif shouted [...] "go, go" [...] <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>over</b> the radio. Alaphilippe said that he had briefly thought that he was going to win the sprint; his second-place finish was, however, the most important result of his career so far. He said, [...] "For my first time performance here, I can't help but be pleased." [...] Albasini's third place was better than his team had expected: before the race, 's directeur sportif Matt White had not expected him to be as strong because of the addition of the extra climb. Albasini himself also described the race as [...] "a lot tenser"; he also said that Valverde was [...] "one of the strongest guys in those kinds of finishes".|$|E
500|$|... "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] {{was written}} by Dana Gould and {{directed}} by Pete Michels. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. The idea for the episode was also pitched by Gould, who had just moved to southern California with his wife. After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, [...] "the police aren't enough. Too many people wanna kill you." [...] When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes {{the owner of a}} security company, which then became [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge." [...] Although current showrunner Al Jean found it [...] "very funny," [...] the episode's first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read out loud to the other writers. During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store, causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was [...] "somewhat obsessed" [...] with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said [...] "I love the idea of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels." [...] While trying to determine who stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>over</b> there, eating that apple. What is he planning?" [...] Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because it bothered the character's voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed. American actor Joe Mantegna reprises his role as Fat Tony in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|Kočić left Gomionica {{after two}} years and {{completed}} his primary education at the Eastern Orthodox religious school in Banja Luka, though {{he returned to the}} monastery every summer in order to spend time with his father. Kočić was the best student in his class at the religious school, and upon graduating in 1891, he departed for Sarajevo to attend high school at the First Sarajevo Gymnasium. During his first three years, he excelled in subjects such as mathematics, as well as Greek, Latin, German and Serbo-Croatian, which the Austro-Hungarians deemed the [...] "language of the land" [...] (zemaljski jezik), so as not to become entangled in local ethno-linguistic disputes. Kočić experienced a violent fit in his fourth year, swearing at a theology teacher and throwing a textbook <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>over</b> a poor grade. He was dismissed from the classroom and subjected to a monetary fine. According to a classmate, the outburst changed Kočić, [...] "turning him from an ambitious, disciplined student, into a truant and frequenter of kafanas and bars." [...] Following an incident in which a visibly intoxicated Kočić and his friends verbally abused Muslim students in a hotel bar, Kočić was expelled from the Gymnasium. He found himself unable to enroll into any of the high schools in Bosnia, having apparently drawn the ire of the Austro-Hungarian authorities. Kočić was forced to continue his education in neighbouring Serbia and enrolled into a Belgrade high school, from which he graduated in 1899.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second half}} of the season saw Oliver face public furore after he was {{involved}} in separate on-field incidents. At the half-time break of the round fourteen match against West Coast, he was hit by West Coast's Will Schofield in which Schofield was immediately reported and consequently charged by the match review panel for striking. Oliver was publicly criticised by fans for [...] "staging" [...] and [...] "diving" [...] along with former Australian Test cricketer, Damien Martyn, tweeting [...] "am I watching soccer???" [...] in relation to the incident, to which Oliver responded on Twitter [...] "hey Damien, you should just worry about that shot in 1994. #amiwatchingachoker" [...] in reference to a batting shot against South Africa in the 1994 Sydney Test match which eventually saw Australia narrowly losing to South Africa. Former Richmond player, Matthew Richardson, publicly defended Oliver amid claims he was a stager by saying [...] "unless you're the one who's received that contact, how do you really know ... he seems like a straight-up, honest kid". Schofield successfully appealed the original charge after arguing that while [...] "he intended to strike Oliver and hit him with his forearm to the chin, the contact was so negligible it was not sufficient for a report". Two weeks later during the round sixteen match against , Oliver confronted a Carlton supporter who was sitting in the front row of the Melbourne Cricket Ground after the supporter had yelled something <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>over</b> the fence. He was publicly condemned by former players including Leigh Matthews and Nick Dal Santo who stated players needed to ignore the crowd during matches and not confront them.|$|E

60|$|Bill punched <b>at</b> <b>'im</b> <b>over</b> the bar, and {{not being}} able to reach 'im threw Peter's pot o' beer <b>at</b> <b>'im.</b> There was a fearful to-do then, and the {{landlord}} jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway, whistling for the police. Bill struck out right and left, and the men in the bar went down like skittles, Peter among them. Then they got outside, and Bill, arter giving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the whistle, jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter 'im.|$|R

60|$|Colonel Parsons {{was sitting}} in the dining-room, twirling his old Panama in a great state of excitement; he had {{interrupted}} his wife at her accounts, and she was looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> good-humouredly <b>over</b> her spectacles.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. As though {{against her}} will, {{she turned her}} head and looked up <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{standing}} <b>over</b> her bedside. Again there was the faint shrinking away, again her troubled eyes seemed held by his against her will.|$|R
60|$|His friend glances slyly <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>over</b> his glass, {{not sure}} whether he is {{expected}} to be amused or sympathetically helpful.|$|E

60|$|Yes, {{it sounded}} incredible, {{and yet she}} {{saw that it was}} true. As Elspeth {{returned}} at that moment, Grizel could say nothing. She stood looking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> only <b>over</b> her high collar of fur. Tommy actually thought that she was admiring him.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked up}} <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{standing}} <b>over</b> me there, tall and handsome, {{no change in}} him except he was so brown and had a little white scar on his forehead; and, though I couldn't understand at all, being all bewildered-like, I felt a great deep thankfulness.|$|R
6000|$|Now she knew, and {{her arms}} rocked convulsively. Joy surged to her face, and she drove it back. She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadfastly <b>over</b> {{the collar of}} her jacket; she looked long, {{as if trying to}} be {{suspicious}} of him for the last time. Ah, Grizel, you are saying good-bye to your best friend! ...|$|R
