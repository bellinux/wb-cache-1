40|$|Cellulose, {{which is}} one of the most-abundant and -renewable natural resources, has been {{extensively}} explored as an <b>alternative</b> <b>substance</b> for electrode materials such as activated carbons. Here, we demonstrate a new class of coffee-mediated green activation of cellulose as a new environmentally benign chemical-activation strategy and its potential use for all-paper flexible supercapacitors. A piece of paper towel is soaked in espresso coffee (acting as a natural activating agent) and then pyrolyzed to yield paper-derived activated carbons (denoted as EK-ACs). Potassium ions (K+), a core ingredient of espresso, play a viable role in facilitating pyrolysis kinetics and also in achieving a well-developed microporous structure in the EK-ACs. As a result, the EK-ACs show significant improvement in specific capacitance (131 F g- 1 at a scan rate of 1. 0 mV s- 1) over control ACs (64 F g- 1) obtained from the carbonization of a pristine paper towel. All-paper flexible supercapacitors are fabricated by assembling EK-ACs/carbon nanotube mixture-embedded paper towels (as electrodes), poly(vinyl alcohol) /KOH mixture-impregnated paper towels (as electrolytes), and polydimethylsiloxane-infiltrated paper towels (as packaging substances). The introduction of the EK-ACs (as an electrode material) and the paper towel (as a deformable and compliant substrate) enables the resulting all-paper supercapacitor to provide reliable and sustainable cell performance as well as exceptional mechanical flexibility. Notably, no appreciable loss in the cell capacitance is observed after repeated bending (over 5000 cycles) or multiple folding.

Nakon istražnih radova, uzimajući u obzir neprimjerene uvjete u kojima se umjetnina dugo nalazila, odlučeno je da se upotrijebe materijali otporniji na oscilaciju vlage i {{temperature}} od onih prirodnog podrijetla. Polivinil-alkohol Mowiol 4 – 8 (netradicionalni materijal za kitiranje i preparaciju), koji je komplementaran s originalnim materijalima, odabran je i zbog svojstva dugotrajne reverzibilnosti. Ovim je radom izložen kratak pregled konzervatorsko-restauratorskih radova na ukrasnom okviru, a ujedno je i revidirana analiza Mowiola 4 – 88 kao restauratorskog materijala. The goal of {{this research}} was to encourage conservators and restorers to re-evaluate traditional fillings, of which only a small number meet the criteria of ageing characteristics, including reversibility, preservation of flexibility, colour stability, and resistance to mould and rot. The research was a result of the practical need to preserve a decorative gilded and polychrome frame from the parish church in Vranjic (17 th c. ?) and to provide substantiated scientific data on the basis of which polyvinyl alcohol would become a fully accepted <b>alternative</b> <b>substance</b> for use as a binding ingredient in fillings and chalk bases. Another goal of the research was to emphasize the need to sort decorative frames, since high-quality frames of this kind are a much-appreciated element of our heritage and, after completion of the research, they could be published. The frame a tortiglione, with rhythmical alteration of black and gilded surfaces, resembles the decorative frames of the Lombard region which appeared {{in the second half of}} the 16 th c. The primary goal of the conservation-restoration intervention was to preserve the artefact’s integrity by presenting the well-preserved original layer of the black polychromy and water gilding. The exploration suggested that it would be difficult to remove two layers of paint, so an alternative system for paint removal was devised, similar to the so-called Pettenkofer’s method for softening the paint film by using vapour as a solvent. The second goal was to use reversible materials whose characteristics would be better than those of organic materials. Extensive research based on an analysis of the condition of the frame material confirmed that it would be better to use polyvinyl alcohol, manufactured under the name ‘Mowiol 4 – 88 ’, for filling and preparing the chalk base. Mowiol’s physical and chemical features are presented in detail, to facilitate the reader’s understanding of the decision. The third and final goal of the research was to meet the formal requirement of integrating the decorative frame and the painting Adoration of the Shepherds, which was much better preserved...|$|E
40|$|History {{shows us}} that {{refrigerant}} choice was never easy, with an evolvement from natural refrigerants to synthesized refrigerants, and maybe back to natural ones. Pursuing <b>alternative</b> <b>substance</b> or technology with zero ozone depleting potential (ODP) once was the priority concern of governments and manufacturers and {{was regarded as a}} long-term solution {{and the best way to}} protect the environment since the Montreal Protocol has been enforced to phase out all ozone depleting refrigerants that have been commonly used in air-conditioning. While the consequence of Climate Change issue is better known today, this argument will be challenged because of future sustainability concerns, and to be more precisely, refrigerant selections anticipate the need to mitigate greenhouse effect as well. Manufacturers have commercialized more than 50 new refrigerants (including blends) in the last decade, and they are examining additional candidates. There is no general rule governing the selection of refrigerants. But basically refrigerants are examined according to some classic criteria in thermodynamic properties, technological and economic aspects and safety and environmental factors. Many relevant research and programs are conducted and most of their concentrate on one indicator such as energy efficiency or flammability of refrigerants, or in a given appliance under some specific standards, without careful consideration of regional differences such as local climatic conditions, local regulations and standards and "cultural" criteria associated with professions, applications, customs and user training levels. Unfortunately no current refrigerants are ideal. Furthermore, future discovery of ideal refrigerant is extremely unlikely. Thus, from the perspective of different countries, how to make an informed choice from the existing imperfect candidates remains a tough challenge. In this paper, methodologies were demonstrated to evaluate some typical refrigerants based on their performance in safety issues, environmental protection, and economic efficiency, with thermodynamic property and technology innovation incorporated from a whole country's perspective. Aiming at providing suggestions and recommendations to the national room air conditioning industry associations and also international manufacturers, the differences of local climatic conditions, technical gap, customer's use habit and environmental awareness among countries and regions are taken into consideration. Meanwhile case study of China and Japan utilizing this methodology are analyzed and compared. Additionally weighting methodology and its distance-to-target principle were also introduced briefly, as well as their important application in refrigerant selection. The results of the research showed: >In safety aspect, specific hazards from refrigerant always fall into two categories: toxicity and flammability, and their corresponding indicators TLV-TWA and HOC were chosen. Based on classification standard involving these indicators, the refrigerants currently being widely used in air conditioning industry are all categorized into group A 1, with the properties of non-flammability and low toxicity, except R 717. The HC alternatives, particularly R 290, which attract the attention of air conditioning and refrigeration industry recently, are proven to have higher flammability and accidents occurred due to their high flammability. China and Japan have showed different acceptance on the flammable refrigerants which may lead to the different refrigerant selection in the future. On one side China believes the bright future of R 290 and its risk management, while on the other hand Japan's lowest requirement in flammability is A/B 2 L. Further risk assessment is needed if flammable refrigerants are utilized in the processed of production, transportation, operation, after sales service and disposal. Moreover special training is suggested to be provided to the services suppliers and corresponding requirements are recommended to deliver the after sales services of air conditioners. >In Environmental protection aspect, Ozone depletion and global warming are the main impacts caused by refrigerants. Consequently ODP and TEWI are carefully examined and then integrated into a whole environmental indicator by utilizing weighting methodology. TEWIs in average for a whole country when using different refrigerants vary a lot. In different cases, based on many factors such as total ownership of RAC, level of technology, energy structure, use habit and local climate conditions, the best or worst performers may change. In general, Japan has a smaller TEWI value when using the same refrigerant in the similar air conditioning system, mainly due to the technical gap and favorable local climatic conditions and energy structure. In terms of Environmental indicator, there exist great differences among countries for the same refrigerant. Despite the higher absolute value of TEWI and ODs emission by a Chinese room air conditioning system, the relative value of environmental impact to a whole country that it causes is still limited due to its much larger territory area and huger population than Japan. This difference may affect the sensitivity of the national industry to environmental sector and may even lead to the final different choice in refrigerants. Basically the second generation refrigerants have a much higher value for Environmental indicators than others due to high ODP while the natural refrigerants perform well in ozone depletion impact, but differ in global warming impact due to efficiency differences. >In economic efficiency aspect, price is the first concern. Basically the more complicated the chemical structure of refrigerant is, the more expensive it is. The availability also influences the selection process. Consequently the natural refrigerants keep a favorable position other than those synthesized refrigerants in HFCs. HFO 1234 yf has a much higher cost, including refrigerant price, production cost, handling cost and patent fees than the ones being used. Additional cost is required for flammable refrigerants when taking safety measures in application and handling. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(サステイナビリティ学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 4530 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科環境学研究系サステイナビリティ学教育プログラ...|$|E

30|$|Citrus fruit can be {{infected}} by many fungal pathogens in the postharvest storage. Among them, Penicillium digitatum {{is the most}} devastating pathogen and causing about 90  % of production losses during postharvest handling of the fruit (Droby et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2010). Currently, this disease is primarily controlled by applying synthetic fungicides (Cañamás et al. 2008). However, considerable scientific interest has been directed toward <b>alternative</b> <b>substances,</b> which were capable of controlling this disease by decreasing the resistance of postharvest fungal pathogens, and the fungicides were primary concerned for human safety and environmental protection in recent reports (Sharma and Tripathi 2008; Viuda-Martos et al. 2008).|$|R
50|$|Pinocytosis is used {{primarily}} for the absorption of extracellular fluids (ECF). In contrast to phagocytosis, it generates very small amounts of ATP from the wastes of <b>alternative</b> <b>substances</b> such as lipids (fat). Unlike receptor-mediated endocytosis, pinocytosis is nonspecific in the substances that it transports. The cell takes in surrounding fluids, including all solutes present. Pinocytosis also works as phagocytosis; {{the only difference is}} that phagocytosis is specific in the substances it transports. Phagocytosis engulfs whole particles, which are later broken down by enzymes, such as cathepsins, and absorbed into the cells. Pinocytosis, on the other hand, is when the cell engulfs already-dissolved or broken-down food.|$|R
