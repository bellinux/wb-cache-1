500|$|After Till went missing, a three-paragraph {{story was}} {{printed in the}} Greenwood Commonwealth and quickly picked up by other Mississippi newspapers. They {{reported}} on his death when the body was found. The next day, when {{a picture of him}} his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them smiling together appeared in the Jackson Daily News and Vicksburg Evening Post, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had caused Till's death. One read, [...] "Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction." [...] The letter said that Negroes were not the downfall of Mississippi society, but whites like those in White Citizens' Councils that condoned violence.|$|E
500|$|Maria and Anastasia {{were dressed}} {{similarly}} for special occasions, when they wore {{variations of the}} same dress. She tended {{to be dominated by}} her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, though she could never stop her younger sister. Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her [...] "fat little bow-wow." [...] In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given her own room and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that it was her own idea to write the letter. Her mother's friend, Lili Dehn, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, she knew her own mind. Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn and occasionally lazy. Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and [...] "bellowed" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> irritated her. Maria's moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from [...] "Madame Becker." ...|$|E

She stated that she doesn't [...] "believe in anarchistic violence but in directed violence," [...] with directed violence being that which is [...] "directed at the institutions which perpetuate capitalism, racism and sexism, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are the appointed guardians of those institutions, and accompanied by popular support." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was curious}} to {{contrast}} the lazy indifference of the attorneys’ clerks who {{were making a}} search for some legal purpose, with the air of earnestness and interest which distinguished the strangers to the place, who were looking up the will of some deceased relative; the former pausing {{every now and then}} with an impatient yawn, or raising their heads to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> passed up and down the room; the latter stooping over the book, and running down column after column of names in the deepest abstraction.|$|E

You figure us as curiously settled down in Utopia, as working for a low wage at wood-carving, until the authorities at the central registry in Paris can solve the perplexing problem we have set them. We stay in an inn looking out upon the lake, and go to and fro for our five hours' work a day, with a curious effect of having been born Utopians. The rest of our time is our own.|$|E

6000|$|... "Once," [...] {{began the}} leader, [...] "we were a free people, living happily {{in the great}} forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps {{some of us were}} rather too full of {{mischief}} at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> walked in the forest.

60|$|I {{gave the}} driver the {{necessary}} direction, and in renewed silence we drove on. Dirk {{had not been}} to the studio since the wretched morning on which they had taken Blanche to the hospital. I was glad {{he did not want}} me to accompany him, and when I left him at the door I walked away with relief. I took a new pleasure in the streets of Paris, and I looked with smiling eyes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> hurried to and fro. The day was fine and sunny, and I felt in myself a more acute delight in life. I could not help it; I put Stroeve and his sorrows out of my mind. I wanted to enjoy.|$|E
6000|$|And it {{went and}} it went through the forest and wilderness, till it arrived at a town full of fine houses.

'That,' thought the gazelle, 'is the house for my master, and I will call up my courage and go and look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are in it, if any people there are.

6000|$|At {{once the}} {{umbrella}} {{rose into the}} air, slowly at first, but quickly gathering speed. Trot and Button-Bright held fast to the ropes and were carried along very easily and comfortably. It seemed scarcely a minute before {{they were in the}} town, and when the umbrella set them down {{just in front of the}} store--for it seemed to know just where they wanted to go--a wondering crowd gathered around them. Trot ran in and changed the yarn, while Button-Bright stayed outside and stared <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> stared at him. They asked questions, too, wanting to know what sort of an aeroplane this was and where his power was stored and lots of other things, but the boy answered not a sound. When the little girl came back and took her seat, Button-Bright said, [...] "I want to go to Trot's house." ...|$|E
60|$|How much rock {{would have}} to be cut away, how much patient {{chipping}} before the edifice of which he had been dreaming could be reared! Could he ever do it?

He found his way to an elevated train, and as it swept along stared unseeing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> pushed and jostled him. Still under the spell, he reached his room and wrote to the lawyer thanking him, but saying that he had reconsidered coming to New York.

60|$|The wives {{had their}} pinks too, {{for the whole}} road to Bordeaux was {{scattered}} with flowers, and every one trooped out to bless the Princess and her son. As she entered the city the 400 vessels in the port fired all their guns three times over, and 30,000 men, escorting a splendid carriage, in which she went along at a foot's pace, came forth to welcome her. Her son was dressed in white taffety turned up with black and white feathers. He was held in a gentleman's arms at the window, and continually bowed, {{and held out his}} little hands to be kissed, saying that his father and grandfather had been quite right to love people who had such an affection for their house as these seemed to have.

60|$|He became {{tired of}} looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> passed, and of speculating about {{them through the}} second {{consciousness}} which enveloped the sad substance of his misgivings like an atmosphere; and he let his eyelids fall, as he leaned his head back against the tree behind his bench. Then their voices pursued him through the twilight {{that he had made}} himself, and forced him to the same weary conjecture as if he had seen their faces. He heard gay laughter, and laughter that affected gaiety; the tones of young men in earnest disquisition reached him through the veil, and the talk, falling to whisper, of girls, with the names of men in it; sums of money, a hundred francs, forty thousand francs, came in high tones; a husband and wife went by quarrelling in the false security of English, and snapping at each other as confidingly as if in the sanctuary of home. The man bade the woman not be a fool, and she asked him how she was to-endure his company if she was not a fool.|$|E
60|$|It was Sunday morning--a damp, warm November morning, {{with the}} sky {{overhead}} grey and low. Miss Reed stopped {{a little to}} take breath before climbing the hill, {{at the top of}} which, {{in the middle of the}} churchyard, was Blackstable Church. Miss Reed panted, and the sultriness made her loosen her jacket. She stood at the junction of the two roads which led to the church, one from the harbour end of the town and the other from the station. Behind her lay the houses of Blackstable, the wind-beaten houses with slate roofs of the old fishing village and the red brick villas of the seaside resort which Blackstable was fast becoming; in the harbour were the masts of the ships, colliers that brought coal from the north; and beyond, the grey sea, very motionless, mingling in the distance with the sky.... The peal of the church bells ceased, and was replaced by a single bell, ringing a little hurriedly, querulously, which denoted that there were only ten minutes before the beginning of the service. Miss Reed walked on; she looked curiously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> passed her, wondering....|$|E
