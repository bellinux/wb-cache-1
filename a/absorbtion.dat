50|$|The most {{immediate}} predecessor of the MBT and arguably {{the very first}} one is the Panzer V or Panther tank designed to counterbalance the Soviet designed T-34, with frontal armour that was not only thick but also sloped, making bullet deflection and <b>absorbtion</b> of shots more likely. It also was equipped with the long-barreled 75 mm KwK 42 L/70 gun roughly equal to the British 17-pounder, a gun able to defeat the armor of all but the heaviest Allied tank at long range. After the design was perfected, the powerful Maybach HL230 P30 engine and robust running gear meant that even though it tipped the scales at 50 tons - sizeable for its day - it was actually quite maneuverable, offering better off-road speed than the Panzer IV. It was not produced in particularly large numbers with around 6.000 built, compared {{to the more than}} 80.000 T-34 the Soviets were able to deploy, but the Panther might just be the most important tank design of all time, and post-war tank development everywhere tried to copy its statistics sheet.|$|E
50|$|Brassicaceae contain glucosinolates {{as well as}} myrosinases {{inside their}} cells. When the cell is damaged, the myrosinases hydrolises the glucosinolates, leading to the {{synthesis}} of isothiocyanates, which are compounds toxic to most animals, fungi and bacteria. Some insect herbivores have developed counter adaptations such as rapid <b>absorbtion</b> of the glucosinates, quick alternative breakdown into non-toxic compounds and avoiding cell damage. In the whites family (Pieridae), one counter mechanisme involves glucosinolate sulphatase, which changes the glucosinolate, so that it cannot be converted to isothiocyanate. A second is that the glucosinates are quickly broken down, forming nitriles. Differences between the mixtures of glucosinolates between species and even within species is large, and individual plants may produce in excess of fifty individual substances. The energy penalty for synthesising all these glucosinolates may {{be as high as}} 15% of the total needed to produce a leaf. Bittercress (Barbarea vulgaris) also produces triterpenoid saponins. These adaptations and counter adaptations probably have led to extensive diversification in both the Brassicaceae and one of its major pests, the butterfly family Pieridae. A particular cocktail of volatile glucosinates triggers egg-laying in many species. Thus a particular crop can sometimes be protected by planting bittercress as a deadly bait, for the saponins kill the caterpillars, but the butterfly is still lured by the bittercress to lay its egg on the leaves.A moth that feeds on a range of Brassicaceae is the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). Like the Pieridae, it is capable of converting isothiocyanates into less problematic nitriles. Managing this pest in crops became more complicated after resistance developed against a toxin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, which is used as a wide spectrum biological plant protection against caterpillars. Parasitoid wasps that feed on such insect herbivores are attracted to the chemical compounds released by the plants, and thus are able to locate their prey. The cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) stores glucosinolates and synthesises its own myrosinases, which may deter its potential predators.|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{computer}} axial tomography is a {{well established}} technique for producing images which show the spatial variation of X-ray linear attenuation coefficient within an object. X-ray differential K <b>absorbtion</b> edge tomography is the application of computer axial tomography to form images of selected atomic elements within an object, and these images show the distribution of specific atomic element concentration. The technique is to measure the attenuation of X-rays {{on either side of}} the K <b>absorbtion</b> edge of an atomic element with an energy dispersive X-ray detector, and then reconstruct an image of the location and concentration of that element in an object by means of a computer algorithm for display on a colour monitor. This method is able to image several atomic elements in one X-ray scan only of the object, in particular, consecutive elements in the Periodic Table of the Elements. One atomic element only within the object may be better selected by correcting for the X-ray attenuation of all the other elements, the matrix of the object, by extrapolating the measurements to the K <b>absorbtion</b> edge, thus measuring accurately the <b>absorbtion</b> coefficient of the analyte element only.

The surface is represented by a lattice of strength numbers which reduce after each <b>absorbtion</b> event, with sites being removed when their strength becomes negative.
