40|$|Introduction: Resuscitation and {{intensive}} care from the 26 weeks of gestation is usually mandatory {{in developed countries}} because infants born <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> {{have a very high}} chance of survival without severe disabilities. The period between the 22 - 25 week of gestation is known as the grey zone, during which the results of care are uncertain and unpredictable in advance. Thesis: Decision-making about offering intensive care at the threshold of viability is done in uncertainty, whether or not such treatment is at {{the best interest of the}} newborn, for out of principle, it is impossible to predict whether the infant will survive at all and if so, if it will continue to live without severe disability. Viability of the fetus and the newborn: Determining the threshold of viability (the ability to survive outside the uterus) is the initial point in considering medical treatment. Viability depends - aside from the level of maturity of the fetus and its health condition - on the advancement of medical technology. It is also based upon given socio-economical, and cultural factors. The threshold of viability in regard of the possibility to be born alive and survive lies between the 22 - 24 weeks. An expert agreement on providing active care is based upon the probability of survival and survival without serious [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine growth performance of partridge (A. chukar) fed by diets include different level of CP through 0 - 4 weeks of age. First, second, third and fourth groups had 28, 26, 24 and 22 % CP in diet, respectively. At the end of 4 weeks of growth period, live weights of group 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 125, 8, 128. 6, 124. 6 and 120. 4 g for males, 113. 4, 111. 3, 110. 3 and 105. 2 g for females, respectively. Protein levels in diet had significant effect on live weight at 1 st and 3 rd week of age only. However, sex had significant (P< 0. 001) effects on live weight of the birds through growth period. Different CP level in diet did not affected weekly and cumulative feed consumption significantly. Through 0 - 4 week of age, cumulative feed consumption of the groups was 194. 7, 190. 8, 195. 6 and 185. 5 g for group 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th, respectively. Differences among the groups in terms of FCR were significant (P< 0. 05) at 1 st week of age only, and birds fed by diet includes 26 % CP had the best FCR <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> FCR of the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th treatment groups were calculated as 1. 85, 1. 81, 1. 83 and 1. 89, respectively. As a result, it could be said that 28, 26, 24 and 22 % CP level in diet did not affect growth performance of partridges through 0 - 4 weeks of age when taking account live weight, feed consumption and FCR of the partridge...|$|E
