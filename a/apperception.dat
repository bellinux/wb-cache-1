The participants then participated in a structured Life Style Interview which dealt with their perceptions of their lives as young children in their families of origin. All questions were tape-recorded and later transcribed. A panel of experts in projective drawings analyzed the drawings and the transcriptions of the three questions and then summarized each participant's possible <b>apperceptions</b> about life. A panel of Adlerian psychologists analyzed the interview data and summarized <b>apperceptions.</b> The <b>apperceptions</b> were then compared.

25|$|The {{truth is}} that Cousin's {{doctrine}} of the spontaneous <b>apperception</b> of impersonal truth amounts {{to little more than}} a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.|$|E

25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} <b>apperception,</b> and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E
25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous <b>apperception</b> may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E

Based on personality traits, individuals may vary in how they perceive risk. Highly impulsive occupants, for example, may require a lower number of fire cues to perceive a high enough risk before they decide to take protective actions. One study found that the relation between personality traits and risky driving behavior was mediated by risk-related attitudes (Ulleberg and Rundmo 2003).|$|R

Namely, the questions raised concern two apparently incompatible concepts, revolution and representation/legitimacy of the political power through the individual expression of citizenship or through the collective expression of the general will.

This background didn't meet a coherent project of rational management of politics and production of the future as the post revolutionary nineteenth century European thought had intended to.

40|$|Purpose: {{analyze and}} {{summarize}} scientific {{information on the}} problem of technologies that are used in the process of physical education and rehabilitation for violations of posture and flat feet in children of older preschool age, according to special scientific and methodological literature. Material & Methods: theoretical analysis and generalization of literary and documentary sources included the use of a number of the following methods: the method of reconstruction, the method of <b>apperceptions,</b> aspect analysis, hermeneutic analysis, problem analysis. Results: despite a significant number of scientific studies on the prevention and correction of human posture disorders, recent results and their undoubted value for science and practice, it can be stated that the proposed technologies and methods do not fully allow to effectively cope with the steadily growing number of children senior preschool age with various functional disorders of the locomotor system. Conclusion: every year the number of children of senior preschool age with functional disorders of posture increases. Inadequate efficiency of health-improving measures for violations of the posture of children of senior preschool age by many researchers is due to the insufficiently developed technology for assessing her condition.

40|$|This article {{observes that}} dreams of {{treasure}} may {{not only be}} about getting rich. In Greece, a country with an illustrious ancient past and a less glorious present, history represents a vital national resource and enduring topic of social concern, not to say anxiety. Dreams of treasure arise as unconscious by-products of this intense historical consciousness in Greece. The treasures considered here are secretions of history, deposited at the moments of rupture that historians subsequently use to demarcate historical periods. Drawing upon the formulations of Heidegger and Binswanger, I further view these dreams as <b>apperceptions</b> of the temporality of being. The dream of treasure involves a divinatory look into the future to discover a past that will enrich the present. The motivations of historicization and temporalization thus converge in this case to create the dream of treasure as a significant cultural phenomenon in Greece.

40|$|Book synopsis: Walter Benjamin, critic, essayist, translator, philosopher – one of {{the twentieth}} century’s most {{influential}} intellectuals – continues to intrigue today. His work stimulates a profusion of responses {{in the form of}} new novels, operas, films and artworks, as well as a never-abating production of academic texts. In this new biography, the first to be written in over a decade, author Esther Leslie uses the recently published entirety of Benjamin’s correspondence, drawing on his numerous diaries and autobiographical works, in order to provide a careful account of his circumstances and thoughts. Benjamin had many interests: he cherished childhood and its trappings; had a passion for the displacement and novelty of travel; toys; cities; trick-books; and ships; all are given due attention as the author weaves Benjamin’s wayward <b>apperceptions</b> into the narrative of a life lived. She follows Benjamin as he travels from Berlin to Capri, Ibiza, Riga, Moscow, Paris, and finally the Spanish border where he died in 1940. The author acknowledges Benjamin’s thesis that personal histories can be traced only in the context of social milieus, economic forces, technological shifts, and historical events, and seamlessly interweaves biographical details with an accessible yet concentrated account of Benjamin’s intellectual development, drawing a colourful portrait of a capacious intellect trapped in increasingly hostile circumstances. Leslie’s meticulous attention to Benjamin’s political, intellectual, geographical and cultural journeying challenges the populist depiction of the intellectual as a tragic and lonely figure. Walter Benjamin restores its subject to his proper place as an artistic combatant and a man desirous of and relishing experience...|$|R

Aristotle touched this point in his distinction between $oi~X~-ns and srpoatpecric. The sudden and unpremeditated wish represented by the former is wholly inferior in character to the free choice of the latter, guided and illumined by intelligence. In this we can deliberately resolve upon what is in our power; in that we are subject to the vain impulse of wishing the impossible. Spontaneity is pleasing, sometimes beautiful, but it is not in this instance the highest quality of the thing to be obtained. That is to be found in a guiding and illumining reflective activity.|$|E
40|$|Introduction A high {{frequency}} of cognitive and behavioural disturbances {{has been reported}} in preterm children. It is not known if this affects the children’s <b>apperceptions</b> or behaviours during dental treatment. The aim was therefore to investigate dental behavioural management problems (BMP) and dental anxiety (DA) in preterm children from age 3 - 14, and to compare with matched controls. Materials and Methods 187 preterm children (23 - 32 weeks of gestation), born 1994 - 96 were followed regarding BMP and DA. Comparisons were made with matched full-term controls. Data on BMP were collected from dental records for the ages 3 and 6 yrs. During the school years, parents were interviewed twice regarding BMP in their children. Two periods of time were covered; preschool period, and early school years. Finally, at 12 - 14 yrs the children filled out the CFSS-DS scale, measuring DA. Results During pre-school years pre-term children showed significantly more BMP at various kinds of dental treatments (32 % vs. 15 %; p< 0. 001). This was confirmed in the first interviews of the parents (20 %vs. 10 %; p= 0. 028). At the second interviews, covering early school years, no {{differences were found between the}} groups. This was also verified by the children’s scorings on CFSS-DS at age 12 - 14 where no differences in mean scores were revealed. Conclusion Children born preterm seem to have a high prevalence of BMP during preschool years. But this difference decreases with increasing age, possibly reflecting a catch-up. At school years and early adolescence no differences were seen between the groups regarding BMP or DA...|$|R

The subject of this research was class VIII B of SMP N I Ponjong totaled 32 students. The object of this study was the overall implementation of the mathematics teachings on the materials of surface area and volume of cube and beam geometry using Guided Discovery Learning. The research data were obtained through observations of the implementation of the teachings, student’s creativity questionnaires, tests, interviews, and documentation. The results showed that the application of Guided Discovery Learning method could enhance students' creativities of class VIII B of SMP N I Ponjong in learning mathematics. The teaching process with Guided Discovery method was as follows: (1) Introduction, namely teacher provided <b>apperceptions</b> to see the readiness of students; (2) the Core activities, namely students working on worksheets that have been prepared specifically for the Guided Discovery Learning method; and (3) Conclusion, namely students and teachers concluded what have been found during the teaching. Increasing students' creativity could be seen from the increase in every aspect of creativity examined, namely: (1) Curiosity (74 %), although still in the moderate category but increased 8 %; (2) Able to work alone (76 %), an increase of 2 % with high category; (3) Happy to try something new (73 %), although still within the moderate category but increased by 10 %; (4) able to give opinions (80 %), up 7 % with high category; and (5) Dare to take the risk (84 %), an increase of 3 % with high category...|$|R
