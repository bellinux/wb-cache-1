5|$|Rain {{falling on}} loosely packed {{material}} such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples {{that can be}} fossilized. The <b>air</b> <b>density</b> dependence of the maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints {{has been used to}} constrain the density of the air 2.7 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} and fourth days (September 1 and 2, 1983), work began with the Canadarm Remote Manipulator System and the payload test article, and {{communications}} testing through TDRS continued. The former was successful, but the latter lost contact on a number of occasions, due to problems at the White Sands ground station. As a result, the crew had to be awakened early on September 1 {{in order to deal with}} the problem. A minor cabin pressure leak on September 2 was traced to the waste management system, and quickly controlled. The orbiter performed an Orbital Maneuvering System firing on September 2 to place itself in a lower orbit, where the <b>air</b> <b>density</b> was higher and the oxygen interaction experiments would work more effectively.|$|E

50|$|Most spacecraft, {{most notably}} the Space Shuttle are {{supersonic}} at least during portions of their reentry, though the effects on the spacecraft are reduced by low <b>air</b> <b>densities.</b> During ascent, launch vehicles generally avoid going supersonic below 30 km (~98,400 feet) to reduce air drag.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine <b>air</b> <b>densities</b> derived from our {{realization}} of aeronomic atmosphere models based on accelerometer measurements from satellites {{in a low}} Earth's orbit (LEO). Using the adapted algorithms we derive comparison parameters. The first results concerning the adjustment of the aeronomic models to the total-density model are given...|$|R
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and <b>air</b> <b>density.</b> With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
25|$|True {{airspeed}} {{differs from}} the equivalent airspeed because the airspeed indicator is calibrated at SL, ISA conditions, where the <b>air</b> <b>density</b> is 1.225kg/m³, whereas the <b>air</b> <b>density</b> in flight normally differs from this value.|$|E
25|$|At about 80 seconds, {{the rocket}} {{experienced}} maximum dynamic pressure (max Q). The dynamic pressure on a rocket varies with <b>air</b> <b>density</b> and {{the square of}} relative velocity. Although velocity continues to increase, <b>air</b> <b>density</b> decreases so quickly with altitude that dynamic pressure falls below max Q.|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{were made}} in the {{variable}} density wind tunnel to determine the pressure distribution over one section of a R. A. F. 31 airfoil with a leading edge slot fully open. To provide data for the study of scale effect on this type of airfoil, the tests were conducted with <b>air</b> <b>densities</b> of approximately one and twenty atmospheres...|$|R
50|$|The {{charge air}} cooler, located between the {{turbocharger}} {{and the engine}} air inlet manifold, is an air-to-air heat exchanger. It reduces the inlet air temperatures of turbocharged diesel engines from 200°C to 45°C while increasing inlet <b>air</b> <b>densities</b> to increase engine efficiencies. Even higher inlet temperatures (246°C or higher) and boost pressures {{may be necessary to}} comply with the emissions standards in the future.|$|R
50|$|If the {{throttle}} is opened {{all the way}} in condition 2, the manifold absolute pressure will increase from 50 kPa to nearly 100 kPa (14.5 psi, 29.53 inHG), about equal to the local barometer, which in condition 2 is sea level. The higher absolute pressure in the intake manifold increases the <b>air's</b> <b>density,</b> and in turn more fuel can be burned resulting in higher output.|$|R
25|$|One {{difference}} of air speed in every air column invariably occurs, however, near the ground/sea, also if the <b>air</b> <b>density</b> {{is the same}} anywhere and no vertical motion occurs.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, {{when one}} {{considers}} a column of atmosphere, it is seldom {{the case that the}} <b>air</b> <b>density</b> is the same all the height up, since temperature and moisture content, hence density, do change with height.|$|E
25|$|In air, objects {{experience}} a supporting buoyancy force which reduces the apparent strength of gravity (as measured by an object's weight). The {{magnitude of the}} effect depends on <b>air</b> <b>density</b> (and hence air pressure); see Apparent weight for details.|$|E
50|$|<b>Air's</b> <b>density</b> is {{very small}} {{compared}} to most solids and liquids. For this reason, the weight of an object in air is approximately the same as its true weight in a vacuum. The buoyancy of air is neglected for most objects during a measurement in air because the error is usually insignificant (typically less than 0.1% except for objects of very low average density such as a balloon or light foam).|$|R
50|$|Forced {{induction}} {{is used in}} {{the automotive}} and aviation industry to increase engine power and efficiency. A forced induction engine is essentially two compressors in series. The compression stroke of the engine is the main compression that every engine has. An additional compressor feeding into the intake of the engine causes forced induction of air. A compressor feeding pressure into another greatly increases the total compression ratio of the entire system. This intake pressure is called boost. This particularly helps aviation engines, as they need to operate at higher altitudes with lower <b>air</b> <b>densities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Upper‐atmosphere <b>air</b> <b>densities</b> and {{temperatures}} have been {{calculated from the}} measured trajectory data of a falling sphere. Densities were calculated from the equation for the drag force on the falling sphere, {{and temperatures}} were then obtained by using the hydrostatic equation and the equation of state of a perfect gas. The aerodynamic background and instrumentation are described; the method of calculation and the errors are discussed. The results of four rocket flights which carried the experiment are given. Comparison with the average of other rocket measurements indicates agreement with these results...|$|R
25|$|For air bursts {{at or near}} sea-level, 50–60% of the explosion's energy {{goes into}} the blast wave, {{depending}} on the size and the yield of the bomb. As a general rule, the blast fraction is higher for low yield weapons. Furthermore, it decreases at high altitudes because there is less air mass to absorb radiation energy and convert it into blast. This effect is most important for altitudes above 30km, corresponding to less than 1 percent of sea-level <b>air</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E
25|$|Efficiency: For maglev systems the {{lift-to-drag}} ratio can exceed that of aircraft (for example Inductrack can approach 200:1 at high speed, {{far higher than}} any aircraft). This can make maglev more efficient per kilometer. However, at high cruising speeds, aerodynamic drag is much larger than lift-induced drag. Jets take advantage of low <b>air</b> <b>density</b> at high altitudes to significantly reduce air drag. Hence despite their {{lift-to-drag ratio}} disadvantage, they can travel more efficiently at high speeds than maglev trains that operate at sea level.|$|E

The cartridge is designed for the MP7. This ammunition is optimized for energy transfer in soft targets and should offer good precision. The muzzle velocity V0 and V100 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.171 to 0.187 (BC's are somewhat debatable). At the stated effective range of 200m the 2.7g Ball projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.36 (463m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (<b>air</b> <b>density</b> ρ=1.225kg/m3).|$|E

The results reveal that many cities are strengthening their position as international air transportation hubs, especially: Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, New York, and Miami. Finally, the results show that the <b>air</b> traffic <b>density</b> of three cities, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Amsterdam, is growing at an extraordinary rate.

The cartridge is designed for the MP7. This ammunition is optimized for energy transfer in soft targets and should offer decent penetration performance on hard and combined targets like car doors or glass and body armour. The muzzle velocity V0 and V50 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.112 to 0.119 (BC's are somewhat debatable). At the stated effective range of 200m the 2g Action projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.67 (586m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (<b>air</b> <b>density</b> ρ = 1.225 kg/m3).|$|E
25|$|Cubic {{feet per}} minute (CFM) is an often {{confusing}} term {{because it has}} no single definition that applies to all instances. Gases are compressible, which means that a figure in cubic feet per minute cannot necessarily be compared with another figure when it comes {{the mass of the}} gas. To further confuse the issue, a centrifugal fan is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device. This means that, provided the fan speed remains constant, a centrifugal fan will pump a constant volume of air. This {{is not the same as}} pumping a constant mass of air. Again, the fan will pump the same volume, though not mass, at any other <b>air</b> <b>density.</b> This means that the air velocity in a system is the same even though mass flow rate through the fan is not.|$|E
25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require light control inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher <b>air</b> <b>density</b> and lack of a power assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. Control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E

25|$|Energy from {{a nuclear}} {{explosive}} is initially released in several forms of penetrating radiation. When {{there is a}} surrounding material such as air, rock, or water, this radiation interacts with and rapidly heats it to an equilibrium temperature (i.e. so that the matter {{is at the same}} temperature as the atomic bomb's matter). This causes vaporization of surrounding material resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shockwave. When a nuclear detonation occurs in air near sea level, much of the released energy interacts with the atmosphere and creates a shockwave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball and if the burst is low enough, it is often associated with a mushroom cloud. In a burst at high altitude, where the <b>air</b> <b>density</b> is low, more energy is released as ionizing gamma radiation and x-rays than an atmosphere-displacing shockwave.|$|E
25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the <b>air</b> <b>density</b> drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude. When the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|E

25|$|A flow bench {{consists}} of an air pump of some sort, a metering element, pressure and temperature measuring instruments such as manometers, and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the volume flow rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known. The mass flow rate can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate <b>air</b> <b>densities,</b> and multiplying by the volume flow rate.|$|R
30|$|Gravity waves which {{propagate}} {{higher up}} into the atmosphere (e.g., into the stratosphere and mesosphere) grow in amplitude due to decreasing <b>air</b> <b>densities.</b> When gravity waves propagate through the airglow layers, the densities of atoms, molecules, and ions that cause photochemical reactions fluctuate. As a result, the airglow layers show 2 D wave patterns. This means that in the horizontal airglow extent, the areas with strong and weak emission intensities change both temporarily and spatially. Consequently, temporal and spatial structures of gravity waves can be mapped by observing the airglow intensity images taken with a sensitive CCD camera, enabling researchers to study the dynamic processes occurring in the mesosphere.|$|R
