5|$|Most of {{the visual}} effects on Labyrinth were {{achieved}} in-camera, with several notable exceptions. The most prominent of these post-production effects was the computer-generated owl that appears {{at the opening of}} the film. The sequence was created by animators Larry Yaeger and Bill Kroyer, and marked the first use of a realistic CGI animal in a film. The owl head maquette had to be rescued from <b>a</b> <b>skip</b> (dumpster) when Omnibus, the animation company, went bankrupt in 1987.|$|E
5|$|McCauley was {{an active}} member of the Edmonton community. He served as a {{director}} of the Edmonton Agricultural Association for 16 years. The association brought the Edmonton Exhibition to Edmonton, one of the prominent fairs of the west at the time. As telephone service was brought to Edmonton, McCauley was one of the first to receive one installed. His telephone number was #1. When John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair would visit Edmonton for business, McCauley and his wife would usually be the ones to entertain him. Also an avid curler, McCauley was a founder of the Royal Curling Club in Edmonton and led his curling team where he served as <b>a</b> <b>skip.</b> He also enjoyed other sports, including horse carriage racing.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, {{the model}} M400 was released, which {{contained}} 35 notes (G–F) and a removable tape frame. It sold over 1,800 units. By the early 1970s, hundreds {{of the instruments}} were assembled and sold by EMI under exclusive licence. Following a financial and trademark dispute through a US distribution agreement, the Mellotron name was acquired by American-based Sound Sales. Streetly-manufactured instruments after 1976 were sold under the name Novatron. The American Mellotron distributor, Sound Sales, produced their own Mellotron model, the 4-Track, in the early 1980s. At the same time Streetly Electronics produced a road-cased version of the 400– the T550 Novatron. By the mid-1980s, both Sound Sales and Streetly Electronics suffered severe financial setbacks, losing their market to synthesizers and solid-state electronic samplers, which rendered the Mellotron essentially extinct. The company folded in 1986, and Les Bradley threw most of the manufacturing equipment into <b>a</b> <b>skip.</b> From 1963 until Streetly's closure, around 2,500 units had been built.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{method by}} which purportedly {{meaningful}} messages have been extracted is the Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS). To obtain an ELS from a text, choose a starting point (in principle, any letter) and <b>a</b> <b>skip</b> number, also freely and possibly negative. Then, beginning at the starting point, select letters from the text at equal spacing as given by the skip number. For example, the bold letters in this sentence form an ELS. With <b>a</b> <b>skip</b> of −4 (that is, reading backwards every fourth letter), and ignoring the spaces and punctuation, the word safest is spelled out.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{consider}} a street where the odd-numbered houses {{are all on}} the north (expensive) side of the road, and the even-numbered houses are all on the south (cheap) side. Under the sampling scheme given above, {{it is impossible to}} get a representative sample; either the houses sampled will all be from the odd-numbered, expensive side, or they will all be from the even-numbered, cheap side, unless the researcher has previous knowledge of this bias and avoids it by a using <b>a</b> <b>skip</b> which ensures jumping between the two sides (any odd-numbered skip).|$|E
25|$|Creeling {{involved}} {{replacing the}} rovings bobbins {{in a section}} of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a bobbin lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into <b>a</b> <b>skip.</b> With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E
25|$|Systematic {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} interval sampling) relies on arranging {{the study population}} according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. Systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size). It {{is important that the}} starting point is not automatically the first in the list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list. A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory (an 'every 10th' sample, also referred to as 'sampling with <b>a</b> <b>skip</b> of 10').|$|E

The company rented the sign to Nycander & Co who in turn placed the sign on top of their Nycander factory at 627 Victoria Street in 1936. The sign advertising their [...] "Skipping Girl" [...] brand of vinegar was immediately popular, becoming a well loved landmark.

Nailed To A Wall had a reserve price of £500,000, half the face value of the cash used in its construction, which Scotland on Sundays reporter Robert Dawson Scott was [...] "fairly confident... really was £1 million [...] ". The catalogue entry for the artwork stated: [...] "Over the years the face value will be eroded by inflation, while the artistic value will rise and rise. The precise point at which the artistic value will overtake the face value is unknown. Deconstruct the work now and you double your money. Hang it on a wall and watch the face value erode, the market value fluctuate, and the artistic value soar. The choice is yours." ...|$|E

500|$|Holden's {{original}} {{plan for the}} university building was for a single structure covering the whole site, stretching almost [...] from Montague Place to Torrington Street. It comprised a central spine linked {{by a series of}} wings to the perimeter façade and enclosing a series of courtyards. The scheme was to be topped by two towers; the taller Senate House and a smaller one to the north. The design featured elevations of load-bearing brick work faced with Portland stone. Construction began in 1932 and was undertaken by Holland, Hannen & Cubitts. King George V laid the ceremonial foundation stone on 26 June 1933 and the first staff moved in during 1936, the University's centenary year. On 28 November 1936, a group of University officials, led by the Principal, Sir Edwin Deller, went out to inspect the work in progress. [...] Suddenly, without warning, <b>a</b> <b>skip</b> being pushed by a workman overhead accidentally fell down and hit them. [...] All were rushed to University College Hospital, where two days later, Deller died of his injuries. Due to a lack of funds, the full design was gradually cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, although the external flanking wings of the north-eastern courtyard were not constructed. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. The completion of the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies followed, but the onset of the Second World War prevented any further progress on the full scheme.|$|E
