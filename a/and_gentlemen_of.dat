5|$|In Belgium, Merrick {{was robbed}} by his road manager and {{abandoned}} in Brussels. He eventually {{made his way}} back to London; unable to communicate, he was found by the police to have Dr. Treves's card on him. Treves came and took Merrick back to the London Hospital. Although his condition was incurable, Merrick was allowed to stay at the hospital for the remainder of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> London society, including Alexandra, Princess of Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{design has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Architectural historian David Watkin described {{the house as}} 'large, irregular and rather featureless' and of a 'dull design'. On the other hand, historian, archivist and Maltravers Herald Extraordinary John Martin Robinson, in The architecture of Northern England, noted the 'complex building history' of the hall, describing it as a 'substantial and elegant Georgian house'. In his early 19th century work 'Views of the Seats, Mansions, Castles, Etc. of Noblemen <b>and</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> England, Scotland and Ireland', John Preston Neale noted that the house is 'large and handsome'.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

His plays may be grouped into four main categories: acts, or devotional plays; comedies tragicomedies; and farces.|$|E
25|$|In 1871 the Prince's Cricket Ground {{was added}} {{as well as}} a croquet lawn, {{followed}} by lawn tennis and lastly a roller-skating rink which was used in the winter for ice skating. The cricket ground was used by the Middlesex County Cricket Club for their first-class cricket matches between 1872 and 1876 before moving to Lord's. The cricket ground was also used by South of England <b>and</b> <b>Gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> the South. Several Gentlemen v Players fixtures were played there, the first taking place in 1873. In 1878 the touring Australians played two matches on the ground. The club's heyday was in the early 1870s; it had over 1,000 members in 1873.|$|E
25|$|Bury {{was born}} in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, in 1836, where his father was the vicar.

Frederick Bury made his debut for Demerara in what was retrospectively considered the inaugural first-class match in the West Indies, played against Barbados at the Garrison Savannah, Bridgetown, in February 1865. In that match, he opened the batting with Calvin Gilbert in each innings, but scored only seven runs across two innings as Demerara was dismissed for 22 and 38 – no Demeraran made double figures. Bury took two wickets in Barbados' innings of 74 and 124, with Barbados winning the match by 138 runs.|$|E

500|$|The nativity scene may not {{accurately}} reflect gospel events. [...] With {{no basis in}} the gospels, for example, the shepherds, the Magi, and the ox and ass may be displayed together at the manger. [...] Some traditions bring other scriptural characters to the nativity scene such as Adam and Eve and the serpent, Noah and his animals, the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve prophets and the twelve apostles. [...] Mundane activities such as Mary washing diapers in the River Jordan, or a dove descending on the newborn infant may be depicted. The art form {{can be traced back}} to eighteenth-century Naples, Italy. Neapolitan nativity scenes do not represent Palestine at the time of Jesus but the life of the Naples of 1700, during the Bourbon period. Families competed with each other to produce the most elegant and elaborate scenes and so, next to the Child Jesus, to the Holy Family and the shepherds, were placed ladies <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> the nobility, representatives of the bourgeoisie of the time, vendors with their banks and miniatures of cheese, bread, sheep, pigs, ducks or grape, and typical figures of the time like gypsy predicting the future, people playing cards, housewives doing shopping, dogs, cats and chickens.|$|E
500|$|Yesterday Major BOYLE Roche, {{representative}} in parliament for Tralee (who is raising {{a body of}} men for his Majesty's service) began recruiting here, and met with great success, which is not surprising, if we consider his connexions, and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> this province. His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession, which was as follows: Major Roche, bearing a large purse of gold. Captain Cowley. A great number of likely recruits. An elegant band of music, consisting of French horns, hautboys , clarionets, and bassoons, playing God Save the King. A large brewer's dray, with five-barrels of beer, the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with ribbands. Two draymen with cockades to serve the beer, The recruiting serjeant. Drums [...] fifes. Another division of recruits. The returning soldiers. Prodigious concourse of [...] The following speech was made by Major Roche to the populace: Being appointed, through the favour of [...] most excellent governor, to raise a body of men for the service of his Majesty, I think it [...] most happy circumstance {{of my life to}} be the instrument of leading you to honour and renown. The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [...] the globe [...] war, have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions to be forgotten? No, forbid it, heaven! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation. His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us, and I hope your instinct prompts you, to obey the dictates of so [...] a master. Let us then, my brave and loyal countrymen, join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator, our King and our Country.|$|E
2500|$|Earrings became fashionable among courtiers {{and gentlemen}} in the 1590s during the English Renaissance.

2500|$|In 1801, an {{antiquarian}} {{book about}} English sport noted that cricket had become [...] "exceedingly fashionable, being much countenanced by the nobility <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> fortune". In another work a year later, the fashion for cricket was deplored {{because it was}} (and remains) a dangerous activity, the writer saying that the country expects very {{different from those of}} [...] "rank and fortune" [...] than from those of [...] "the labouring classes". The determining factor in cricket's future as an [...] "exceedingly fashionable" [...] sport was its popularity, handed down through generations from old boys to new boys, in the fee-paying ("public") schools. Even so, headmasters of the time were not convinced that inter-school rivalry was a good thing and, when Eton played Harrow at Lord's in 1805, the match was organised by the boys themselves, among them Lord Byron.|$|E
2500|$|Humbert Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, {{is named}} after the [...] "maiden" [...] in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee" [...] by Poe; this poem is alluded to {{many times in the}} novel, and its lines are {{borrowed}} to describe Humbert's love.

In the opening of the novel, the phrase Ladies <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied, is a pastiche of two passages of the poem, the winged seraphs of heaven (line 11), and The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me (lines 21–2). Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called The Kingdom by the Sea, drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. A variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one, which reads ...had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of Italian poetry, especially that of Petrarch, into the peninsula {{led to a}} revival of Castilian verse, which dominated Portugal throughout the fifteenth century.

The court poetry of some three hundred knights <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> the time of Afonso V and John II is contained in the [...] "Cancioneiro Geral", compiled by Resende and inspired by Juan de Mena, Jorge Manrique, and other Spaniards.
