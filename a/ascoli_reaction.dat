40|$|ABSTRACTThree {{extractable}} Bacillus anthracis cell-wall-associated antigens {{were evaluated}} for potential use as skin testing agents, and as possible candidates for in-vitro diagnosis of anthrax immunity. Anthraxin and a partially purified extractable antigen (EAP) were produced from avirulent B. anthracis strain 34 F 2 (Sterne). The thermoextractable antigen {{used for the}} <b>Ascoli</b> <b>reaction</b> was obtained commercially. Guineapigs were immunised and boosted several times subcutaneously with the Sterne live veterinary anthrax vaccine. Four weeks after the last booster dose, animals were skin-tested with the three antigens. Serum antibody levels were also determined by ELISA, and the in-vitro T-cell response was evaluated by [3 H]-thymidine incorporation. EAP was the most active antigen in both the serological and cellular reactions. EAP also elicited a distinct positive skin reaction in animals immunised with B. anthracis. The data obtained in this preliminary study indicated that extractable cell-wall antigens obtained from the vegetative form of B. anthracis {{may be used for}} skin tests and in-vitro testing of specific humoral and cell-mediated anthrax immunity...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies, {{developing}} in animal and human organisms against antigens of {{external and internal}} origin are not limited with opsonization functions, lying {{on the base of}} formation of humoral immunity. Being the product of somatic mutations of plasmatic cells, according to clonal selection theory of immunity, they themselves are also alien proteins for organisms. Thus, they themselves also begin to display antigen pressure on the immune competent system. So, they will start themselves the elaboration of antibodies against them, which are called anti–idiotypic ones. Anti–idiotypic antibodies, imitating the corresponding bacterial and virus antigens are able to initiate the immune response of animal organism against them, which play great immune modulating role. The immunological structure of populations of Karakul sheep lambs vaccinated against E. coli bacteria, salmonellosis and anthrax antigen from the age of 2 – 3 days till 2 – 3 weeks was studied. Experiments were carried out in the 1 – 2, 3 – 4, 5 – 6, 7 – 8, 9 – 10 and 11 – 12 weeks old Karakul lambs. Experimental lambs during appraisal were vaccinated once by associated hydroxide aluminum form vaccine against paratyphoid and coli bacteriosis of calves, pigs and lambs. In another experiment, the lambs were immunized by rare naturally occurring bacterial antigen. As such an immunogenic was selected sterile soluble anthrax antigen. Developed and tested in the application of <b>Ascoli</b> <b>reaction</b> the role of anti–idiotype antibodies in the formation of natural immunity against opportunistic pathogens identified the nature of normal antibodies was studied. The nature of wavelike character of the immune reaction of an organism of newborn animals of vaccination was revealed. Also the immunomodulation role of anti–idiotypic antibodies was determined...|$|E
