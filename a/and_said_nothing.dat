Then they made their demand: the series must not be published. S.S. scowled at them <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> To fill the silence, Brynner began rather nervously to assure the Scientists that the {{articles}} were not sensational, not offensive; {{that there was no}} cause for apprehension; that all the facts had been most carefully verified.One of the Scientists cut in to suggest that perhaps there would be no objection to publication of the material if the Scientists were permitted to edit it as they might please.|$|E
5|$|Following the Australian Open loss, del Potro missed several tournaments, {{including}} the Masters tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami, which were touted as potential return dates, {{due to the}} persistent wrist injury. Even though he withdrew from the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, he regained the world No. 4 ranking, due to Murray's early exit in the second round. He then withdrew from Barcelona and the Rome Masters. On 4 May, del Potro took the option of having an operation to fix the injury. On 19 May, del Potro {{said he would not}} defend his US Open title, but if all went well, he would appear after the event, targeting the Paris Masters as a possible comeback. However, on 22 July, the USTA stated that del Potro was expected to defend his US Open crown. The player himself confirmed that his comeback to the tour would be the Thailand Open <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about the New York event. On 2 August, del Potro returned to the practice courts. A week {{before the start of the}} US Open, after practicing for two weeks, del Potro withdrew from the event, as he felt he was not ready to compete at the highest level.|$|E
500|$|Lunney {{attracted}} significant {{media attention}} in 1968, {{when he worked}} as lead flight director on Apollo 7, {{the first of the}} manned Apollo flights. Coming as it did after the Apollo 1 fire, the mission was an important test for the Apollo program, and was stressful for astronauts and controllers alike. Lunney had primary responsibility for dealing with the mission commander, Wally Schirra, who repeatedly questioned orders from the ground. Although pressed by reporters in news conferences, Lunney stayed diplomatic <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> critical of Schirra. Privately, however, he was extremely exasperated, and later assured his team of young controllers that [...] "manned spaceflight is usually better than this". He was also diplomatic about Donn Eisele's sarcastic comment to the CAPCOM that he would [...] "like to meet the man, or whomever it was, that dreamed up that little gem". The [...] "gem" [...] turned out to be Lunney's.|$|E

500|$|As the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace {{were invited}} to quite a few parties, where the legend of [...] "Silent Cal" [...] was born. It is from this time {{that most of the}} jokes and anecdotes {{involving}} Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private {{he was a man of}} few words and was commonly referred to as [...] "Silent Cal". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, [...] "I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you." [...] He replied, [...] "You lose." [...] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, [...] "How can they tell?" [...] Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, [...] "Got to eat somewhere." [...] Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: [...] "When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle." ...|$|E
500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whenever Shi Yi {{recommended}} {{talents to}} Sun Quan, he only pointed out their strengths <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> about their weaknesses. Sun Quan thus chided {{him for not}} saying anything about their weaknesses and not making judgments about them. In response, Shi Yi said, [...] "Your Majesty, as your subject, my duty is to perform my role well. I am always worried about not being competent in my role. (I keep my opinions about their weaknesses to myself because) I don't want to let my ignorance and limited knowledge affect Your Majesty's judgment about them." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, 2010, Ellerbe {{denied that}} {{negotiations}} ever took place <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> was ever agreed on. [...] "Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself {{speak to each}} other on a regular basis and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor was there ever a deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is not telling the truth, but history tells us who is lying," [...] stated Ellerbe. Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, the {{documentary}} miniseries Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States premiered on Showtime, Stone co-wrote, directed, produced, and narrated the series, having {{worked on it}} since 2008 with co-writers American University historian Peter J. Kuznick and British screenwriter Matt Graham. [...] The 10-part series is supplemented by a 750-page companion book of the same name, also written by Stone and Kuznick, released on October 30, 2012 by Simon & Schuster. Stone described the project as [...] "the most ambitious thing I've ever done. Certainly in documentary form, and perhaps in fiction, feature form." [...] The project received positive reviews from former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, The Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, and reviewers from IndieWire, San Francisco Chronicle, and Newsday. Hudson Institute adjunct fellow historian Ronald Radosh accused the series of historical revisionism, while journalist Michael C. Moynihan accused the book of [...] "moral equivalence" [...] <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing</b> within the book was [...] "untold" [...] previously. [...] Stone defended the program's accuracy to TV host Tavis Smiley by saying [...] "This has been fact checked by corporate fact checkers, by our own fact checkers, and fact checkers [...] by Showtime. It's been thoroughly vetted...these are facts, our interpretation may be different than orthodox, but it definitely holds up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Queen Victoria {{was also}} against the match. No British prince had ever married a Romanov, and she foresaw {{problems}} with Maria's Orthodox religion and Russian upbringing. The Queen considered that Russia was generally [...] "unfriendly" [...] towards Britain. Victoria was also suspicious about Russian {{moves in the}} direction of India. The Queen was dismayed, therefore, when she heard that official negotiations had restarted in January 1873. There were rumours going about St Petersburg that Maria Alexandrovna had compromised herself with Prince Golitsyn, the Tsar's aide-de-camp, and her family were anxious to see her settled. Alfred refused to believe those rumours and he was prepared to fight to marry the person he loved. Queen Victoria therefore swallowed her pride <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>nothing.</b> Both mothers continued to look for other partners for their children, but Alfred and Maria would not have anyone else. As the Tsarina failed to find a German prince acceptable for her daughter, a meeting among Alfred, the Tsarina and her daughter took place in Sorrento, Italy in mid April 1873. That year, there was an Anglo-Russian dispute [...] over the Afghan border. The Queen’s ministers thought that a marriage might help to ease the tension between the two countries, if only by putting the monarchs into closer contact with one another.|$|E
