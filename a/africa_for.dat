5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern <b>Africa.</b> <b>For</b> some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
