This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> condenser.

40|$|Abstract: In high {{temperature}} coal mine, the surface <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> heat exchange efficiency decreases greatly {{because of high}} humidity and dust. In order to improve the heat exchange efficiency, {{the surface of the}} <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> needs to be designed to reduce the dust adhesion, and improve the heat exchange efficiency. Based on the self-cleaning effect of lotus leaf, the surface of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> is designed and fin and tube are processed into the constructure of lotus leaf surface. With Ansys, the <b>cooling</b> effect of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> is simulated, and the experiment is done to test the heat exchange effect of the common <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> and bionic <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> in lab. By analysis, it can be concluded that the surface of bionic <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> has the function of self-cleaning, and the structure can increase the heat exchange efficiency, which is higher above 30 % than that of common <b>air</b> <b>cooler...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} a cold {{production}} process was proposed for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> in which cryogenic energy from {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) was sufficiently converted to cold energy. The effect of using the cold production process for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> on the off-design performance of a gas turbine combined cycle was analyzed under different ambient conditions.

Furthermore for the inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> the proposed method increased the relative power increment from 2. 2 % to 14. 4 % and the relative efficiency increment from 0. 7 % to 2. 2 %, mainly depending on the variations in the relative humidity, compared to cold production without <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> The relative power and relative efficiency of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> were increased by 0. 6 % to 3. 1 % and 0. 3 % to 0. 5 %, respectively, above those of the traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooling...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the spatial variation of temperature, relative humidity and black globe humidity temperature (BGHT) index in growing-finishing swine facilities, with and without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> The experiment was conducted in a 60 x 9 m facility containing 32 pens of 3. 20 x 4. 00 m each, divided into two sectors. The treatments were without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (control) and with evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> Temperature and relative humidity data were collected weekly in two periods (morning and afternoon) at 32 different sampling points, encompassing the center of each pen and the outer perimeter of the facility. Animal performance variables were: feed intake, feed conversion, weight out of the nursery, slaughter weight, weight gain and daily weight gain. According to the results, the analyzed variables showed spatial dependence, with lower temperature and higher relative humidity in the evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> environment. However, evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> system provided better environment thermal conditions inside the facilities, lowering BGHT values, which were lower in the adiabatic cooling sector.

25|$|Cleansing and polishing: Walnut shells {{are mostly}} used to clean soft metals, fiberglass, plastics, wood and stone. This {{environmentally}} friendly and recyclable soft grit abrasive {{is well suited}} for air blasting, deburring, descaling, and polishing operations because of its elasticity and resilience. Uses include cleaning automobile and jet engines, electronic circuit boards, and paint and graffiti removal. For example: In {{the early days of}} jet transportation, crushed walnut shells were used to scour the compressor airfoils clean, but when engines with <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> vanes and blades in the turbine started being manufactured, this practice was stopped because the crushed shells tended to plug up the cooling passages to the turbine, resulting in turbine failures due to overheating.|$|E

Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work.|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} chiller energy {{consumption}} {{in a central}} air-conditioning system, a heat exchanger, acting as an <b>air</b> <b>cooler,</b> can be installed before an air handling unit to pre-cool the fresh <b>air</b> by recovering <b>cooling</b> capacity from exhaust air. However, studies on evaluating the performances of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under condensation condition are limited. Therefore, an experimental {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the plate type <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> performance under four operating modes (dry/wet mode, low/high air humidity). Under dry operating mode, the <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> serves as a traditional air cooler; while under wet operating mode, it works as an indirect evaporative cooler (IEC). The cooler dynamic performances during different operating mode transition were investigated. The steady performances under different parameter influence were also comparatively studied. The results show that wet operating improves the sensible and latent <b>cooling</b> capacities of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> significantly. Condensation takes place under high humidity inlet air, results in decreasing of sensible efficiency but increasing of latent efficiency and total heat transfer rate. The coefficient of performance (COP) of IEC is higher than that of traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under the same testing configuration. The highest COP can reach 9. 0 and achieved under wet operating mode with condensation. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

In order to estimate the thermal error of ball screw system and effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> system, thermal behavior models of finite element method and modified lumped capacitance method were developed separately which includes the heat generation power of the main heat source of the ball screw system and other boundary conditions.

With the help of optimization of tower structure, a tower with better structure is used to conduct thermal analysis of the influences of ambient temperature, windward air velocity, and saturated exhaust flow rate on back pressure of turbine.

25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 30 May 1939 {{powered by}} two Walter Sagitta I-SR <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> vee piston engines. The trial flights identified {{problems with the}} cooling of the rear engine and general engine performance. It was proposed to use Rolls-Royce or Daimler-Benz engines in the production aircraft. Concerns were also raised about the pilot clearing the rear propeller {{if he had to}} bail out and an ejector seat was studied. As a provisional solution, rails were put {{on both sides of the}} forward fuselage for the Fokker test pilot, Gerben Sonderman, to use to bail out in an emergency. The aircraft was flown 11 times for a total flight time of less than four hours. The rear fuselage paneling was modified significantly before the last few flights in an attempt to address chronic rear engine cooling problems. On the 11th flight in April, the undercarriage was damaged, and the programme was abandoned in May 1940 when the German forces invaded the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Not until 1927 {{were there}} once again plans for {{conversion}} to electric operations. Now, however, high tension alternating current, at a frequency of 16 Hz, {{was to be}} used. This offered, amongst other things, the advantage of requiring only one electrical insertion point, near Visp, which would drastically reduce the costs of electrical systems {{in comparison with the}} original plans. Consideration was also given to adopting completely the SBB current system at 15,000 volts without alteration, but that idea quickly had to be abandoned. In particular, the Rhätische Bahn, which since 1913 had been operating electric traffic at 11,000 volts AC on the Engadine Line, stressed the benefits of using lower voltage than the SBB voltage. Whereas light weight <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> transformers could be used on the Engadine Line, a heavy oil cooling system would be necessary for 15,000 volt operations, and that would greatly have increased the weight of the VZ locomotives. Additionally, the use of a single phase current system would make problem free through traffic possible in the event of electrification of the Furka Oberalp Bahn. These advantages led to the decision to use a voltage of 11,000 volts also on the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn.|$|E
