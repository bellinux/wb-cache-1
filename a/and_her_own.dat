5|$|At {{several points}} in the book, Bechdel {{questions}} whether her decision to come out as a lesbian {{was one of the}} triggers for her father's suicide. This question is never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights.|$|E

5|$|In {{writing the}} script, Thomas drew {{inspiration}} from {{the story of the}} Virgin Mary, her research on fundamentalist Mormon communities, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> upbringing. She originally intended to produce the film on a $25,000-budget and hire her family and friends to work on the cast and crew, but when the budget was raised to $1million she was able to hire professional actors. Filming took place over 25 days in Utah and Nevada in late 2011.|$|E

5|$|Macmillan {{was active}} in the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage (ENSWS). In 1897, two women's groups in Great Britain united to become the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), of whom Macmillan, along with Louisa Stevenson, served as {{executive}} committee members from Edinburgh. She was known as Chrystal Macmillan—she did not use the name Jessie, her mother's first name <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> birth name.|$|E
5|$|At 24, she won {{the role}} of the title {{character}} in UPN's drama Veronica Mars, which was launched in the fall of 2004. Created by Rob Thomas, the series starred Bell as the seventeen-year-old anti-establishment high school student/detective. Bell drew on the parallels between the character of Veronica <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> life, since Bell's parents had divorced and her best friend had also died. The series earned acclaim from television critics, as did Bell's performance. Some critics asserted that her performance was overlooked, and deserved consideration for an Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1912, Potthast {{began as}} Himmler's {{secretary}} in 1936 and by 1938 {{she was his}} lover. She resigned from her duties in 1941, and subsequently had two children with Himmler, {{a boy and a}} girl. After the war, Potthast married and lived out {{the rest of her life}} outside the public eye. In post-war interviews, she refrained from answering questions about Himmler's involvement in war crimes committed by the Nazis <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> knowledge of them.

5|$|Henry had Anne {{investigated}} for high treason in April 1536.

She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge.|$|E
5|$|Melanie {{was created}} by {{producer}} Mara Brock Akil. While casting the character, Brock Akil had doubts about whether Mowry {{would be the best}} choice, given her wholesome image from starring as Tia Landry on the sitcom Sister, Sister, but hired the actress based on her strong work ethic and her desire {{to be part of the}} series. Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.|$|E

5|$|Susie Diamond is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{appears in the}} romantic comedy-drama film The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989). Portrayed by actress Michelle Pfeiffer, Susie is a former escort who becomes a professional lounge singer when she is hired to help revitalize the career of The Fabulous Baker Boys, a waning piano duo consisting of brothers Jack (Jeff Bridges) and Frank Baker (Beau Bridges). Susie's addition to the group ultimately proves beneficial to both the trio's career <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> but she also inadvertently generates conflict between the two brothers as Frank strongly disapproves of Jack's romantic interest in Susie, jeopardizing both the brothers' relationship and the trio's future as a musical act.|$|E
5|$|The Thraliana was a diary kept by Hester Thrale and {{is part of}} {{the genre}} known as table talk. Although the work began as Thrale's diary focused on her {{experience}} with her family, it slowly changed focus to emphasise various anecdotes and stories about the life of Samuel Johnson. The work was used as a basis for Thrale's Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, but the Thraliana remained unpublished until 1942. The anecdotes contained within the work were popular with Thrale's contemporaries but seen as vulgar. Among 20th century readers, the work was popular, and many literary critics believe that the work is a valuable contribution to the genre and for providing information about Johnson's <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> life.|$|E
5|$|The game follows Naija, a mermaid-like woman, as she {{explores the}} {{underwater}} world of Aquaria. Along her journey, she learns {{about both the}} history of the world <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> past. The gameplay focuses on a combination of swimming, singing and combat, through which Naija can interact with the world. Naija's songs can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms. These forms have different abilities, such as firing projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural form.|$|E

5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two did not speak {{for the next five years}} after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
5|$|As for the Street Fighter series, {{starting}} from Street Fighter X Tekken, Poison {{has a unique}} moveset of her own that mixes agile Pro Wrestling techniques <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> streetfighting abilities. Poison's standard throws include a multi-hitting slap and a Frankensteiner, Aeolus Edge and Kissed by a Goddess which are the names of her Fireball and Shoryuken-like moves, and Whip of Love which is a multi-hitting whip attack and is done {{in a similar fashion}} to Fei Long's Rekkas. Her famous flip kick from the original Final Fight games appears as a special called Love Me Tender. After the flipping axe kick, Poison can follow this move up with a reverse Frankensteiner (Poison-Rana). In addition, Poison's Super Art is called Love Storm, and starts with her charging a large version of Aeolus Edge. Once it hits, she flips into the air and lands with a hard hitting axe kick that stuns the opponent in a prone position. Afterwards, she repeatedly smacks the opponent with her horse whip and delivers a final blow that knocks them into the air. Poison also retained her signature backflip from the original game.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky, accepting the pastorate of First Presbyterian Church of Lexington. His return to Kentucky was also {{motivated by a}} growing fondness for his cousin, Virginia Hart Shelby, who had cared for two of his children during his stay in Pennsylvania. Virginia was the widow of Alfred Shelby, the son of Isaac Shelby, who was twice governor of Kentucky. Their written exchanges included love poems from Robert and concerned questions from Virginia {{about the wisdom of}} engaging in a relationship. Despite being advised by her sisters to avoid the marriage <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> wavering on the issue, the two were married in April 1847. They had three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood. Disagreements among the children of both partners' previous marriages exacerbated an already tense union, which almost ended in divorce in September 1856. Robert managed to reconcile with his wife, and they remained together until Virginia's death in 1859.|$|E

5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
