500|$|In {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the novel, Le Guin stated [...] "the hero of the book, the protagonist, he has a different gift, it isn’t magic at all, in fact, it’s another kind of talent. And his problem is to realize that he doesn’t have the kind he’s supposed to have, he has this other one. Which is a problem, actually, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> face: What is my gift?" [...] Reviewers have described Orrec's search for his own identity, in contrast to the identity that has been thrust upon him, as one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is related to the other major theme of the novel, that of power and responsibility. As he comes to terms with his identity, Orrec questions whether he is betraying his power by refusing to try to use it. Gry, too, is unwilling to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and wonders whether [...] "all the gifts are backward.... They could have been healing, to begin with." [...] The novel ends with the two protagonists realizing that they are unwilling to remain in the cycle of violence and retribution in the Uplands, and leaving to keep their integrity; but they are also running toward a place where they can use their gifts as they please, rather than simply running away. A part of Orrec and Gry's process of growing up is to see beyond the binary choices they are presented with by society. Orrec is faced with a choice of whether to use his power, or to be blindfolded; Gry has to use her power to hunt, or not. Gry realizes that all of the upland powers can be used in two ways: for control and dominion, or for healing and nurturing. This recognition allows them to take a third choice, and leave. This wrestling with choice has been compared to the choices the characters are forced to make in Le Guin's novella The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} situation in Denmark {{was one of}} high unemployment and poor housing, especially in Copenhagen. In the 1970s, the Copenhagen City Council, led by a social democratic mayor, Egon Weidekamp, had begun a process of rehousing for {{people living in the}} poor areas of Copenhagen. The process involved the demolition of large parts of the old boroughs surrounding the city center. Although the intent was to raise the standard of living for working-class people, the consequence was that the new houses often became too expensive for those very people to live in. Many found themselves temporarily relocated to elsewhere in the city, and when they wanted to return to their old homes, they found the rent to be too high for them to pay. [...] This gave rise to a growing anger towards the city council and a feeling amongst the poor people of Copenhagen that decisions concerning their lives were being made without them having anything to say about it. The city's plans also left many old and worn, but still useful, buildings empty. [...] At the same time, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> were unemployed and without homes. All these factors opened the door to widespread squatting.|$|E

Carl Friedman, the Director of the San Francisco Department of Animal Care and Control, said, [...] "There were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> there who have never been to a government meeting. For this to be their first experience was embarrassing." [...] When asked about the situation, the student responded, [...] "I didn't mean to cry, I just kind of lost it.
