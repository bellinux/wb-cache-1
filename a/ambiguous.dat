5|$|Acute leukemias of <b>ambiguous</b> lineage (also {{known as}} mixed {{phenotype}} or biphenotypic acute leukemia) {{occur when the}} leukemic cells can not be classified as either myeloid or lymphoid cells, or where both types of cells are present.|$|E
5|$|B Fono.fi, a music {{database}} {{maintained by}} the Finnish Broadcasting Company, provides <b>ambiguous</b> credits; the lyrics are either by Immonen, Mariska, Vartiainen and Vesala or solely by Mariska.|$|E
5|$|Choirosphaktes {{replied with}} an <b>ambiguous</b> answer, {{which was used}} by Simeon to claim that Leo could not prophesy the future and to refuse {{the return of the}} captives, further prolonging the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} {{may be less}} <b>ambiguous</b> {{when the}} fetal remains are found to lie within the pelvic outlet of the adult, thus indicating that partial extrusion had occurred during decomposition.|$|E
5|$|For complex numbers w and z with , the {{notation}} w'z is <b>ambiguous</b> {{in the same}} sense that log w is.|$|E
5|$|Gens {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{characters}} in Joshua Sobol's plays Ghetto and Adam. They depict him as a complex, morally <b>ambiguous</b> character forced to choose between two evils.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other worlds of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as <b>ambiguous.</b> Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets {{is seen as a}} good thing, Athshe is seen as changed for the worse both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have <b>ambiguous</b> overtones.|$|E
5|$|In fiction, pet brown rats {{are often}} {{depicted}} as tamed rather than domesticated, akin to when a character befriends a wolf. As tamed pets, {{they have been}} portrayed in roles that vary from evil to <b>ambiguous</b> to lovable.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{status as}} {{potentially}} a trans woman, consciously left <b>ambiguous</b> by the developers, {{has remained a}} topic of frequent debate by both fans and media alike.|$|E
5|$|The school educates {{the future}} {{leaders of the}} US Armed Forces, its allies, and the Interagency at the {{graduate}} level to be agile and adaptive leaders who think critically at the strategic and operational levels to solve complex <b>ambiguous</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|The song is the namesake for the 2014 film Obvious Child; {{it appears}} in {{a scene in which}} two {{characters}} drunkenly dance together. Director Gillian Robespierre titled the film with hope that its meaning would be <b>ambiguous.</b>|$|E
5|$|A call {{like this}} might be a bit <b>ambiguous,</b> but it was unsettling to those who were {{on the side of the}} status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as <b>ambiguous,</b> aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that this style {{may have been a}} result of Innis' illness late in his career.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{preliminary}} peace in 1712, the Treaty of Utrecht ended {{the war in}} 1713. It resulted in the French ceding to Britain the territories of Hudson Bay, Acadia, and Newfoundland, while retaining Cape Breton and other islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some of its terms were <b>ambiguous,</b> and concerns of various Indian tribes {{were not included in}} the treaty, setting the stage for future conflicts.|$|E
5|$|For {{the size}} of limitanei units, opinion is divided. Jones and Elton suggest from the scarce and <b>ambiguous</b> {{literary}} evidence that border legiones numbered c. 1,000 men and that the other units contained {{in the region of}} 500 men each. Others draw on papyrus and more recent archaeological evidence to argue that limitanei units probably averaged about half the Jones/Elton strength i.e. c. 500 for legiones and around 250 for other units.|$|E
5|$|Hosseini stated his {{intentions}} {{to make the}} characters more complex and morally <b>ambiguous.</b> Continuing the familial theme established in his previous novels, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, And the Mountains Echoed centers on the rapport between siblings. Besides Abdullah and Pari, Hosseini introduced two other sibling and sibling-like relationships—the children's stepmother Parwana and her disabled sister Masooma and an Afghan-American doctor named Idris and his cousin Timur.|$|E
5|$|However, Samuel Taylor Coleridge {{proposed}} that the three weird sisters {{should be seen as}} <b>ambiguous</b> figures, never actually being called witches by themselves or other characters in the play. Moreover, they were depicted as more fair than foul both in Holinshed's account and in that of contemporary playgoer Simon Forman.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{around the}} time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were {{questioning}} the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more <b>ambiguous</b> religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider.|$|E
5|$|In the Wujing Zongyao {{and other}} {{military}} texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is <b>ambiguous.</b> At the time, the Chinese usually did not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method. One of the few exceptions is the shoupao, or hand bomb, which {{is analogous to the}} hand grenade.|$|E
5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally <b>ambiguous,</b> and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Machula: {{wearing a}} mask, a humpback, {{and a long}} coat, and {{carrying}} a walking stick, machulas represent the ñawpa machus, the mythical first inhabitants of the Andes. In a similar way to the ukukus, they perform an <b>ambiguous</b> role in the festival, being comical as well as constabulary figures.|$|E
5|$|Michael Weyland's <b>ambiguous</b> {{humanity}} {{is a subject}} of debate for viewers and critics, and speculation exists {{that he is an}} android more sophisticated than Bishop. In Cinema of Simulation: Hyperreal Hollywood in the Long 1990s, Randy Laist interprets this ambiguity as indicative of a theme of the Alien franchise: what matters is a character's actions, not its species. Michael Weyland is a duplicitous character, and it is irrelevant whether he is a human or an android.|$|E
5|$|Modern-day western gunslingers {{have also}} {{appeared}} in recent Neo-Westerns. Raylan Givens from the television series Justified shares the same <b>ambiguous</b> moral code of an Old West sheriff, even using a fast draw to dispatch his enemies. The hitman Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men shares many elements of a hunted outlaw. Additionally, the comic book character Vigilante is a self-proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad's life is {{traditionally}} defined into two periods: pre-hijra (emigration) in Mecca (from 570 to 622), and post-hijra in Medina (from 622 until 632). Muhammad {{is said to}} have had thirteen wives in total (although two have <b>ambiguous</b> accounts, Rayhana bint Zayd and Maria al-Qibtiyya, as wife or concubine.) Eleven of the thirteen marriages occurred after the migration to Medina.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} to rescind the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were <b>ambiguous</b> and confusing. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh {{has three}} sequels, Shiloh Season, Saving Shiloh, and A Shiloh Christmas {{published}} in 1996, 1997, and 2015 respectively. In Shiloh Season, Naylor renews the strife by restoring Judd's hostility and aggravating {{it with a}} bout of drinking issues. Marty fears Judd will take back Shiloh and be faithless to the deal they made. Whereas in Shiloh Marty confronts the confusing and <b>ambiguous</b> concept of morality, in Shiloh Season he must face the notion of wickedness.|$|E
5|$|Smithers' {{devotion to}} Mr. Burns was {{inspired}} from how numerous Fox executives {{and staff members}} acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' <b>ambiguous</b> sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but little attention should be drawn to it. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials {{who had received}} Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was <b>ambiguous,</b> since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, {{and most of the}} officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E
5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether {{invocation of}} Miranda rights could be implied from the behavior or <b>ambiguous</b> {{words of the}} accused. It concluded (in line with previous cases such as Davis v. United States) that there was good reason why invoking these rights should require an unambiguous act of the accused, including certainty for police, prosecutors, and accused, and social benefit in law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|The {{demarcation}} between carnivorous and protocarnivorous is blurred by {{the lack}} of a strict definition of botanical carnivory and <b>ambiguous</b> academic literature on the subject. Many examples of protocarnivorous plants exist, some of which are counted among the ranks of true carnivorous plants as a matter of historical preference. Further research into these plants' carnivorous adaptations may reveal that a few protocarnivorous plants do meet the more rigid definition of a carnivorous plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive, and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains <b>ambiguous,</b> {{and the perception of}} it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E
5|$|The mythology {{surrounding}} Rommel {{has been}} the subject of analysis by both English- and German-speaking historians in recent decades. The reevaluation has produced new interpretations of Rommel, including his relationship with National Socialism, his abilities as operational and strategic level commander, and his role (if any) in the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler. Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an <b>ambiguous</b> figure, not easily definable either inside or outside the myth.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{theme is}} {{repeated}} throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are <b>ambiguous</b> about the opening stanza's {{position in the}} song; {{it is unclear whether}} the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The orchestral exposition, 99 {{measures}} long, presents {{two groups}} of thematic material, one primary and one secondary, both in the tonic of C minor. The orchestra opens the principal theme in unison, but not powerfully: the dynamic marking is piano. The theme is tonally <b>ambiguous,</b> not asserting the home key of C minor until its final cadence in the thirteenth measure. It is also highly chromatic: in its 13 measures it utilises all 12 notes of the chromatic scale.|$|E
5|$|The saga tales draw {{attention}} to Sigurd's conversion to Christianity and his use of a totemic raven banner, {{a symbol of the}} Norse God Odin. This <b>ambiguous</b> theme and the lack of detailed contemporary records of his life have led to a variety of interpretations of the saga material by modern scholars.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 12, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with theater advertisements appearing in Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Washington D. C., Washington state, and North Carolina. Some advertisements were <b>ambiguous</b> in {{whether or not the}} picture of the play was being performed, as one Bell Theatre advertisement shows.|$|E
