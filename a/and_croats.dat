5|$|Prior to the occupation, {{the most}} recent Yugoslav census had been taken in 1931. This census used {{language}} as the primary criterion, and counted all speakers of Serbo-Croatian as one group, rather than recognising distinct Serb, Croat, Bosnian Muslim, Macedonian and Montenegrin nationalities. Aligning data on religious affiliation with the linguistic data {{has been used by}} scholars to determine approximate numbers of Serbs <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> in the 1931 census, by counting those of the Roman Catholic denomination as Croats.|$|E
5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, {{located in}} The Hague, has found several {{individuals}} guilty {{of crimes against}} humanity perpetrated at Omarska. Murder, torture, rape, and abuse of prisoners was common. Around 6,000 Bosniaks <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> were held in appalling conditions at the camp for about five months {{in the spring and}} summer of 1992, including 37 women. Hundreds died of starvation, punishment beatings and ill-treatment.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{followed}} escalating {{ethnic tensions}} in the Lika region, including attacks on Croatian civilians in Lovinac, {{an attack on a}} Croatian police checkpoint in Žuta Lokva, and skirmishes at the Plitvice Lakes and the Ljubovo Pass on the Gospić–Plitvička Jezera road. The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration of the situation in the region, resulting in war crimes against Serbs <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> in the Gospić and Široka Kula massacres. Fighting in the region remained deadlocked, with little to no territorial gains to either side, until a lasting ceasefire was called with the signing of the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992.|$|E
50|$|By 1927, all Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> {{associations}} - {{not only}} political, but also cultural, educational and sport associations - were dissolved, as were all financial and economic {{institutions in the}} hands of the Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> minority. Since 1928, the State law started limiting the use of Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> also in the churches, and in 1934, all use of Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> in Roman Catholic liturgy (including singing and sermons) was prohibited.|$|R
5000|$|After the Fascist {{movement}} came {{to power}} in 1922, anti-Slavic policies were enforced as part of Italianization. In 1923, the use of Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> languages in all public offices, including post offices and means of public transport, was prohibited. In the same year, the Gentile reform declared Italian as the only language of public education; by 1928, all Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> schools, including private ones, were closed down. In 1925, the use of Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> was prohibited in the courts of law. All Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> names of towns and settlements were Italianized. By 1927, all public use of Slovene <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> languages was prohibited. Children were prohibited being given Slavic names, and all Slavic-sounding surnames were administratively given an Italian-sounding form. The Fascist Italianization prohibited Slavic inscriptions on gravestones [...]|$|R

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Serbs <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles were fired at Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, missiles were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three missiles were fired at houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country's Serbs <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> since the Second World War. It enraged many Croatians {{and led to a}} surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|Vrbanja Bridge {{was located}} in no-man's-land during the Siege of Sarajevo (1992–96). It was {{surrounded}} by tall buildings, which made it a target of sniper-fire {{from the beginning of}} the Bosnian War. On 5 April 1992, six protestors were shot on the bridge by Serb snipers. Two women, Suada Dilberović and Olga Sučić, died as a result, and are considered the first victims of the siege by Bosniaks <b>and</b> <b>Croats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bursać {{was born}} on 2August 1920 {{in the village of}} Kamenica, near Drvar in the region of Bosanska Krajina, the {{north-western}} sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina (then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed as Yugoslavia in 1929). The Drvar area was inhabited primarily by ethnic Serbs, with Bosnian Muslims <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> forming less than four percent of the population. Bursać was the oldest of five children of stonemason Nikola Bursać and his wife, Joka, who mostly raised sheep and cattle on their family farm. Like other village girls, Bursać did not go to school—only the boys attended elementary school in Drvar. A shepherdess until age fourteen, she later helped her mother with housekeeping and agricultural work. Bursać became skilled at weaving, spinning, knitting and embroidery before completing a six-month tailoring course in Drvar.|$|E

5|$|In the east, the Roman–Persian Wars {{continued}} until 561 when the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau {{agreed on a}} 50-year peace. By the mid-550s, Justinian had won victories in most theatres of operation, with the notable exception of the Balkans, which were subjected to repeated incursions from the Slavs and the Gepids. Tribes of Serbs <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> were later resettled in the northwestern Balkans, {{during the reign of}} Heraclius. Justinian called Belisarius out of retirement and defeated the new Hunnish threat. The strengthening of the Danube fleet caused the Kutrigur Huns to withdraw and they agreed to a treaty that allowed safe passage back across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for {{one or another of}} the prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after the Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E
5|$|Albania {{remained}} {{occupied by}} Italy until its {{surrender to the}} Allies in September 1943. In August of that year, faced with the imminent collapse of the Italian war effort, Germany deployed the 2nd Panzer Army to the Balkans to take over areas previously occupied by Italy. One of the Italian areas seized by the Germans was Albania, where the XXI Mountain Corps of Generaloberst (General) Lothar Rendulic's 2nd Panzer Army had been deployed. A Wehrmacht plenipotentiary general, and a special representative of Heinrich Himmler, SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS und Polizei Josef Fitzthum, were both based in the Albanian capital of Tirana. The Germans took control of all Albanian forces that had been collaborating with the Italians prior to their capitulation, including the Balli Kombëtar, an anti-communist and nationalist militia. The Germans strengthened the Albanian army and gendarmerie, but quickly decided those troops were unreliable. That year, a number of Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak region were recruited into the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), a Waffen-SS division composed largely of Bosnian Muslims <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> with mostly German officers. For about six months the division included about 1,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment (I/2), which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28). The division later recruited a further 500 men from the Sandžak.|$|E

25|$|The Serbian media during Milošević's era {{was accused}} by The New York Times of {{embracing}} Serbian nationalism and promoting xenophobia toward {{other ethnic groups}} in the former Yugoslavia. Serbian state media during the wars featured reports which demonized Bosnians <b>and</b> <b>Croats.</b> Thee negative media depictions of said ethnic groups are examples of Milošević's state media promoting hysteria and to anger Serbs to support the Yugoslav wars. The station drew little attention to Serbian war crimes committed against Croats and Serbs. Reports about Serbs being massacred by Bosnians and/or Croats were broadcast daily in order to create anger among the Serb and Montenegrin populace. Examples include the American embassy reporting of falsified stories created by state media of Bosnians <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> killing nuns and babies.|$|E
