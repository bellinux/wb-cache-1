5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value {{will depend on the}} eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of his}} death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial <b>aid</b> <b>policy</b> at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} optimal policy for foreign {{economic}} aids and welfare effects foreign <b>aids</b> <b>policy</b> coordination between asymmetric donor countries {{in terms of}} income level. When donor countries are altruistic with higher welfare from the increased income of the poor in the recipient country, {{it has been argued}} for <b>aids</b> <b>policy</b> coordination to reduce a common good problem. Based on a simple model considering asymmetric donors making endogenous decision on the amount of aids and recipient country making decision on the income transfer for the poor people, we demonstrate that <b>aids</b> <b>policy</b> coordination does not always welfare dominates the non-cooperative <b>aids</b> <b>policies.</b> The results imply that when the asymmetry of donor countriesâ€™ income level is higher than the critical level, <b>aids</b> <b>policy</b> sovereignty can be welfare dominant to uniform <b>aids</b> <b>policy</b> coordination...|$|R

It believes that free trade is the key for developing countries to gain economic growth, and that [...] "the relationship between aid and development is at best unclear."

The party instead supports an increase in support for global health and vaccination initiatives against global epidemics such as HIV, AIDS and tuberculosis, and to increase the support after emergencies and disasters.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst {{the above}} {{conception}} of aid {{has been the}} most pervasive within development geography work, {{it is important to remember}} that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide alternative development discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of [...] "LEDCs", as well as the discursive symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states. Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign <b>aid</b> <b>policy</b> as recently as 2011 and India, an often cited aid recipient, but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the EC regional <b>aid</b> <b>policies</b> to finance infrastructure investment in the poorest regions where large disparities in public infrastructure (transport, telecommunications, energy and education) exist. We show that in a model in which trade is based on increasing returns, increasing returns industries tend to locate in countries with better infrastructure. By decreasing the disparities in the levels of public infrastructure, the regional <b>aid</b> <b>policies</b> lead firms to relocate from rich to poor countries. In the context of this model, the regional <b>aid</b> <b>policies</b> can be interpreted as the price paid by the richest countries for the benefits of full trade integration. In the empirical section, we find that telecommunications and education infrastructures are well correlated with industry location and per capita GDP. However, transport infrastructure, on which EC regional aid programmes concentrate, is poorly correlated with either industry location or per-capita GDP.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which tuition and need-based financial <b>aid</b> <b>policies</b> help explain important differences in family income â€“ post-secondary (PS) attendance relationships between Canada and the U. S. We first conduct a parallel empirical analysis of the effects of parental income on PS attendance for recent high school cohorts in both the U. S. and Canada using data from the 1997 Cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and Youth in Transition Survey. We estimate substantially smaller PS attendance gaps by parental income in Canada relative to the U. S., even after controlling for family background, adolescent cognitive achievement, and local residence fixed effects. We next document that U. S. public tuition and financial <b>aid</b> <b>policies</b> are actually more generous to low-income youth than are Canadian policies. By contrast, Canada offers more generous aid to middle-class youth than does the U. S. These findings suggest that the much stronger family income â€“ PS attendance relationship in the U. S. is not driven by differences in costs or the need-based nature of financial <b>aid</b> <b>policies.</b> Based on previous estimates of the effects of tuition and aid on PS attendance, we argue that income â€“ attendance gradients would be even greater in the U. S. relative to Canada if financial <b>aid</b> <b>policies</b> were equalized. Finally, we calculate how much additional aid would likely need to be offered to lower-income families in each country to eliminate existing income â€“ attendance gaps. ...|$|R

We discuss how the location of public housing units is a fundamental policy variable, in addition to the numbers and sizes of units, and argue that vouchers not only cause less distortion for social welfare compared to public housing, but may also improve overall welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the current {{emerging}} international development policies of the VisegrÃ¡d (V 4) countries are heavily influenced by the {{certain aspects of the}} Communist past and the transition process. Due to these influences, the V 4 countries have difficulties in adapting the foreign aid practices of Western donors and this leads to the emergence of a unique Central and Eastern European development cooperation model. As an analytical background, the paper builds on the path dependency theory of transition. A certain degree of path dependence is clearly visible in V 4 foreign <b>aid</b> <b>policies,</b> and the paper analyses some aspects of this phenomenon: how these new emerging foreign aid donors select their partner countries, how much they spend on aid, how they formulate their <b>aid</b> delivery <b>policies</b> and institutions and what role the non-state actors play.
