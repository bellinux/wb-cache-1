50|$|Their job was {{to attack}} the surface-to-air missile complex, antiaircraft guns and a ring of <b>automatic</b> weapons <b>guarding</b> the target. On the first pass, his flight leader (F-105F 63-8335, piloted by Maj. David Everson and Capt. Jose Luna, both POW) was shot down by 85mm AAA fire and his wing man was forced to {{withdraw}} with severe damage.|$|R
50|$|Relationships between {{characters}} are built up through Support conversations between chapters. The normal rankings of relationships are C to A, with A standing for a close friendship. For characters of opposing genders, an additional S ranking is available, {{in which the}} characters fall in love, marry and have children. Relationships also have a direct impact during battles, with certain character pairings granting positive effects such as increased mobility or an <b>automatic</b> <b>guarding</b> action. A couple's children can be found and recruited in optional chapters made available by the parent characters' marriage, with their appearance and in-game abilities varying depending on who their parents were. Most characters have a specific list of units which they can have Support conversations with; the Avatar can build a relationship with all characters, and (depending on their chosen gender) marry any unit from any generation {{as long as they}} are not a direct descendant.|$|R
50|$|The camp {{is around}} 378 km2 in area. It is {{surrounded}} by a barbed-wire fence 3 - 4 m tall and walls with electric wire and watchtowers at regular intervals. The camp is patrolled by 1,000 <b>guards</b> with <b>automatic</b> rifles and <b>guard</b> dogs.|$|R

The Cold War serves, therefore, as the frame of reference for this article, which is further preoccupied with the geographical positions that automatons or prototype cyborgs occupy: {{the last part of}} the essay analyses Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project, where mechanical hens stand at the entrance to dreamworlds. <b>Automatic</b> fowl <b>guard,</b> and usher into being, new technologised worlds...|$|R
50|$|CDS-3 was {{launched}} in 2008, along with the 5 Quick Launch satellites. It contained experiments for relaying signals from the United States Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>Automatic</b> Identification System through the satellite constellation. It was designated Orbcomm FM-29, having most of the communications payload from an unlaunched satellite. The avionics bus to that satellites later became TacSat-1.|$|R
40|$|In the {{presented}} project, a {{new approach}} {{for the prevention of}} hand movements leading to hazards and for non-contact detection of fingers is intended to permit comprehensive and economical protection on circular saws. The basic principles may also be applied to other machines with manual loading and / or unloading. With an <b>automatic</b> blade <b>guard</b> an improved integration of the protection system can be achieved. In addition a new detection principle is explained. The distinction between skin and wood or other material is achieved by a dedicated spectral analysis in the near infrared region. Using LED and photodiodes it is possible to detect fingers and hands reliably. With a kind of light curtain the intrusion of hands or fingers into the dangerous zone near the blade guard can be prevented...|$|R

5000|$|The game {{takes place}} on the planet Opthamalia, in the Valley of the Leepers, which the manual {{describes}} as omnivorous creatures having [...] "two long rubbery legs, a single eye and a massive green beak". In {{the first phase of}} the game, the player pilots a spaceship to rescue crew members stranded in the valley among the Leepers. The Leepers must be avoided or shot, lest they leap up and consume the spaceship or the crew member it carries. Once all the crew members are either rescued or killed, the second phase begins. In this phase the player navigates the ship through a cave in search of a giant eyeball which must be destroyed. The cave is trapped with <b>automatic</b> lasers and <b>guarded</b> by creatures known as [...] "trabants." ...|$|R
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} on Louisiana, Hurricane Florence produced {{higher than}} normal tides, including a peak observation of 7.5feet (2.3m) {{above mean sea level}} on the Bayou Benvenue to the east of New Orleans. Rainfall was relatively light, ranging from about 1inch (25mm) to a maximum of 4.05inches (103mm) at Watson. Winds of tropical storm force occurred across southeastern Louisiana, with wind gusts peaking at 64mph (103km/h) at an <b>automatic</b> Coast <b>Guard</b> Station on the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River Delta. An unofficial tornado was reported in Tangipahoa Parish. Minor storm surge flooding occurred outside of the levee system of southern Louisiana in Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, and Saint Tammany Parishes. On Grand Isle, strong wave action resulted in significant beach erosion, with most areas on the island losing about 40feet (12.2m) of beach. The storm surge also flooded a portion of Louisiana Highway 300 near Delacroix. The passage of the hurricane broke a levee in Delacroix; it was quickly repaired with flooding from the levee being pumped to the gulf. Light to moderate damage was reported across the southeastern portion of the state, primarily from falling trees. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving about 150,000people without power for some period of time during the storm. The power outages were short-lived, with about 6,900left without power by the day after the hurricane. Damage in the state was fairly minor, totaling about $2.5million (1988USD, $4.4million 2007USD).|$|R

40|$|In 2006, we {{used the}} U. S. Coast <b>Guard’s</b> <b>Automatic</b> Identification System (AIS) to {{describe}} patterns of large commercial ship traffic within a U. S. National Marine Sanctuary located {{off the coast of}} Massachusetts. We found that 541 large commercial vessels transited the greater sanctuary 3413 times during the year. Cargo ships, tankers, and tug/tows constituted 78 % of the vessels and 82 % of the total transits. Cargo ships, tankers, and cruise ships predominantly used the designated Boston Traffic Separation Scheme, while tug/tow traffic was concentrated in the western and northern portions of the sanctuary. We combined AIS data with low-frequency acoustic data from an array of nine autonomous recording units analyzed for 2 months in 2006. Analysis of received sound levels (10 – 1000 Hz, root-mean-square pressure re 1 μPa ± SE) averaged 119. 5 ± 0. 3 dB at high-traffic locations. High-traffic locations experienced double the acoustic power of less trafficked locations {{for the majority of the}} time period analyzed. Average source level estimates (71 – 141 Hz, root-mean-square pressure re 1 μPa ± SE) for individual vessels ranged from 158 ± 2 dB (research vessel) to 186 ± 2 dB (oil tanker). Tankers were estimated to contribute 2 times more acoustic power to the region than cargo ships, and more than 100 times more than research vessels. Our results indicate that noise produced by large commercial vessels was at levels and within frequencies that warrant concern among managers regarding the ability of endangered whales to maintain acoustic contact within greater sanctuary waters...|$|R
40|$|In {{a commercially}} hosted {{operational}} mode, a scientific instrument or operational device {{is attached to}} a spacecraft but operates independently from the spacecraft s primary mission. Despite the expected benefits of this arrangement, there are few examples of hosted payload programs actually being executed by government organizations. The lack of hosted payload programs is largely driven by programmatic challenges, both real and perceived, rather than by technical challenges. Partly for these reasons, NASA has not sponsored a hosted payload program, in spite of the benefits and visible community interest in doing so. In the interest of increasing the use of hosted payloads across the space community, this paper seeks to alleviate concerns about hosted payloads by identifying these programmatic challenges and presenting ways in which they can be avoided or mitigated. Despite the challenges, several recent hosted payload programs have been successfully completed or are currently in progress. This paper presents an assessment of these programs, with a focus on acquisition, costs, schedules, risks, and other programmatic aspects. The hosted payloads included in this study are the Federal Aviation Administration's Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) payloads, United States Coast <b>Guard's</b> <b>Automatic</b> Identification System (AIS) demonstration payload, Department of Defense's IP Router In Space (IRIS) demonstration payload, the United States Air Force's Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP), and the Australian Defence Force's Ultra High Frequency (UHF) payload. General descriptions of each of these programs are presented along with issues that have been encountered and lessons learned from those experiences. A set of recommended approaches for future hosted payload programs is presented, with a focus on addressing risks or potential problem areas through smart and flexible contracting up front. This set of lessons and recommendations is broadly applicable to future hosted payload programs, whether they are technology demonstrations, communications systems, or operational sensors. Additionally, we present a basic cost model for commercial access to space for hosted payloads as a function of payload mas...|$|R
