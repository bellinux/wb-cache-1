40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were focussed on exploring the relationship between the individual constructs psychological contract breach (PCB), job satisfaction, organisational support <b>and</b> that of <b>work</b> engagement to add to previous literature. The relationship between PCB <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement has been previously researched and two different views are held. One that believes there is no direct relationship between PCB <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement, <b>and</b> one that believes there is a direct relationship. These different views confirm the complexity of the relationship that exist between PCB <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. To explore this complex relationship we introduced two moderators to ascertain their moderating effect individually on the relationship between PCB <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. The benefits to organisations <b>and</b> employees when <b>work</b> engagement levels are high have been researched and confirmed. An online survey specifically addressing the research objectives was sent out to members of a service organisation who are employed at different organisations across various industries within South Africa. A total of 1029 responses were analysed, using simple linear regression models to determine the relationship between psychological contract breach, job satisfaction and organisational support individually <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement <b>and</b> multi variable regression models were used to determine the moderating effect that job satisfaction and organisational support has as moderators on the relationship between psychological contract breach <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. For the sample population, it was determined that this study support the view that there is a significant direct relationship between PCB breach <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement as well as between job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement <b>and</b> organisational support <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. It was determined that job satisfaction has a moderating effect on the relationship that exist between psychological contract breach <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement <b>and</b> that organisational support does not have a moderating effect on the relationship.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Tracking and {{addressing}} police members' effectiveness {{in areas that}} could impact on the standard of their services is important. Burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement are specific focus areas in this regard. To measure burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement, {{it is important to}} use reliable and valid instruments. However, {{there is a lack of}} empirical research systematically investigating police burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement in South Africa, as well as serious limitations, including poorly designed studies, a lack of sophisticated statistical analyses and poorly controlled studies. Furthermore, South Africa is a multicultural society and therefore, when burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement measures are applied to different cultural groups, issues of equivalence and bias become important. Because a lack of South African norms exists for the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS) <b>and</b> Utrecht <b>Work</b> Engagement Scale (UWES), it is difficult to identify burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. Therefore, it is important to determine norms for the levels of burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement that could serve as reference for police officers in the South African Police Service (SAPS). It also seems relevant to consider differences in burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement between different demographic groups as well as between the different provinces in South Africa. Furthermore, it appears as if job stressors and coping strategies may be related to burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement. However, no studies were found that included these factors in a causal model of burnout or work engagement in police officers in South Africa The objectives of this research were to standardise the MBI-GS and the UWES for the SAPS and to determine equivalence and bias for each instrument, to determine norms and demographic differences between burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagement levels <b>and</b> to test a causal model that could explain the role of job stress and coping in burnout <b>and</b> <b>work</b> engagementDoctora...|$|R
