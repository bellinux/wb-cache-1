50|$|In 2010, {{at least}} two {{international}} aviation transportation agencies issued a number of recommendations of different passenger brace positions.

5000|$|Originally, the car offered full-service {{dining in}} the table seating area. An {{attendant}} would seat diners, take orders, prepare food in the galley and deliver it to passengers. Walk up service, like what is offered today, was offered by a second attendant in the lounge seating area. Even on the San Joaquin with its 6+ hour end to end travel time, the full-service dining option proved to be unpopular. The service and the second <b>attendant</b> <b>position</b> was eliminated. Passengers are now free to sit in any seat in the car.|$|E
50|$|Bartsch {{was born}} in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada, in 1932. She was {{interested}} in becoming a pilot from a young age, although careers counsellors at her high school advised her that becoming a female pilot was impossible, and to train as a nurse instead. Nevertheless, she applied to McGill University's aviation school. She was rejected due to her gender, and had to apply elsewhere until a flight school in Vancouver agreed {{to give her a}} place in their programme. The teachers were impressed with her aptitude and skills, however on completion of her studies, in 1951, the government inspector refused to give Bartsch the flying test. Bartsch's teacher persuaded the inspector to take her for the test; he later told the teacher that Bartsch flew so well he couldn't refuse her a license. When Bartsch and her flight school classmates were hired to what would become Air Canada, the company changed their job offer on realising her sex, and she was offered a flight <b>attendant</b> <b>position</b> rather than a pilot position. Bartsch declined and found work as a flight instructor in Calgary, Alberta, instead, although at half the pay of her male colleagues. Although more progressive airlines eventually agreed to hire her as a pilot, the Canadian Air Line Pilots’ Association refused to accept women members.|$|E
5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight <b>attendant’s</b> <b>position.</b> Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|R

25|$|On November 8, 2001 {{the company}} {{suddenly}} collapsed with no warning for travelers or employees. The company filed for bankruptcy, citing {{a downturn in}} air travel during the weeks following the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist attacks on the}} United States. The fleet was left grounded at various airports around the world, leaving 50,000 vacationers stranded. September 10, 2001 was a record booking day, but within a few days air traffic declined by 50%. The airline was offered a $75 million loan guarantee from the Canadian government under the condition of a 'viable business plan' being produced. By November 7, 2001, the airline had $260 million in debt, and only had $1.49 million in cash. In secret, it had applied to the Canada Labour Board for permission to cut labour costs by 30% by closing its Royal division immediately. The Board would not approve without union agreement. Union offers to cut 700 pilot and flight <b>attendant</b> <b>positions</b> did not provide enough savings immediately and the airline applied for bankruptcy protection on November 8, while it planned to continue flying. By the end of the day, airport authorities in Toronto and St. John's, Newfoundland has seized planes under court authority and the company directors decided to cease operations.|$|R

40|$|Objective The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the effects of a series of four training courses comprised of 13 synchronous videoconferences on the implementation of cognitive services in Spanish community pharmacies. Setting A phone survey to continuing training course attendants. Methods A random sample of 225 pharmacists registered in a 2004 videoconference course was selected. The phone-survey questionnaire included quality perception elements rated on a 5 -point Likert scale, and a series of questions used to identify position in the Rogers 5 -step innovation-decision model. An algorithm was used to translate the questions into Rogers' categories. To discover determinants of <b>attendants</b> <b>position</b> in these categories, bivariate analysis, simple correspondence analysis, and logistic regressions were performed. Main outcome measure Position in Rogers' diffusion of innovation steps regarding the adoption of pharmacotherapy follow-up. Results The perception of the course quality rated between good and very good for the majority of respondents. A significant association between having attended two or more of these four courses and the Persuasion/Decision step in Rogers's model appeared. No association was found between course attendance and the Implementation/Confirmation step of patient follow-up. Fifty percent of those who indicated they implemented the service reported following-up with less than 10 patients, and only 25 % reported following up with more than 20 patients. Conclusions Although participation in these courses was associated with higher steps in Rogers' model, significant association appeared only with Persuasion/Decision steps and not with the Implementation/Confirmation step, reflecting an attitude but not a performance change...|$|R

40|$|The {{confusion}} {{associated with}} comprehending fundamental legal concepts associated with how America conducts the “War on Terror” {{centers around the}} unwillingness of the U.

If the American government cannot properly differentiate between an enemy combatant and a domestic criminal, it is little wonder that <b>attendant</b> legal <b>positions</b> associated with investigation techniques, targeted killing, arrest, detention, rendition, trial, and interrogation are subject to never-ending debate. While all al-Qaeda unlawful enemy combatants can be labeled as violent jihadists, not all violent jihadists are unlawful enemy combatants. Without a significant about face in leadership that is willing to discern the basic difference between an unlawful enemy combatant and a domestic criminal, America’s reputation will remain under a cloud of suspicion and confusion regarding the legality of our actions associated with two significant areas of critique: rendition and targeted killing vis-àvis unlawful enemy combatants in the War on Terror...|$|R
500|$|A {{year after}} Zhang {{presented}} his seismoscope to the court, officials and candidates {{were asked to}} provide comments about a series of recent earthquakes which could be interpreted as signs of displeasure from Heaven. The ancient Chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the Chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth. In Zhang's memorial discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters, he criticized the new recruitment system of Zuo Xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title [...] "Filial and Incorrupt" [...] at age forty. The new system also transferred the power of the candidates' assessment to the Three Excellencies rather than the Generals of the Household, who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen. Although Zhang's memorial was rejected, his status was significantly elevated soon after to Palace <b>Attendant,</b> a <b>position</b> he used to influence the decisions of Emperor Shun. With this prestigious new position, Zhang earned a salary of 2,000bushels and had the right to escort the emperor.|$|R
40|$|Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as it {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by the courts, is an uncompromising statute. It bars adverse employment actions taken on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, with only one exception: in cases where an employer can demonstrate that sex, religion, or national origin is a 2 ̆ 2 bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise” Much of Title VII 2 ̆ 7 s impact, of course, depends upon the scope given to this exception, and, in particular, upon whether employers are allowed to claim inconvenience, cost, or customer preference as legitimate components of the BFOQ analysis. Because a broad exception would swallow the rule, the Supreme Court has held that the BFOQ provision was 2 ̆ 2 meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination” and established a stringent test for its application. An employer seeking a sex-based BFOQ must have a 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 factual basis 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 to believe that 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 all or substantially all women [or men] would be unable to perform safely and efficiently the duties of the job involved,’” or, alternatively, demonstrate that the qualification in question relates to 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 7 essence, 2 ̆ 7 or to the 2 ̆ 7 central mission of the employer 2 ̆ 7 s business. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Courts have also strongly rejected attempts to define the 2 ̆ 2 essence of a business 2 ̆ 2 in ways that allow sex discrimination in through the back door of customer preference. The logic is the same as that justifying a narrow BFOQ: As one court put it, “[I]t would be totally anomalous if we were to allow the preferences and prejudices of the customers to determine whether the sex discrimination was valid. Indeed, it was, to a large extent, these very prejudices the Act was meant to overcome. ” Thus, courts have refused to allow the preferences of airline customers to justify rejection of men for flight <b>attendant</b> <b>positions,</b> or the biases of customers or associates in other countries to justify refusal to promote women to positions directing international operations...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2010. Major: American Studies. Advisor: Dr. Jennifer L. Pierce. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 325 pages. This dissertation historically analyzes the working lives and activism of flight attendants in the U. S. airline industry since 1970. During that period, I trace {{the emergence of}} what I call the "family values economy. " Given three decades of neoliberal reforms, working people have been less able to count on living-wage jobs or on the state for material support. Traditional family relationships have had {{to make up for}} such austerity, with fathers, mothers, and children turning the household into a space to pool the resources of multiple low-paying service jobs. Since flight attendants' work schedules keep them away from home for weeks at a time, and because of involvement in feminist and LGBT movements long critical of "family values" agendas, I argue that flight <b>attendants</b> are uniquely <b>positioned</b> to challenge the reorganization of the economy around traditional family. Flight attendants have thus demanded and won new resources for the alternative arrangements in which they live: as single people, as unmarried parents, as same-sex couples, and as cohabitating friends. The dissertation therefore contributes to labor, gender, and sexuality studies by showing how politicizing family has sustained flight attendants' vigorous push to contest economic inequality...|$|R

He and his wife Janet created a fellowship for Graduate Study, and made a big gift in 1997, with which renovations were done. Flint Hall was renamed Keene-Flint Hall. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The text on the plaque reads as : 2 ̆ 2 First known as Science Hall, this building opened in 1910. It housed classes in physics, chemistry, botany, horticulture, zoology, bacteriology and pharmacy. In 1955 the building was renamed Flint Hall in honor of Edward Rawson Flint. Dr. Flint was the first {{professor of}} chemistry and resident physician at the University. He held a Ph. D. from the University of Gottingen in Germany and a degree in medicine from Harvard University. The restoration of this historic building in 2001, with its new auditorium and service tower, was made possible by a generous gift from Kenneth and Janet Keene adding to funds from the State of Florida. Kenneth graduated from P. K. Yonge in 1943 and then enrolled at the University. After serving in the U. S. Navy, he returned to the campus and earned a B. S. degree with honors in 1947. The next year he received a master 2 ̆ 7 s degree from the University of Michigan and then launched a career as an actuary, holding a number of executive positions with large insurance related firms. Janet attended Brigham Young University and joined American Airlines as a flight <b>attendant,</b> a <b>position</b> that she held until early retirement.

5000|$|This is a {{remarkable}} and dramatic Calvary. The central crucifix is 12 metres high and flanked by two 10 metres high crosses bearing {{the good and the}} bad murderer. At the foot of these three crosses are depictions of five people; St Longinus, who pierced Jesus in his side with a lance, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, a kneeling Mary Magdalene, John the Evangelist, and Sainte Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. The crosses and <b>attendant</b> figures are <b>positioned</b> on a pedestal which is decorated with a bas-relief depicting Saint Yves and below this is inscribed [...] "vere hic homo filius dei erat/en gwirione an den ze e ca mab doue/cet homme etait vraiment le fils du dieu".
