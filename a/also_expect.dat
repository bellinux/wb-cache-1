Invest NI and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> the series to generate tourism revenue. According to Arlene Foster, the series has given Northern Ireland the most non-political publicity in its history. The production of Game of Thrones and other TV series also boosted Northern Ireland's creative industries, contributing {{to an estimated}} 12.4-percent growth in arts, entertainment and recreation jobs between 2008 and 2013 (compared with 4.3percent {{in the rest of}} the UK during the same period).|$|E

Moreover, we can <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> that poor noncitizen children whose parents lack job-based coverage have lower rates of participation than poor citizen children of U.S. citizens. The lack of insurance for citizen children in mixed-status families means that these children {{are less likely to}} receive timely care for acute conditions, and less likely to have their chronic conditions diagnosed and appropriately managed.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} {{cost of the}} Dubai Metro {{project has}} shot up by about 80 per cent from the original AED 15.5 billion/US$4.2 billion to AED 28 billion/US$7.8 billion. The authorities contradicted this, saying {{that the cost of}} the project did not overshoot. They attributed the increase in expenditure to the major changes in the scope and design of the project. The authorities <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> to generate AED 18 billion/US$4.9 billion in income over the next 10 years; but they speculate that the Metro would not be a profit-making enterprise, since the fares would be subsidised.|$|E
25|$|O'Connor did, however, {{state that}} the Court accepts certain forms of {{categorical}} presumptions of confidentiality. But these categorical presumptions {{are a lot more}} narrowly defined than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted categorical presumption of confidentiality. She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases like this one, informants may <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for a murder case.|$|E

25|$|Announced on 19 August 2013 by Changi Airport Group, a new mixed-use complex will be {{developed}} on the car park site fronting Terminal 1 (T1) and will optimise {{the use of the}} 3.5-hectare plot of land. Construction of the new facility began in December 2014. Named Jewel Changi Airport, the complex will offer aviation and travel-related facilities, a wide range of retail offerings, as well as unique leisure attractions. The redevelopment will <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> Terminal 1 to be expanded to allow more space for the arrival hall, baggage claim areas and taxi bays, enabling T1's passenger handling capacity to increase to 24 million passenger movements per annum. Changi will be working with CapitaMalls Asia on the concept and plans of Jewel Changi Airport. The completion of the complex would expect a joint venture partnership between Changi and CapitaMalls Asia to develop and manage Project Jewel. Jewel Changi Airport is also being designed {{with a view of the}} complex from both the Airport Boulevard and the sky. It will be designed by a consortium of design consultants led by architect Moshe Safdie, who designed Marina Bay Sands. A feature of the complex will be a large-scale indoor garden with a waterfall. To be connected to Terminals 1, 2 and 3, Project Jewel will serve as a node linking the three terminals, improving inter-terminal connectivity.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{praised the}} landscape, {{environment}} and graphics of Red Dead Redemption. Erik Brudvig of IGN lauded the environmental details, noting the player can even scare {{a flock of}} birds from the bushes as they ride past. He {{also noted that the}} game's dynamic events, weather and ambient sounds provide a rich experience for players. He summarized by stating [...] "you can <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for." [...] Game Informer called the scenery [...] "breathtaking", and the cinematic cutscenes [...] "vastly improved" [...] over Grand Theft Auto IV, and named it the [...] "best-looking Rockstar game to date".|$|E

It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon after Tamarod's first statement, the Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy {{announced}} {{its support for}} protest plans. [...] "Let August 14 be the day of rebellion against the ruling gang in Bahrain," [...] the movement said in a statement. The February 14 Youth Coalition also supported the protests and called for civil disobedience for 3 days. The youth group also told participants to avoid clashing with police. Ali Salman, leader of Al Wefaq opposition society welcomed the Tamarod plans. [...] "We support any peaceful movement, {{at any time and}} from any party. Everybody has the right to protest ... the call for protests on August 14 shows that the Bahraini people will not cease to demonstrate until they achieve their demands," [...] he added. Al Wefaq however, stopped short of taking part in the Tamarod movement, blaming their secession on clashes between security forces and protesters. [...] "t {{is going to be a}} peaceful movement but having said that I <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> clashes ... I only pray that there are no victims," [...] said Ali Salman.|$|E
500|$|However, {{preceding}} 1951 season, he reimposed {{the blackout}} rule on all {{teams in the}} league. The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, [...] "You can't give fans a game for free on TV and <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> {{them to go to}} the ballpark"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952. After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL. He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week, and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams. In the DOJ's case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract; Bell was ecstatic. Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns' football games. Although he hated to fly, at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league.|$|E

2500|$|On April 23, 2009, CARB {{approved}} the specific rules and carbon intensity reference {{values for the}} LCFS that will go into effect on January 1, 2011. [...] The technical proposal was approved without modifications by a 9-1 vote, to set the 2020 maximum carbon intensity reference value for gasoline to 86 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent released per megajoule of energy produced. One standard was established for gasoline and the alternative fuels that can replace it, and a second similar standard is set for diesel fuel and its replacements. The regulation {{is based on an}} average declining standard of carbon intensity that is expected to achieve 16 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2020. CARB expects the new generation of fuels to come from the development of technology that uses cellulosic ethanol from algae, wood, agricultural waste such as straw and switchgrass, and also natural gas from municipal solid waste. They <b>also</b> <b>expect</b> the standard to drive the availability of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel-cell powered cars while promoting investment in infrastructure for electric charging stations and hydrogen fueling stations.|$|E

Right now, R is not a genre anymore. It's pop, it's hip-hop, it's other things. I wanna bring back rhythm and blues." [...] During a different interview, the girls talked about how different this album was from their shelved debut: [...] "Well it's very different coming out now because with this album we have more creative control.

But this time around, we were able to write every song on the album, which makes this album very personal for all of us." [...] They later added on, [...] "From this album you can expect realness.
