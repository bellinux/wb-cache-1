40|$|How shall a {{business}} adapt its management control systems when learning machines enter the arena? Will {{the control system}} {{continue to focus on}} humans aspects and continue to consider a learning machine to be an automation tool as any other historically programmed computer? Learning machines introduces productivity capabilities that achieve very high levels of efficiency and quality. A learning machine can sort through large amounts of data and make conclusions difficult by a human mind. However, as learning machines become even more complex systems, they introduce an uncertainty not previously considered by automation tools. The algorithms can make their own associations, and the <b>automation</b> <b>engineer</b> will no longer know exactly how a learning machine produces its outcome. What is the motive for a learning machine’s decision? A learning machine in this context becomes more human-like compared to the older generation of automation computers. This thesis concludes that most contemporary Management Control System principles are relevant when deploying machine learning, but some are not. A Management Control System must in contradiction to a historically programmed computer, consider multiple human-like aspects while controlling a deployed learning machine. These conclusions are based on empirical data from web-articles, TED-talks, literature and questionnaires directed to contemporary companies using machine learning within their organizations...|$|E
40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a {{methodology}} for the industrial <b>Automation</b> <b>Engineer</b> to help him design, build and run computer-based systems containing, physical and software parts. This methodology enables him to define a system through its requirements and its specifications, and it allows him to validate and then to run it (for instance on a PLC, a Programmable Logical Controller). This methodology {{is based on the}} description of the computer based systems in terms of hierarchical temporal-components, which are described as synchronous subsystems validated through the use of temporal logic. The concept of temporal-component is an extension of the concept of objects, it is made of four parts: (i) a declarative part giving the links with other components, the signals and the variables, (ii) a set of local operations (hard/soft), (iii) a requirements part (named ‘Goals') and (iv) a working specification part (named 'Behavior ’ or ‘Controller’), these two last parts are written using an "engineering dialect " of the Temporal logic. The validation process consists in proving that the Behavior specification of the whole embedded-system satisfies its main goal using all the subcomponents ' Goals (for this, one can use an automatic prover such as the Stanford's STEP prover). These Temporal logic requirements and specifications can easily be translated in Ladder Diagrams and run on a PLC (Programmable Logical Controller) using for instance the international standard IEC 1131 - 3. Our "engineering dialect " of the Temporal logic is built so that the translation rules from the TCOM notation to provable Temporal Logic and also to executable Ladder Diagrams (PLC) are simple.

40|$|Abstract – Formal {{verification}} of PLC programs using model-checking requires to elaborate previously temporal logic formulae that {{state in a}} formal way the properties that must be checked. Unfortunately temporal logic is a formalism totally unknown by <b>automation</b> <b>engineers.</b> This explains why PLC programs developers willing to verify the behavior of their programs are unable to use the existing modelchecking tools. Temporal logic formulae elaboration is a too difficult task. In order to overcome this problem and {{to bridge the gap}} between PLC programs development and model-checking, this paper proposes a methodology enabling to obtain invariant safety properties from fault-tree analysis. Fault-tree analysis is a quite popular analysis method often used in industry when designing critical systems. Hence using the results of this analysis to elaborate formal properties may contribute to increase the use of formal verification techniques. I...|$|R
40|$|As {{technological}} advancement continues and {{the usage of}} automation in the cab of a locomotive grows, {{the role of the}} locomotive engineer and conductor changes. There is a need then to better understand the impact of different task allocations, or configurations of tasks, among the human and automation agents. The technical objective of this thesis was to investigate whether the workload of the locomotive engineer could be predicted from a task model {{of the role of the}} engineer and conductor and their interactions with automation in rail operation. A task model was developed by reviewing existing Cognitive Task Analyses, and also by using concept mapping to identify information gaps which were then filled via expert interviews. Engineer and conductor goals and priorities were formalized in an Abstraction Hierarchy. This included controlling train speed, train forces, and dispatcher communications, while maintaining awareness of train and signal states, track conditions, and nearby traffic. Hierarchical Task Analysis was used to identify the lower level tasks of the engineer and conductor when driving manually in traditional fashion, or when using two alternative levels of throttle, brake, horn, in cab signaling and pacing <b>automation.</b> <b>Engineer</b> mental workload was predicted based on the number of information inputs and actions required, and an analysis of when the engineer would be engaged in the specific tasks while driving a route. To validate the task model based workload prediction, a human-in-the- loop experiment was conducted in a DOT locomotive simulator. Eleven subjects drove the same route manually and under the two automation conditions. Response time to a visual secondary task was used as a proxy measure for mental workload. Hierarchical mixed regression analysis was performed to compare the secondary task response time with the workload predications from the task model, which incorporated the three automation effects. Response time correlated significantly with the modeled workload. The ratio of experimental response time to predicted workload depended significantly on subject, automation condition, and along track distance effects. The task model slightly (2 %) under/overestimated mean effects of automation and average response time. However other un-modeled effects also contributed to the regression residual, as discussed. A second objective of this thesis was to consider whether the qualitative information contained in the concept maps, CTA analyses, and formal task models on the role of the engineer and conductor and their interaction with automation could be useful in policy discussions. Several potential benefits of using this information were identified: it can educate people on the job of the engineer and conductor in rail operations, it can be a shared language for stakeholders to use in discussion of the future of rail automation, and it can promote knowledge translation between researchers and policymakers. However, several steps need to be taken to get the information from the task model into an accessible form for use in policy discussions. These include creating a visual and interactive tool to display the information and involving stakeholders in the development process. by Hannah L. Groshong. Thesis: S.

40|$|Service-oriented {{architectures}} {{based on}} web services {{have become the}} de facto standard for the design and implementation of distributed applications. Due to their standardization, web services are widely adopted for inter-organizational communication, but their use for intra-organizational communication is challenging, especially within enterprises of the manufacturing domain. Business processes within an industrial enterprise have to satisfy predefined time constraints. More precisely, the manufacturing process has to guarantee real-time, i. e. predefined deadlines have to be kept. Todays industrial enterprises use specialized hard- and software at the manufacturing layer - industrial PCs (IPCs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) - that run under vendor-specific operating systems and are implemented using vendor-specific tools. This mixture of technologies of different vendors leads to numerous breaks in the communication paradigm. The interconnection of these technologies results in additional costs and is often quite error-prone. This thesis investigates the seamless use of web services as a homogeneous communication backbone throughout the overall industrial enterprise {{with a focus on}} the manufacturing layer. The common layered organization of an industrial enterprise - consisting of the business layer, the intermediate layer, and the manufacturing layer - is avoided by using web services as the communication backbone. The need for real-time makes the use of web services in industrial automation challenging. Web service standards (e. g. SOAP for the invocation and WSDL for the description of web services) and technologies (e. g. available SOAP engines) have emerged from the Internet domain where processing is based on a best-effort basis (time constraints are of little or no interest). The Time-Constrained Services (TiCS) framework presented in this thesis is a technical foundation for using web services in time-constrained environments with a specific focus on industrial automation. TiCS is a tool suite for the development, deployment, publication, composition, and execution of web services with time constraints, especially real-time constraints. TiCS consists of several components to ease the entire development process for automation engineers who are normally not familiar with web service technologies. The main components of the TiCS framework can be distinguished according to their functionality: - permit access to the manufacturing layer using web services - permit the composition of several web services to a value-added workflow that represents a production process - offer a mechanism to describe the time constraints of web services and workflows - permit the efficient transmission of binary web service parameters To access the manufacturing layer using web services, the TiCS framework offers a real-time SOAP engine for IPCs called SOAP 4 IPC and for PLCs called SOAP 4 PLC. Both engines permit an evolutionary change to a web service based communication backbone, since existing hardware can be used further. Most real-world production processes consist of several steps. Due to this reason, it is necessary to combine web services to a multi-step workflow. The TiCS Modeler supports an <b>automation</b> <b>engineer</b> to define such workflows with regard to the required time constraints. The WS-TemporalPolicy language permits the description of time constraints for web services and entire workflows. Since time constraints may vary over time, e. g. compare processing during peak time and off-peak time, WS-TemporalPolicy permits the definition of a validity period for time constraints. The protocol predominantly used for the invocation of web services is SOAP. Since SOAP is based on XML, it is necessary to encode binary parameters, resulting in a remarkable overhead. For an efficient parameter transmission - a fundamental prerequisite to process a web service within a given deadline - the TiCS framework contains a component called Flex-SwA. Despite the fact that the technologies developed in this thesis focus on industrial automation, they can also be used in related research areas where web services are used as the communication technology...|$|E
40|$|Automation {{engineering}} is an engineering discipline {{the objective of}} which is to design and implement automated functioning of industrial processes and machines. The output of automation {{engineering is}} an autonomously performing system that is controlled by an automation system. Making production processes more flexible and safe is a current trend in the industry. This increases the complexity of the processes and machines, and requires adaptability from the automation systems. Thus, also new kinds of competences, knowledge as well as work practices are expected from <b>automation</b> <b>engineers</b> who design <b>automation</b> systems. The focus in this thesis is on automation engineers’ learning at work and how this learning process can be supported with computer-assisted technologies. Engineers’ learning process is based on the knowledge of the automation engineers’ core task which is investigated {{with the help of the}} Core-Task Analysis method (Norros 2004). The core task of automation engineering work is refined with the ideas of the process model of learning at work introduced by Järvinen and Poikela (Järvinen & Poikela 2001). The model combines three well-known learning theories: individual’s experiential learning introduced by Kolb (Kolb 1984), the theory of the knowledge creating company introduced by Nonaka and Takeuchi (Nonaka & Takeuchi 1995), and finally the 4 I organizational learning framework introduced by Crossan, Lane, and White (Crossan et al. 1999). In this study the focus is on the levels of individuals’ and teams’ learning at work. Research material was collected with two methods: semi-structured theme interviews and workshops. All together 18 <b>automation</b> <b>engineers</b> were interviewed. There were both inexperienced and experienced engineers and both from the domains of process automation and machine automation. The interview themes were constructed based on the Core-Task Analysis method and the Järvinen’s and Poikela’s learning at work process model. As a result the <b>automation</b> <b>engineer’s</b> core task and learning at work process were defined. Workshops were utilized when defining the concept of work support and training tool. Based on this knowledge the concept of Autaki tool was defined and a prototype was developed. The purpose of Autaki is to assist engineers in their daily work and to support them in learning at work. According to the concept definition, Autaki is a databank of knowledge which can flexibly be extended and updated with new information. Autaki supports learning at work by providing tools for both independent and collaborative learning. There is a need for Autaki kind of tool in automation engineering work as well as in many other design work disciplines. The high requirements of performing work fast and effectively in addition to the aging and retirement of the engineers are threats for engineering companies if they do not prepare themselves into this change in an appropriate way. Essential domain specific tacit knowledge have to be transferred from the experienced engineers to the inexperienced ones.
