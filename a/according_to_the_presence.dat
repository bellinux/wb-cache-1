500|$|As part of {{the attempt}} to {{understand}} supernovae, astronomers have classified them according to their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra. The first element for division is {{the presence or absence}} of a line caused by hydrogen. If a supernova's spectrum contains lines of hydrogen (known as the Balmer series in the visual portion of the spectrum) it is classified TypeII; otherwise it is TypeI. [...] In each of these two types there are subdivisions <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve (a graph of the supernova's apparent magnitude as a function of time).|$|E
