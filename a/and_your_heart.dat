Here Madonna is the anti-materialism girl, exhorting her female audiences to respect themselves. That means having {{a man who}} loves your head <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>heart.</b> If he doesn't treat you right (and here's the revolutionary rhetoric) you're better off on your own. Like a female preacher, Madonna emphasizes each word of the chorus, invoking God {{and the power of}} orgasm. In parts Cosmo-woman, girl-talk, and swinging dance track, it presages the deliciously declarative stance of [...] "Vogue" [...] and shows Madonna moving from introspective to survivalist mode.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} re-issued on CD in 2004 {{with a very}} {{different}} track listing, featuring 1986-only tracks. Between 2004 and 2008, alternate versions of the tracks [...] "New Beginning", [...] "You <b>and</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Heart</b> So Blue", [...] "Magical", [...] "Keep Each Other Warm", [...] "Love the One You're With" [...] and [...] "Love in a World Gone Mad" [...] have been released on various Bucks Fizz compilations.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{the album}} {{contained}} {{three of its}} ten songs from the RCA days. These being the first two singles, [...] "You <b>and</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Heart</b> so Blue" [...] and [...] "Magical", along with a remix of [...] "I Hear Talk", which was featured on their 1984 album of the same name, but included here as it had since become a big hit in the clubs in both the UK and US.|$|E
2500|$|Smash Hits {{awarded the}} album an 8 out of 10 rating and singled out tracks [...] "New Beginning", [...] "You <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>Heart</b> so Blue" [...] and [...] "I Hear Talk" [...] as being {{particularly}} strong. Reviewer Tom Hibbert said that [...] " [...] is awesomely brilliantly conceived pop music performed with relish", while the songs [...] "are thoroughly ravishing, proper popular music". Number One magazine {{was impressed by}} the adult rock sound of many of the tracks, but feared that the album wouldn't stand up to repeated listenings. Nevertheless, they gave the album a 4 out of 5 rating, commenting that [...] "Writing On the Wall sees [...] the Fizzers moving ever further away from their light pop of old, [...] a fair impression of American AOR rockers â€“ in the most melodic way possible of course". The newly established Q Magazine rated the album 3 out of 5 and favoured the tracks [...] "Keep Each Other Warm" [...] and [...] "The Company You Keep". On the re-issue in 2004, The Daily Mirror stated that though the album may not be cutting-edge, it had class, while Music Week labelled the album [...] "a gem". Reviewing the 2012 re-release, Music News.com said the album saw the group lose their identity in a largely negative review. The album was rated two stars out of five but did compliment the group's performance, stating [...] "The band themselves are in pretty good form and the performances are solid but subtleties are clobbered by the production".|$|E
