40|$|A {{surgical}} tissue macerating {{and removal}} tool is described {{which has a}} rotating rod with <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>member</b> {{at one end and}} which disposed in a tube which is then contained in an extension of the tool handle. A frusto-conical member extends into the extension at the cutter member end of the rotating rod with its small end engaging the tube. The portion of the frusto-conical member outside of the extension forms a tissue engaging member and may be cut-off at an angle to the axis of the rod to form a tissue engaging edge. Apertures are provided in the extension adjacent the frusto-concial member so that treatment fluid supplied in the annular space between the tube and the extension may flow to the operative site. An aperture is provided in the frustoconical member between the extension and the tube so that fluid may also flow into the tube where it mixes with macerated tissue being directed through an aperture in the tube to a passageway which may have suction applied to help remove macerated material...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tool for producing a test cut in workpieces in panel or strip form, in particular on sheet, whereby the tool has a first cut {{and a second}} cut which is movable past the first cut to form <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> gap. The purpose of invention is to create <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tool which permits the generation of a test cut using <b>a</b> single <b>cutting</b> operation, permitting <b>an</b> assessment of several parameters of the cuttability of the workpiece such as the achievable cut edge quality, the occurrence of cutting burr and the optimum cutting gap width to be selected. The invention achieves this {{by the fact that}} the cuts (6, 11) are arranged at an angle () in such a way that <b>a</b> wedge-shaped <b>cutting</b> gap (u) is formed...|$|R
40|$|Vibrations of a tool or <b>a</b> {{workpiece}} in <b>cutting</b> shorten {{tool life}} and deteriorate a surface roughness. In this research, we propose {{a method to}} reduce vibrations of the workpiece at <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> point. An algorithm that generates <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> path to minimize workpiece displacements at <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> point is developed. In this algorithm, the cutting path is generated with changing feed directions, tool posture and material removal process by considering workpiece compliance matrices and cutting force vectors. Feed directions and tool posture are changed to control {{the direction of the}} cutting force vector. Material removal process is changed to control the change of the workpiece compliance. FEM (Finite Element Method) is used to calculate workpiece compliance matrices. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is used to calculate the direction which has the lowest compliance in the workpiece compliance matrices. Minimum workpiece displacement at <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> point is calculated from these calculated results. The algorithm is applied to the cutting path of end milling for a simple bar and the cutting path is compared with two conventional cutting paths by conducting a simulation and <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> test. <b>As</b> a result, mean values of workpiece displacement were reduced by applying the algorithm...|$|R

25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap without the flutes. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need}} to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|R
