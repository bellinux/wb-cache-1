5|$|In October 2013, hip-hop artist Daz Dillinger {{issued a}} {{cease and desist}} letter to Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive for {{allegedly}} using two of his songs without authorisation. American television personality Karen Gravano of the reality television programme Mob Wives filed suit against Rockstar Games in February 2014 in allegation that a character in the game is based on her likeness and story and was depicted without her consent. Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that the <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> foreclosed by the First Amendment. In July, actress Lindsay Lohan also filed a lawsuit, claiming elements in the game, including the Lacey Jonas character, were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes. In 2016, both lawsuits were dismissed.|$|E

25|$|Transnistria's {{economy is}} {{frequently}} described as dependent on contraband and gunrunning, with some labelling it a mafia state. These <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> denied by the Transnistrian government, and sometimes downplayed by the officials of Russia and Ukraine.|$|E

50|$|The spouse that is {{responsible}} for committing these <b>allegations</b> <b>is</b> required to confirm the correct date and place that the <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> committed. The reason for the spouse to confirm the <b>allegations</b> <b>is</b> to show proof that the allegations have taken place in the same state. The state then has to have the authority to administer justice by hearing and determining the controversies. Different states accept different grounds for divorce. For example, some states only accept no-fault divorce where other states accept both fault and no-fault grounds for divorce.|$|R

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the simplification process is arbitrary and not based on consistent rules.

Articles that claim to rebut those charges include Juha Pentikäinen's The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force.|$|E

25|$|On May 12, 2011, ClearCorrect filed a countersuit against Align Technology, denying {{allegations}} {{that it is}} infringing on Align patents.

The countersuit cited much of the evidence raised in Align's previous patent case against Ormco, {{which resulted in a}} federal court ruling that 11 of Align's patent claims were invalid.|$|E
5000|$|This key {{piece of}} {{evidence}} was used to convince the Guatemalan populace and the world that Rodrigo Rosenberg had himself killed.

25|$|The {{merits of}} the <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> {{impossible}} to judge, although {{it seems clear that}} Archer was acquainted with Cahill. The assassination plot was just one of many against the queen that received credence during the final decade of her reign. One sceptic has pointed out that the evidence only emerged once Father Robert Persons had published his A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crown of England. The book does appear to have alarmed Elizabeth's advisers, and from that date onward the flow of supposed plots against the queen's life became steady. In 1601 Cecil himself was accused of treason at the trial of the Earl of Essex {{on the basis of his}} reading of Person's book, but survived this twist and went on to secure the succession of James I upon the queen's death two years later.|$|E
25|$|There {{have long}} been {{allegations}} that volunteer DMOZ editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition. Such <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> fielded by ODP's staff and meta editors, who {{have the authority to}} take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices. In 2003, DMOZ introduced a new Public Abuse Report System that allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form. Uninhibited discussion of DMOZ's purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream Webmaster discussion forums. Although site policies suggest that an individual site should be submitted to only one category, as of October 2007, Topix.com, a news aggregation site operated by DMOZ founder Rich Skrenta, had more than 17,000 listings.|$|E
25|$|The {{officers}} {{have been subject to}} criticism, both in the media and in formal proceedings before the Braidwood Commission of Inquiry. The officers were served notices of misconduct by the commission forewarning them the commissioner may include a finding of misconduct in its final report. The warnings allege specific but overlapping grounds for each of the four. The collective <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> that they failed to properly assess and respond to the circumstances in which they found Mr. Dziekański. They repeatedly deployed the taser without justification and separately failed to adequately reassess the situation before further deploying it. The notices allege that afterwards they misrepresented facts in notes and statements, furthered the misrepresenting before the commission and provided further misleading information about other evidence before the commission. The four officers each sought judicial review to prevent the commission from making findings based on the notices. The petitions were dismissed. Three of the officers appealed and lost. In July 2013 one of the three officers was cleared of perjury. The remaining two officers stood trial in 2014.|$|E

50|$|In September 2012, {{there were}} accusations {{that there had}} been {{misappropriation}} of funds amounting to Rs. 700 billion (about $13 billion). These <b>allegations</b> <b>were</b> made by a Maharashtra bureaucrat, Vijay Pandhare, and caused Anjali Damani to request Pawar's resignation as a minister.

25|$|The Copenhagen daily, Politiken, {{published}} further charges {{stemming from}} Operación Puerto on August 19, 2006. The article summarizes Hamilton's alleged doping program during 2003. It quotes Danish doping researcher Rasmus Damsgaard {{on the organization}} Hamilton's program would have required. It cites Bjarne Riis, Hamilton's directeur sportif in 2003, denying knowledge of Hamilton's doping. And the article states that the reporters attempted to contact Hamilton on numerous occasions but were unable to reach him. The article's <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> based on the rider's doping and racing calendar obtained by the paper. The calendar was seized in Operación Puerto. The doping calendar indicates use of EPO, growth hormone, testosterone, blood doping, and insulin on 114 days over seven months during the 2003 season. The racing program correlates with Hamilton's races in 2003, according to Politiken. The calendar includes two blood transfusions during the Tour de France. “The first time before the three stages in the Alps and the second before the 12th stage – a 47 km individual time trial,” write the reporters. The article stated that such an ambitious program would have required assistance – “at least four or five people,” according to Damsgaard.|$|E
25|$|In response, on {{the basis}} it was {{tantamount}} to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, Pauline Green, announced she would put forward a motion of censure. However PES would vote against its own motion, {{as there is no}} method for a motion of confidence. During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a de facto opposition party to the executive. This is in part because the allegations centred on Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both from the Socialist party (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the People's party (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the 1999 elections. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations. Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.|$|E
25|$|The {{school board}} prohibits {{bullying}} by district students and employees. The board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when <b>allegations</b> <b>are</b> verified.

The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives.|$|E
