5|$|The {{combination}} of Lutosławski's <b>aleatory</b> techniques and his harmonic discoveries {{allowed him to}} build up complex musical textures. According to Bodman Rae, in his later works Lutosławski evolved a more mobile, simpler, harmonic style, in which less of the music is played with an ad libitum coordination. This development {{first appeared in the}} brief Epitaph for oboe and piano, around the time Lutosławski was struggling to find the technical means to complete his Third Symphony. In chamber works for just two instrumentalists the scope for <b>aleatory</b> counterpoint and dense harmonies is significantly less than for orchestra, but these developments also influenced his orchestral style in late works including the Piano Concerto, Chantefleurs et Chantefables, Chain 2 and the Fourth Symphony, which require mostly conventional coordination.|$|E
5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term <b>aleatory</b> are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
25|$|Zukofsky's formal procedures, {{especially}} {{his interest in}} <b>aleatory</b> writing, were a key influence on Jackson Mac Low and John Cage, amongst others, and through them on the Language School, an avant garde group of poets who started publishing in the 1970s and who included Bruce Andrews, Charles Bernstein, Ron Silliman, Lyn Hejinian, Bob Perelman, Michael Palmer, Rae Armantrout, Carla Harryman, Barrett Watten, Clark Coolidge, Hannah Weiner, Susan Howe, Tina Darragh and Fanny Howe.|$|E
25|$|Other poets often {{associated}} with the Black Mountain are Cid Corman (1924–2004) and Theodore Enslin (born 1925), though they are perhaps more correctly viewed as direct descendants of the Objectivists. And one-time Black Mountain College resident, composer John Cage (1912–1992), along with Jackson Mac Low (1922–2004), wrote poetry based on chance or <b>aleatory</b> techniques. Inspired by Zen, Dada and scientific theories of indeterminacy, they were to prove to be important influences on the 1970s U.S avant-garde.|$|E
25|$|Skempton's {{style is}} characterised by a {{concentration}} on quality {{of sound and}} economy of means, absence of development in the conventional sense, and concentration on sonority. Many of his pieces are quite short, lasting no longer {{than one or two}} minutes. Although the compositional methods are clearly experimental, involving, for example, <b>aleatory</b> methods, there is a marked emphasis on the melody in many pieces. Some of his earlier piano works, such as Saltaire Melody (1977) and Trace (1980), have become favourites with the public.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he would}} {{continue}} to write short poems and prose works, notably the 1963 Bottom: On Shakespeare, the completion of A was to be the major concern of the remainder of Zukofsky's writing life. As the poem progressed, formal considerations tended to be foregrounded more and more, with Zukofsky applying a wide range of devices and approaches, from the sonnet to <b>aleatory</b> or random composition. The final complete edition was going to press as the poet lay on his deathbed in 1978. His final written work was the index to this volume.|$|E
500|$|Karlheinz Stockhausen ( [...] ; 22 August 1928 – 5 December 2007) was a German composer, widely {{acknowledged}} by critics {{as one of}} the most important but also controversial [...] composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. A critic calls him [...] "one of the great visionaries of 20th-century music" [...] He is known for his groundbreaking work in electronic music, for introducing controlled chance (<b>aleatory</b> techniques or aleatoric musical techniques) into serial composition, and for musical spatialization.|$|E
500|$|Both Lutosławski's {{harmonic}} and <b>aleatory</b> {{processes are}} illustrated by example 1, {{an excerpt from}} Hésitant, the first movement of the Symphony No. 2. At number 7, the conductor gives a cue to the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who then play their parts in their own time, without any attempt to synchronise with the other instrumentalists. The harmony of this section {{is based on a}} 12-note chord built from major seconds and perfect fourths. After all the instrumentalists have finished their parts, a two-second general pause is indicated. The conductor then gives a cue at number 8 (and indicates the tempo of the following section) for two oboes and the cor anglais. They each play their part, again with no attempt to synchronise with the other players. The harmony of this part is based on the hexachord F–G–A–C–D–D, arranged {{in such a way that}} the harmony of the section never includes any sixths or thirds. When the conductor gives another cue at number 9, the players each continue until they reach the repeat sign, and then stop: they are unlikely to end the section at the same time. This [...] "refrain" [...] (from numbers 8 to 9) recurs throughout the movement, slightly altered each time, but always played by double-reed instruments which do not play elsewhere in the movement: Lutosławski thus also carefully controls the orchestral palette.|$|E

2500|$|Lousadzak was Hovhaness's first work to {{make use}} of an {{innovative}} technique he called [...] "spirit murmur", an early example of aleatoric music inspired by a vision of Hermon di Giovanno. The technique, essentially similar to the 1960s ad libitum <b>aleatory</b> of Lutoslawski, involves instruments repeating phrases in uncoordinated fashion, producing a complex [...] "cloud" [...] or [...] "carpet" [...] of sounds..|$|E
2500|$|Henri Pousseur is {{generally}} regarded {{as a member of}} the Darmstadt School in the 1950s. Pousseur's music employs serialism, mobile forms, and <b>aleatory,</b> often mediating between or among seemingly irreconcilable styles, such as those of Schubert and Webern (Votre Faust), or Pousseur's own serial style and the protest song [...] "We shall overcome" [...] (Couleurs croisées). He was strongly linked to the social strikes in Liège during the 1960s. He worked also with the French writer Michel Butor.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Edward Ives ( [...] ; October 20, 1874May 19, 1954) was an American [...] modernist composer. He {{is one of}} {{the first}} American composers of {{international}} renown, though his music was largely ignored during his life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years. Over time, he came to be regarded as an [...] "American original". He combined the American popular and church-music traditions of his youth with European art music, and was among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, <b>aleatory</b> elements, and quarter tones, foreshadowing many musical innovations of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{contracts}} {{of insurance}} {{have many features}} in common with wagers, insurance contracts are often distinguished under law as agreements in which either party {{has an interest in}} the [...] "bet-upon" [...] outcome beyond the specific financial terms. e.g.: a [...] "bet" [...] with an insurer on whether one's house will burn down is not gambling, but rather insurance — as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the continued existence of his/her home independent of the purely financial aspects of the [...] "bet" [...] (i.e., the insurance policy). Nonetheless, both insurance and gambling contracts are typically considered <b>aleatory</b> contracts under most legal systems, though they are subject to different types of regulation.|$|E

But no scientific discovery has proved so ripe for spiritual projection as the theories of quantum physics, replete with their quixotic qualities of uncertainty, simultaneity and parallelism." [...] Wertheim continues that the movie [...] "abandons itself entirely to the ecstasies of quantum mysticism, finding in this <b>aleatory</b> description of nature the key to spiritual transformation. As one of the film’s characters gushes early in the proceedings, 'The moment we acknowledge the quantum self, we say that somebody has become enlightened'. [...] A moment in which 'the mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics [...] are stripped of all empirical content and reduced to a set of syrupy nostrums'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Palmer has {{published}} translations from French, Russian and Brazilian Portuguese, and {{has engaged in}} multiple collaborations with painters. These include the German painter Gerhard Richter, French painter Micaëla Henich, and Italian painter Sandro Chia. He edited and helped translate Nothing The Sun Could Not Explain: Twenty Contemporary Brazilian Poets (Sun & Moon Press, 1997). With Michael Molnar and John High, Palmer helped edit and translate a volume of poetry by the Russian poet Alexei Parshchikov, Blue Vitriol (Avec Books, 1994). He also translated [...] "Theory of Tables" [...] (1994), a book written by Emmanuel Hocquard, a project {{that grew out of}} Hocquard's translations of Palmer's [...] "Baudelaire Series" [...] into French. Palmer has written many radio plays and works of criticism. But his lasting significance occurs as the singular concerns of the artist extend into the <b>aleatory,</b> the multiple, and the collaborative.|$|E
2500|$|Frequentists posit {{that the}} {{probability}} of an event is its relative frequency over time, (3.4) i.e., its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process {{a large number of}} times under similar conditions. This is also known as <b>aleatory</b> probability. [...] The events are assumed to be governed by some random physical phenomena, which are either phenomena that are predictable, in principle, with sufficient information (see determinism); or phenomena which are essentially unpredictable. Examples of the first kind include tossing dice or spinning a roulette wheel; an example of the second kind is radioactive decay. In the case of tossing a fair coin, frequentists say that {{the probability of}} getting a heads is 1/2, not because there are two equally likely outcomes but because repeated series of large numbers of trials demonstrate that the empirical frequency converges to the limit 1/2 as the number of trials goes to infinity.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1960 and 1969 Bois {{composed}} {{a series of}} seven Pastorales for various instrumental combinations. (Pastorale V, for example, is his Second String Quartet, written in 1966). The numerical order does not correspond {{to the order of}} composition. Rather, the pieces are arranged so as to become increasingly remote from the character suggested by the series title [...] He planned the cycle to amount to nine or ten pieces in all, to conclude with a large-dimension composition combining all of the instruments used in the preceding works in the series (Vetter 1966). By far his best-known and often-recorded work is the last work in this series, Pastorale VII (1964) for solo recorder, which employs <b>aleatory</b> techniques and is based on a motivic distribution and filtering of several dense chords. It was Pastorale VII that convinced Louis Andriessen to authorise a recorder version of his Paintings for flute and piano, since he felt the recorder had more potential than the flute for producing new and exciting sounds ( [...] ; [...] ). Pastorale II (begun in 1963 but completed only in 1969) also includes the alto recorder, together with flute and guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Cowell would {{ultimately}} spend {{four years in}} San Quentin State Prison. There he taught fellow inmates, directed the prison band, and continued to write music at his customary prolific pace, producing around sixty compositions, including two major pieces for percussion ensemble: the Oriental-toned Pulse (1939) and the memorably sepulchral Return (1939). He also continued his experiments in <b>aleatory</b> music: for all three movements of the Amerind Suite (1939), he wrote five versions, each more difficult than the last. Interpreters of the piece are invited to simultaneously perform two or even three {{versions of the same}} movement on multiple pianos. In the Ritournelle (Larghetto and Trio) (1939) for the dance piece Marriage at the Eiffel Tower, performing in Seattle, he explored what he called [...] "elastic" [...] form. The twenty-four measures of the Larghetto and the eight of the Trio are each modular; though Cowell offers some suggestions, any hypothetically may be included or not and played once or repeatedly, allowing the piece to stretch or contract at the performers' will—the practical goal being to give a choreographer freedom to adjust the length and character of a dance piece without the usual constraints imposed by a prewritten musical composition.|$|E
2500|$|The title Votre Faust {{is meant}} {{on the one}} hand to recall Paul Valéry's {{unfinished}} play Mon Faust, and on the other to refer to the mobile form of the work. The second-person possessive pronoun also suggests a connection to Butor's best-known novel, La modification [...] Butor and Pousseur call Votre Faust a [...] "fantaisie variable genre opéra" [...] (variable fantasy in the style of an opera), in order to emphasize its distance from operatic conventions. Although live singers are called for, the principal roles are taken by actors, instrumentalists share the stage and interact with the singers and actors, and much of the vocal material is actually prerecorded on tape. The second act has an <b>aleatory</b> structure, in which the audience determines the course of the action by formal ballots at some points, and by vocal interjections at others. There are about seven hours of material in the thousand pages of the score, but only a selection can occur in any one version. Because of this intentionally variable structure, duration may vary considerably from one version to another, but stagings to date have been between three and three-and-a-half hours ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
6000|$|That {{for which}} man lives {{is not the}} same thing for all {{individuals}} nor in all ages; yet it has a common base; what he seeks and what he must have is that which will seize and hold his attention. Regular meals and weather-proof lodgings will not do this long. Play in its wide sense, as the artificial induction of sensation, including all games and all arts, will, indeed, go far to keep him conscious of himself; but in the end he wearies for realities. Study or experiment, to some rare natures, is the unbroken pastime of a life. These are enviable natures; people shut in the house by sickness often bitterly envy them; but the commoner man cannot continue to exist upon such altitudes: his feet itch for physical adventure; his blood boils for physical dangers, pleasures, and triumphs; his fancy, the looker after new things, cannot continue to look for them in books and crucibles, but must seek them on the breathing stage of life. Pinches, buffets, the glow of hope, the shock of disappointment, furious contention with obstacles: these are the true elixir for all vital spirits, these are what they seek alike in their romantic enterprises and their unromantic dissipations. When they are taken in some pinch closer than the common, they cry, [...] "Catch me here again!" [...] and sure enough you catch them there again--perhaps before the week is out. It is as old as [...] "Robinson Crusoe"; as old as man. Our race has not been strained for all these ages through that sieve of dangers that we call Natural Selection, to sit down with patience in the tedium of safety; the voices of its fathers call it forth. Already in our society as it exists, the bourgeois is too much cottoned about for any zest in living; he sits in his parlour out of reach of any danger, often out of reach of any vicissitude but one of health; and there he yawns. If the people in the next villa took pot-shots at him, he might be killed indeed, but so long as he escaped he would find his blood oxygenated and his views of the world brighter. If Mr. Mallock, on his way to the publishers, should have his skirts pinned to a wall by a javelin, it would not occur to him--at least for several hours--to ask if life were worth living; and if such peril were a daily matter, he would ask it never more; he would have other things to think about, he would be living indeed--not lying in a box with cotton, safe, but immeasurably dull. The <b>aleatory,</b> whether it touch life, or fortune, or renown--whether we explore Africa or only toss for halfpence--that is what I conceive men to love best, and that is what we are seeking to exclude from men's existences. Of all forms of the <b>aleatory,</b> that which most commonly attends our working men--the danger of misery from want of work--is the least inspiriting: it does not whip the blood, it does not evoke the glory of contest; it is tragic, but it is passive; and yet, in so far as it is <b>aleatory,</b> and a peril sensibly touching them, it does truly season the men's lives. Of those who fail, I do not speak--despair should be sacred; but to those who even modestly succeed, the changes of their life bring interest: a job found, a shilling saved, a dainty earned, all these are wells of pleasure springing afresh for the successful poor; and it is not from these but from the villa-dweller that we hear complaints of the unworthiness of life. Much, then, as the average of the proletariat would gain in this new state of life, they would also lose a certain something, which would not be missed in the beginning, but would be missed progressively and progressively lamented. Soon there would be a looking back: there would be tales of the old world humming in young men's ears, tales of the tramp and the pedlar, and the hopeful emigrant. And in the stall-fed life of the successful ant-heap--with its regular meals, regular duties, regular pleasures, an even course of life, and fear excluded--the vicissitudes, delights, and havens of to-day will seem of epic breadth. This may seem a shallow observation; but the springs by which men are moved lie much on the surface. Bread, I believe, has always been considered first, but the circus comes close upon its heels. Bread we suppose to be given amply; the cry for circuses will be the louder, and if the life of our descendants be such as we have conceived, there are two beloved pleasures on which they will be likely to fall back: the pleasures of intrigue and of sedition.|$|E
60|$|This for the un{{fortunate}}. But {{with the}} fortunate also, even those whom the inspector loves, {{it may not}} be altogether well. It is concluded that in such a state of society, supposing it to be financially sound, the level of comfort will be high. It does not follow: there are strange depths of idleness in man, a too-easily-got sufficiency, {{as in the case of}} the sago-eaters, often quenching the desire for all besides; and it is possible that the men of the richest ant-heaps may sink even into squalor. But suppose they do not; suppose our tricksy instrument of human nature, when we play upon it this new tune, should respond kindly; suppose no one to be damped and none exasperated by the new conditions, the whole enterprise to be financially sound--a vaulting supposition--and all the inhabitants to dwell together in a golden mean of comfort: we have yet to ask ourselves if this be what man desire, or if it be what man will even deign to accept for a continuance. It is certain that man loves to eat, it is not certain that he loves that only or that best. He is supposed to love comfort; it is not a love, at least, that he is faithful to. He is supposed to love happiness; it is my contention that he rather loves excitement. Danger, enterprise, hope, the novel, the <b>aleatory,</b> are dearer to man than regular meals. He does not think so when he is hungry, but he thinks so again as soon as he is fed; and on the hypothesis of a successful ant-heap, he would never go hungry. It would be always after dinner in that society, as, in the land of the Lotos-eaters, it was always afternoon; and food, which, when we have it not, seems all-important, drops in our esteem, as soon as we have it, to a mere pre-requisite of living.|$|E
60|$|If any {{one wishes}} to {{understand}} the quarrel between Dickens and the Americans, let him turn to that chapter in Martin Chuzzlewit, in which young Martin has to receive endless defiles and deputations of total strangers each announced by name and demanding formal salutation. There are several things to be noticed about this incident. To begin with, it did not happen to Martin Chuzzlewit; but it did happen to Charles Dickens. Dickens is incorporating almost without alteration a passage from a diary {{in the middle of}} a story; as he did when he included the admirable account of the prison petition of John Dickens as the prison petition of Wilkins Micawber. There is no particular reason why even the gregarious Americans should so throng the portals of a perfectly obscure steerage passenger like young Chuzzlewit. There was every reason why they should throng the portals of the author of Pickwick and Oliver Twist. And no doubt they did. If I may be permitted the <b>aleatory</b> image, you bet they did. Similar troops of sociable human beings have visited much more insignificant English travellers in America, with some of whom I am myself acquainted. I myself have the luck to be a little more stodgy and less sensitive than many of my countrymen; and certainly less sensitive than Dickens. But I know what it was that annoyed him about that unending and unchanging stream of American visitors; it was the unending and unchanging stream of American sociability and high spirits. A people living on such a lofty but level tableland do not understand the ups and downs of the English temperament; the temper of a nation of eccentrics or (as they used to be called) of humorists. There is something very national in the very name of the old play of Every Man in His Humour. But the play more often acted in real life is 'Every Man Out of His Humour.' It is true, as Matthew Arnold said, that an Englishman wants to do as he likes; but it is not always true even that he likes what he likes. An Englishman can be friendly and yet not feel friendly. Or he can be friendly and yet not feel hospitable. Or he can feel hospitable and yet not welcome those whom he really loves. He can think, almost with tears of tenderness, about people at a distance who would be bores if they came in at the door.|$|E

Instead of composing in this way, Dusapin seems to compose measure by measure, deciding what he wants to happen next when he gets there. This process slightly alludes to the chance-like aspect of <b>aleatory</b> music, but Dusapin’s music is so precisely composed that it cannot truly be aleatoric. Stoïnova writes, [...] "With regard to Dusapin’s music we can observe a principle of auto-organization and complexity in the compositional system through the integration or assimilation of <b>aleatory</b> disturbances." [...] In other words, Dusapin lets the music go where it will, often evoking <b>aleatory</b> idioms, while still notating everything and maintaining control of his music. He avoids repetition and rejects stability and redundancy in music, which is yet another distinguishing feature of his music.|$|E
