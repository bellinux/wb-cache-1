40|$|Summary The paper shows a {{case study}} {{concerning}} the liquefaction potential <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposits</b> which mainly consist of non plastic silts and sands. The site under study has been characterized by means of in situ tests (CPTU, SPT and DPSH), boreholes and laboratory tests on undisturbed samples. Liquefaction susceptibility has been evaluated by means of several standard procedures prescribed by codes or available in technical literature. The evaluation of liquefaction potential {{has been carried out}} by means of different standard procedures based on in situ and laboratory tests. A qualitative estimation of possible damages to shallow structures has been obtained on the basis of indication contained in TC 4 -ISSMGE [1993]. In addition, quantitative effects of minor liquefaction phoenomena on shallow structures have been studied by means of simplified soil-foundation interaction. The main scope of the paper is to show that application of standard procedures for liquefaction susceptibility or liquefaction potential in areas of medium – low seismicity can lead to overemphasize the liquefaction problem. In addition, any liquefaction study should consider, at least in a simplified way, the effects of possible liquefaction on the shallow structures. In addition useful information about the liquefaction strength of silty sands is provided...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Problems which {{relate to}} production, health and {{reproduction}} in herds of high yielding cows very often occur due to insufficient knowledge and monitoring of energy reserves in cow organisms. Many researches and practical experiences {{in this field}} indicate significant relation between body condition and achieved results in production. Body condition of heads of cattle in certain stages of production cycle is important parameter of applied nutrition, but also entire technological procedure. In countries with developed cattle production, evaluation of body condition has for several years been main component of production practice on farms. It is considered that condition is very reliable indicator of the nutrition status and energy balance in the organism.

The special emphasis {{is given to the}} most common PPP model in the field of industrial infrastructure construction using the Investment Fund of RF. We offer specific tools to be used with Russian models for <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> PPP projects and forecasting of its efficiency for its participants. This model allows evaluating the results <b>of</b> the whole <b>deposit</b> development process, constructing graphs of all types of expenditures and revenues (by years), and having rent <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> NPV (net present value) and internal rent rate (IRR).

The results of analyses of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> known VMS <b>deposits</b> and their spatial associations with geological features are consistent with existing knowledge of geological controls on VMS mineralization in the district, and we used them to define spatial recognition criteria of regional-scale VMS prospectivity. Integration of layers of evidence representing spatial recognition criteria of VMS prospectivity via application of data-driven evidential belief functions results in a regional-scale map of prospective areas occupying 15 % of the district and having fitting and prediction-rates of 100 %. We used the map of prospective areas and proxy measures for degrees of exploration based on the spatial distribution <b>of</b> known VMS <b>deposits</b> in one-level prediction of undiscovered mineral endowment. We obtained estimates of 709 Kt undiscovered Cu endowment, 3190 Kt undiscovered Zn endowment, 95 Mt undiscovered ore tonnage, and 48 undiscovered VMS deposits. These estimates are slightly (ca. 5 % on average) lower than, and thus corroborated by, estimates obtained via radial-density fractal analysis of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> known VMS <b>deposits.</b> Therefore, mineral prospectivity mapping can be a part <b>of</b> mineral resource <b>assessment</b> if the spatial distribution <b>of</b> discovered <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> the type sought is considered in both predictive modeling processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The physic-chemical and {{mechanical}} properties <b>of</b> steel <b>deposits</b> obtained by thermal spraying depend on technological {{parameters of the}} spraying process. Generally, wear resistance <b>of</b> the <b>deposits</b> depends {{on the degree of}} porosity and the adhesion of the layer to the substrate. In the case <b>of</b> the <b>deposits</b> obtained by spraying, studies have shown that between deposited layer (SD) and substrate (S) there are the following types of adhesions: mechanical, metallurgical, superficial, physical and diffusive. Each type of adherence, enumerated above, works through a well-defined mechanism {{so that it can be}} said that the adhesion <b>of</b> the obtained <b>deposits</b> by thermal spray is a sum of mechanisms which interacting. How these mechanisms interact, as well the percentage of the influence is determined by: operating parameters, by the deposit material and thermal treatments after the deposit obtaining.

IADI, {{in collaboration with the}} BCBS, IMF, the World Bank, European Forum <b>of</b> <b>Deposit</b> Insurers (EFDI) and European Commission developed a Methodology for the <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Compliance with the Core Principles. Such assessments include self-assessments and Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) reviews conducted by IMF and the World Bank, as well as country and peer review programs conducted by the FSB. Being a part of the FSB Compendium of Key Standards for Sound Financial Systems, the IADI Core Principles are used by international community in assessing the condition of financial systems. A comprehensive, credible and action-oriented <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>deposit</b> insurer against the Core Principles identifies strengths and weaknesses in an existing system and forms a basis for improvement measures by policymakers. Proper application of the IADI Core Principles gives significant advantage in the pursuit of financial stability, pairing the right protection for retail depositors with more multifaceted aspects of crisis management.

Tubular, dehydrated halloysite from the deposit does not readily intercalate formamide, {{and the proportion}} of tubes in < 2 /tm size-fractions was determined initially from scanning electron micrographs. For samples showing arange of tube contents, a strong correlation between IR spectral response and counts of halloysite tubes was established using partial east-squares analysis. This provided a rapid technique suitable for routine determination f tubular halloysite insamples from the Mount Hope deposit. Although the universality ofthe method remains to be tested, itoffers an alternative approach to other analytical techniques for <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> kaolin <b>deposits</b> where the presence ofhalloysite issuspected.

40|$|Purpose. To use {{in vitro}} and {{in vivo models}} to {{evaluate}} Glechoma longituba extract to provide scientific evidence for this extract’s antiurolithic activity. Materials and Methods. Potassium citrate {{was used as a}} positive control group. Oxidative stress (OS) markers and the expression of osteopontin (OPN) and kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM- 1) were measured to assess the protective effects of Glechoma longituba. Multiple urolithiasis-related biochemical parameters were evaluated in urine and serum. Kidneys were harvested for histological examination and the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> crystal <b>deposits.</b> Results. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that treatment with Glechoma longituba extract significantly decreased calcium oxalate- (CaOx-) induced OPN expression, KIM- 1 expression, and OS compared with the positive control group (P< 0. 05). Additionally, in vivo rats that received Glechoma longituba extract exhibited significantly decreased CaOx deposits and pathological alterations (P< 0. 05) compared with urolithic rats. Significantly lower levels of oxalate, creatinine, and urea and increased citrate levels were observed among rats that received Glechoma longituba (P< 0. 05) compared with urolithic rats. Conclusion. Glechoma longituba has antiurolithic effects due to its possible combined effects of increasing antioxidant levels, decreasing urinary stone-forming constituents and urolithiasis-related protein expression, and elevating urinary citrate levels...|$|R

Here, a general multi-species reactive transport formulation has been developed, which is applicable to homogeneous and/or heterogeneous reactions that can proceed either subject to local equilibrium conditions or kinetic rates under non-isothermal multiphase flow conditions. Two numerical solution methods, the direct substitution approach (DSA) and sequential iteration approach (SIA) for solving the coupled complex subsurface thermo-physical-chemical processes, are described. An efficient sequential iteration approach, which solves transport of solutes and chemical reactions sequentially and iteratively, is proposed for the current reactive chemical transport computer code development. The coupled flow (water, vapor, air and heat) and solute transport equations are also solved sequentially.

40|$|The {{basic method}} for {{analyzing}} {{the degree of}} DNA fragmentation caused by genotoxic factors is gel electrophoresis of single cells (single cell gel electrophoresis), also called the comet assay. The comet assay enables {{the analysis of the}} level of several different DNA modifications. The basic testing procedure has been only slightly modified. This method helps identify single-strand and double-strand DNA cracks, as well as any chemical and enzymatic modifications that can potentially turn into cracks in DNA or chromatids. The comet assay makes it possible to detect DNA damage at the level of single cells. It can be employed in analyses of any tissues which provide cellular suspensions. Analysed cells are submerged in agarose on a microscope slide. DNA is what is left after proteins have been broken down. The slide is then subjected to electrophoresis and stained with a fluorescent dye. A “comet-like” image is obtained. The “head” is the cell fixation site prior to lysis; the “tail” represents damaged DNA fragments. The extent of DNA damage is reflected in the length of the tail and the amount of DNA contained in it.

Intersections of NNE- and NW-trending faults were likely predominantly involved in local-scale structural controls on lode gold mineralisation, whilst NNE-trending faults were likely predominantly involved in district-scale structural controls on lode gold mineralisation. The results of the spatial analyses facilitate the conceptualisation and selection of spatial evidence layers for lode gold prospectivity mapping in the study area. The applications of the derived map of lode gold prospectivity and a map of radial density of spatially coherent lode gold mines/prospects results in a one-level prediction of 37 undiscovered lode gold prospects.

The study provides a reconnaissance stratigraphical <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deposits,</b> {{the correlation between}} the Pleistocene of Flatey and the well-known Tjornes section on the mainland, and the reconstruction of the Pleistocene palaeoenvironment. The preservation of the assemblages is poor to moderate, whereas the diversity and richness are moderate to high. The pollen and spores indicate vegetation composed mainly of sedges and heath, comparable to the vegetation in the Tjornes area during deposition of the Pleistocene Breidavik Group. Analysis of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from an outcrop sample allowed their assignment to the Lower Pleistocene dinoflagellate cyst zone DAZ 5, previously defined in the Tjornes section. A core sample yielded a dinoflagellate cyst assemblage unknown from the Tjornes area. The dinoflagellate cyst data combined with the palaeomagnetic record, the radiometric dating of lavas, and the position of the diamictites and tuff layers allowed refinement of the previously proposed stratigraphical correlations between the Tjornes area and the Flatey core. The deposition of the sequence from the Flatey core took place during the Matuyama, i. e. between 2. 59 and 0. 78 Ma, and several hiatuses are postulated. The Lower Pleistocene dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from the outcrop sample bear similarities to those recovered from fully marine subsurface samples on the northern shelf of Iceland within the Polar Front realm. Similar oceanographical conditions influenced by the Irminger Current and the East Icelandic Current can be inferred for Early Pleistocene times...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cluster {{analysis}} is a statistical method applied {{with increasing frequency}} to solve geotechnical problems. Its primary advantage is the possibility to simultaneously consider several parameters describing soil to isolate homogenous subsoil layers. Studies conducted so far pertained mainly to subsoil composed of homogenous layers with thickness of at least several dozen centimeters. This study {{presents the results of}} analyses conducted on <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> different character – varved clays. These deposits exhibit marked lamination, consisting of alternate clay and silt layers. Individual laminae do not exceed several cm in thickness. Such a structure <b>of</b> <b>deposits</b> may cause marked discrepancies in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> homogenous geotechnical layers, depending on the applied method of cluster analysis. The subject of the paper is the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the effect of the laminar structure on efficiency of isolations performed using different cluster analysis methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Rock mass is {{typically}} characterized by inherent fractures that cause natural blocks of rocks. Unplanned cutting <b>of</b> stone <b>deposits</b> in quarries {{may lead to}} over-producing waste (rock debris) or extracting unfit (fractured) stone blocks. This paper presents two case studies {{through the use of}} low and high frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) antennas to detect fractures in two benches of a quarry. In the first case study, a high frequency GPR antenna was used aiming to: (i) compare the GPR results with a map of the out-cropping fracture intensity in the bench surface, developed using the data of the GPR survey marks and interpolated by the Ordinary Kriging technique, and (ii) present how sub-vertical fractures can be numerically modelled in three dimensions from the GPR results. The second case study was focused on using a low frequency antenna to detect large aperture size of fracture surfaces as deep as possible in order to evaluate a deposit stratum before quarrying. This could be done through studying the reflections from a 3 D cross-sectional GPR model and a 3 D transparent GPR model. In the discussion section, an exploitation planning approach, based on modelling fractures as 3 D surfaces, is theoretically and graphically proposed to optimize the stone production recovery. The two case studies showed that GPR is a successful tool for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> ornamental stone <b>deposits</b> and a promising tool for recovery optimization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> {{risks of the}} loose soil deposits along Provincial Road 303 near {{the epicenter of the}} 2008 Wechuan Earthquake. The loose deposits formed during the earthquake on the steep terrains in the Xiaojiagou ravine are identified {{with the aid of a}} GIS platform. The stability <b>of</b> these <b>deposits</b> during rainfall infiltration is analyzed. For simplicity, the failure mode <b>of</b> these loose <b>deposits</b> is assumed to be shallow-seated so that these deposits can be treated as infinite slopes. Subsequently, the run-out distances <b>of</b> these <b>deposits</b> are estimated and the risks to passengers traveling on the road are assessed...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} part of the {{research}} program of the Yucca Mountain Project intended to provide the State of Nevada with a detailed <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the geology and geochemistry of Yucca Mountain and adjacent regions. The purpose of this report is to try and establish criteria for the recognition <b>of</b> pedogenic/supergene <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> calcite/opal versus non-pedogenic/hypogene <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> calcite/opal. Far from being of esoteric concern, this subject is of paramount importance to the pedogenic-hypogene debate which rages around the suitability of Yucca Mountain as a high-level radioactive waste repository site...|$|R
