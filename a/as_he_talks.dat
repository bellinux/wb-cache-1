5|$|Father John learns the john's car {{belongs to}} an {{accountant}} named Steven Miller, who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda, an expensive call {{girl who is}} widely considered among the best at her profession. Meanwhile, Linda visits her dying, elderly stepfather Donald Dupree (Tom Carey), who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her {{on the path to}} prostitution. Linda confronts him about their past, but claims she has forgiven him his sins, even though he continues to deny any wrongdoing. A drunk Nadine goes to talk to Father John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him. He admits to caring for her as well, but they agree to remain friends. Later, Father John hires Lloyd Montag (Bruce A. Young), an unemployed boxer at his church, to serve as his bodyguard <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> to St. Clair. The pimp, who knows Lloyd from his boxing days, tells Father John what neighborhood Linda lives in. There, Father John and Lloyd find Zeke (Tony Papenfuss), a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees to take them to her apartment. Zeke explains he had driven her to the church when she first spoke to Father John at confession, and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach.|$|E
25|$|The main {{characters}} in a documentary on the religion released in 2012, The Gardener, includes an articulate gardener Eona, a native of Papua New Guinea, who brings a feeling of deep inner devotion <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about its tenets while he tends the flower beds.|$|E
25|$|I {{afterwards}} travelled {{much with}} him, and have now only {{to speak of}} him with great respect, or, I ought to say, with admiration... No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks.</b>|$|E

One Iraqi citizen opined that [...] "If [...] can do as well <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks,</b> then all our problems are over", adding a belief that [...] " [...] is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same {{and that we are}} a playground for their interests." [...] Another citizen noted that [...] "Obama won't get the same treatment,'... 'But he won't have too long to prove himself to us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Angelica tells Boris that he's {{not really}} missing {{anything}} and {{admits that she}} thinks that Passover's a dumb holiday. Boris tries convincing her otherwise by telling her and the boys {{the story of the}} Exodus, hoping to improve their understanding of Passover. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks,</b> Angelica imagines herself as the Pharaoh of Egypt, who commands the Hebrew slaves (imagined as the other Rugrats and numerous other babies) to throw their newborn sons into the Nile River. One Hebrew slave defies the order by putting her infant son, Moses (imagined as Tommy), into a basket and setting the basket afloat in the river. The basket and baby are discovered by Pharaoh Angelica, who shows Moses around her palace and kingdom, and decides to make him her partner.|$|E
500|$|Believing {{the case}} completed, Olivia goes {{to meet with}} Henry, where he has gotten use of his cousin's boat. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about having been trained to use it, Olivia contemplates how Wyatt knew about the {{chemistry}} to make the serum, and realizes he had a teacher as well - their true culprit, and immediately suspects Reverend Marcus. Broyles and Olivia hurry to his house to protect Christopher from Marcus; Broyles kills Marcus. Olivia accompanies Broyles and his family to the same hospital that Max is being treated. There, Max thanks Olivia personally and asks her about what the [...] "FBI" [...] is. Broyles, having listened to Olivia's conversation, knows that she has broken her conditioning, as the FBI had ceased to exist years earlier in the parallel universe. Because of her efforts to save Christopher, he lets her go.|$|E

Ash kills it using a Winchester rifle from the Sporting Goods department, finally ending the threat.|$|E
2500|$|Gord {{has worked}} in his watch tower for more than {{eighteen}} years without a paycheck and claims {{to have been a}} forest ranger his entire life. His apparent reason for becoming a ranger was that he thought Smokey Bear was talking directly to him in one of his famous public service announcements ("Only you can prevent forest fires"). He frequently breaks out in tears during Red's visits <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about how lonely he is and/or how much of a sacrifice he makes at his job. During one visit, Gord claimed to have gotten so lonely that he ate the watch tower and then later moved on to another tower in season 7. Gord sometimes laments his lack of recognition. Once, he thought that someone had left him some honorary medallions only to learn from Red that they were beer bottle caps (Gord thought that a Budweiser cap was for being a [...] "bud of the forest"). On another occasion, Gord justified his lack of communication with his superiors as a sign that he was doing a [...] "good job protecting the forest," [...] to which Red suggested that his superiors most likely forgot about him. In truth, it turned out that he had been dismissed many years ago, but the message had never reached him.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>talked</b> {{swiftly and}} clearly, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> {{one by one}} his officers' faces became alight with eagerness. When he had done, they cried as with one voice that he had saved them.|$|R

6000|$|... "I hope not, madam, I {{hope you}} would be wiser; I'm sure if he will set you up, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> of, you ought to deny him nothing; and you will starve {{if you do not}} consent, that's certain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my child! You {{will like}} {{to come out with}} papa, and Betsy can dress you." [...] He flings off his own paint-stained shooting-jacket <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks,</b> takes a frock-coat out of a carved wardrobe, and a hat from a helmet on the shelf. He is no longer the {{handsome}} splendid boy of old times. Can that be Clive, with that haggard face and slouched handkerchief? [...] "I am not the dandy I was, Pen," [...] he says bitterly.|$|E
50|$|There were videos found {{featuring}} Nigel Marven as the host, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about animals. Webosodes {{could be}} viewed by both members and non-members.|$|R

50|$|At the CD-shop, Jun-yong was {{browsing}} {{through the}} CDs <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to Yeon-ae. Yeon-ae went off, and Jun-yong was surprised <b>as</b> <b>he</b> found that Yeon-ae had gone off.|$|R
60|$|But May has passed; the arbutus and the Linnea {{are gone}} from the woods, and the pine tips have grown into young shoots, which wilt at noon under a direct {{reflection}} from sun and sea, and the blue sky has that metallic clearness and brilliancy which distinguishes those regions, and the planting is at last over, and this very morning Moses is to set off in the Brilliant for his first voyage to the Banks. Glorious knight he! the world all before him, and the blood of ten years racing and throbbing in his veins <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> knowingly of hooks, and sinkers, and bait, and lines, and wears proudly the red flannel shirt which Mara had just finished for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Margaret, {{since you}} have decided for me that you are to go--and indeed I myself plainly see that that {{alternative}} is really the best--let us talk over who you had best take with you. I quite approve of your choice of Guy; {{he is a good}} lad, and will make a brave knight some day. I shall now make him one of my esquires, and as such he will always be in attendance on you; and assuredly Agnes and Charlie will, as well as yourself, benefit by his presence. He {{will be able to take}} them out and look after them, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> French as well as English the lad will be useful to you in many ways. Have you any preference as to the four men-at- arms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another schoolfellow of mine {{is staying}} here now, and I think that Mr. Trefusis {{will have the}} {{pleasure}} of paying her bills some day. He is a great pet of Lady Brandon's. Sir Charles was angry at first because she invited him here, {{and we were all}} surprised at it. The man has a bad reputation, and headed a mob that threw down the walls of the park; and we hardly thought he would be cool enough to come after that. But he does not seem to care whether we want him or not; and he comes when he likes. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> cleverly, we find him a godsend in this dull place. It is really not such a paradise as you seem to think, but you need not be afraid of my returning any sooner than I can help.|$|E
5000|$|Pasternak says {{he interviewed}} {{hundreds}} of children to play Eddie but <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> to Ron Howard [...] "I knew he was right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt it. Most likely <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> Brown into signing it just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> us. I {{tell you}} {{his ways are}} all crooked, like his ideas. Did you hear how he lied about Miss Lindsay?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{listened to}} Steele's deep voice <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> about Linrock. What {{he said was}} old to me, and I gave heed only to its effect.|$|R
60|$|I {{asked what}} he was doing, and found he was clerk in a large shop. His pleasure, however, was to wander about upon the hills, talking to half- mad and visionary peasants, or to persuade queer and conscience- {{stricken}} persons to deliver up the keeping of their troubles into his care. Another night, when I was {{with him in his}} own lodging, more than one turned up to talk over their beliefs and disbeliefs, and sun them as it were in the subtle light of his mind. Sometimes visions come to him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> with them, and he is rumoured to have told divers people true matters of their past days and distant friends, and left them hushed with dread of their strange teacher, who seems scarce more than a boy, and is so much more subtle than the oldest among them.|$|E
60|$|These are {{the broad}} {{principles}} contained in Mr. Mahaffy's clever little book, {{and many of}} them will, no doubt, commend themselves to our readers. The maxim, 'If you find the company dull, blame yourself,' seems to us somewhat optimistic, and we have no sympathy at all with the professional story-teller who is really a great bore at a dinner-table; but Mr. Mahaffy is quite right in insisting that no bright social intercourse is possible without equality, and it is no objection to his book to say that it will not teach people how to talk cleverly. It is not logic that makes men reasonable, nor the science of ethics that makes men good, but it is always useful to analyse, to formularise and to investigate. The only thing to be regretted in the volume is the arid and jejune character of the style. If Mr. Mahaffy would only write <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks,</b> his book would be much pleasanter reading.|$|E
6000|$|... "At the Hague," [...] says Björnstähl, [...] "we {{go about}} {{every day with}} M. Diderot. He has views {{extending}} over an incredibly wide field, possesses a vivacity that I cannot describe, is pleasant and friendly in intercourse, and has new and unusual observations to make on every subject.... Who could fail to prize him? He is so bright, so full of instruction, has so many new thoughts and suggestions, that nobody can help admiring him. But willingly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> when one goes to him, he shows to little advantage in large companies, {{and that is why}} he did not please everybody at St. Petersburg. You will easily see the reason why this incomparable man in such companies, where people talk of fashion, of clothes, of frippery, and all other sorts of triviality, neither gives pleasure to others nor finds pleasure himself." [...] And the friendly Swede rises to the height of generalisation in the quaint maxim, Where an empty head shines, there a thoroughly cultivated man comes too short.|$|E
60|$|The American bowed {{across the}} table with a serious politeness, and then began playing idly with a quaint ring on his long finger <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked.</b>|$|R
60|$|I remember, too, that <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> I {{would find}} my aunt {{watching}} {{my face as}} if to check the soundness of his talk by my expression.|$|R
