40|$|A {{right to}} a healthy {{environment}} is neither novel nor extreme. As this Essay posits, this is a propitious moment for exploring why such a right is supported by this Nation’s legal institutions. This Essay walks through those institutions – our Constitution, the common law, as well as Congressional and state efforts to embed a {{right to a}} healthy environment into our legal fabric. Those institutions collectively demonstrate how an <b>aspirational</b> <b>right,</b> such as {{a right to a}} healthy environment, enjoys sufficient legal currency and is capable of enforcement. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} administrative actions in recent years is the U. S. Department of Education 2 ̆ 7 s campaign against sexual assault on college campuses. Using its authority under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (mandating nondiscrimination on the basis of sex in all educational programs and activities receiving federal funds), the Department 2 ̆ 7 s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has launched an enforcement effort that critics denounce as aggressive, manipulative, and corrosive of individual liberties. Missing from the commentary is a historically informed understanding of why this administrative campaign unfolded as it did. This Article offers crucial context by reminding readers that freedom from sexual violence was once celebrated as a national civil right- upon the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 -but then lost that status in a 5 [...] - 4 decision by the U. S. Supreme Court. OCR 2 ̆ 7 s recent campaign reflects a legal and political landscape in which at least some potential victims of sexual violence had come to feel rightfully connected to the institutions of the federal government, and then became righteously outraged by the endurance of such violence in their communities. OCR 2 ̆ 7 s campaign also reflects the unique role of federal administrative agencies in this landscape. Thanks {{to the power of the}} purse and the conditions that Congress has attached to funding streams, agencies enjoy a powerful form of jurisdiction over particular spaces and institutions. Attempts to harness this jurisdiction in service of <b>aspirational</b> <b>rights</b> claims should not surprise us; indeed, we should expect such efforts to continue. Building on this insight, the Article concludes with a research agenda for other scholars seeking to understand and evaluate OCR 2 ̆ 7 s handiwork...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{inception}} of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1997, the Hong Kong courts have not been short of opportunities to tackle difficult issues concerning civil and political rights. In relation to socioeconomic rights, the common conception that these were <b>aspirational</b> and nonjusticiable <b>rights</b> had made them modest grounds of progress until recent years. However, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in two recent cases has adjudicated on the constitutional protection of social welfare rights in Hong Kong. These two cases demonstrated the Court’s approach in adjudicating cases that concern social and economic policies, particularly, when the decisions affect the distribution of scarce public expenditure. The intensity of review was at issue, and the Court’s view of the justification provided by the government accounts for the difference in results of the two cases. It can be seen clearly that the Court was greatly influenced by the political and economic implications of their decisions. The author argues that the Court’s internal restraints on adjudicating socioeconomic rights are misplaced, and that there is room for a more principled approach to dealing with social rights, especially in relation to the decision-making process by the government, while respecting the freedom of the democratic government to determine its own policies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{asks whether}} {{international}} human rights arguments {{are likely to be}} effective in advancing immigrants 2 ̆ 7 rights in the United States. There are certainly reasons to be pessimistic. Despite its history as a nation of immigrants and the ever-increasing diversity of its populace, the United States remains a deeply parochial and nationalist culture. International human rights arguments are often seen as the advocates 2 ̆ 7 last refuge. In the absence of an international forum that can hold the United States accountable, and in the face of Congressional directives that the {{international human rights}} treaties it has ratified are not self-executing, international human rights often seem only <b>aspirational.</b> International human <b>rights</b> arguments are rarely advanced in domestic U. S. courts, where they are broached, they are as often as not ignored or dismissed. Yet there are also reasons to be hopeful about the potential for advancing immigrants 2 ̆ 7 rights through international human rights. Human rights are just that - human rights - and therefore generally do not acknowledge distinctions in fundamental rights between citizens and noncitizens. Human rights offers a common language and standard for global pressure. And international law has always been an integral part of immigration law. Accordingly, human rights discourse offers tremendous normative power and potential for advancing social justice on behalf of foreign nationals in the United States. Analogizing to the New Deal revolution {{in the role of the}} federal government vis-à-vis the economy and rights protection, this essay argues that we may be living in a similar global revolution marked by the simultaneous rise of a global economy and an international human rights regime. I propose a three-pronged strategy: advancing modest claims of statutory construction and constitutional interpretation in the courts; advocating more expansive conceptions of international human rights in the political and popular realms; and pushing for the creation of institutions and processes to bring international human rights considerations into domestic policymaking at the outset, before disputes aris...|$|R
