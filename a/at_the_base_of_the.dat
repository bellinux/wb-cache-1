5|$|Stela 43 is {{paired with}} Altar 35. It is a plain {{monument}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairway of Temple IV.|$|E
5|$|A thin pyrite-carbonate bed is {{also found}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marcellus black shale in the {{exposures}} of south central Pennsylvania, above a thin calcerous green shale bed, which lies upon the Onondaga limestone.|$|E
5|$|Altar 35 is a plain {{monument}} {{associated with}} Stela 43. The stela-altar pair is centrally located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairway of Temple IV.|$|E
50|$|Colluviation {{refers to}} the buildup <b>of</b> {{colluvium}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> a hillslope. Colluvium is typically loosely consolidated angular material located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> a steep hill slope or cliff. Colluvium accumulates as gently sloping aprons or fans, either <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> or within gullies and hollows within hillslopes. These accumulations of colluvium can be several meters in thickness and often contain buried soils (paleosols), crude bedding, and cut and fill sequences.|$|R
5|$|Stela 38 stands <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Structure 2.|$|R
5|$|Stela 42 is also located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Structure 2.|$|R
5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gynophore.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} pathology was {{noticed by}} Parks, and {{from around the}} notch. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the notch, the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had an obvious fracture, {{with the other two}} possessing a swelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> break.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marcellus, in the pyrite-carbonate bed {{between the}} {{carbonaceous}} black shale {{and a green}} calcareous shale bed, pyrite, carbonate, and groundwater reacted to form gossan iron oxide and gypsum.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{there are}} many attractions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Mt. Kinka.|$|R
50|$|Distinguishing males from females is easy: The male has a smooth, soft, pouch-like area <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> its abdomen {{where the}} stomach meets the tail {{on the front}} side. Males also have a fin there, but it is less obvious. The female has more of a pointed stomach with a very obvious fin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
25|$|A {{performance}} {{stage was}} constructed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Skyrama (Astroneedle) in 1974.|$|R
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{bacterial}} flagellum, {{where it}} enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient {{set up by the}} cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tentacles in {{some species}} lie acrorhagi, {{elongated}} inflatable tentacle-like organs armed with cnidocytes, that can flail around and fend off other encroaching anemones; {{one or both}} anemones can be driven off or suffer injury in such battles.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
50|$|A fishing {{camp was}} located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Lost Mountain for decades.|$|R
50|$|A {{performance}} {{stage was}} constructed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Skyrama (Astroneedle) in 1974.|$|R
5|$|Stela 35 {{was another}} of the five monuments found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Structure8.|$|R
5|$|Below the Solsville, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Otsego {{in eastern}} New York, a coral bed is found; another coral bed {{can be seen}} {{at the top of the}} Marcellus near Berne, New York.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{has been}} a problem along the Scarborough Bluffs. Properties located near the brink have been abandoned, and houses condemned, as the brink wears back away from the lake. Since the 1980s, large areas of beach <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bluffs have been {{reinforced}} with limestone breakwaters and construction rubble infilling.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the hollow}} took {{the shape of}} a large bowl {{in the side of the}} mountain, with the {{headwall}} being weathered by constant freezing and thawing, and eroded by plucking. The basin became deeper (especially <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headwall) as it continued to be eroded by abrasion.|$|E
50|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> either condyle <b>the</b> bone is {{tunnelled}} {{by a short}} canal, the hypoglossal canal.|$|R

50|$|In 1839 a {{post office}} was {{established}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Tryon peak, both named after Governor Tryon.|$|R
5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder {{on the surface of the}} spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E
5|$|However, the two wavy lines <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blazon officially {{represent}} {{rivers of}} Slovenia and the Adriatic Sea {{rather than the}} Savica or the Sava specifically.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} New York survey, the Marcellus shale was placed below the Hamilton Group <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Erie {{division}} of the New York system, but this taxonomy is obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Cover {{near the}} ground is an {{important}} criterion for white-throated woodrat shelter sites. In northern portions of their range, white-throated woodrats tend to construct houses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> trees; in southern portions of their range, white-throated woodrats tend to construct houses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> shrub-trees, shrubs, or cacti. When available, rocks are preferred by white-throated woodrats for shelter because they provide more protection from variations in ambient temperature than <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> plants.|$|R
5|$|Altar 18 {{was one of}} five monuments {{forming a}} north-south row <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Structure8 on Terrace 3.|$|R
5|$|Stela 34 {{was found}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Structure8, {{where it was}} one of a row of five monuments.|$|R
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is a {{saprobic}} species, deriving {{nutrients from}} decaying organic matter, particularly the rotting branches and stumps of deciduous trees. One field guide notes {{a preference for}} sugar maple. It grows singly or in bunches, clustered together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.|$|E
5|$|Mud bricks {{were found}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramid, {{which are not}} {{associated}} with the pyramid itself, but are interpreted as remnants of a construction ramp.|$|E
5|$|Occipital condyles - Two knobs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull {{fit into}} the topmost neck vertebra; most other tetrapods, in contrast, have only one such knob.|$|E
