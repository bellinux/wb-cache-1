50|$|Following the 1993 Copenhagen Council's {{invitation}} to Central and Eastern European countries {{to apply for}} membership, PHARE support was reoriented towards this aim, including a marked expansion of support for infrastructure investment. PHARE's total pre-accession focus {{was put in place}} in 1997, in response to the Luxembourg Council’s launching of the present enlargement process. Phare funds focus entirely on the pre-accession priorities highlighted in the Road Maps and the <b>Accession</b> <b>Partnerships</b> which establish the overall priorities the country must address to prepare for accession and the resources available to help them do so. The National Programme for the Adoption of the Acquis is the candidate country's timetable for preparing its accession. It estimates the timing and cost of the steps needed to prepare the country for membership and the implications for staff and financial resources.|$|R
40|$|The {{accession}} of Poland to the European Union requires creating adequate institutional conditions. The {{strengthening of}} institutional and administrative capacity of Poland (and other candidate countries) {{is also in}} the interest of EU - hence its help with creating and strengthening administrative structures in those countries. The main source of this help is PHARE. One of its components - Institution Building - allows financing the strengthening of administrative capacity. One of the mechanisms of support of institution building is twinning. It is the agreement between an institution in the candidate country and its equivalent in one or more member states. The aim of twinning is to deliver specific and guaranteed results, agreed between the parties in advance and fulfilling the goals set out in the <b>Accession</b> <b>Partnerships.</b> The parties sing the "Twinning Covenant" in which they agree on detailed work plan and means to achieve the result. It is the new form of co-operation of candidates and member states of EU. The article touches on the meaning of twinning projects and the commitment of member states in their implementation.

40|$|This {{article has}} {{concluded}} that revenue collection based upon the development of well-embedded civil society norms can be quite effectively carried out by civil (non-police) tax administration bodies, even in countries where economic and political transition are not yet fully complete. The CEECs (Central and Eastern European Countries) are helped, in this respect, by the <b>accession</b> <b>partnership</b> with the EU and its Member States. By contrast, the Russian Federation's development of quite a large, but less effective, tax police reflects the very different political and economic circumstances in that country. In Russia, a much weaker civil society base plus higher levels of corruption and deprivation produces a more politicised tax enforcement system...|$|E

40|$|Today the European Union has 27 member states. Each {{enlargement}} {{has led to}} {{a fierce}} debate in the union if and how the enlargement is supposed to be done. How big can the union become? A set of criteria, the Copenhagen criteria, has to be fulfilled for a country to be accepted as a full member of the union. Turkey took its first steps toward accession when they became a candidate for accession in the year of 1999. Turkey did not fulfil the obligation for respect of the Human Rights. Therefore they started reforming their political system and legislation. The prospect of Turkish accession to the EU has started a debate. Why do some fear the prospect when others see it as an opportunity? The purpose of the essay was to explore and analyse which discourses are presently existing in the EU concerning the relationship with Turkey. The purpose was met by a discourse analysis made from three nodal points (sub discourses) : democracy, human rights and politics. The information was gathered from the political groups which are at present represented in the European parliament. Some conclusions could be made: (1) five different discourses concerning Turkey and the EUs relationship where found, each making a unique viewpoint: full membership, eventual membership, privileged partnership, strategic partnership and objection to Turkish membership. Those who want a Turkish accession to the EU see the greatest good coming from such an arrangement, for both parties. The overall discourse put focus on the fact that Turkey can adapt to the European way and Turkeys potential role as a bridge between the European and Muslim world is the dominant argument. The EU is viewed as a trans national organisation rather than an entity that is limited to a specific territory (Europe). Those who oppose Turkish <b>accession</b> or propose <b>partnership</b> has an opposite view. They think that the EU shares characteristics with the nation-state that has its base in a specific territory and peoples who share the same history, culture and religion. : (2) At this juncture a potential majority for Turkish accession would be very small, there are to many unknown variables. It does not exist a dominant discourse. The discourses are fighting for dominance and {{who is going to be}} the winner is not clear. All the discourses can therebye said to exist in the discursive field. Though there is unity in the sub discourses democracy and human rights. The common view is that these are not at an acceptable level in Turkey today. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Membership of the European Union U {{is usually}} {{seen as a}} {{strategic}} goal of the associated states {{of central and eastern}} Europe. At the beginning of the 1990 s central European countries, where the economic and political transformation was relatively advanced, received preferential treatment from the European Community, which was starting to evolve a policy of differentiation. Podraza studied the strategies of four central European countries towards changes under way in the European Union, analysing several aspects for each case: (1) the process of political transformation (2) decision-making structures in the field of foreign policy and European integration (3) integration strategies: (a) main foreign policy priorities (b) application for membership of the European Union (c) the Commission option on each country (d) <b>accession</b> <b>partnership,</b> including a National Programme for the Adoption of the Acquis (NPAA) (e) regular Commission reports (f) accession negotiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} to show the {{twinning}} mechanism as a convergence tool in a states accession process. Since it’s beginning in 1998 more than 1300 projects {{have been carried out}} in the scope of candidate states’ convergence process. Due to these projects the states’ administrative and judicial systems have been restructured. Thus, the capacity of Union legislation’s applicability enhanced and the programs have been used to strengthen the institutional structures in all the sectors in the scope of instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. Starting from the December 17, 2001 various funds were launched for use in Turkey in order to ensure compliance with the EU acquis communautaire within the accession process of the state and to facilitate the fulfillment of the obligations which are specified in the <b>Accession</b> <b>Partnership</b> Document and National Programme of Turkey.

40|$|The {{process of}} European Union Accession has {{provided}} a strong stimulus for various institutional changes in Turkey. The European Council decision taken at Helsinki (10 - 11 December 1999) was an important turning point in this process. The <b>Accession</b> <b>Partnership,</b> which followed the Helsinki summit, identified short and medium term priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions on which accession preparations must concentrate {{in the light of}} the political and economic criteria. One of the most important issues for Turkey regarding the adoption and implementation of the Community acquis is related with the labor market regulations and employment policies. The adoption of the Community acquis will certainly bring radical changes in the functio ning of the labor market in Turkey with vital consequences for firms, and workers, as well as the long-term performance of the economy. The aim of this study is to provide information for the use of these agents on the employment and labor market issues that are important during the EU accession process. Since the topic is rather broad, the current study has concentrated upon the possible effects of the adoption of the employment acquis regulating work and employment conditions, and issues like child labor...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{planning}} approaches {{include the}} actions which aim {{to eliminate the}} economical, social and cultural differences between the regions. In Turkey, there are serious developmental differences in terms of population, income level, economical and social activities between the regions. To eliminate these differences, the regional planning policies and development plans are made. The main goals are to eliminate the regional inequalities, to solve the economic, social and cultural problems of the regions, to satisfy the efficient use of the resources and to control the population movements. In the European Union, even though all member states apply their own national regional policies, {{there is a common}} regional policy to provide the economical and social development and to remove the regional instabilities. To realize these policies, the European Union benefits from certain instruments like financial aids and structural funds. Turkey, in the accession period has a responsibility of implementing regional policies. The <b>accession</b> <b>partnership</b> documents and progress reports prepared by the Union and national program and preliminary national development plan prepared by Turkey are very important in terms of showing the priorities of the Union and the responsibilities of Turkey...|$|E
