40|$|Introduction. The Red-tailed Amazon parrot (<b>Amazona</b> <b>brasiliensis)</b> is an {{endangered}} species of the Psittacine family, and for which various data are important for a comprehensive preservation plan. Data about plasma protein gel electrophoresis of Amazon parrot blood are scarce. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine plasma protein concentrations and concentrations of major protein bands in blood of young and adult Red-tailed Amazon parrot (<b>Amazona</b> <b>brasiliensis).</b> Materials and Methods. Blood samples from eight young and eight adult healthy free-living parrots were obtained. Plasma protein concentration and fractions were determined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare variables. Results and Conclusions. Six major protein bands with the following molecular weights were identified by SDS-PAGE: 170 kDa, 117 kDa, 85 kDa (putative ovotransferrin), 60 kDa, 45 kDa and 23 kDa. Adult parrots had significantly higher concentrations of total proteins, albumin and other proteins with similar mobility (around 60 kDa). Young birds had significantly higher levels of 23 kDa proteins. The concentration of putative ovotransferrin (85 kDa) was not different between young and adult parrots. Plasma protein gel electrophoresis patterns in Red-tailed Amazon parrots are similar between young and adult animals, but specific protein bands differ in their absolute concentrations. This finding should be taken into consideration when clinical pathology data are analysed...|$|R

A experiência teve o intuito de fomentar, tanto no corpo docente quando no corpo discente, a discussão sobre valores e princípios que norteiam as relações homem/natureza, desenvolvendo-se, assim, uma interação mais responsável com o meio ambiente. Foram desenvolvidos módulos-educativos sobre o papagaio-da-cara-roxa e seu ambiente, direcionados a 795 estudantes do ensino fundamental, nos Municípios de Paranaguá e Guaraqueçaba. Para analisar a eficácia das atividades, os estudantes responderam a testes antes e depois do processo educativo que mediram mudanças obtidas com relação ao incremento de conhecimento, postura e valorização do papagaio-da-cara-roxa e de seu ambiente. Os resultados indicaram que a utilização do exemplo de uma espécie, ameaçada de extinção e que ocorre próximo às comunidades envolvidas no processo de conservação, serviu de base para a associação do tema específico para com uma realidade {{ambiental}} mais ampla e contextualizada localmente.

50|$|The red-tailed amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>brasiliensis),</b> {{also known}} as the red-tailed parrot, is a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is endemic to coastal regions in the {{south-east}} Brazilian states of São Paulo and Paraná. The bird has been threatened by habitat loss and capture for the wild bird trade, and is a symbol of the efforts to conserve one of the Earth's most biologically diverse ecosystems. Consequently, it is considered vulnerable by BirdLife International and the IUCN. In 1991-92, the population had fallen below 2000 individuals. Following on-going conservation efforts, the most recent estimate suggests a population of around 6600, indicating that this species is recovering from earlier persecution. A recent study shows that the population of this species is stable at Paraná state, Southern Brazil, revealing population trend fluctuation during the last 12 years.|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of molecular markers for population studies {{is an important}} tool for biodiversity conservation. The family Psittacidae contains many endangered and vulnerable species and we tested three kinds of molecular markers for their potential use in population studies of five psitacid species: 43 hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), 42 blue-and-yellow macaws (Ara ararauna), 23 red-and-green macaws (Ara chloroptera), 19 red-spectacled amazons (Amazona pretrei); and 18 red-tailed amazons (<b>Amazona</b> <b>brasiliensis).</b> We tested 21 clones from a genomic library of golden conure (Guarouba guarouba) minisatellites and 12 pairs of microsatellite primers developed for the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) and A. hyacinthinus. We also tested seven tetranucleotide repeat primers {{for their ability to}} amplify regions between microsatellite loci (inter simple sequence repeats, ISSRs). We were able to select seven markers that were variable in different degrees for three species (A. hyacinthinus, A. chloroptera and A. ararauna). The mini and microsatellites produced more polymorphic patterns than the ISSRs. The genetic variability of the species studied seems to be correlated with their endangered status...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The red-tailed Amazon parrot (<b>Amazona</b> <b>brasiliensis)</b> is a {{threatened}} species of psittacine bird that inhabit coastal regions of Brazil. In {{view of the}} threat of this species, the aim {{of this study was to}} perform a health evaluation in wild nestlings in Rasa Island, determining the prevalence of enterobacteria and infectious agents according to type of nest. Blood samples were collected from 64 birds and evaluated for antibodies of Chlamydia psittaci by commercial dot-blot ELISA. Cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs samples were collected from 23 birds from artificial wooden nests, 15 birds from PVC nests and 2 birds from natural nests for microbiological analysis. Swab samples were collected from 58 parrots for C. psittaci detection by PCR and from 50 nestlings for Avian Influenza, Newcastle Disease and West Nile viruses’ detection analysis by real-time RT-PCR. Ten bacterial genera and 17 species were identified, and the most prevalent were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. There was no influence of the type of nest in the nestlings’ microbiota. All samples tested by ELISA and PCR were negative. There is currently insufficient information available about the health of A. brasiliensis and data of this study provide a reference point for future evaluations and aid in conservation plans...|$|R
40|$|The parrot family {{represents}} one of the bird group with the largest number of endangered species, as a result of habitat destruction and illegal trade. This illicit traffic involves the smuggling of eggs and animals, and the laundering through captive breeding facilities of wild-caught animals. Despite the huge potential of wildlife DNA forensics to determine with conclusive evidence illegal trade, current usage of DNA profiling approaches in parrots has been limited by the lack of suitable molecular markers specifically developed for the focal species and by low cross-species polymorphism. In this study, we isolated DNA microsatellite markers in seven parrot species threatened with extinction (<b>Amazona</b> <b>brasiliensis,</b> A. oratrix, A. pretrei, A. rhodocorytha, Anodorhynchus leari, Ara rubrogenys and Primolius couloni). From an enriched genomic library followed by 454 pyrosequencing, we characterized a total of 106 polymorphic microsatellite markers (mostly tetranucleotides) in the seven species and tested them across an average number of 19 individuals per species. The mean number of alleles per species and across loci varied from 6. 4 to 8. 3, with the mean observed heterozygosities ranging from 0. 65 to 0. 84. Identity and parentage exclusion probabilities were highly discriminatory. The high variability displayed by these microsatellite loci demonstrates their potential utility to perform individual genotyping and parentage analyses, in order to develop a DNA testing framework to determine illegal traffic in these threatened species...|$|R
40|$|Psittaciformes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} groups of birds, and several Brazilian species are classified between vulnerable and critically endangered. It is thus necessary to identify agents that cause infections in captive wild animals and to assess the risks posed thereof and to design interventions to minimize the possibility of disease outbreaks, leading to the conservation of endangered species. The purpose of this study was to identify enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) cloacal isolates from asymptomatic psittacines in captivity and evaluate the distribution of the EPEC pathotype. Cloacal swabs were obtained from 46 asymptomatic birds, and resulting isolates were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the attaching and effacing gene (eae) and bundle-forming pilus structural gene (bfpA) of EPEC. Samples from several species were tested, and three samples were found to be positive for the eae and bfpA genes and characterized as typical EPEC. This is the first report of this pathotype in asymptomatic psittacines. Although certain E. coli strains are more pathogenic than others, various factors should be considered when determining the potential of E. coli isolates to cause disease in captive psittacines. Birds that are positive for the EPEC (typical) strain could be zoonotic sources of infection, and may have acquired these strains through contact with humans or domestic animals.

S'ha realitzat un exhaustiu estudi fenotípic d'aquestes espècies i, combinant alguns dels diferents caràcters morfològics i fisiològics estudiats [presència/absència i morfologia de conidis sèssils pigmentats, taxes de creixement de les colònies (30, 35 i 37 ºC) i assimilació de sacarosa, rafinosa i ribitol], es descriuen tres noves espècies per a la ciència: S. globosa, S. <b>brasiliensis</b> <b>i</b> S. mexicana.

Summary PhD Thesis Molecular and phenotypic characterization of Sporothrix schenckii 	 	Sporothrix schenckii is the pathogenic dimorphic fungus responsible for sporothrichosis, an important fungal infection with a worldwide distribution. Recently, molecular and phenotypic data seem {{to demonstrate that}} different genetic lineages exist within this species. For this reason we performed a morphological and molecular study involving numerous strains of clinical and environmental origins and from different countries. The analysis of partial sequences of the quitin synthase, &# 946;-tubulin and calmodulin genes demonstrated that S. schenckii is a species complex. A combined analysis of the sequences of the three loci of 60 strains from different origins showed 6 phylogenetic species within this species demonstrating {{that most of these}} species prevail in different geographical regions. Since the delineation of of such species could be of extreme importance from a clinical point of view, we studied a total of 127 isolates, most of which were received as S. schenckii, including the available type strain of species currently considered synonyms, and also some close morphological species. We have phenotypically characterized all these isolates using different culture media, growth rates at different temperatures, and numerous nutritional tests and compared their calmodulin gene sequences, which previously was revealed as the most informative molecular marker of the three evaluated. The molecular analysis revealed that Sporothrix albicans, S. inflate and S. schenckii var. luriei are species that are clearly different from S. schenckii. The combination of these phonetic and genetic approaches allowed us to propose the new species Sporothrix brasiliensis, S. globosa, S. mexicana and S. luriei. The key phenotypic featudes for recognizing these species are the morphology of the sessile pigmented conidia, growth at 30, 35, and 37 ºC, and the assimilation of sucrose, raffinose, and ribitol. 	In this thesis we also evaluated the in vitro activities of 12 drugs (amphotericin B, albaconazole, fluconazole, eberconazole itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole, voriconazole, terbinafine, micafungin and flucytosine) by using the microdilution method following the CLSI guidelines against 92 isolates belonging to the six species that constitute the sporotrhix schenckii complex. There were significant differences among the species, Sporothrix brasiliensis was the species that showed the best response to antifungals and S. mexicana was the worst. In general, terbinafine was the most active drug, followed by ketoconazole and posaconazole. 		 	Another objective of the present thesis was to perform a comparative study on the experimental pathogenicity of six species of Sporothrix of clinical interest, i. e. S. albicans, S. brasiliensis, S. globosa, S. mexicana, S. luriei and S. schenckii sensu stricto, it was performed using a murine model with immunocompetent mice. We used two different inocula, i. e., 1 x 108 conidia/ml and 1 x 105 conidia/ml, for each fungal strain tested. Two isolates of each species were used. Two inocula of each isolate, i. e. 1 x 108 and 1 x 105 conidia/ml, were tested, the animals being infected intravenously.

Then the beads were either plunged rapidly in liquid nitrogen were they were kept for 1 h (rapid cooling) or cooled at 1 ºC min- 1 to - 30 ºC. Then the beads were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 1 h (slow cooling). The beads were rewarmed by immersion of the cryovials for 1 min in a water bath thermostated at 30 ºC. Finally, beads were transferred onto culture medium (1 / 4 MS, 3 % sucrose, 0. 1 mg/l zeatin, solidified with 0. 8 % agar) and incubated in a growth room at 27 ± 2 ºC under a 14 h light (116 &# 956;mol. m- 2. s- 1) / 10 h dark photoperiod. Maximum recovery percentages between 15 and 83 % (depending on de the species and the treatment) were obtained with the cryopreserved embryos...|$|R

The study was undertaken on four groups of individuals: 46 patients with untreated paracoccidioidomycosis, 22 patients with other deep mycoses, 30 with other infectious diseases (tuberculosis and cutaneous leishmaniasis) and 47 blood donors as negative controls. Data were obtained using Paracoccidioides <b>brasiliensis</b> antigens, <b>i.</b> e.,a yeast culture filtrate for ID, CIE and CF, and a yeast cell suspension for IIF. The sensitivity, specificity and efficiency values were measured according to GALEN & GAMBINO 8. The gel precipitation tests (ID and CIE) showed the greatest sensitivity (91. 3 and 95. 6 %, respectively), maximum specificity (100 %) and the highest efficiency values when compared to the CF and IIF tests...|$|R

Bacteriol. 85 : 549 – 555. 1963. —Two immunologically active polysaccharides were {{isolated}} from Nocardia asteroides (Poly I Na and Poly II Na) and N. <b>brasiliensis</b> (Poly <b>I</b> Nb and Poly II Nb). These polysaccharides {{were isolated}} from cell extracts and purified by methanol precipitation, chloroform extraction of extraneous material, and deproteinization with trichloroacetic acid. The crucial step used {{for separation of}} Poly I and Poly II from both nocardias was differential solubility. From dried preparations containing both polysaccharides, Poly I was solubilized at pH 10, whereas Poly II remained insoluble and was subsequently solubilized at pH 5. Poly I Na and Poly I Nb are apparently the same. Arabinose and galactose were the monosaccharide constituents of these polysaccharides, and their molar ratios were similar. Furthermore, Poly I Na and Poly I Nb cross-reacted in agar diffusion precipitin tests with rabbit antisera prepared against either N. asteroides or N. brasiliensis. Either polysaccharide absorbed serum antibodies against the other. These polysaccharides {{can be regarded as}} groupspecific. Poly II Na and Poly II Nb are different and species-specific. They are composed of arabinose, galactose, and mannose but exhibit different molar ratios of these sugars according to species. They reacted only with homologous antisera...|$|R
25|$|The largetooth cookiecutter shark has a long, cigar-shaped {{body with}} an {{extremely}} short, blunt head and snout. The large, oval eyes are positioned to allow binocular vision, and {{are followed by}} wide, angled spiracles. The nostrils are small, each with a low, pointed skin lobe in front. The mouth is transverse, with a deep fold enclosing its corners and fleshy suctorial lips. The jaws are larger and more powerful than those of <b>I.</b> <b>brasiliensis,</b> and contain fewer tooth rows, numbering around 29 in the upper jaw and 19 in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small, narrow, and smooth-edged, upright {{at the center of}} the jaw and becoming more angled towards the corners. The lower teeth are massive, the largest teeth relative to body size of any living shark. They are triangular in shape, with minutely serrated edges and interlocking rectangular bases. The five pairs of gill slits are minute.|$|R

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{registered}} signs of mutilation on cetaceans in Brazil, especially from shark attacks. This work describes interactions between cookiecutter sharks Isistius spp. and cetaceans through {{the analysis of}} bite records for cetacean carcasses washed ashore on the Bahia coast between 1996 and 2005. Twenty bite records were analyzed in 13 cetacean species, of which the Delphinidae family was the most frequent. After the analysis, Isistius plutodus was identified as the aggressor species on 80 % of the records, followed by <b>I.</b> <b>brasiliensis</b> (20 %), based on the characteristic shape of the mutilations. The areas most subject to attack in cetaceans were: flanks 40 %; head and abdomen 20 % each; dorsal 15 %; and genital with 5 %. The relatively high number of bites on the flanks was probably due to its larger area, which offered greater opportunities to the cookiecutter shark. At least three bite records {{were related to the}} possible causes of strandings in delphinids. We recommend further studies on interactions between sharks and cetaceans along the Brazilian coast...|$|R
