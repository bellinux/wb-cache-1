Non-lethal devices have not been tested extensively in rivers {{as an alternative to}} shooting. Trials were carried out between January and May 2006 on the River North Esk and between October 2007 and February 2008 on the River Conon in northeast Scotland to examine the effectiveness of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>device</b> (ADD) at deterring seals from a specific area of river and as a barrier to the upstream movement of seals. The ADD was switched on and off alternately for periods of several days, and surveys were carried out to estimate the number of seals present within each river. The ADD had no significant effect on the absolute abundance of seals in the survey area in either river, but it did reduce seal movement upstream significantly, by 50 % in both rivers. This reduction was constant over the 4 -month period of both trials. The results suggest that ADDs might be a useful conservation tool in the management of seal–salmon conflicts, particularly in estuaries and rivers where the potential for adversely impacting cetaceans is limited...|$|E
40|$|Avoidance of {{interactions}} between fishing gear and whales Summary of Proposed Work: Sperm whales {{have learned to}} depredate deep-water sablefish longlines off Sitka, AK, {{and over the past}} decade their behavior has become more aggressive and widespread. Since 2003 the NPRB has funded a collaboration between fishermen and researchers (Southeast Alaska Sperm Whale Avoidance Project or SEASWAP), to understand the extent and nature of this behavior, with an aim of identifying methods for discouraging this behavior. Over the years SEASWAP field techniques have evolved from passive observations of opportunistic encounters to deliberate deployments for hypothesis testing. Under this proposal SEASWAP would conduct instrumented deployments to quantitatively test three different approaches to depredation reduction. The first two approaches, circle hauls and decoy anchorline deployments, have been discussed in the previous award (NPRB 626), and are the most promising of the so-called “passive strategies ” tested to date, based on previous instrumented deployments and volunteer sets by fishermen over the past four years. The third approach would use knowledge gained from our passive acoustic and video camera work to test an active <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>device</b> that would play back sperm whale echolocation sounds, white noise pulses, and transient killer whale sounds during a haul. This work would be leveraged by additional support from the Joint Industry Project of the Oil and Gas Producers Association, which has provided funds for 2009 to build the device, and to tag animals in order to document fine-scale reactions t...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. The {{aim of the}} project is to provide the {{capability}} to establish potential risks to cetaceans and seals {{from the use of}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices</b> in Scottish waters. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Deterrent</b> <b>Devices</b> (ADDs) are often used on aquaculture sites to reduce predation of seals on fish stocks using acoustic emissions.

In this project, an attempt is made to investigate the effects of water depth, seabed sediment type and bathymetry on the propagation and received levels of ADDs. It also examines the implications of simplified modelling approaches and associated prediction of a ‘zone of potential risk’. A generalised sensitivity model has been developed to allow prediction of the range to exceed predetermined thresholds (e. g. for hearing injury) based on sound pressure levels and cumulative sound exposure levels for user defined impact criteria based on ADD type, local environments and functional hearing capabilities of species present in Scotland...|$|R

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that between 1 and 4 million farmed Scottish salmon die annually from marine mammals, principally common seals. The predation of farmed fish by sea mammals is not only financially damaging to the farmer but is unacceptable from an animal welfare viewpoint. Many sea mammals predate on fish but, {{in the case of}} the seal, far fewer than 1 in every 100 learn how to predate farmed fish. Seals predate farmed fish by first frightening them and it is argued that many predator attacks go unnoticed due to the lack of dead fish. Predator attacks, whether successful or not, leave the fish stressed and therefore more prone to disease. All anti-predator measures currently employed have some environmental impact but <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Deterrent</b> <b>Devices</b> (ADDs) are alone in being humane, non-lethal and able to reverse any environmental impact by remaining silent. The report reviews our current knowledge of the effects of underwater sound on sea mammals and how it can be used to control their behaviour (target animals) at aquaculture facilities.

40|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices</b> (pingers) {{that are}} {{designed}} to alert marine mammals to the presence of fishing gear have been successfully employed to reduce cetacean–fishery interactions. However, pinger sounds may affect fisheries target species: noise can induce short-term stress responses in fish that are reflected in increased blood cortisol concentrations and behavioural alterations, which may ultimately result in reduced catch rates. In order to test this hypothesis, the present study analyses the hormonal and behavioural stress response of European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) to a commercially available pinger—the 70 kHz dolphin pinger. The responses of wild captive fish to the pinger sounds were tested in tank experiments, measuring the stress level of fish by analysing blood plasma cortisol concentration and swimming behaviour. Mixed effect models were used for statistical analysis. During the experiments, pinger sounds caused subtle, but significant elevations in sardine plasma cortisol concentration and fish school compaction. However, when compared to the rates of increase reported for acute stress responses in similar studies, the observed increment was very small. This suggests that the sounds of the trialled pinger are not likely to significantly alter sardine behaviour and should consequently not have any negative impact on sardine catch rates.

40|$|A {{controlled}} experiment {{was carried out}} in 19961997 to determine whether <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices</b> (pingers) reduce marine mammal bycatch in the California drift gill net fishery for swordfish and sharks. Using Fisher’s exact test, bycatch rates with pingers were significantly less for all cetacean species combined (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and for all pinniped species combined (P = 0. 003). For species tested separately with this test, bycatch reduction was statistically significant for shortbeaked common dolphins (P = 0. 001) and California sea lions (P = 0. 02). Bycatch reduction is not statistically significant for the other species tested separately, but sample sizes and statistical power were low, and bycatch rates were lower in pingered nets for six of the eight other cetacean and pinniped species. A log-linear model relating the mean rate of entanglement to the number of pingers deployed was fit to the data for three groups: short-beaked common dolphins, other cetaceans, and pinnipeds. For a net with 40 pingers, the models predict approximately a 12 - fold decrease in entanglement for short-beaked common dolphins, a 4 -fold decrease for other cetaceans, and a 3 -fold decrease for pinnipeds. No other variables were found that could explain this effect. The pinger experiment ended when regulations were enacted to make pingers mandatory in this fishery...|$|R
40|$|By {{the end of}} this decade, world-wide {{production}} of farmed salmon is estimated to reach 2, 000, 000 mt and almost all farmed salmon production takes place in sheltered areas of the coastal zone. This paper reviews the main activities associated with the marine phase of salmon aquaculture production, the pathways to the environment of the various activities and the potential effects on the coastal environment. The review is based on a extensive survey of the last ten years of published scientific research. It concludes there are large gaps in our knowledge of the impacts salmon aquaculture has on the marine environment. At the same time, the review reveals that salmon aquaculture: 1) contributes to coastal nutrient pollution, exacerbating existing problems from agricultural runoff, sewage discharges and atmospheric deposition; 2) releases toxic compounds, exacerbating existing pollution of coastal ecosystems; and 3) interferes with the performance of existing wild salmonid stocks, exacerbating the continuing decline in wild Atlantic salmon stocks. Given the large gaps in our knowledge and the universally acknowledged poor state of health of estuaries and coastal waters, it is recommended that regulatory agencies and policy-makers apply the precautionary principle to decisions concerning expansion of salmon, as well as other finfish, aquaculture in coastal waters and to maximizing mitigative measures (e. g., closed containment systems, restrictions on the use of pesticide and <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices,</b> moratoriums, and comprehensive environmental assessments) on existing operations...|$|R
40|$|Galicia (NW Spain) is an {{important}} fishing region with a high potential for cetacean–fishery interactions. Cetacean depredation on catch and damage to fishing gear can potentially lead to substantial economic loss for fishers, while cetacean bycatch raises conservation concerns. With the aim of gathering information on the types and scale of interactions and of suggesting possible management strategies, we conducted face-to-face interviews with fishers in local fishing harbours, in particular to identify specific problematic interactions and to quantify the level of economic loss and bycatch rates associated with these interactions. We found that cetacean–fishery interactions are frequent, although damage to catch and fishing gear by cetaceans was mostly reported as small. Nevertheless, substantial economic loss can result from common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) damaging coastal gillnets and from short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) scattering fish in purse-seine fisheries. Cetacean bycatch mortality {{was reported to be}} highest for trawls and set gillnets, and probably exceeds sustainable levels for local common and bottlenose dolphin populations. Although interview data may be biased due to the perceptions of interviewees, and therefore should be interpreted with care, the methodology allowed us to cover multiple sites and fisheries within a reasonable time frame. Minimizing cetacean–fishery interactions requires the implementation of case-specific management strategies with the active participation of fishers. For set gillnet and purse-seine fisheries, the use of <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices</b> (pingers) may prevent cetaceans from approaching and getting trapped in the nets. For trawl fisheries, where bycatch appears to be particularly high at night in water depths of 100 – 300 m, possible solutions include the implementation of time/area closures and the relocation of some fishing effort to deeper waters.

Harbour porpoises have been effectively excluded from bottom-set gill nets during many experiments for instance in the Gulf of Maine, along the Olympic Peninsula, in the Bay of Fundy, and in the North Sea. All of these studies show up to a 90% decrease in harbour porpoise bycatch. Pingers work because they produce a sound that is aversive (20; 15). There has been a recent re-evaluation of the potential of pingers and their use in other fisheries due to their growing success.An experiment on the California drift gill net fishery demonstrated how acoustic pingers reduce marine mammal bycatch. It was shown that bycatch was significantly reduced for common dolphins and sea lions. Bycatch rates were also lower for other cetacean species like the Northern right whale dolphin, Pacific white-sided dolphin, Risso’s dolphin and Dall's Porpoise. It is agreed upon that the more pingers on a net, the less bycatch. There was a 12-fold decrease in common dolphin entanglement using a net with 40 pingers.However, the widespread use of pingers along coastlines effectively excludes cetaceans such as porpoises from prime habitat and resources. Cetaceans which are extremely sensitive to noise are effectively being driven from their preferred coastal habitats by the use of acoustic devices. In poorer quality habitat, harbour porpoises are subjected to increased competition for resources. This situation is recognized as range contraction which can be a result of climate change, anthropogenic activity, or population decline. Large scale range contractions are considered indicative of impending extinction. A similar form of deterrent is noise pollution originating from vessel traffic.|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of sensory ecology, how animals receive {{and respond to}} their environment, {{can be a powerful}} tool for the conservation of endangered species because it can allow us to assess the potential success of actions designed to mitigate particular threats. We have a general {{understanding of}} how sea turtles perceive and respond to certain visual, magnetic, and chemical cues, but we understand very little about how they perceive and respond to acoustic cues. This dissertation explores the acoustic ecology of sea turtles, focusing on their auditory capabilities, responses to acoustic stimuli and the implications of this knowledge for their conservation. I measured the underwater and aerial hearing sensitivities of juvenile green (Chelonia mydas), hatchling leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and hatchling hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles by recording auditory evoked potential responses to tonal stimuli. Green turtles detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 600 Hz underwater (maximum sensitivity: 200 - 400 Hz) and 50 and 800 Hz in air (maximum sensitivity: 300 - 400 Hz), leatherbacks detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 200 Hz underwater (maximum sensitivity: 100 - 400 Hz) and 50 and 1, 600 Hz in air (maximum sensitivity: 50 - 400 Hz), and hawksbills detected tonal stimuli between 50 and 1, 600 Hz in both media (maximum sensitivity: 200 - 400 Hz). Sea turtles were more sensitive to aerial than underwater stimuli when audiograms were compared in terms of sound pressure, but they were more sensitive to underwater stimuli when audiograms were compared in terms of sound intensity. I also examined the behavioral responses of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) to simulated low frequency <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices</b> (ADDs) and found that these turtles exhibited a mild, aversive response to these sounds. This finding indicates that low frequency tonal ADDs have the potential to warn sea turtles of the presence of fishing gear and suggest that field tests of ADDs are warranted. Finally, I conducted a comprehensive review of our knowledge of the acoustic ecology of sea turtles, examined the sources of marine anthropogenic sound sea turtles are able to detect, evaluated the potential physiological and behavioral effects of anthropogenic sound, identified data gaps, and made recommendations for future research.

40|$|The WKBYC {{workshop}} {{was held}} to address three advice requests from the European Commission to the Working Group on Bycatch of Endangered Species. To address these issues DGMARE requests ICES to consider the following: 1) Assess {{the extent to which}} current fishery monitoring schemes, including inter alia those conducted under the DCF and Regulation 812 / 2004, provide an acceptable means of assessing the nature and scale of cetaceans and other protected species bycatch. Consider alternative means and other sources of data {{that could be used to}} improve our understanding of the conservation threat posed to cetaceans and protected species by bycatch in European fisheries. 2) Advise on how Annex II of Regulation 812 / 2004 defining technical specifications and conditions of use <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Deterrent</b> <b>Devices</b> could be best revised in light of technical and scientific progress in this field. 3) Based on the methodology used and the estimates of bycatch limits (take limits) generated by region at WKREV 812 and other relevant analyses, propose effective ways to define limits or threshold reference points to by-catch that could be incorporated into management targets under the reformed CFP. Limits or threshold reference points should take account of uncertainty in existing bycatch estimates, should allow current conservation goals to be met, and should enable managers to identify fisheries that require further monitoring, and those where mitigation measures are most urgently required. In response to the first request: ICES compared the coverage of current sampling under the DCF and the EU Regulation 812 / 2004 programmes with known abundances of cetaceans (and approximate indications of abundances of other protected species), with an index of bycatch vulnerability and with minimum estimates of fishing effort by métier. Métiers/areas were identified where the risk to populations of certain species (groups) being adversely affected was greatest, and where coverage of the present monitoring schemes was relatively poor. Second request: ICES also approached a small number of underwater acousticians and manufacturers of ADDs and asked them for their views on how Annex II of Regulation 812 / 2004 could be best revised. A number of existing ADDs are effective in reducing harbour porpoise bycatch, but the full bounds of the technical specifications between an effective and an ineffective ADD are not known. The group recommends that rigorous experiments are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of new ADDs, while prescriptive constraints are unhelpful. ICES bases its advice for an > 80 % reduction in bycatch on the results of all the successful pinger experiments listed by Dawson et al. (2013), with > 95 % being the standard level of confidence for scientific studies. Third request: the group considered that the existing procedures to establish limits and reference points (CLA, PBR, and 1. 7 %), has been reviewed several times in the past decade. The WKBYC notes the recommendations made by the WGMME (2013), particularly that the Catch Limit Algorithm (CLA) approach is recognized as the most appropriate method to set limits on the bycatch of cetaceans and that explicit conservation and management objectives for managing interactions between fisheries and cetacean populations should be adopted at a European level...|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) Significant {{declines in}} the catch rates of smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) have {{recently}} been reported {{off the coast of}} New South Wales, Australia. Quantitative investigations on the life history and correlates of distribution of exploited marine species is fundamental in providing sound species management, as resulting quantifiable results can help determine how population structures are affected by fishing, and their capacity to recover from reduced stocks. This information is particularly important for commercially targeted animals, such as sharks. This thesis assesses the age, growth and distribution of juvenile smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) on the east coast of Australia. Vertebra, along with information on sample sex, size and stage of maturity were collected from 144 sharks. Lengths-at-age and growth rates were estimated from vertebral growth band counts for 82 females (109 – 284 cm total length (LT) and 62 males (120 – 255 cm LT). A multimodal approach (various growth functions) was used on pooled data and then separated by sex. These were compared using Akaike Information Criterion, sorted by Akaike score (Δ) with supporting evidence weighed using Akaike weights (ω). These indicate that a multimodal approach is necessary for growth analysis and that sex specific models are required. Females attained a maximum theoretical total length (L∞) of 302. 2 cm and k of 0. 06, whereas male L∞ was larger at 340. 7 cm with a k of 0. 06. Sex ratios were similar, however 96 % of samples were not sexually mature, indicating that the coastal population of S. zygaena are mostly immature. These results have important implications in assessing the resilience of S. zygaena to stock depletion in south eastern Australian waters. This is fundamental for management decisions about status listings and allowable fishery interactions. Environmental variables influencing the catch of juvenile S. zygaena within the New South Wales Shark Meshing (Bather Protection) Program (SMP) were investigated to identify potential variables that explain spatial and temporal variability in catches. Using remotely sensed products and spatial conditions, 23 years of daily catch data from the SMP were applied to generalised linear mixed models with random effects to predict capture. The environmental variables assessed included sea surface temperature (SST), rainfall and chlorophyll a, as well as spatial and temporal variables such as distance to estuary mouth, substrate type, moon phase and southern oscillation index. Additionally, the introduction of <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices</b> were included in the model using year of introduction (1999). Corellative information indicates that juvenile S. zygaena catch were greatest at warmer SSTs, during dry weather, dark moon phases, in primarily sandy surroundings, and in nets closest to estuary mouths. Chlorophyll a concentration and southern oscillation did not help explain variation in catch. However, after adjusting for temporal changes in significant environmental factors, a temporal decline in catch was still present, indicating that the temporal decline in catch was not attributed to the environmental conditions assessed. The best predictor of temporal decline in the model was the introduction of acoustic deterent devices on nets. While a catch decrease after device introduction may be coincidental to an actual decline in the population, the close agreement between the fit of the model and the change point suggests that the temporal decline was associated with the introduction of the acoustic devices. This study suggests that further investigation at a finer level of detail (i. e. satellite tracking) is required into how each of the significant environmental conditions drives movement patterns of S. zygaena. This will also allow for a confirmation of the current studies method in detecting environmental patterns of occurrence and may allow an opportunity to test how acoustic alarms may affect their sensory biology. This thesis can assist decision makers in potential status listings both locally and worldwide. The identification of environmental and demographic catch patterns allow for informed coastal management decisions to take place, complementing future species specific adaptive management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{in water}} tends to travel {{much faster than}} in air. Cetaceans started to use the hearing system as a tool for their {{communication}} and so this system must have been adapted during the evolution. Every species form his specific sound repertoire which is used mainly for food finding, detection of predator or other hazards, communication and reproduction. Ocean ambient noise is created by natural sources of sound and man-made sounds (also called as anthropogenic sounds). Natural sounds are produced by marine organisms and processes like earthquakes, rainfall and so on. Anthropogenic sounds are made by man either intentionally or unintentionally and these sounds mostly disrupt the oceanic environment. Sound frequency and intensity level are the main factors when we determine the intensity of distortion in communication of Cetaceans. The most detrimental sounds are those with low frequency (from 10 to 500 Hz) and long-ranged propagation (hundreds of kilometers). Into this category we can include shipping and seismic surveys. In general, the most of anthropogenic sources of noise belong to this category. Other sources of anthropogenic noise are industrial activities, military sonar and <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrent</b> and harassment <b>devices</b> (ADDs/AHDs). Responses of Cetaceans to anthropogenic noise {{can be divided into}} three categories: physiological, behavioral and acoustic. The physiological reaction can be increasing metabolism, increasing baseline concentration of glucocorticoids in the blood and ultimately reducing immunity. Behavioral responses include changes in heading patterns and swim speed, changes in diving and breathing. Also included are social activities like food finding or nursing. Every change in vocalization represents acoustic responses. With growing number of studies which prove a negative influence of anthropogenic noise on Cetaceans there is an increasing need to introduce effective measures which could reduce or limit this negative influence. For this purpose there are established marine protected areas and safety zones which avoid exposure to loud noise (circa 120 dB and more) thanks to their regulations. As well there was developed a technology to modify the ship equipment and the using of an air bubble curtain in the immediate area of the industrial activity shows efficiency in acoustic attenuation...|$|R

In this study, an acoustic device was moored on the seafloor in the pathway of migrating gray whales off Yaquina Head on the central Oregon coast. Shore-based observers tracked whales with a theodolite (surveyor’s tool) to accurately locate whales as they passed the headland. Individual locations of different whales/whale groups as well as tracklines of the same whale/whale groups were obtained and compared between times with the acoustic device was transmitting and when it was off. Observations were conducted on 51 d between January 1 and April 15, 2012. A total of 143 individual whale locations were collected for a total of 243 whales, as well as 57 tracklines for a total of 142 whales.

There are also {{reports that the}} devices {{take a while to}} become effective, as some cats will stand their ground in a futile attempt to make the deterrent go away. Moving the device to different locations regularly and combining with another form of cat repellent may make these devices more effective. A statistical survey into customer satisfaction levels with ultrasonic deterrents concluded that 80% of owners expressed satisfaction with the results of ultrasonic <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Studies of {{long-term}} {{effects on the}} marine environment have not been carried out, including damage to non-targeted species. Results of the devices are mixed, and they have proved ineffective in some circumstances, especially over the long term, while design improvements such as electric fences to keep seals from climbing into enclosures, gear modification to exclude certain species, and keeping aquaculture plants clean of dead fish have often been effective at solving the problem of keeping predatory species away. Reports indicate that {{in contrast to the}} harassment <b>devices,</b> the <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices</b> have been very effective in dealing with cetacean bycatch.|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind farms. The lungs of bats are typical mammalian lungs, {{and unlike the}} lungs of birds, they {{are thought to be}} more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes in their immediate vicinity, such as near wind turbines, and are more liable to rupture. Bats suffer a higher death rate than birds in the neighborhood of wind turbines. Since there are no signs of external trauma, the cause has been hypothesized to be a greater sensitivity to sudden pressure fluctuations in the mammalian lung than in that of birds. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>deterrents</b> may prove beneficial in mitigating bat mortality at wind energy facilities.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to limited}} {{visibility}} of crew members wearing simulated spacesuits, all {{work outside the}} station is conducted with one crew member [...] "out-of-sim". It {{is the responsibility of}} this crew member be on look out for, and to protect the crew from polar bears. This crew member is typically armed with a pump-action shotgun loaded with slugs. The crew also carries bear <b>deterrent</b> <b>devices</b> known as bear bangers. No polar bears have yet been encountered by the crew of an FMARS expedition, although signs of their presence on the island are regularly seen, and at least one encounter has occurred with participants in the HMP.|$|R

40|$|Background: Animals {{typically}} show less habituation to biologically meaningful sounds than to novel signals. We might therefore {{expect that}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>deterrents</b> {{should be based}} on natural sounds. Methodology: We investigated responses by western grey kangaroos (Macropus fulignosus) towards playback of natural sounds (alarm foot stomps and Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) calls) and artificial sounds (faux snake hiss and bull whip crack). We then increased rate of presentation to examine whether animals would habituate. Finally, we varied frequency of playback to investigate optimal rates of delivery. Principal Findings: Nine behaviors clustered into five Principal Components. PC factors 1 and 2 (animals alert or looking, or hopping and moving out of area) accounted for 36 % of variance. PC factor 3 (eating cessation, taking flight, movement out of area) accounted for 13 % of variance. Factors 4 and 5 (relaxing, grooming and walking; 12 and 11 % of variation, respectively) discontinued upon playback. The whip crack was most evocative; eating was reduced from 75 % of time spen...|$|R
