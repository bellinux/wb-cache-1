Reflecting on his arrival to the band, Mangini told Noisecreep, [...] "As I see it, as I look back, I really think what {{happened}} was that this band kind of started over. They were in a new place as they looked for a drummer, and I when got the news, after the shock wore off, I knew what I wanted to do – which was just basically come in and try to support where they wanted to go.

500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] was {{the first}} episode that did not feature regular {{character}} Kramer (Michael Richards), Jerry's neighbor. David explained {{that the reason for}} Kramer's absence was because—during Seinfelds early seasons—the character never left his apartment and did not go out with the other three. Richards was still displeased with the absence of his character, as he felt the episode was a breakthrough and—as such—essential for the series' development. In an interview for the Seinfeld first and second season DVD box set, he commented, [...] "The Chinese restaurant episode was so unique, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to be a part of}} that because it was cutting edge. I knew that was a very important episode; it was so odd." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{illustrated}} book of The Hockey Sweater {{was among}} the children's books included as official Canadian gifts presented to the Prince of Wales and his family during an official visit in 1991, for his then nine-year-old son William. Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk, {{as part of a}} personal tradition of honouring others, brought a copy of the story to space when he travelled to the International Space Station in 2009 and later presented the copy to Carrier. Of the story, Thirsk said: [...] "It represents part of Canadian literacy, it represents support of reading <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to say thank you to Mr. Carrier." [...] The story has also been set to music by composer Abigail Richardson-Schulte as part of a piece commissioned by the Toronto Symphony, the Calgary Philharmonic and National Arts Centre Orchestras in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Parker {{said he and}} Stone did {{not intend}} for [...] "Damien" [...] to be {{offensive}} to Christians or any other religion: [...] "In South Park, Jesus is a great guy, he's on our show, and in this episode he's the hero. We're {{not in the business}} of offending people. We're in the business of making people laugh." [...] The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of the second grade, when he started at a Cheyenne, Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year. Parker said, [...] "It was brutal ... Everybody already had their little groups and the year was almost over, so I wasn't going to fit into any of them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to destroy and kill, which was the inspiration for this show." ...|$|E

"When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E

500|$|After the 2009–10 {{season was}} over, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. On July 10, 2010, Bosh officially completed a sign-and-trade deal with the Miami Heat, teaming up with Wade and James. Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, [...] "now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute here <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to thank you {{from the bottom of}} my heart..."

500|$|In December 2003, Welling {{made his}} feature film debut as Charlie Baker, the oldest son and second oldest in the Baker family which had 12 children, {{in the family}} comedy Cheaper by the Dozen with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, which is a remake of the 1950 movie {{starring}} Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy, based on [...] Frank and Lillian Gilbreth's 1948 book. Welling talked about why {{he was interested in}} the project in an interview with Paul Fischer: [...] "The top three reasons I decided to do this film were, one, Steve Martin, two, Steve Martin and three, Steve Martin. That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, I really liked this character, Charlie.

500|$|Through a Glass Darkly is a long, complex {{narrative}} that {{features more than}} 60 characters and at least 15 subplots. The title of the novel comes from the Bible verse 1 Corinthians 13. Before she began writing it, Koen envisioned creating {{a story about the}} relationship between a young woman and an older man, a plot element riddled with emotional tension that required much planning and foresight. Koen also sought to create a story that featured issues relevant to contemporary women, such as the non-existence of [...] "legal rights. If a husband wanted to beat his wife to death he could do it, and if her parents didn't care... No birth control. If you had any normal sexual urges you were pregnant all the time, and half the women died in childbirth. Life was very violent and short <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to show how it was without getting up on a soapbox, so someone reading it would say, 'I'm glad I live now.'" [...] According to Koen, another consistent theme throughout Through a Glass Darkly is how vital family is to our well-being, family in this case being a loose term that does not necessarily equate to being biologically-related. She was also interested in writing how people are connected to each other.|$|E

500|$|Following his mother's {{successful}} {{career as a}} divorce lawyer, {{the family moved to}} Beverly Hills, where Schwimmer attended Beverly Hills High School. Schwimmer admitted to being an outsider during his time at the school, recalling, [...] "When I was there I always felt: 'This is not me, I'm surrounded by people with a different value system. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to get out of California.'" [...] He was best at the subjects of science and math and thought he would become a doctor. Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class, where he appeared in stage productions. Encouraged by his school drama teacher to further his acting, he flew to Chicago for an acting workshop. He noted that the experience was both [...] "enlightening and exhilarating". In 1984, Schwimmer graduated from Beverly Hills High and wanted to go straight into acting, but his parents insisted he go to college first so he would have something to fall back on. Schwimmer moved to Chicago to attend Northwestern University, where he had attended a summer drama course when he was 16 years old. At the university, he studied theater and was in an improv group with Stephen Colbert, the No-Fun Mud Piranhas. After graduating in 1988, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and speech, Schwimmer co-founded the Lookingglass Theatre Company. Subsequently, he returned to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] was {{recorded}} by American rock musician Chris Cornell for his Carry On album in 2007. Cornell {{said of his}} cover, [...] "I didn't plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." [...] He added, [...] "And it's not a joke. I took a completely different approach to it, musically." [...] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, [...] "I {{was getting ready to}} do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to have fun with it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even if it sounds a lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance. In 2011, Patrick Stump covered the song in an a cappella mash-up tribute to Jackson along with several other songs over pre-recorded backing vocals.|$|E
