40|$|The Adriatic sturgeon, Acipenser naccarii (Bonaparte, 1836), is {{a highly}} {{threatened}} species due to human activities, particularly overfishing and habitat destruction. Its peculiar ecology and biology (restricted areal and anadromy) makes this species particularly vulnerable. In March 2010 the IUCN has identified the Adriatic sturgeon as a critically endangered species according to the Red List of Threatened Species. Due to its rapid decline, starting from the 80 s, at present {{there is no evidence}} of natural reproduction in wild environment, which makes the Adriatic sturgeon dependenton captive breeding programs that need to be improved in order to be effective for the survival of the species. For this purpose this study aims to characterize <b>artificial</b> <b>restocking</b> population of Adriatic sturgeon, with both genetic and physiological analysis in order to establish an efficient restocking program for future reproductions. The research is structured on two levels: First genetically, by analyzing 9 microsatellite loci. This gives information relatively about parent allocation and kinship between individuals that were sampled for this study. Hence to predict which reproduction events are the most optimal in terms of incrementing genetic diversity, by the estimation of multilocus pairwise band sharing coefficients. Second step, physiological analysis: testosterone (T) concentration levels in each individual were measured for sexing, without sacrificing the lives of the animals with the use of an invasive examination of the gonads. The combination of interdisciplinary analysis is important to obtain an overall picture in order to indicate the main broodstock participating in reproduction events and future optimal potential participants, in order to ensure a valid management for restocking program and their monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The ide, Leuciscus idus {{belongs to}} autochthonous, less {{numerous}} and endangered (vulnerable) fish {{species of the}} Czech Republic. In 2004, the fishing on ide was conducted on 51 non-salmonid (NS) fishing-grounds of the Moravian Anglers Union (MAU) on water area of 4622. 4 ha. In total, 432 ides (= 0. 31 ind. ha- 1; 0. 25 % of all captured fish) and 332 kg of ide biomass (= 0. 23 kg. ha- 1, = 0. 10 % of total mass of captured fish) were captured in 2004. Mean individual mass of ide was 0. 78 kg. In the period 1990 - 2004, 0. 11 ind. ha- 1 (= 0. 067 % of all captured fish) and 0. 075 kg. ha- 1 (= 0. 035 % of total mass of captured fish) in the NS fish-grounds of MAU were captured yearly. During 1953 - 1978, 1. 67 ind. ha- 1 and 1. 41 kg. ha- 1 of the ide were captured yearly in the riverine fishing-ground Dyje 7. General trend of catches is decreasing. Legislative species protection, <b>artificial</b> reproduction and <b>restocking</b> of fish fry and 1 + juveniles were realized...|$|R
