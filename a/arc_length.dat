5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow {{is an example of a}} geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has {{constant}} current output, {{ensuring that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> to cause minor fluctuations in the current.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, <b>arc</b> <b>length</b> is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} six new {{variants of}} the polynomially bounded Partitioning Shortest Path (PSP) algorithm for finding the shortest path from one node {{to all other}} nodes in a network. Three of these variants, one for negative <b>arc</b> <b>lengths,</b> but without negative cycles, and two for nonnegative <b>arc</b> <b>lengths,</b> augment the PSP algorithm to maintain a property called sharp by Shier and Witzgall. The other three variants augment the PSP algorithm to maintain a property called near-sharp for nonnegative <b>arc</b> <b>lengths.</b> Extensive computational testing is presented {{on one of the}} sharp variants for nonnegative <b>arc</b> <b>lengths</b> and two of the near-sharp variants. The empirical results based on 4500 test problems with 90 different configurations and three different network topologies indicate that these new algorithms have excellent computational performance characteristics. Based on total solution times for the 4500 test problems, these new algorithms out-perform all other algorithms tested. In addition, one of the near-sharp algorithms strictly dominates all others on all problem topologies tested. shortest path algorithms...|$|R

5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to <b>arc</b> <b>length,</b> normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCommon network parameters, such as {{number of}} nodes and <b>arc</b> <b>lengths</b> are {{frequently}} subjected to ambiguity {{as a result}} of probability law. A number of authors have discussed the calculation of the shortest path in networks with random variable <b>arc</b> <b>lengths.</b> Generally, only a subset of intermediate nodes chosen in accordance with a given probability law can be used to transition from source node to sink node. The determination of a priori path of the minimal length in an incomplete network is defined as a probabilistic shortest path problem. When <b>arc</b> <b>lengths</b> between nodes are randomly assigned variables in an incomplete network the resulting network is known as an incomplete stochastic network. In this paper, the computation of minimal length in incomplete stochastic networks, when travel times between nodes are allowed to be exponentially distributed random variables, is formulated as a linear programming problem.  A practical application of the methodology is demonstrated and the results and process compared to the Kulkarni’s [V.
