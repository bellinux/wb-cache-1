In the early 14th century, the capital was moved considerably upstream to Sarai Berqe, which {{became one of the}} largest cities of the medieval world, with 600,000 inhabitants. Sarai was described by the famous traveller Ibn Battuta as [...] "one of the most beautiful cities ... full of people, with the beautiful bazaars and wide streets", and having 13 congregational mosques along with [...] "plenty of lesser mosques". Another contemporary source describes it as [...] "a grand city <b>accomodating</b> markets, baths and religious institutions".

Extensional structures in the Las Parras and Calve basins are consistent with a roughly N-S oriented extension (locally NE-SW and NW-SE, perpendicular to the main normal faults). Thrusts show an overall E-W direction compatible with a near N-S shortening between the Late Eocene and the Early Miocene. Extension in the Algarve Basin was <b>accomodated</b> by ENE-WSW to NE-SW late Variscan faults; NW-SE transfer faults dipping to the Northeast also <b>accomodated</b> some extension and divided the area into sub-basins. Inversion in the Algarve Basin pre-dated deposition ofthe Miocene sediments and was <b>accomodated</b> by S- to S-SE directed thrusts, which cross-cut the main extensional fault...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the impact of cooperative or competitive organizational culture and employees’ job related affective well being on their preferred conflict resolution styles. A total of 236 white collar employees {{in the private sector}} completed questionnaires on “Organizational Culture“, “Job Related Affective Well Being“and “Conflict Resolution Styles“. Results indicated that employees working in a cooperative organizational culture would choose problem solving, compromising and <b>accomodating</b> conflict resolution styles while those working in a competitive work environment would choose forcing and avoiding strategies. Results also showed that while positive job related affective well being is a major predictor o problem solving, compromising, <b>accomodating</b> and avoiding conflict resolution styles, negative job related affective well being significantly predicts forcing and avoiding strategies.
