5|$|McElhenny was <b>a</b> <b>first-round</b> {{pick of the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1952 NFL Draft, ninth overall, {{and made}} an {{immediate}} impression as a rookie. His first play as a professional was a 40-yard touchdown run which had been drawn in the dirt because {{he had not yet}} learned the team's playbook. He recorded the season's longest run from scrimmage (89 yards), the longest punt return (94 yards), and the top rushing average (7.0 yards per carry).

Cody ran a 5.62 sec 40-yard dash, the slowest by an eventually drafted defensive tackle since Corey Swinson, a seventh round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft. Cody was selected in the 2nd round (57th overall) by the Baltimore Ravens.

5|$|In {{his rookie}} season, Nash only managed 10.5 minutes a game, {{but in his}} second season, his playing time {{increased}} significantly and he was even ranked 13th in the league for three-point field-goal percentage.

Following the 1998 NBA draft, Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange for Martin Müürsepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity and <b>a</b> <b>first-round</b> draft pick (who later turned out to be future Phoenix teammate Shawn Marion).|$|E
5|$|In his welterweight debut and {{his first}} fight under Team Rough House affiliation, Wallhead was victorious. The fight took place at Cage Warriors: Strike Force 3 where Wallhead faced Greco-Roman wrestler Steve Singh-Sidhu. Though Wallhead had dropped to welterweight, {{he still had a}} {{considerable}} weight advantage over his opponent who weighed in at 3.5kg less than Wallhead. This perhaps was significant as Singh-Sidhu's strikes seemed to have little bearing on Wallhead, who was able to land takedowns and a standing choke. Midway through the first round, Singh-Sidhu appeared to be backing away from Wallhead, who chased him down with punches and knees to the head. After a shin strike to the head, Singh-Sidhu's corner threw in the towel, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>first-round</b> TKO victory for Wallhead.|$|E
