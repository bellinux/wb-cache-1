2500|$|The {{second of}} three children, Lady Annabel {{was born in}} London into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family with its roots in Ulster and County Durham. [...] Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart was born the {{daughter}} of Robin Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, who later became the 8th Marquess of Londonderry, and Romaine Combe, who {{was the daughter of}} Major Boyce Combe, from Surrey. [...] She became Lady Annabel as a young girl in February 1949 when her father became Marquess on the death of his father, the famous Ulster Unionist politician the 7th Marquess of Londonderry. Her mother died of cancer in 1951, but the illness was kept a secret by her parents. [...] She later said, [...] "Cancer was such a taboo then â€“ Mummy didn't even tell her sisters." [...] Subsequently, her father became a chronic alcoholic and died from liver failure at 52 on 17 October 1955. [...] "My father was a really wonderful man but <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died, we couldn't talk to him as we had done before. He couldn't face life without her and he turned into Jekyll and Hyde almost overnight", she explained.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} there,--if that means knowing it. I lived there--till I was eleven years old. We came home <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. Yes. If it {{had been}} a girl, I would have called it <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> My mother had the same name as myself, Margaret.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wrote it}} down {{in the shape of}} a story some years ago, just <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death,' said Mrs. H--. 'It is locked up in my desk there now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Archer just hesitated. [...] "It {{was because}} {{there had been}} some {{disagreement}} between your <b>mother</b> and <b>my</b> father, <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death, which took place when I was a child. In consequence of it we never expected to see you." ...|$|R
60|$|I declined, {{with all}} needful {{gratitude}} and respect, {{to take his}} advice. The bare idea of living with a stranger so soon <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death revolted me. Besides, I liked my aunt, and my aunt liked me. Being made acquainted with my decision, {{the head of the}} family cast me off, exactly as he had cast off <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> before me.|$|R
60|$|Shortly <b>after,</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> went upstairs. Lettie came {{in rather}} late from Highclose; Leslie {{did not come}} in. In the morning they were going with a motor party into Matloch and Chatsworth, and she was excited, and did not observe anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I swear {{you shall}} tell me. It {{was such a}} cruel thing to answer me as you did, unless you meant it. And yet you never saw me again till <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had been over for you to Mrs. Crawley's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So indeed am I named <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> the 'Moon,'" [...] she said. [...] "But how did {{you know}} it, O Wanderer, whose skin is white as the foam of the sea and whose hair is yellow as the fine gold in the temples?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had no alternative," [...] she said. [...] "I {{began to}} realize it <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death. Then <b>my</b> father was badly hurt in an {{accident}} with a team, and I came back. He has nobody else to look after him, and he is getting on in life." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{begin at}} the beginning, I must {{take you back to}} the time <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death, when <b>my</b> only brother had gone to sea, when my sister was out at service, and when I lived alone with my father {{in the midst of a}} moor in the west of England.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the absence}} of any {{instructions}} to guide me, <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death, I was left to use my own discretion in examining the papers which she had left behind her. Reading her letters carefully, before I decided what to keep and what to destroy, I discovered a packet, protected by an unbroken seal, and bearing an inscription, addressed abruptly to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> in these words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I {{answered}} triumphantly, [...] "I {{did nothing}} of the sort. Is it likely that I should have taken those priceless pearls into battle? I gave them to Karema to keep <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> returned them to me on her death-bed; I remember it distinctly." ...|$|E
6000|$|MAUD. [Tapping the newspaper] It's all true. He came <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to Miss Athene's, and I--I couldn't stand it. I {{did what}} it says here; and now I'm sorry. Mother's dreadfully upset. You know father as well as anyone, Topping; {{what do you think}} he'll do now? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{father was}} {{master of the}} horse to the king of my country, and <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died he married another wife. At first all went well, {{but as soon as}} she had babies of her own she hated me, and I fled, lest she should do me harm.' ...|$|E
60|$|It grieved us much, it grieves me now, {{that this}} was his last {{distinct}} utterance. He LOOKED as if the comforting replies and the appeals to the Source of all redemption did awaken a response, but he never spoke articulately again; and only thirty-six hours <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> arrival, all was over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I take {{horses and}} go <b>after</b> her? <b>My</b> <b>mother's</b> gone to bed, she won't know," [...] asked George. [...] "Sixty {{thousand}} {{is a lot}} of money to lose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Through a heart trouble, {{from which}} he had {{suffered}} for years, and which had obliged him to lead a very quiet life," [...] was the reply. [...] "That {{was one of the}} things which, <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death, helped to sour his disposition. He could not return to the sea again, because he was told that any sudden excitement was likely to carry him off; and, indeed, that was exactly what happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|THREE days <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and I had {{established}} ourselves at Torquay, I received Mrs. Van Brandt's {{answer to my}} letter. After the opening sentences (informing me that Van Brandt had been set at liberty, under circumstances painfully suggestive to the writer of some unacknowledged sacrifice on my part), the letter proceeded in these terms: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{think that}} {{there was no one to}} meet you!" [...] exclaimed William George. [...] "But I never dreamed of your coming by train, knowing how you were set against it. Telegram? No, I got no telegram. S'pose Cyrus forgot to send it. I'm most heartily obliged to you, sir, for looking <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> so kindly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed. I want no one to-night, no one; {{after that}} you'll look <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> that's the great thing." [...] He spoke steadily, but his hand trembled {{so that he}} could not light his candle, and Julius was obliged to do it, saying wistfully, [...] "I'll come up the {{first thing in the morning}} and see how you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not that, {{but there}} is a great deal to do at home in <b>after</b> hours. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> is not strong, and we cannot keep a really {{efficient}} servant.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But Carmina still resisted. [...] "I {{have never}} even seen my aunt," [...] she said. [...] "It is dreadful to pass my life with a stranger. Remember, I was only a child {{when you came to}} us <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death. It is hardly six months yet since I lost my father. I have no one but you, and, when I go to this new home, you will leave me. I only ask for one more day to be together, before we part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he {{was never}} found. When folks learned how queerly he had acted all came to the {{conclusion}} that he had gone to the river and drowned himself, and <b>after</b> awhile <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> thought so too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} {{speaking}} of him socially," [...] said Van Loo, with a deprecating smile. [...] "You know {{he married a}} young woman--the hotel-keeper's daughter, who used to wait at the table--and <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and sister came out to keep house for me at Boomville it was quite {{impossible for me to}} see much of him, for he seldom went out without his wife, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|To make a {{long story}} short, he offered to look <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> while I was away, and, to prove his sincerity, laid down five shillings, and said he would call with that sum every week as long as I was absent. My mother, after some trouble, agreed to let me go, and, before that evening closed, {{everything}} was arranged, and the gentleman, leaving his address, went away.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went back}} {{with him to the}} [...] "Admiral Benbow," [...] and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and myself, and though nothing had been {{actually}} taken away except the captain's money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest,--My {{father is}} dead, my poor old father, and now I have nobody but you {{left in the}} world. Thank God, at the last he was without pain and, they thought, insensible; but I know he wasn't, because he {{squeezed}} my hand. Some of his last words that could be understood were, 'Give my love to Morris.' Oh! I feel as though my heart would break. <b>After</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death till you came into my life, he was everything to me--everything, everything. I can't write any more.|$|R
40|$|As a {{research}} librarian {{for the past}} twenty years, I have often envied the scholar who made a serendipitous discovery in the stacks â€” a stash of historic letters tucked inside a book, an adventurerâ€™s lost diary, a rare book shelved alongside the ordinary. Little did I imagine that a chain of such discoveries would occur {{in my own life}} when six months <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>motherâ€™s</b> death I traveled from my home in New Haven, Connecticut, back to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, to spend a week with my father organizing family memorabilia...|$|R
60|$|Jane {{had never}} seen Aunt Emma. There had been feud between the {{families}} while my father lived, so she didn't visit The Grange <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death. Aunt Emma had often explained to me in part how all that happened. It was the one point in our family history on which she'd ever been explicit: for she had a grievance there; and what woman on earth can ever suppress her grievances? It's our feminine way to air them before the world, as it's a man's to bury them deep in his own breast and brood over them.|$|R
60|$|Anneke's face brightened up, {{more and}} more, as the {{explanations}} proceeded; and, {{soon after they}} were ended, {{she turned to me}} in a very gracious manner, and inquired <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> As I sat directly opposite to her, and the table was narrow, we could converse without attracting much attention to ourselves; Mr. Mayor and his other guests keeping up a round of reasonably noisy jokes, on the events of the evening, nearer the foot of the table.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> fled to England with my father, de Garcia persecuted my {{grandmother}} and his aunt with lawsuits and by other means, till at last she was reduced to beggary, in which condition the villain left her to die. So poor was she indeed, that she was buried in a public grave. After that the old woman, my informant, said she had heard that de Garcia had committed some crime and been forced to flee the country. What the crime was she could not remember, but it had happened about fifteen years ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must {{go first}} to Mainz to get away a chest of my grandfather's, and perhaps to see a friend of his," [...] said Deronda. [...] "Although the chest has been lying there these twenty years, I have an {{unreasonable}} sort of nervous eagerness to get it away under my care, {{as if it were}} more likely now than before that something might happen to it. And perhaps I am the more uneasy, because I lingered <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> left, instead of setting out immediately. Yet I can't regret that I was here--else Mrs. Grandcourt would have had none but servants to act for her." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>After</b> {{two years}} <b>my</b> {{life was in}} the east again, [...] "architecting" [...] {{traveling}} by bicycle in Continental Europe and Great Britain, and keeping house for <b>my</b> father <b>after</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> death in 1900. I might mention that my trip abroad was aided by revenue from cattle investments in Arizona, at the N.Y. Ranch in Cochise County. Father {{at the age of}} 79 retired from business and went to Tombstone to be with my brother and his family, and I was in an architect's offices and my own in Detroit and Buffalo, but arrived in Tombstone in 1909, and remained until my father's release from months of physical failure. His funeral and burial were in Mount Morris in 1911.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When Jane Murdstone meets, I say,' he went on, <b>after</b> {{waiting until}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was silent, 'with a base return, {{that feeling of}} mine is chilled and altered.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that one--I am the second. I {{was born}} three months <b>after</b> that night, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> being mercifully {{permitted}} {{to lay down}} her life in giving me mine." ...|$|R
