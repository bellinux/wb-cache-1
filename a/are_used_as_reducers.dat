Hydrogen <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a <b>reducer.</b> Three different catalytic membrane reactors were prepared and employed in the studied reaction. The catalytic membrane reactors <b>were</b> prepared <b>using</b> commercial corundum hollow fiber membranes. The active phases, palladium, cerium oxide, iron oxide or combinations of them, were incorporated by incipient wetness impregnation of the corresponding water-soluble salts followed by calcination and reduction. The catalytic tests were performed in semi-batch mode at ambient conditions. A mass flow controller <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to supply hydrogen to {{one end of the}} membrane whilst the other end was kept closed. The reactors were submerged into a vessel containing the chromate solution. The concentration of the chromate was continuously monitored following a standard analytical method. The initial chromate concentration was varied between 0. 5 and 18 mg L- 1. In order to completely reduce the Cr(VI) to Cr(III), it was necessary to decrease the pH of the solution to 3. In the end of the tests the final solutions were neutralized to pH 8 and filtered. The content of chromium in the final solutions and in the precipitates was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) technique.

40|$|A piled raft is a {{composite}} foundation in which the piles <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> settlement <b>reducers</b> and they share, with the raft, the load from the superstructure. The applied load is transferred from the raft to the shallow soil and to the pile heads, and from the piles it is diffused through the shaft and the base to deeper soil. The pile–raft and pile–pile interactions represent the distinctive aspect of the piled raft foundations since they modify the load–bearing behaviour of each foundation component, compared to an analogous isolated element, thus determining the overall foundation behaviour. The main aim of this thesis is to highlight {{the effects of the}} raft–soil–pile interactions on the resistance and stiffness of axially loaded piled raft foundations in sand. A series of centrifuge tests on models of rigid circular piled rafts in loose saturated sand has been performed to this end, employing both non displacement and displacement piles. The raft settlement and the load transmitted to the pile heads and bases were monitored during the tests, which also included unpiled raft and isolated pile tests. The test results have been analysed in terms of bearing capacity and stiffness; the former according to a load efficiency method, the latter by comparing the values obtained from centrifuge tests with those evaluated through a simplified analytical method. ii Modelling of Piled Raft Foundations in Sand D. Giretti In order to clarify the effect of the pressure transmitted by the raft to the soil on the behaviour of a single capped pile, some of the centrifuge tests were simulated via finite element numerical analyses, using an elasto–plastic strain hardening constitutive model for the sand.

30|$|In oil-drilling operations, a {{filtrate}} reducer is {{the most}} commonly used drilling fluid additive. Its main functions are reducing drilling fluid filtration by forming thin and dense filter cakes on the wellbore, thus reducing the mutual permeability between the mud filtrate and wellbore, minimizing wellbore instability, and ensuring the stability of drilling fluid performance (Zhang and Deng 1998). Partially hydrolyzed sodium polyacrylonitrile with an anionic hydration group, polyacrylonitrile calcium salts, and polyacrylonitrile ammonium salts <b>are</b> widely <b>used</b> <b>as</b> filtrate <b>reducers,</b> which meet the requirements of well drilling operations below 120  °C (Cui and Zhu 1999; Ahmed et al. 2013). The application of an allyl copolymer with cationic groups in the drilling fluid has been reported. This mainly revolves around its application to cationic and zwitterionic drilling fluid systems (Zhang and Deng 1998; Warren et al. 2000). Hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide as a sealing agent has <b>been</b> <b>used</b> in water-based drilling fluid. This can effectively improve the temperature and salt resistance of water-based drilling fluid system (Xie et al. 2013). Lubricants based on water-soluble polyacrylamide have also <b>been</b> <b>used</b> in drilling, particularly in low-density drilling fluid systems (Wang 2013). In recent years, standards of drilling fluid systems have become higher with the increase in deep and complex wells. Therefore, a filtrate reducer containing cationic groups is believed to have a promising application (Zlotnikov et al. 2006). There have been reports about acrylic waste fiber that can enable the drilling fluid loss agent to be cationically grafted under alkaline conditions (Yu et al. 2004; Celik et al. 2012). Still missing are the molecular structure of the cationic agent and the cationic degree of the final products. The characterization of the structure of such reaction products is yet to be reported. The application of the products and their mechanisms of activity in the drilling fluid should be further investigated.|$|R
3000|$|At present, {{shale gas}} {{exploration}} and production has attracted much attention. Given its accumulation characteristics, extended-reach horizontal wells and cluster horizontal wells were drilled to produce shale gas. Because {{of the existence of}} micro-fissures and strong water sensitivity in shale formations, severe wellbore instability often occurs in the long horizontal sections, which seriously restricts the process of shale gas exploration and development (Cui et al. 2011; Dong et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013). Shale formation is mainly composed of hard brittle shale, mainly of illite and mixed layer illite/smectite. For hard brittle shales, pore pressure transmission is the primary cause of wellbore instability. Therefore, the key to maintaining wellbore stability is to prevent pore pressure transmission. The effective sealing of micropores and micro-fissures is of great significance for preventing pore pressure transmission. Traditional plugging agents are difficult to form effective mud cake to prevent liquid penetration into shale matrix which has extremely low permeability and tiny pore throats. In recent years, nanoparticles are found to effectively plug shale pore throats to prevent liquid penetration into the formation, thus maintaining wellbore stability and protecting the reservoir (Roshan and Aghighi 2012; Rafieepour et al. 2013; Wen et al. 2014). According to previous experimental results, silica nanoparticles could significantly improve the densification of mud cakes, slow down pressure transmission and reduce shale permeability, while the rheology and lubrication of water-based drilling fluid were improved (Cai et al. 2012; Hoelscher et al. 2012; Al-Baghli et al. 2015). Bai and Pu (2010) synthesized PMMA latex nanoparticles with an average size of 73  nm, which can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a lubricant in drilling fluids based on their “ball bearing” function to prevent pipe sticking. They can also <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a filtration <b>reducer</b> based on its deformability under temperature and pressure, forming a tough filter cake and sealing the micro-fissures in the formations drilled. Qu et al. (2007) synthesized intercalated or exfoliated nanocomposite poly(styrene-b-acrylamide)/bentonite using reversible addition-fragmented chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Experiments showed that these products had high-temperature tolerance and were good filtration control agents. In the last 20  years, the investigation into nanomaterials has greatly developed in many fields. Great {{progress has been made in}} basic theory and application of nanooptical materials, nanosemiconductor materials, nanobiomedical materials, nanoenhanced materials, nanomodified surface, etc. (Lin et al. 2012; Cormick and Hunter 2014; Kearnes et al. 2014). The combination of smart polymers with environmental response behavior (temperature, pH value, electrolyte concentration, magnetic field strength, electric field strength, etc.) and nanoparticles to realize the potential of nanoparticles is the most common research (Wu et al. 2013; Gulfam and Chung 2014; Lian et al. 2015). In this study, nanomaterials technology, smart polymers, and drilling fluid technology were combined. Emulsifier-free poly(methyl methacrylate–styrene) [P(MMA–St)] nanospheres [...] with an average particle size of about 100  nm were synthesized in an isopropyl alcohol–water medium by the solvothermal method. Then, the thermo-sensitive smart polymer P(NIPAm–AA) was modified onto the surface of P(MMA–St) nanospheres and thermo-sensitive smart nanoparticles were obtained. With the change in temperature, the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface would change accordingly. Moreover, we would adjust the transformation temperature of NIPAm by an introduction of hydrophilic monomer or hydrophobic monomer, getting smart nanoparticles with different transformation temperatures to adapt to shale formations with different temperatures.|$|R

In addition, we have found that LiAl 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 sample exhibited the more stable capacity than the other samples...|$|R
40|$|Silicomanganese <b>is</b> widely <b>used</b> <b>as</b> {{a complex}} <b>reducer</b> and an {{alloying}} addition {{in the production}} of various grades of steel due to its economic and metallurgical advantages. It <b>is</b> also <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a semi-product in the manufacture of medium- and low-carbon ferromanganese and metallic manganese. Manganese-rich slag, resulting from high carbon ferromanganese production, has the advantages of high manganese content, high Mn/Fe ratio, low excess oxygen, low phosphorus content, low fine content and low cost. Such slag seems to be very attractive to <b>use</b> <b>as</b> raw materials for the production of silicomanganese alloys. In the present study, experimental heats were designed and carried out to optimise the factors affecting the production process of silicomanganese using manganese rich slag in the charge. The results of pilot plant experimental heats showed that the optimum metallic yield and recoveries of manganese and silicon are obtained with initial slag basicity, (CaO + MgO) / (Al 2 O 3), equals 1. 8 by <b>using</b> dolomite <b>as</b> fluxing material and charging quartzite and fluorspar in percentage of 25 % and 4 % of the blend, respectively. The results showed also that an amount of 30 % of coke in excess of the stoichiometric amount should be added. These result are relative for the specific high Al 2 O 3 ores used...|$|R
