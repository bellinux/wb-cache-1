5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Rice is {{the basic}} {{ingredient}} in ceremonial dishes, and {{is a very important}} element of Palestinian meals.

Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E

Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
