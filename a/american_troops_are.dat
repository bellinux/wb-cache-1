5000|$|The {{original}} game contains counters {{representing the}} German, Russian and American armies. Russian troops {{are portrayed as}} poorly armed (and with poor quality radios, making {{it very difficult for}} them to summon artillery support) and with relatively fewer leaders, but with the capacity to become [...] "berserk" [...] in combat (a capacity shared in later expansions by SS troops). US troops are shown as having unusually high firepower (representing larger squads, using the Browning Automatic Rifle - unlike other nationalities who have separate counters for light machine guns), but with slightly lower basic morale than German or Soviet troops, representing the supposed greater tendency of more individualistic Americans to break from their orders or the group under fire - however, <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> easier to rally under fire, as they were exempt from the usual penalty ("Desperation Morale") paid by broken squads in these circumstances. British troops, when eventually added to the game system, are shown as largely similar to the Germans, albeit with somewhat inferior equipment.|$|E

50|$|<b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> {{now being}} {{withdrawn}} in increasing numbers. The Americans organize German civilian police in their zone, but this force's loyalty {{to democracy and}} ability to combat re-emerging Nazis is doubtful. The C-47 attack finally brings about a degree of cooperation between the Soviet and American counterintelligence services. At a meeting, the Soviets turn over a Holocaust survivor {{who worked as a}} slave laborer constructing the bunker system Heydrich is using. He leads American forces to the bunker where the insurgent leader is hiding. When the U.S. Army begins to dig into the bunker, Heydrich and a group of his men attempt to escape, but come under fire by U.S. soldiers which results in Heydrich being killed. This success does not end the insurgency, however; Heydrich's deputy Joachim Peiper takes over as Reichsprotektor and orders the hijacking of three civilian airliners. While the Soviets remain committed to the occupation and to crushing the resistance, the Americans and British complete their withdrawal, leaving the Nazis ready to reemerge in western Germany. However, the French and Soviets tighten their grip on their occupation zones.|$|E

50|$|A great {{familiarity}} of each control and swift operation {{needs to be}} achieved before the unit can be deployed efficiently. <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> trained on the system at the Infantry School in Fort Benning, Georgia, for two weeks. The soldiers are taught basic care and maintenance, operation and abilities, assembly and disassembly, and the positions it can be fired from. Soldiers are also taught to distinguish between a variety of vehicle types even when only a rough outline is visible. The soldiers must accomplish several timed drills with set standards before being qualified to operate the system in both training and wartime situations. There are also smaller training programs set up on most Army bases that instruct soldiers on {{the proper use of}} the system. At these courses, the training program might be changed in small ways. This is most commonly only minor requirements left out due to budget, the number of soldiers vs. simulation equipment, and available time and resources. Both types of training courses have required proficiency levels that must be met before the soldier can operate the system in training exercises or wartime missions.|$|E

40|$|This film is the 3 rd of 5 reels in the US Army Signal Corp {{produced}} film, "America Goes Over," {{documenting the}} activities of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. The film was produced in 1918 and this print was likely produced ca. 1927. The footage opens with radio operators working in the trenches, various scenes of battle planning, artillery firing, wounded soldiers being removed from a battlefield and the dead left behind. The film then moves to the American forces move toward Soissons, crossing the Marne, and taking Chateau Thierry. The <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> seen eating, washing, getting haircuts, and welcoming more troops and supplies from ships from the United States. Footage shows the city of supplies at Gievres, an industrial cooking demonstration, and General Pershing writing commands. The film then moves into the opening of the Saint-Mihiel Offensive of 12 Sep 1918 with many artillery scenes, Renault tanks, soldiers cutting barbed wire at dawn, and troops running out of bunkers to fight. An airplane dogfight is captured on film from this battle, ending with the German pilot being shot down and taken prisoner. Troops are then shown digging in Howitzers, crossing enemy lines, surveying the German dead, helping wounded American troops off the field, resting, then going back the next day. In the German fortifications they find a dog used for sending messages. Troops are seen eating, feeding villagers, and marching German prisoners through the streets. The footage then moves to show the American and Australian troops marching through the Hindenburg line together. The footage ends showing the St. Quentin Canal Tunnel, and King Albert and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium watch the American troops marching...|$|E
40|$|This {{commentary}} is {{a six-month}} update on UK military fatality rates per 1000 personnel-years in Iraq 1, {{together with an}} account for Afghanistan for both UK and other forces. In 2006, there have been 32 UK military deaths in Afghanistan and 19 in Iraq where {{more than twice as}} many UK troops are stationed as in Helmand province, Afghanistan. Over 10, 000 Afghan, British, Canadian and <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> reported to be deployed on Operation Mountain Thrust in Afghanistan 2. Military casualties, in addition to fatalities, are reported for both US and Canadian troops 3 4. Blank columns signify that UK’s non-fatal military casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan (specifically: those who do not return to duty within 72 hours, as cited in the Edinburgh Fringe’s highly-acclaimed play, ‘Black Watch’) are still 1 not properly collated, analysed and published. UK’s performance monitoring in the public services 5 requires better if we are to discharge the debt of honour that parliament and public owe to our military forces. Analysis should properly take into account that military fatalities, and indeed casualties, may occur in clusters as when a helicopter or plane crashes, as occurred on 2 September 2006 when a Kinloss-based Nimrod came down in southern Afghanistan with the loss of 14 British lives, or there is a suicide bombing, or ordinance explodes. Deaths and casualty also dog those who have returned home, but are haunted by operations; and they add to the wages of war 6 - 9. UK’s military fatality rate at the outset of operations in Helmand province in Afghanistan is comparable with the initial period of major combat in Iraq. Ten out of 11 deaths in Helmand to 12 August 2006 were hostile, whereas only two were of the preceding period’s (and locations’) seven, which included at least one each of accidental weapon discharge, suicide, homicide, and vehicle accident; and, additionally, there has been one non-hostile death due to vehicle accident on 11 August 2006 in camp at Kabul...|$|E

40|$|In January 2006 WorldPublicOpinion. org {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} Iraqis. Since then {{there have been numerous}} developments that raise questions about how the views of the Iraqi people may have shifted. The center of violence in Iraq has shifted geographically into Baghdad, and socially into interethnic violence between Shias and Sunnis. Has this changed attitudes about the presence of US forces—especially among the Sunnis who may now feel more vulnerable? Some Iraqi members of parliament have called for the US to give a timetable for the withdrawal of its forces. In the January poll, a majority of Iraqis wanted the US to set a timetable, but there was no majority sentiment for a quick withdrawal. What do the Iraqi people feel now, and does it vary by ethnic group? Attacks on US troops have continued unabated. In January, nearly half of Iraqis approved of attacks on US-led forces [...] but the sense that <b>American</b> <b>troops</b> <b>are</b> now focused on reducing violence in Baghdad may have altered the equation. Meanwhile, the argument among Iraq’s political parties about how decentralized the country’s future federal structure will be continues to simmer. Among Shia leaders there are deep divisions over whether or not to set up a largely autonomous region in the south. While Kurds in the north have considerable autonomy now, the size and independence of their future territory remains a subject for dispute. Sunni leaders tend to be hostile to federalism in general. In America, there has also been speculation in policy circles about whether a full partition of Iraq would be the best long-run solution. But it is unclear to what degree the centrifugal forces that are undoubtedly in play actually represent what ordinary Iraqis think. The growth of militias, in many cases allied to political parties, has been a deeply troubling phenomenon. It is possible that this very growth in militia membership is a sign that Iraqis are turning to them increasingly to meet their need for security. However, since militia members certainly do not constitute a majority of all Iraqis, {{it is also possible that}} the apparent trend does not coincide with most people’s desires. In the US, there is a stormy political argument over whether the presence in Iraq of an al Qaeda group, active in atrocities against US troops, foreign civilians, and Iraqi civilians alike, means that battle lines are now clearly drawn in Iraq between those who stand with the US against al Qaeda and those who do the opposite. But little is known of how the mass of Iraqis view al Qaeda, or whether opponents of the US presence are also al Qaeda supporters. In the context of these dynamics, WorldPublicOpinion. org has undertaken a second poll of the Iraqi people to determine their attitudes about these various developments occurring around them, and also to differentiate the views of the ethnic subgroups—Arab Sunnis, Shia and Kurds. The poll was fielded by KA Research Limited/D 3 Systems, Inc. Polling was conducted September 1 - 4 with a nationwide sample of 1, 150, which included an oversample of Arab Sunnis. Respondents from all of Iraq’s 18 governorates were interviewed for the sample...|$|E
