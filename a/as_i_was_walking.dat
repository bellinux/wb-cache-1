25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E

6000|$|My gait <b>was</b> erect, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather tall for my age; {{and that}} may have been the reason why, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rapidly <b>walking</b> along the dock, a drunken sailor passing, exclaimed, [...] "Eyes right! quick step there!" ...|$|R

60|$|The Captain rode {{over several}} times to see us; and Miss Brough seemed always delighted to see him. One day I met him <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> out alone by the river, {{and we had a}} long talk together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{you were}} right in warning me. He must needs think I worked in the parish for his sake; and one fine day, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> home, he joined company, and before I knew where I was he was making me an offer.' ...|$|E
60|$|I narrate this incident, {{otherwise}} trivial, as {{indicating the}} astounding ramifications and {{the ubiquity of}} the international spy system. A similar illustration occurs to me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> write. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> the other day with another man, on upper B. way between the T. Building and the W. Garden.|$|R
6000|$|We {{went on in}} {{this way}} for a long time, and it seemed likely that we should {{continue}} to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss Havisham stopped short <b>as</b> she and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking,</b> she leaning on my shoulder; and said with some displeasure,-- ...|$|R

[...] By making his revelations public, Barmine felt the book might help frustrate Stalin's immediate desire to silence him. Upon its release, the Soviet government made no comment on Barmine's revelations, though they had denounced earlier works by other Soviet émigré authors.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile I had {{definitely}} {{decided not}} to be a lawyer, and it happened in this way. One Sunday morning <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> toward school, I met a young man named Lohr, a law student several years older than myself, who turned and walked with me for a few blocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't bear to be spied upon. Oh, the cause? Yes, {{there is}} a cause; there is {{something}} else that is lost besides Antonia's favourite fan. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> home after seeing Don Jose and Antonia to their house, the Capataz de Cargadores, riding down the street, spoke to me." ...|$|E
60|$|She was tall--tall {{at least}} for a woman. There were not many people in the road along which we were proceeding; but even if there had been, far behind <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking,</b> I should never have lost her--never have mistaken any one else for her. Already, strangers though we were, I felt that I should know her, almost at any distance, only by her walk.|$|E
6000|$|No sooner {{said than}} {{out in the}} night! My heart lighter and more light: And still, <b>as</b> before, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> swift, [...] With my senses {{settling}} fast and steadying, But my body {{caught up in the}} whirl and drift [...] Of the vesture's amplitude, still eddying On just before me, still to be followed, [...] As it carried me after with its motion, --What shall I say?--as a path, were hollowed, [...] And a man went weltering through the ocean, Sucked along in the flying wake Of the luminous water-snake.|$|R

6000|$|And he will {{wonder why}} still there seems {{reason for this}} outcry. Still, after what {{analysis}} and proof of his being right have as yet been given, the reader may perhaps be saying to himself: [...] "All this reasoning is of no use to me. Turner does not give me the idea of nature; I do not feel before one of his pictures <b>as</b> <b>I</b> should in the real scene. Constable takes me out into the shower, and Claude into the sun; and De Wint makes me feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> in the fields; but Turner keeps me in the house, and I know always that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> looking at a picture." ...|$|R

"Lady, {{this is the}} truth. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> {{through the}} market-place an old black woman met me, and offered me a piece of gold if I would deliver a letter into {{the hand of the}} prince Aziel. The gold tempted me, for I had need of it, and I consented; but of who wrote the letter I know nothing, nor have I ever seen the woman before." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> {{one morning}} with Buckthorne, {{near one of}} the Principal theaters, he {{directed}} my attention to a group of those equivocal beings that may often be seen hovering about the stage-doors of theaters. They were marvellously ill-favored in their attire, their coats buttoned up to their chins; yet they wore their hats smartly on one side, and had a certain knowing, dirty-gentlemanlike air, which is common to the subalterns of the drama. Buckthorne knew them well by early experience.|$|E
6000|$|When {{there was}} a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed so strange to me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> home, to think that Dora was at home! It was such a {{wonderful}} thing, at first, to have her coming softly down {{to talk to me}} as I ate my supper. It was such a stupendous thing to know for certain that she put her hair in papers. It was altogether such an astonishing event to see her do it! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{now come}} forth {{on a good}} thoroughfare, which led (<b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could judge) in my direction. It brought me almost {{immediately}} through a piece of street, whence I could hear close by the springing of a watchman's rattle, and where I suppose a sixth part of the windows would be open, and the people, {{in all sorts of}} night-gear, talking with a kind of tragic gusto from one to another. Here, again, I must run the gauntlet of a half-dozen questions, the rattle all the while sounding nearer; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>walking</b> inordinately quick, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke like a gentleman, and the lamps were too dim to show my dress, I carried it off once more. One person, indeed, inquired where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> off to at that hour.|$|R

Read through and corrected St. Ronan's Well. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> no judge, but I think the language of this piece rather good. Then I must allow the fashionable portraits are not the true thing. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too much {{out of the way}} to see and remark the ridiculous in society. The story is terribly contorted and unnatural, and the catastrophe is melancholy, which should always be avoided. No matter; I have corrected it for the press.[305] ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took his}} pocket-book and the revolver, being {{resolved}} rather to die {{than to be}} captured, and laden besides with the basket and the bag of gems, set forward towards the north. The swamp, at that hour of the night, {{was filled with a}} continuous din: animals and insects of all kinds, and all inimical to life, contributing their parts. Yet {{in the midst of this}} turmoil of sound, <b>I</b> walked <b>as</b> though my eyes were bandaged, beholding nothing. The soil sank under my foot, with a horrid, slippery consistence, <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> among toads; the touch of the thick wall of foliage, by which alone I guided myself, affrighted me like the touch of serpents; the darkness checked my breathing like a gag; indeed, I have never suffered such extremes of fear as during that nocturnal walk, nor have I ever known a more sensible relief than when I found the path beginning to mount and to grow firmer under foot, and saw, although still some way in front of me, the silver brightness of the moon.|$|R

'I've had a dream,' repeated Charlson, who required no encouragement. 'I dreamed that a gentleman, who has been very kind to me, married a haughty lady in haste, before he had quite forgotten a nice little girl he knew before, and that one wet evening, like the present, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> up the harbour-road, I saw him {{come out of that}} dear little girl's present abode.' ...|$|E

After a while Allan remarked, jocosely, that the mere sound of the liquids you were pouring out made him thirsty. When he said this, I turned round from the window. I {{approached}} you, and said the lemonade {{took a long time to}} make. You touched me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> away again, and handed me the tumbler filled to the brim. At the same time, Allan turned round from the window; and I, in my turn, handed the tumbler to him.--Is there any mistake so far?' ...|$|E

At this I made a stand in my spirit: with that this word took hold upon me, The blood of Jesus Christ His Son, cleanseth us from all sin. 1 John i. 7.|$|E
60|$|The {{few people}} I met didn't {{seem to think}} it was {{anything}} wonderful for a woman to ride on a tricycle, and I soon began to feel as proper <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> on a sidewalk. Once I came very near tangling myself up with the legs of a horse who was pulling a cart. I forgot that it was the proper thing in this country to turn to the left, and not to the right, but I gave a quick twist to my helm and just missed the cart-wheel, but it was a close scratch. This turning to the right, instead of to the left, was a mistake Jone made two or three times when he began to drive me in England, but he got over it, and since my grazing the cart it's not likely I shall forget it. As I {{breathed a sigh of relief}} after escaping this danger I took in a breath full of the scent of wild roses that nearly covered a bit of hedge, and my spirits rose again.|$|R
60|$|Frank cared {{little for}} books {{but he could}} take a hand at games {{although}} he was not strong. Burton who at sixteen was almost as tall as his father {{was the last to}} surrender his saddle to the ash-bin. He often rode his high-headed horse past our house on his way to town, and I especially recall one day, when <b>as</b> Frank and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> to town (one fourth of July) Burt came galloping along with five dollars in his pocket.--We could not see the five dollars but we did get the full force and dignity of his cavalier approach, and his word was sufficient proof of the cash he had to spend. As he rode on we, in crushed humility, resumed our silent plodding in the dust of his horse's hooves.|$|R
60|$|My {{wife had}} screwed up the {{machine in the}} {{knapsack}} more than usual, and walking seemed scarcely any effort at all. I carried a long alpenstock, and {{when we reached the}} mountain and began the ascent, I found that with the help of this and my knapsack I could go uphill at a wonderful rate. My companion had taken the lead, so as to show me how to climb. Making a détour over some rocks, I quickly passed him and went ahead. After that it was impossible for him to keep up with me. I ran up steep places, I cut off the windings of the path by lightly clambering over rocks, and even when I followed the beaten track my step was as rapid <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>walking</b> on level ground.|$|R
60|$|I {{must tell}} you, what I just remembered {{in a flash}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> about dictating this letter--there was in the {{original}} plan of the Master of Ballantrae a sort of introduction describing my arrival in Edinburgh {{on a visit to}} yourself and your placing in my hands the papers of the story. I actually wrote it, and then condemned the idea--as being a little too like Scott, I suppose. Now I must really find the MS. and try to finish it for the E.E. It will give you, what I should so much like you to have, another corner of your own in that lofty monument.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> {{one evening}} with the Oxonian, Master Simon, and the general, in a meadow {{not far from}} the village, we heard the sound of a fiddle, rudely played, and looking in the {{direction}} from whence it came, we saw a thread of smoke curling up from among the trees. The sound of music is always attractive; for, wherever there is music, there is good-humour, or good-will. We passed along a footpath, and had a peep through a break in the hedge, at the musician and his party, when the Oxonian gave us a wink, and told us that if we would follow him we should have some sport.|$|E
60|$|Oddly enough, {{this last}} Cockney epigram clings to my memory. For <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> {{a little while}} ago round a corner near Victoria I {{realized}} {{for the first time that}} a familiar lamp-post was painted all over with a bright vermilion just as if it were trying (in spite of the obvious bodily disqualification) to pretend that it was a pillar-box. I have since heard official explanations of these startling and scarlet objects. But my first fancy was that some dissipated gentleman on his way home at four o'clock in the morning had attempted to paint the town red and got only as far as one lamp-post.|$|E
500|$|Gilchrist's {{actions have}} sparked debate amongst {{current and former}} players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has {{declared}} on several occasions {{that he is not}} a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a [...] "walking crusade" [...] when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: [...] "...not everyone <b>is</b> <b>walking,</b> Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had [...] "zero support in the team" [...] for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he [...] "felt isolated" [...] and [...] "silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> made to feel selfish, <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest." ...|$|R
6000|$|Addressing the House of Commons is like {{no other}} public {{speaking}} in the world. Its semi-colloquial methods give it an air of being easy, but its shifting audience, {{the comings and goings}} and hesitations of members behind the chair--not mere audience units, but men who matter--the desolating emptiness that spreads itself round the man who fails to interest, the little compact, disciplined crowd in the strangers' gallery, the light, elusive, flickering movements high up behind the grill, the wigged, attentive, weary Speaker, the table and the mace and the chapel-like Gothic background with its sombre shadows, conspire together, produce a confused, uncertain feeling in me, <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> upon a pavement full of trap-doors and patches of uncovered morass. A misplaced, well-meant [...] "Hear, Hear!" [...] is apt to be extraordinarily disconcerting, and under no other circumstances have I had to speak with quite the same sideways twist that the arrangement of the House imposes. One does not recognise one's own voice threading out into the stirring brown. Unless <b>I</b> <b>was</b> excited or speaking to the mind of some particular person in the house, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> apt to lose my feeling of an auditor. I had no sense of whither my sentences were going, such as one has with a public meeting well under one's eye. And to lose one's sense of an auditor is for a man of my temperament to lose one's sense of the immediate, and to become prolix and vague with qualifications.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I reflect, my dear cousin," [...] said she, [...] "on {{the miserable}} death of Justine Moritz, I {{no longer see}} {{the world and its}} works as they before {{appeared}} to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood. Yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had <b>been</b> her own! <b>I</b> could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she <b>was</b> innocent. <b>I</b> know, <b>I</b> feel she <b>was</b> innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> {{on the edge of a}} precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch." ...|$|R
