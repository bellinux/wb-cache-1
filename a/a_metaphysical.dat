5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical,</b> unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|Krishna-related {{literature}} {{such as the}} Bhagavata Purana accords <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> {{significance to}} the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of Krishna Lila {{is an act of}} remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of para bhakti (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche criticised all {{contemporary}} moral systems, with {{a special}} focus on Christian and Kantian ethics. He argued that all modern ethical systems share two problematic characteristics: first, they make <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> claim {{about the nature of}} humanity, which must be accepted for the system to have any normative force; and second, the system benefits the interests of certain people, often over those of others. Although Nietzsche's primary objection is not that metaphysical claims about humanity are untenable (he also objected to ethical theories that do not make such claims), his two main targets—Kantianism and Christianity—do make metaphysical claims, which therefore feature prominently in Nietzsche's criticism.|$|E

5|$|Terra, Aqua, and Ventus {{arrive at}} the Keyblade Graveyard, where Xehanort and Vanitas reveal their plan to use the χ-blade to unlock Kingdom Hearts and start a Keyblade War, an apocalyptic event that nearly {{destroyed}} {{the world in the}} past. Terra's heart is swallowed by darkness in the ensuing battle and Xehanort takes over his body, but Terra's mind remains within his discarded suit of armor, which comes to life and defeats Xehanort. Meanwhile, Ventus is forced to fuse with Vanitas to create the χ-blade. Aqua and Mickey fight with the possessed Ventus and destroy the χ-blade, while Ventus engages and defeats Vanitas in <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> battle within his own mind, losing his heart and falling into a deep sleep as a result.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} pratītyasamutpāda {{has also been}} {{compared}} to the Western philosophy of metaphysics, {{the study of the}} nature of being and ultimate reality. Schilbrack states says that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> teaching, by questioning whether there is anything at all. Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.|$|E

25|$|Necessitarianism {{is closely}} related to the causal {{determinism}} described above. It is <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> principle that denies all mere possibility; there is exactly one way for the world to be.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Occam's razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> assumption.

25|$|Beginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel {{scholarship}} {{has attempted to}} challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> system: this has also been the approach of Z.

This view, {{sometimes referred to as}} the 'non-metaphysical option', has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past 40 years.|$|E

25|$|His final {{destination}} in New England was Malden, Massachusetts {{at the home}} of Maria P. Wilson, originally of Boston, where he stayed from 23 to 29 August. In Malden he spoke to various groups - a New Thought movement, a women's suffrage group, <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> thought group, and a theosophical group. He also attended a marriage ceremony of Clarence Johnson and Ruby Breed, daughter of Alice Breed and sister to Florence Breed Khan.|$|E
25|$|Hume's {{argument}} {{is supported by}} modern day compatibilists such as R. E. Hobart, a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller. However, P. F. Strawson argued {{that the issue of}} whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the length}} of his career, there are some {{defining}} characteristics, {{such as the use of}} different registers, the literary references to several writers, and the use of a variety of themes in order to reach moral conclusions. His lyrics frequently have <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> tone and existential motifs, and are often centered around portrayals of people and events. Guccini's voice is baritonal, with a noticeable rhotacism. Most of his songs, especially early in his career, are folk rock.|$|E

25|$|Ramakrishna used rustic colloquial Bengali in his conversations. According to {{contemporary}} reports, Ramakrishna's linguistic style was unique, even {{to those who}} spoke Bengali. It contained obscure local words and idioms from village Bengali, interspersed with philosophical Sanskrit terms and references to the Vedas, Puranas, and Tantras. For that reason, according to philosopher Lex Hixon, his speeches cannot be literally translated into English or any other language. Scholar Amiya P. Sen argued that certain terms that Ramakrishna may have used only in <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> sense are being improperly invested with new, contemporaneous meanings.|$|E
25|$|The goddess Sarasvati was {{originally}} a personification of this river, but later developed an independent identity. The Nadistuti hymn in the Rigveda (10.75) mentions the Sarasvati between the Yamuna {{in the east}} and the Sutlej in the west. Later Vedic texts like the Tandya and Jaiminiya Brahmanas, as well as the Mahabharata, mention that the Sarasvati dried up in a desert. The Sarasvati is also considered by Hindus to exist in <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> form, in which it formed a confluence with the sacred rivers Ganges and Yamuna, at the Triveni Sangam. The name Sarasvati was also given to a formation in the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Although Vishnu was a Vedic solar deity, he is {{mentioned}} less often compared to Agni, Indra and other Vedic deities, thereby {{suggesting that he}} had a minor position in the Vedic religion. Other scholars state that there are other Vedic deities, such as water deity Nara (also mentioned as Narayana-Purusha in the Brahmanas layer of the Vedas), who together form the historical roots of Vaishnavism. In the late-Vedic texts (~1000 to 500 BCE), the concept of <b>a</b> <b>metaphysical</b> Brahman grows in prominence, and the Vaishnavism tradition considered Vishnu to be identical to Brahman, just like Shaivism and Shaktism consider Shiva and Devi to be Brahman respectively.|$|E
