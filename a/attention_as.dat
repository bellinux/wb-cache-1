5|$|Koufax is also {{remembered as}} one of the {{outstanding}} Jewish athletes in American sports. His decision not to pitch Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on Yom Kippur garnered national <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> an example of conflict between professional pressures and personal beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Melina and Nitro's {{association}} {{began to}} fizzle out when Melina became the WWE Women's Champion and began garnering <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> a singles performer. Melina {{was released from}} her contract in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Rubber seed oil, pressed {{from the}} seeds of the Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), has {{received}} <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> a potential use of what otherwise would be a waste product from making rubber. It has been explored as a drying oil in Nigeria, as a diesel fuel in India and as food for livestock in Cambodia and Vietnam.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of whom {{else should}} I speak?--Has {{he not been}} your shadow the whole day?--so marked in his <b>attentions,</b> <b>as</b> scarce to deem it {{necessary}} to conceal his suit?" ...|$|R
50|$|Carol Bradley is {{attractive}} but thoroughly stupid. At one point, she was Alan's girlfriend while disguised as Haley, {{but has been}} unable to attract his <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> herself. She was introduced January 20, 2003.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, the pyramid-like {{mountain}} of Rtanj, in the Serbian Carpathians, attracted much apocalyptic <b>attention,</b> <b>as</b> many believed an artificial pyramid structure buried within it would emit {{a powerful force}} shield on the day, protecting those within it. Hotels around the base received up to 500 bookings a piece for rooms.|$|E
5|$|Successive World Cup tournaments have {{generated}} increasing media <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> One-Day International cricket {{has become more}} established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa {{was the first to}} sport a mascot, Dazzler the zebra. An orange mongoose known as Mello was the mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Stumpy, a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|These oils are {{extracted}} from {{plants that are}} cultivated solely for producing oil-based biofuel. These, plus the major oils described above, have received much more <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> fuel oils than other plant oils.|$|E
60|$|Ronald having, {{as the son}} of the house, {{to divide}} his <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> much as possible, did not dance with his cousin. Lieutenant Gulston had been {{accompanied}} by the third-lieutenant, and by the doctor, who never missed an opportunity of going to a ball because, as he said, it gave him an opportunity of studying character.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{therefore}} understand that your lordship is quite serious in your proposal; {{and that it}} is not to be withdrawn, even if upon acquaintance with Miss Mowbray, you should not perhaps think her so deserving of your lordship's <b>attentions,</b> <b>as</b> report may have spoken her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Colonel!" [...] said Holmes, {{arranging}} his rumpled collar. [...] "'Journeys end in lovers' meetings,' {{as the old}} play says.

5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay <b>attention,</b> <b>as</b> secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
6000|$|... "The late {{events at}} the Hall have {{agitated}} the poor child, sir," [...] said Mrs. Dutton, {{in the way of}} apology, [...] "and she has not tasted food since morning. I have told her you would excuse the intrusion, and receive her carving and <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> an excuse for her company." ...|$|R
50|$|At a resort, bandleader Clipper Conovan can't {{hire the}} musicians, but hotel guest Toby Spencer, taking a shine to Pete, {{introduces}} {{him to her}} father Walter, who runs a pineapple plantation. Walter {{is involved in a}} business dispute with his partner, Lawton, and both men vie for Mrs. Floto's <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|R
60|$|As the Major rightly predicted, Lady Clavering {{was very}} {{grateful}} for Arthur's attention to the boy; more grateful than the lad himself, who took <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> a matter of course, and very likely had more sovereigns in his pocket than poor Pen, who generously gave him {{one of his own}} slender stock of those coins.|$|R
5|$|At the World Cup, Croatia {{were drawn}} with host-nation Brazil, Mexico and Cameroon. In the opening {{game of the}} tournament, Croatia lost 3–1 to Brazil. The match {{garnered}} heavy media <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura was scrutinized {{for a number of}} controversial decisions. In their second game, Croatia won 4–0 against Cameroon, but did not progress from the group as they lost 3–1 to Mexico in their final fixture.|$|E
5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} <b>attention.</b> <b>As</b> the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has {{the reputation of being}} a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly as much <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E
60|$|Nelly herself {{never seemed}} to be {{conscious}} of the social gulf between them. At least she never alluded to it in any way, and accepted Winslow's <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> {{if she had a}} perfect right to them. She had broken the record by staying with Mrs. Pennington four weeks, and even the cats were in subjection.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{appeal to}} you, sir,' {{proceeded}} Bella with increasing spirit, 'not to pursue me. I {{appeal to you}} not {{to take advantage of}} your position in this house to make my position in it distressing and disagreeable. I appeal to you to discontinue your habit of making your misplaced <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> plain to Mrs Boffin as to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is but {{one thing}} that I cannot {{understand}}. I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should he pay her such <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> to make her quarrel with my brother, and then fly off himself?" ...|$|R
5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in Vojvodina {{noted that there}} was a dispute between them and the {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E
5|$|Commercial solar {{water heaters}} began {{appearing}} in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of the}} oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999. Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling {{is by far the most}} widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154GW as of 2007.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS {{has had a}} {{great impact}} on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large {{economic}} impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Rebeck soon {{finds himself}} subject to another's <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> well, {{in the form}} of a widow, Mrs. Klapper, who discovers him while visiting her husband's mausoleum. The quiet {{existence}} of this unlikely quintet is diverted by philosophical conversation and the poisoning trial of Morgan's wife, word of which is regularly provided by the raven from the local newspapers.|$|R
50|$|King Electric is Chris Isepp and Peter Hartwig. They {{took their}} first musical {{attempts}} {{at the end}} of 1980s / beginning 1990s and first met each other at the upcoming and flourishing Viennese techno scene back in '92. While Hartwig was touring with the well known noise-pop band the Basket Boys, Isepp made first <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> Electro DJ & Producer.|$|R

5|$|In February 2014, it was {{announced}} that Gaga had been allowed to shoot for a musical project at Hearst Castle, located near San Simeon, California. The shooting took place from February 11–13, at locations including the 84,000 square feet area of the Castle's main terrace, the Neptune Pool and the indoor Roman Pool. The cast from Bravo channel's reality show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (RHOBH) was also seen around the shoot. The news attracted media <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> {{it was the first time}} since 1960 that a video project was shot there, the last being for Stanley Kubrick's epic film Spartacus; the Deed of gift mandate by the Hearst Corporation prohibited any commercial filming at the location.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prepared}} speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain {{and the free}} and unfree Internet. Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> {{the first time a}} senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy. In July 2010, she visited Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all the while preparing for the July 31 wedding of daughter Chelsea amid much media attention.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{are also}} used in medicine, for example fly larvae (maggots) were {{formerly}} used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene, as they would only consume dead flesh. This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Recently insects have also gained <b>attention</b> <b>as</b> potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances. Adult insects, such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds, are also commonly used as fishing bait.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dextran catches {{increasing}} <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> a {{drug carrier}} {{because of its}} biocompatibility, biodegradability and ease of modification. In this study, we synthesized the derivated dextran by grafting with 1 -(3 -aminopropyl) imidazole. The dextran-based nanoparticles with sizes of < 200 nm were successfully prepared by nanoprecipitation, and its pH-sensitivities were investigated. The samples were fully characterized by FTIR, 1 H NMR, SEM, AFM and Zetasizer...|$|R

The photo series initially had a documentary character, but got the publics <b>attentions</b> <b>as</b> well because of its artistic mélange of colorful and smokey close-ups. The 2008 jury of the Prince Claus Fund describes the photo series as intense, cru, powerful and poetic.|$|R
