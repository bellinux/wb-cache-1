2500|$|They {{construct}} their homes, or [...] "lodges", out of sticks, twigs, rocks, and mud in lakes, streams, and tidal river deltas. These lodges may {{be surrounded by}} water, or touching land, including burrows dug into river banks. Beavers are well known for building dams across streams and constructing their lodges in the artificial ponds which form. When building in a pond, the beavers first make a pile of sticks and then eat out one or more underwater entrances and two platforms above the water surface inside the pile. The first is used for drying off. Towards winter, the lodge is often plastered with mud which, when it freezes, has the consistency of concrete. A small <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> is left {{in the top of}} the lodge.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} PCF {{characteristics}} such as chromatic dispersion, effective area, confinement loss and nonlinearity for circular PCF having 5 rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> and 4 rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes.</b> Proposed structures are simulated by using Comsol multiphysics. Method used for simulation is finite element method (FEM). For both the cases of circular structures air filling fraction i. e. d/Λ= 0. 5. From the numerically simulated results it’s shown that circular PCF with 5 rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> provides large negative dispersion, which is {{of the value of}} - 150 ps/(km. nm), hence such PCF have high potential {{to be used as a}} dispersion compensating fiber in optical communication systems. Circular PCF with 5 rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> offers low confinement loss of the order of 10 - 10 dB/m. Circular PCF with 5 rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> offers low effective area. In the case of nonlinearity circular PCF with 5 rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> has a value of 38. 38 W- 1 km- 1 and that for circular PCF with 4 rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> has 14. 47 W- 1 km- 1 at 1550 nm. From the above optical properties for both the structures, it is seen that structure with 5 rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> is suitable for majority of application such as dispersion compensation fiber and supercontinuum generation. Nonlinearity can be increased by increasing the number of rings. By increasing nonlinearity value it became suitable for supercontinuum generation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We numerically {{compare the}} mode {{birefringence}} and confinement loss with four patterns (case A–D) of index-guiding photonic crystal fibers (PCF) using the finite element method. These PCFs {{are composed of}} a solid silica core surrounded by different sizes of elliptical <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> and a cladding which consist of the same elliptical <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> in fiber cladding with tetragonal lattice. The maximal modal birefringence and lowest confinement loss of our proposed case A structure at the excitation wavelength of λ = 1550 nm can be achieved at a magnitude of 5. 3 × 10 − 2 (which is the highest value to our knowledge) and less than 0. 051 dB/km (an acceptable value less than 0. 1 dB/km) with only four rings of <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> in fiber cladding, respectively. The merit of our designed PCFs is that the birefringence and confinement loss can be easily controlled by turning the pitch (hole to hole spacing) of elliptical <b>air</b> <b>holes</b> in PCF cladding...|$|R

50|$|This applies once an {{infestation}} is established. In many {{circles the}} first response to cutaneous myiasis once the breathing hole has formed, is {{to cover the}} <b>air</b> <b>hole</b> thickly with petroleum jelly.

In a clinical or veterinary setting {{there may not be}} time for such tentative approaches, and the treatment of choice might be more direct, with or without an incision. First the larva must be eliminated through pressure around the lesion and the use of forceps. Secondly the wound must be cleaned and disinfected.
