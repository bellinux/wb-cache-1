5|$|Arsenal faced {{cup holders}} Liverpool {{at home in}} the {{following}} round. A solitary goal scored by Bergkamp in the 27th minute saw the home side progress in a match layered with controversy: Martin Keown, Bergkamp and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher were all sent off in the space of ten minutes, the latter for hurling back a coin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Against Gillingham in the fifth round, Arsenal twice had their lead cancelled out, before Tony Adams scored the winning goal of the match.|$|E
5|$|By midday, {{the crowds}} {{returned}} around St. Philip Neri's Church. General George Cadwalader ordered the crowds to disperse, {{but they did}} not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence grew, and three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. In response to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon to be fired <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> on Third Street. A man named Charles Naylor begged the general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but the crowds returned, being led by an alderman and the sheriff, and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. The crowds grew, and a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people's shoulders.|$|E
5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E

25|$|On 10 April 1919, {{there was}} a protest at the {{residence}} of the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar, a city in Punjab, a large province in the northwestern part of India. The demonstration was to demand the release of two popular leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, who had been earlier arrested {{by the government and}} moved to a secret location. Both were proponents of the Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi. A military picket shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> killing several protesters and setting off a series of violent events. Later the same day, several banks and other government buildings, including the Town Hall and the railway station, were attacked and set on fire.

There was retaliatory shooting at crowds from the military several times during the day, and between eight and twenty people were killed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event, the match between The Undertaker and Roman Reigns was {{revealed}} to be a No Holds Barred match. Jim Ross returned as a guest commentator. During the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on an announce table on Reigns, who then performed a spear through another announce table. Undertaker performed a Last Ride for a near-fall. Reigns performed two Superman Punches on Undertaker, who performed a chokeslam on Reigns onto a chair for a near-fall. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Reigns for a near-fall. Reigns executed another spear but Undertaker applied Hell's Gate, with Reigns managing to escape. Reigns attacked Undertaker with a chair, and performed two spears - both scored near-falls. Undertaker attempted his signature sit-up, but suddenly collapsed. After another spear, Reigns pinned Undertaker to win the match and become the second person to defeat Undertaker at WrestleMania, after Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX. After the match, The Undertaker symbolically left his gloves, coat, and hat {{in the center of}} the ring, hinting that this was possibly his last match. In a very rare moment, Undertaker broke character and kissed his wife, Michelle McCool, who was seated in the front row. Undertaker walked to the center of the entrance ramp, looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and raised his arm as he was lowered below the stage to the sound of his music and his signature gong sounded three times as the show ended. In the arena, the main stage lighting (not the crowd's lighting) was left off for the remainder of the evening, and Undertaker's clothes were left in the ring as the production crew cleaned up, only taking his clothing articles when it was time to disassemble the ring.|$|E

500|$|Violence {{broke out}} in June 1994 when riot police used tear gas on 1,500 demonstrators who had {{organized}} a sit-in {{in front of the}} Ministry of Labor. The protesters were campaigning against the increasing rate of unemployment, which had reached 15 percent. Over the following years, many opposition leaders were arrested and others exiled. Some protesters used Molotov cocktails to attack [...] "police stations, banks and commercial properties". Riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets, some of which were fired <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> from police helicopters. It was also reported that police used live ammunition in some cases.

At the stadium, Eisenhower introduced Nixon as a [...] "colleague" [...] who had been subject to [...] "a vicious and unprincipled attack" [...] but who had [...] "vindicated himself" [...] and who [...] "stood higher than ever before". The presidential candidate finished by reading two telegrams, one from Nixon's mother assuring the general of her son's integrity, and the second from Summerfield stating that the RNC had voted unanimously to retain Nixon on the ticket. Nixon then spoke, telling the crowd that {{this was one of}} two moments when he was most proud to be an American; the other had been at the victory parade in New York in 1945, when he had seen General Eisenhower go by. He called the Wheeling rally [...] "the greatest moment of my life".|$|E

Vicki is brought to the Batcave by Bruce's butler, Alfred Pennyworth, who has been coaxing their relationship because Vicki brings out Bruce's human side. After telling her that he cannot focus on their relationship with the Joker terrorizing Gotham, Bruce departs as Batman to destroy the Axis plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the citizens of Gotham to a parade with the promise of free money, but while throwing cash <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> as promised, also attacks them with Smilex gas released from his giant parade balloons.

500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed, the crowd around Private White grew {{larger and more}} boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually {{signified}} a fire, bringing more people out. Over fifty Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White, who had taken up a somewhat safer position {{on the steps of}} the Custom House, sought assistance. Runners alerted the nearby barracks and Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch. According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White. The soldiers Preston sent were Corporal William Wemms, Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy. Accompanied by Preston, they pushed their way through the crowd. En route, Henry Knox, again trying to reduce tensions, warned Preston, [...] "For God's sake, take care of your men. If they fire, you must die." [...] Captain Preston responded [...] "I am aware of it." [...] When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets, and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston shouted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> estimated to number between three and four hundred, to disperse.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} FA Cup {{in the third}} round, {{in which they were}} drawn to play Watford of the First Division. They took the lead in the eighth minute, where good play by Kanu allowed Henry to round goalkeeper Alec Chamberlain and tap the ball into the net.

[...] Gifton Noel-Williams moments {{afterwards}} halved the lead, when Arsenal failed to deal with a corner; Noel-Williams headed the ball in from a Gary Fisken cross. After squandering numerous chances to increase their lead, Arsenal added a late third and fourth goal from Kanu and Bergkamp before Marcus Gayle scored what was a mere consolation for Watford in stoppage time. Arsenal faced cup holders Liverpool the following round, whom they lost to in the 2001 FA Cup Final. A solitary goal scored by Bergkamp in the 27th minute was enough for Arsenal to progress, in a match layered with controversy: Martin Keown, Bergkamp and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher were sent off in the space of ten minutes ‚Äì the latter footballer for hurling back a coin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Against Gillingham in the fifth round, Arsenal twice had their lead cancelled out, before Adams, making his long-awaited return, scored the match-winning goal.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a gothic cathedral setting, which was {{developed}} by Tait Towers, a production management company. They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant thurible back and forth, as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional, covered by a scrim at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra peeking out from the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008). Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> giving way to the second performance of the show, [...] "Revolver". The performance of the song at the November 19‚Äì20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E
