Averaging only 2,000 fans per game, the team sold Morenz to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to cut costs.

5|$|SM U-17 was {{constructed}} in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 21 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October.

5|$|U-17 {{primarily}} operated from Cattaro, patrolling off the Italian and Albanian coasts. The submarine {{had several}} opportunities to sink merchant ships and warships throughout the war, but sank only one Italian destroyer in July 1916 <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to disrupt the}} Otranto Barrage.

5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to establish}} a healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout the forests of Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. <b>As</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Offensive {{additions}} included halfback Ara Parseghian {{and quarterback}} George Terlep, {{but the most}} significant signing {{of the year was}} Dub Jones. Brown got Jones – who had a long and successful career in Cleveland – in a trade with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the rights to draft Bob Chappuis. Author Andy Piasick describes this trade {{as one of the most}} astute in Browns history. The Browns also signed quarterback Y. A.

5|$|The {{ruins of}} both Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> {{to destroy the}} landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried {{to blow up the}} bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker. Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.|$|E

5|$|Together {{these two}} units {{remained}} linked until 4 September 1939 when, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel William Jeater, the 2nd Battalion was once again raised as a separate unit <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> by the Australian government to hastily expand the Militia following the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, although mobilised and assigned to the 1st Brigade, the battalion did not see active service overseas and was instead used as a garrison force in Australia until 2 December 1943 when it was merged once again with the 41st Battalion, forming the 41st/2nd Battalion. They remained linked until 17 December 1945, when they were disbanded as part of the demobilisation process.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|The Allies also {{conducted}} a major air offensive against the French railway network and bridges {{over the river}} Seine from April to June.

In addition, Australians took part in 29 of the 46 raids conducted by 2TAF's light bombers against French railway infrastructure. Australian fighter pilots, including all of No.453 Squadron on occasion, escorted some of these raids and conducted ground attack sorties targeting railway rolling stock. 2TAF's fighter-bombers also attacked bridges over the river Seine from April <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to seal off the Normandy region, and Australian pilots posted to British squadrons were involved in a small number of these operations. No.453 Squadron attacked bridges and viaducts near Normandy on 27 April and 2 May.|$|E

5|$|Valerian {{made his}} game debut in Wings of Liberty, voiced by Josh Keaton.

Valerian reveals {{that he is the}} owner of the Moebius Foundation, the think tank that Raynor had been {{collecting}} the pieces of a Xel'Naga artifact for, and claimed that his mission was the same as Raynor's – to rescue Kerrigan. Taking more than half the Dominion fleet, Valerian joins forces with Raynor's Raiders and lays siege to the Zerg stronghold of Char, <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> to prove to the Dominion (and to his father) that he will be worthy to take the emperor's crown after Arcturus.
