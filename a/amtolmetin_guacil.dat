40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) usually affects certain joint groups {{selectively}} and {{the hand}} joints (HJ) are one of its classical locations. Hand OA is widespread in the population. In their practice rheumatologists encounter HJ injury in OA in 38 % of cases. It is conventional to identify three main types of hand OA. These are 1) interphalangeal OA {{that may or may}} not be accompanied by nodulation; 2) first carpometacarpal OA; and 3) erosive OA. At the same time, the rate of clinical forms ranges from 2. 0 to 6. 2 %; it is 4. 7 to 20. 4 % in the elderly. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most commonly used to relieve pain that is the main manifestation of the disease. The risk for NSAID-related adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events is substantially reduced by the drugs that exert their effects mainly on cyclooxygenase 2. These include nimesulide in particular. Undesirable GI effects may be also considerably minimized by using NSAIDs that have both their gastroprotective and antiinflammatory activities. By suppressing pain and inflammatory changes, the recently designed NSAID <b>amtolmetin</b> <b>guacil</b> simultaneously exerts a protective effect on the GI mucosa, by elevating its nitric oxide levels...|$|E
40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) are {{the main}} component of symptomatic treatment of patients with rheumatic disorders. The use of these drugs reduces the intensity of the most unpleasant symptoms and improves patients’ quality of life. Unfortunately, NSAID therapy is limited by the risk of dangerous gastric and cardiovascular complications. Researchers {{all over the world are}} involved in designing new drugs belonging to this family that would be characterized by increased safety. These drugs include coxibs (selective cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitors), combination drugs containing NSAIDs and gastroprotector agents (misoprostol, H 2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors), COX 2 /LOG 2 (lipoxygenase 2) inhibitors, and COX-inhibiting nitric oxide donors (CINODs). However, all these drugs proved to have serious drawbacks. Some of them are being actively used; launching of other drugs has been stopped at the stage of clinical trials; while the others were abandoned because of inadequate efficacy/tolerability ratio. A new representative of improved NSAIDs, <b>amtolmetin</b> <b>guacil</b> (AMG), was synthesized from tolmetin, a nonselective NSAID. As opposed to tolmetin, AMG has a number of gastroprotective properties. The most important one is that it increases NO concentration in the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmacological features of AMG are discussed; the data obtained during pre-clinical and clinical trials are reported.   </div...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the efficacy and tolerability of <b>amtolmetin</b> <b>guacil</b> (AMG; Niselat®, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, India) versus previous therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and signs of dyspepsia. Subjects and methods. The open-label observational study included 220 patients aged 30 – 65 years who suffered from knee OA and intense pain during NSAID intake and had symptoms of dyspepsia {{in the absence of}} contraindications to the use of AMG. Among the comorbidities that generally occurred in 68 % of the patients, there was a preponderance of hypertension (42 %), lower extremity varicose veins (6. 4 %), and diabetes mellitus (6 %).  Treatment efficacy was evaluated using three domains of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), by also taking into account pain intensity and general health assessment on the visual analogue scale. A Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SODA) scale was used to rate dyspepsia. Results and discussion. AMG had a marked analgesic effect confirmed by 40 % or more pain reduction that occurred in 72. 5 % of the patients. The high analgesic effect of AMG was confirmed by a statistically significant (p < 0. 001) reduction in the WOMAC index (pain and stiffness) and by an increase in functional activity. There was a significant decrease in painless and painful signs of dyspepsia, as well as positive changes in the measures “overall assessment of dyspepsia severity” (p < 0. 001) and “satisfaction with treatment”. Overall assessment of AMG tolerability was only positive: excellent (33 %), good (56 %), and satisfactory (11 %). There were no serious adverse events (AE). AE were graded as moderate and mild in 8 and 82 % of cases, respectively. AE were recorded in 7. 7 % of the patients.   Conclusion. The findings suggest that AMG offers good prospects for knee OA treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{vessel wall}} {{stiffness}} {{are a sign}} of endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling at reversible, preclinical stages and may be a marker for cardiovascular disease, including {{in the use of}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Objective: to study changes in vessel wall stiffness indicators in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) without cardiovascular diseases during short- and long-term therapy with NSAIDS. Patients and methods. The investigation enrolled 164 AS patients aged older than 18 years. Of them 60 patients took <b>amtolmetin</b> <b>guacil</b> (AMG)  daily for 3 months {{within the framework of the}} CORONA trial, the other 104 patients received nimesulide at least thrice weekly for 60 months (the index of NSAID use was 56 %) within the framework of the PROGRESS study. Vessel wall stiffness indicators (augmentation indices and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVao)) were studied in all the patients at baseline and after 3 (for those who took AMG) and 60 (for those who received nimesulde) months. Results. At baseline, AS activity and cardiovascular risk factors were comparable in the short- and long-term follow-up groups. The mean values of aortic augmentation index (AixAo) in the patients taking AMG were 13. 5 % [6. 08; 22. 08] at baseline and 14. 25 % [9. 4; 24. 25] after  3 months of therapy (p= 0. 18); PWVao was 7. 7 [6. 72; 9. 41] and 8. 46 [7. 28; 9. 96] m/sec, respectively (p= 0. 007). At the same time, PWVao was > 10 m/sec only in 6 (10 %) patients at baseline and in 12 (20 %) following 3 months. In the group of patients taking NSAIDs long, AixAo was 21. 5 % [11. 08; 34. 25] at baseline and 18. 25 % [09. 33; 26. 28] at week 12 (p= 0. 3); PWVao was as high as 7. 6 [6. 56; 7. 91] at baseline and 7. 8 [7. 22; 8. 1] m/sec at week 12 (p= 0. 12). The PWVao of > 10 m/sec was found in 20 (19. 2 %) patients at baseline and in 22 (21. 15 %) after 60 months of follow-up and treatment. The number of patients with unidirectional changes in vessel wall stiffness indicators did not differ in the 3 - and 60 -month use of NSAIDs.   Conclusion. During 3 -month NSAID therapy, the patients with AS showed a slight increase in PWVao in the absence of changes in the other indicators of vessel wall stiffness. At the same time, the mean values of PWVao remained within the normal range and its increase > 10 m/sec was detected only in 20 % of the patients. Long-term NSAID therapy in AS patients without cardiovascular diseases was unaccompanied by a change in the values of vessel wall stiffness and PWVao. </p...|$|E
