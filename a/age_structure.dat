5|$|The {{demographic}} characteristics of the population of Croatia are known through censuses, normally conducted in ten-year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29 million. The population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 78 years in 2012. The population rose steadily (with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars) from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate; the natural growth rate of the population is negative. Croatia is in the fourth or fifth stage of the demographic transition. In terms of <b>age</b> <b>structure,</b> the population is dominated by the 15‑ to 64‑year‑old segment. The median age of the population is 41.4, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{there were}} 39,566 live births in Croatia, {{comprising}} 20,374 male and 19,192 female children. Virtually {{all of those}} were performed in medical facilities; only 19 births occurred elsewhere. Out of the total number, 32,677 children were born in wedlock or within 300days {{after the end of}} the marriage, and the average age of mothers at the birth of their first child was 28.4 years. General fertility rate, i.e. number of births per 1,000 women aged 15–49 is 42.9, with the age specific rate peaking at 101.0 per million for women aged 25–29. In 2009, 52,414 persons died in Croatia, 48.5% of whom died in medical facilities and 90.0% of whom were receiving medical treatment at the time. Cardiovascular disease and cancer were the primary causes of death in the country, with 26,235 and 13,280 deaths respectively. In the same year, there were 2,986 violent deaths, including 2,121 due to accidents. The latter figure includes 616 deaths in traffic accidents. In 2014, the birth rate was 9.3 per mille, exceeded by the mortality rate of 12.0 per mille. The infant mortality rate was 5.0 per mille in 2014. In terms of <b>age</b> <b>structure,</b> the population of Croatia is dominated by the 15–64year older segment (68.1%), while the size of the population younger than 15 and older than 64 is relatively small (15.1% and 16.9% respectively). The median age of the population is 41.4. The sex ratio of the population is 1.06 males per 1 female at birth and up to 14 years of age, and 0.99 males per 1 female between the ages of 15 and 64. But at ages over 64 the ratio is 0.64 males per 1 female. The ratio for the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} problem of prolonging the life of <b>aged</b> <b>structures</b> of historical value that have already outlived their original designed lives many times. While {{a lot of research}} has been carried out in the field of structural monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics for high tech industries, {{this is not the case}} for historical <b>aged</b> <b>structures.</b> Currently most maintenance projects for <b>aged</b> <b>structures</b> have focused on the instrumentation and diagnostic techniques required to detect any damage with a certain degree of success. This research project involved the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools to be used for monitoring and predicting the ‘health’ of <b>aged</b> <b>structures.</b> The diagnostic and prognostic tools have been developed for the monitoring of Cutty Sark iron structures as a first application. The concept of canary and parrot sensor devices are developed where canary devices are small, accelerated devices, which will fail according to similar failure mechanisms occurring in an <b>aged</b> <b>structures</b> and parrot devices are designed to fail at the same rate as the structure, thus mimicking the structure. The model-driven prognostic tool uses a Physics-of-Failure (PoF) model to predict remaining life of a structure. It uses a corrosion model based on the decrease in corrosion rate over time to predict remaining life of an <b>aged</b> iron <b>structures.</b> The data-driven diagnostic tool developed uses Mahalanobis Distance analysis to detect anomalies in the behaviour of a structure. Bayesian Network models are then used as a fusion method, integrating remaining life predictions from the model-driven prognostic tool with information of possible anomalies from data-driven diagnostic tool to provide a probability distribution of predicted remaining life. The diagnostics and prognostic tools are validated and tested through demonstration example and experimental tests. This research primarily looks at applying diagnostic and prognostic technologies used in high-tech industries to <b>aged</b> iron <b>structures.</b> In order to achieve this, the model-driven and data-driven techniques commonly used had to be adapted taking into consideration the particular constraints of monitoring and maintaining <b>aged</b> <b>structures.</b> The fusion technique developed is a novel approach for prognostics for <b>aged</b> <b>structures</b> and provides the flexibility often needed for diagnostic and prognostic tools...|$|R
