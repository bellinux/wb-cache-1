5|$|Carey is a {{supporter}} of libraries, crediting them for beginning his successful comedy career. On May 2, 2000, in a celebrity edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, he selected the Ohio Library Foundation to receive his $500,000 winnings. He later {{went on to win}} an additional $32,000 on the second celebrity Millionaire, making him one of the biggest winning contestants on Millionaire who did not win the top prize. Carey also has played on the World Poker Tour in the Hollywood Home games for the Cleveland Public Library charity. In June 2007, Carey offered to donate up to $100,000 (in $10,000 increments) to the Mooch Myernick Memorial Fund if anybody could beat him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> game FIFA Soccer 07 for the Xbox 360. He dared five players from both the U.S. Men's and Women's National Teams to compete against him. Carey ended up donating $100,000, plus $60,000 for losing two games out of the six games he played.|$|E
5|$|Druckmann {{wrote the}} story {{in his spare time}} while working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> game {{developer}} Naughty Dog. He considers A Second Chance at Sarah to be a personal story, focusing on the characters instead of the supernatural elements. Druckmann worked on several unsuccessful comic book ideas and pitches, before collaborating with Wong on A Second Chance at Sarah. Wong's work on the book was extensive, as she refined and extended Druckmann's initial concepts and ideas. The two worked on the book for over a year. The book received generally positive reviews. Critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.|$|E
25|$|Nomura's father {{influenced}} {{his interest}} in art and games early on, creating little drawings and unique Sugoroku board games for him. Nomura started drawing {{at the age of}} three years and developed his own Sugoroku games during his elementary school years. As a child, he spent much of his free time playing baseball, swimming, fishing and building fortresses. When he was in middle school, his father told him that an era of computers would come and bought him his own computer. Nomura played Legends of Star Arthur: Planet Mephius on it and started creating his own video games by learning programming. He first tried a Nintendo product with the tennis and ping-pong variant of the Color TV Game console and later borrowed a Family Computer in high school. Around that time, Dragon Warrior became Nomura's favorite because it surprised him and introduced him to video games with story elements. His art teacher in high school pointed him towards the works of Final Fantasy illustrator Yoshitaka Amano. Nomura also created his own manga during class and intended to do this as a profession although he ultimately abandoned the idea. Nomura went to vocational school to learn magazine and advertising artwork. Nomura then looked for an advertising job at a publishing company. However, he eventually applied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> game company Square after he had seen a job advertisement with a drawing by Yoshitaka Amano.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's first live {{performance}} of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] {{was at the}} 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. She started the performance by descending from a flight of stairs, wearing a pin-striped suit and a monocle. Later she removed the coat to reveal her bustier, and together with her backup singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory, performed a dance routine called voguing. Ian Inglis, author of Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time noted that the historical importance of Madonna's performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Video</b> Music Awards {{was due to the}} televisual venue. Inglis explained that since Madonna's performance was striking primarily as a high-energy, provocatively choreographed, dance production number, it went on to highlight the 'TV' part of MTV, and in a way heralded her and the network as a cultural arbiter.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Spears' {{previous}} albums, Blackout was not heavily promoted through magazine interviews, talk-show appearances or televised performances {{besides the}} performance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Video</b> Music Awards {{and was not}} accompanied by a tour either. On November 27, 2007, MTV launched the contest [...] "Britney Spears Wants a Piece of You", in which fans could direct a separate video for [...] "Piece of Me", using footage of interviews and performances from Spears. Using the MTV Video Remixer, fans could mix and create a mashup of the footage. The winning video premiered on TRL on December 20, 2007, and MTV, Jive Records and Spears herself picked the winner. The winner also received a Haier Ibiza Rhapsody device along with a one-year subscription to Rhapsody, as well as Spears' entire discography released in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Julie Andsager in Sex in Consumer Culture (2006) {{said that}} the music videos from In the Zone {{presented}} a different Spears, and that although the album was intended to target the gay market, the videos were clearly designed for heterosexual men. Andsager suggested that Spears took cues more directly from sexual fantasies, and {{that the use of}} sanitized images of attractive young women posed in sexual ways (lesbian chic) serves two audiences: primarily, it sought to fulfill heterosexual fantasies, but as a secondary function, it may also serve young women as a source of instruction in attracting males. From a marketing perspective, the fantasy-fulfillment purpose of the album was apparent not only on the videos, but also in the kiss between Spears at Madonna <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Video</b> Music Awards. Finally, Andsager explained that [...] " [...] has, perhaps, taken her sexuality to its extreme—for network television, at least—at the age of 22".|$|E

500|$|On September 2, 1993, Madonna {{opened the}} 1993 MTV Video Music Awards {{performing}} [...] "Bye Bye Baby". She cavorted {{on stage with}} three scantily clad women in a brothel-style setting, dressed in tuxedos and top hats, in a choreographed, highly sexual routine. According to choreographer Alex Magno, {{he wanted to do}} [...] "Justify My Love" [...] or [...] "The Beast Within" [...] on MTV, but Madonna decided that they might be too controversial for live television and abandoned the idea. Nevertheless, [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] was chosen and performed with the choreography they had been practicing for The Girlie Show World Tour, since it represented the whole idea behind the tour. Louis Virtel from The Backlot ranked the performance at number eight on a list for [...] "Madonna's 11 Greatest VMA Moments". He praised Madonna's rendition of the song <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Video</b> Music Awards, calling it [...] "a hell of a VMA performance" [...] and a [...] "killer cinematic throwback".|$|E
500|$|Jim Glauner from MTV News {{commented that}} from the first scene from the video, the viewer discovers {{that this is not}} [...] "Holiday" [...] (1983). Matthias Groß of Madonna On the Couch: A psychoanalytic view on Madonna's music videos, argumented that it is {{interesting}} to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> as a dream, and noted that in the video, Madonna was presented as a witch or an uncanny creature, by the technique of the central perspective. He concluded that the viewers find themselves in control of their view, of the situation in general, and are conveyed the impression to follow a realistic depiction of a mere melancholic woman in the desert, according to him. Henry Keazor and Thorsten Wübbena of Rewind, Play, Fast Forward: The Past, Present and Future of the Music Video said that the large panels of cloth that gather and wind around Madonna gain an even more obvious independent movement quality. Billboard considered it Madonna's third best video noting that it [...] "conveys the song's bleak heartbreak perfectly" [...] with Madonna's persona in the video.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} 1980s B studios was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, Troma Pictures, founded in 1974. Troma's most characteristic productions, including Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986), Redneck Zombies (1986), and Surf Nazis Must Die (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma's best-known production is The Toxic Avenger (1985); its hideous hero, affectionately known as Toxie, was featured in several sequels and a TV cartoon series. One of the few successful B studio startups of the decade was Rome-based Empire Pictures, whose first production, Ghoulies, reached theaters in 1985. The video rental market was becoming central to B film economics: Empire's financial model relied on seeing a profit not from theatrical rentals, but only later, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> store. A number of Concorde–New Horizon releases went this route as well, appearing only briefly in theaters, if at all. The growth of the cable television industry also helped support the low-budget film industry, as many B movies quickly wound up as [...] "filler" [...] material for 24-hour cable channels or were made expressly for that purpose.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Ology (website)'s Josh Harrison gave it an {{eight out of}} ten rating, writing that [...] "You gotta love these Simpsons episodes that really get {{into the heart of}} a subculture. Diving head-first into the world of foodies and food blogging (after a hilarious geeky pit-stop at a video game expo), 'The Food Wife' shish-kabobs gourmet diehards while highlighting a very real problem between Homer and Marge." [...] He concluded that the episode is [...] "a definite swing for the fences, and I think it hits its mark completely." [...] The scenes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> game convention were praised by Anthony Severino of Game Revolution as well. He commented that the writers [...] "nailed it. Everything from the massive displays, long lines, and even the look of the Los Angeles Convention Center was spot on. The best was how they portrayed people with 'VIP passes', you know those things that we journalists get, as douches who think they're better than the regulars." ...|$|E
500|$|The pair put {{the prostitute}} in Archer's trunk and drive off, hoping {{to dispose of}} the body in an {{undisclosed}} location. On the way, however, Archer reveals he is aware of Malory's plan and has been attempting to discourage Cyril from becoming a field agent, presumably due to his own feelings for Lana, and had orchestrated the whole fiasco to this end (revealing the prostitute was merely tranquilized). At this point, the car is rammed by a pursuing vehicle. [...] Cyril believes this is part of Archer's hoax, until their pursuer opens fire on them. In a true show of his character, Archer threatens to eject from the car and leave the hysterical Cyril behind. Their mystery attacker then ceases fire and reveals herself to be Lana, who has discovered Archer's assignment and decided {{to put a stop to}} it. Despite Cyril's concern about being caught with a dead hooker, Lana reveals she is only upset he felt the need to keep secrets from her, so she punishes Cyril by forcing him to buy interracial pornography from [...] "the sweet old Korean lady" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> store. Archer releases the prostitute in the trunk after Cyril and Lana depart, who reveals she was not in on the plan. Archer is forced to not only pay her obscene amounts of money as collateral, but also give her his car, leaving him stranded.|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of [...] "The Food Wife", HitFix's Alan Sepinwall commended it for [...] "stay true to the characters. Of course the kids would {{consider}} Homer to be the fun dad on those occasions when he's actually making an effort, and of course Marge would feel jealous of this. And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best thing about this episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. It sticks to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been overdone everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mixed to negative reviews from critics. Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "The {{moral of the}} story is, if you’re going to build an entire video around a stripper pole, then you better work said pole like a nine-to-five. Drop it like it’s hot. [...] Alas, in the case of [...] "Gimme More," [...] I’ve seen sexier pole work during an afternoon of fly-fishing". Andrei Harmsworth of Metro commented [...] "To her credit, the video is slightly less disappointing than her mimed performance of the track <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Video</b> Music Awards last month but it is still smeared with the same smutty hallmarks". Dose said the video [...] "sucks less than you think" [...] and added [...] "Spears appears lucid, sometimes happy, and awards-worthy editing makes her appear to be standing upright competently throughout". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said the lightning effects and digital body enhancement of the video [...] "indicate a predilection toward maintaining an image that no longer reflects reality. It doesn't point to an artist who refuses to evolve, but rather one who doesn't know how—or isn't being allowed to." [...] IGN writer Sketch Longwood called it one of Spears' hottest videos, adding that she [...] "proves to be quite skilled in the art of teasingly slinking around." [...] While reviewing the alternate version of the video in July 2011, Becky Bain of Idolator stated that [...] "Spears's last few videos — particularly the joyfully silly clip for 'I Wanna Go' — more than make up for the travesty that was the pop star's video for 'Gimme More' [...] The stripper concept was a poor choice, the barely-there outfits were ill-fitting, the 'choreography' was a joke, the editing was sloppy." ...|$|E
