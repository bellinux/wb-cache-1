5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> in Scotland, {{from the late}} fifteenth century {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century. It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Age {{coincided with}} the rise of pop art, an <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> that used popular {{cultural}} artifacts, such as advertising and packaging, as source material for fine, or gallery-exhibited, art. Roy Lichtenstein, one of the best-known pop art painters, specifically chose individual panels from comic books and repainted the images, modifying them to some extent in the process but including in the painting word and thought balloons and captions as well as enlarged-to-scale color dots imitating the coloring process then used in newsprint comic books. An exhibition of comic strip art was held at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs of the Palais de Louvre in 1967, and books were soon published that contained serious discussions of the art of comics {{and the nature of the}} medium.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} Lissitzky also {{developed}} {{his career as}} a graphic designer with some historically important works such as the books Dlia Golossa (For the Voice), a collection of poems from Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Die Kunstismen (The Artisms) together with Jean Arp. In Berlin he also met and befriended many other artists, most notably Kurt Schwitters, László Moholy-Nagy, and Theo van Doesburg. Together with Schwitters and van Doesburg, Lissitzky presented the idea of an international <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> under the guidelines of constructivism while also working with Kurt Schwitters on the issue Nasci (Nature) of the periodical Merz, and continuing to illustrate children's books. The year after the publication of his first Proun series in Moscow in 1921, Schwitters introduced Lissitzky to the Hanover gallery kestnergesellschaft, where he held his first solo exhibition. The second Proun series, printed in Hanover in 1923, was a success, utilizing new printing techniques. Later on, he met Sophie Kuppers, who was the widow of Paul Kuppers, an art director of the kestnergesellschaft at which Lissitzky was showing, and whom he would marry in 1927.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance is {{a concept}} {{formulated}} by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} to describe the intellectual and <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive the principles of the Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early seventeenth century, when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 {{to the end of the}} seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetics}} of film noir {{are influenced by}} German Expressionism, an <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> of the 1910s and 1920s that involved theater, photography, painting, sculpture and architecture, as well as cinema. The opportunities offered by the booming Hollywood film industry and then the threat of Nazism, led to the emigration of many film artists working in Germany who {{had been involved in}} the Expressionist movement or studied with its practitioners. M (Fritz Lang 1931), shot only a few years before his departure from Germany, is among the first crime films of the sound era to join a characteristically noirish visual style with a noir-type plot, in which the protagonist is a criminal (as are his most successful pursuers). Directors such as Lang, Robert Siodmak and Michael Curtiz brought a dramatically shadowed lighting style and a psychologically expressive approach to visual composition (mise-en-scène), with them to Hollywood, where they made some of the most famous classic noirs.|$|E

25|$|Russian {{symbolism}} was {{an intellectual}} and <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> predominant {{at the end}} of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century.

25|$|Social Realism is an <b>artistic</b> <b>movement,</b> {{expressed}} in the visual and other realist arts, which depicts working class activities as heroic. Many artists who subscribed to Social Realism were painters with socialist political views. The movement therefore has some commonalities with the Socialist Realism used in certain Communist nations.|$|E
50|$|Galenson's {{distinction}} between conceptual and experimental {{is based upon}} evidence from the age in which artists were most productive creatively. However, other studies have challenged that the underlying cause is not age, but are due to <b>artistic</b> <b>movements</b> which occur in certain periods. Artists in <b>artistic</b> <b>movements</b> tend to be creative regardless of their age. Thus, Galenson's theory {{has been criticized for}} overemphasizing the individual and overlooking the collective aspects in supporting creativity.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> {{generated in}} Latin America is muralism represented by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco and Rufino Tamayo in Mexico, Santiago Martinez Delgado and Pedro Nel Gómez in Colombia and Antonio Berni in Argentina.

25|$|The {{strength}} of this <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico’s identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having {{an effect on the}} global stage.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese Renaissance {{refers to}} the {{cultural}} and <b>artistic</b> <b>movement</b> in Portugal during the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. Though the movement coincided with the Spanish and Italian Renaissances, the Portuguese Renaissance was largely separate from other European Renaissances and instead was incredibly important in opening Europe to the unknown and bringing a more worldly view to those European Renaissances, as {{at the time the}} Portuguese Empire spanned the globe.|$|E
25|$|The {{public is}} {{outraged by the}} {{apparent}} obscurity of the subject matter, and the predominance of the elementary geometrical shapes, which give rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although the term 'cube' has been used before {{with respect to the}} works of Metzinger (1906), Delaunay and Metzinger (1907), and Georges Braque (1908), {{this is the first time}} the word 'Cubism' is used. The designation becomes widespread as an <b>artistic</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

25|$|Throughout his life, Jensen met and {{collaborated with}} many already or {{subsequently}} influential artists, most notably Mark Rothko, Sam Francis, Jean Dubuffet, Joan Miró, and Allan Kaprow, and held exhibitions with contemporaries including Ulfert Wilke, Robert Becker, Sally Hazelet, Franz Kline, Joseph Cornell, Willem de Kooning and Robert Rauschenberg.

25|$|When {{it became}} clear that {{independence}} would not be possible, Albert and Isabella's goal became the reincorporation of the Southern Provinces into the Spanish monarchy.

Thus Isabella and her husband stimulated the growth of this <b>artistic</b> <b>movement,</b> which resulted in the creation of the Flemish Baroque painting.|$|E
