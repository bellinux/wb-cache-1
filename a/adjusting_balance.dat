The traditional theory of the balance of payments adjustment process through exchange rate changes is used for this purpose. We found evidence, first, about the doubtful effectiveness of this policy due to the marginal verification of the critical elasticities condition; second, about the success of the exchange rate policy in the short-run, since the monthly data of bilateral exchange rates (USD, DEM, ITL, FRF, GBP, JPY) of the Hellenic Drachma (GRD) Granger cause the respective trade balances; third, about the significant co-movement in the series which in the long-run, are driven by the same stochastic trend. We are much aware of the tentative nature of these conclusions. However, our findings suggest that the loss of the exchange rate policy was costly in the case of Hellas because an efficient policy sacrificed by the BoG to the European Central Bank (ECB).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit {{one of the}} “missing links” between budget {{balances}} and the economic cycle, namely the impact of asset prices on fiscal revenues. We estimate revenue elasticities with respect to equity and real estate price indices for 16 OECD countries, {{as well as for}} a synthetic euro area aggregate. For a sub-sample of euro area countries, we use these elasticities to investigate the impact of asset prices on budget balances and the assessment of the fiscal stance by adjusting existing estimates of cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balances</b> for the asset price “cycle”. The results support the view that asset price movements are a major factor behind unexplained changes in the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance,</b> which, if not accounted for, can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding underlying fiscal developments.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years {{there has been}} an intense {{discussion}} whether the actual behaviour of fiscal authorities is consistent with cyclical stabilization objectives. The question of the appropriate fiscal policy is gaining recognition especially for the countries of the euro area after entering the European Monetary Union (EMU). Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the activity of the fiscal policy before and after the entrance to the euro zone for each individual EMU country in 1995 – 2010 period. For this purpose we will use the cyclical <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance,</b> which is the common tool used to estimate fiscal policy stance. The analysis of the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> gives an additional insight into the former activity arrangements of the fiscal policy, which contributes to gauge the ex-post estimation of the fiscal policy. On this base we can determine the causes of general government budgets imbalance in the past. Despite this fact, we should be aware of some caveats in the assessment of cyclical <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance,</b> which appear due the inconsistency in measurement of output gap and potential GDP growth. To evaluate pro-cyclical or countercyclical fiscal policy stance we compare the dynamic evaluation of the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> and output gap. Namely, changes of the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> in consecutive years indicate the orientation of fiscal policy, i. e. the fiscal impulse. By comparing the change in the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance</b> and output gap between individual years, which indicates fluctuations in the economic cycle, it is possible to assess the orientation of fiscal policy, i. e. the fiscal position. The fiscal policy can be considered as countercyclical if it is expansive in the situation of negative output gap and restrictive in the situation, when the actual growth of GDP is above its potential rate. On the other hand, fiscal policy is characterized to be pro-cyclical if in the situation of negative output gap the government uses restrictive fiscal instruments and when the fiscal policy reacts expansionary in the situation of positive output gap, where the actual output exceeds the estimated potential GDP. In the empirical analysis we evaluate the fiscal policy stance for each country of the euro area. In the assessment of government behaviour we cover 14 countries in the 1995 – 2010 period. The results of the analysis generally confirm that the fiscal policy in most euro-area member states became more expansionary in the period after entering the EMU. Moreover, these preliminary findings were partly confirmed by a statistical analysis which shows statistically significant differences in expansionary fiscal policy between the aforementioned sub-periods. In addition, we might also conclude the average fiscal stance is expansionary when actual output is above its potential level, which implies a pro-cyclical bias in times of prosperity, and that the fiscal stance tends to be predominantly counter-cyclical when actual output is below its potential level. These conclusions can be associated with asymmetric fiscal behaviour after entering the euro area because the response of fiscal authorities to cyclical conditions in the economy depends on whether good or bad times are prevailing. These assertions reflect some conclusions made in other similar studies. ...|$|R

40|$|Cyclically <b>adjusted</b> {{government}} budget <b>balances</b> {{have become}} increasingly popular {{as a means of}} analysing the fiscal situation and changes in policy that result from the intentional actions of the government. As the actual budget balances are affected both by cyclical factors ('automatic stabilisers') and structural ('discretionary') measures, they may not, in general, be very useful when seeking to assess the orientation of underlying fiscal policy and possible structural imbalances in the budget balance. The problem however {{is that there is no}} generally accepted method of calculating cyclically <b>adjusted</b> (structural) budget <b>balances.</b> The results tend to be fairly noisy and sensitive to the method of calculation. The purpose of this article is to highlight these issues by reviewing three estimation methods used by the Bank of Finland - GDP smoothing based on the Hodrick-Prescott trend estimation method, the production function approach and Blanchard's method - and the corresponding estimates of the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> budget <b>balances</b> for Finland. fiscal policy; cyclically <b>adjusted</b> budget <b>balance...</b>|$|R

Antalet studier som behandlar anpassning av balanserat styrkort till offentlig verksamhet är begränsat vilket leder till att studien syftar till att belysa hur balanserat styrkort anpassas till svensk offentlig verksamhet. Metod: Studien tillämpar en abduktiv kvalitativ ansats med datainsamling i form av semistrukturerade intervjuer. Bearbetning av data och teori följer tematisk analys. Studien genomsyras av den tolkande hermeneutiska traditionen. Resultat & slutsats: Studien tolkar att offentlig verksamhet tillämpar anpassade balanserade styrkort där ingen uppnår samtliga kriterier för balanserat styrkort. Studien tolkar vidare att nyttan med anpassat balanserat styrkort uttrycks i form av enkelhet och enhetlighet vilket skapas genom att syftet med anpassat balanserat styrkort är detsamma som inom traditionellt balanserat styrkort. Anpassning av perspektiv uttrycks genom att lärande- och tillväxtperspektivet exkluderas till förmån för medarbetarperspektivet. Förslag till vidare forskning: Studien föreslår vidare forskning vad gäller strategikartans roll efter strategiutveckling, kausalitet när ett annat perspektiv än det finansiella placeras högst upp i hierarkin, lärande- och tillväxtperspektivets exkluderande till förmån för medarbetarperspektivet samt valet att avveckla balanserat styrkort inom offentlig verksamhet.

Method: The study applies an abductive qualitative research method with semistructured interviews as data gathering tool. The processing of data and theory follow thematic analysis. The study permeates the interpretive hermeneutic tradition. Result & conclusion: The study interprets that public sector organisations apply <b>adjusted</b> <b>balanced</b> scorecard where none acquire all criteria of the balanced scorecard. The study also interprets that the benefits of <b>adjusted</b> <b>balanced</b> scorecard are simplicity and uniformity. The benefits are accomplished through the purpose of implementing <b>adjusted</b> <b>balanced</b> scorecard, which is the same purpose as for traditional balanced scorecard.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy with respect to output gap fluctuations in the Republic of Macedonia during the period 1991 - 2009. We use two different fiscal policy measures: 1) the cyclically unadjusted primary budget balance and 2) the cyclically <b>adjusted</b> primary budget <b>balance</b> as a proxy indicator of the fiscal policy stance. This analysis also aims to explore whether there was a substantial change in the fiscal policy behavior prior to 1996 due to the turbulent initial period of transition and the switch in monetary policy strategy. We additionally control for other factors that also seem to have had a significant impact over the fiscal policy behavior, such as the armed conflict in 2001 and the impact of public debt as a proxy indicator of budget financing constraints. The estimated results with respect to both measures, the cyclically unadjusted and cyclically <b>adjusted</b> budget <b>balance,</b> indicate differences in the fiscal policy behavior prior to and after 1996. More precisely, the results imply that the fiscal policy behavior prior to 1996 was procyclical, whereas afterwards the fiscal policy became countercyclical. These results are robust to different measures of the output gap and different frequency of the data sets. fiscal policy, cyclically <b>adjusted</b> <b>balance,</b> output gap, monetary policy change...|$|R
