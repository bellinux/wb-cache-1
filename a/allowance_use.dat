The {{purpose of this study}} is to use semi-structured interviews to get an understanding of how the discretion is used within the municipality and social insurance and how the cooperation look like between these agencies, in the investigation process of applications for compensation of personal assistance. The questions that this study aims to answer are: -          How is the discretion used in the municipality and social insurance?  -          How does the cooperation look like between the municipality and social insurance?    The results of the study indicate that the manoeuvre is separated between the municipal and social insurance, as the two authorities are organized in different ways. The municipality of work on the basis of a self-rule while the social insurance agency is more centrally controlled.   The definition of the concept of the discretion is equally within the two authorities but the application of the term is used in different ways.   The study's results show that cooperation between the two authorities is limited, and they thus not have clear goals to work from. Furthermore, the result show that officer in the municipality produced more flexibility in their work than what the insurance officer has, which is due to the social insurance agency has increasingly guidelines to relate to.   The study is completed through a discussion that lifts our thoughts and opinions about the results yielded by the gathered empirical evidence...|$|E

40|$|Social Security is {{the main}} {{instrument}} of social policy that serves to balance social inequalities and helps address adverse social situations. This thesis provides a basic overview of individual retirement and sickness insurance allowances, state social support benefits, social care, poverty relief allowances and the offer of social services. The thesis also deals with the Medical Assessment Service and the health assessment of persons for purposes of individual social security systems. The main {{attention is paid to}} the care allowance, the benefit addressed to persons who are, mainly due to poor health status, dependent on the assistance of another person in regular daily self-care and self-sufficiency. The research is focused on care allowance recipients who live in homes for the elderly, in nursing homes and in their own households with their families or separately. The objective of this thesis is to survey the provision of social security allowances, activities of the Medical Assessment Service and the issues of the health assessment process {{for the purposes of the}} care allowance entitlement. Another objection is to determine the quality of life of people receiving the care allowance. A part of the thesis is a questionnaire by which the course of the care allowance entitlement was assessed, the reasons for applying for the care allowance and the manner of the care <b>allowance</b> <b>use</b> are described, and the health status assessment of respondents and quality of their lives were determined. The information obtained from the questionnaires was evaluated and recorded in graphs. It was found that 93. 6 % of respondents use the care allowance for payments for care services, personal assistance or to pay the rent and services in senior homes, i. e. payments of services related to the security assistance and support to the allowance receiver. The first hypothesis, assuming that the care allowance is mainly used to cover expenses related to the security assistance and support to the allowance receiver, was confirmed. It was also found that, with the exception of respondents living in nursing homes, the respondents´ quality of life did not change when they were drawing the allowance. The second hypothesis, assuming that the care allowance improved the respondents´ quality of life, was not confirmed. The considered replacing the current 36 self-care and self-sufficiency operations with 10 areas of basic needs of life might be a simplification and an increase in effectiveness of the health condition assessment for the purpose of the care allowance admission...|$|E
40|$|Since January 1, 2007 a {{new social}} {{security}} benefit has been provided: Care Allowance. This benefit is regulated by Act No. 108 of 2006, about social services. The Act defines conditions of help and benefit distribution to people, dependent on other person's help, who got into a difficult social situation. I have chosen the topic, regarding Care Allowance, {{on the basis of}} my professional experience in this issue. The aim of this thesis was to survey opinions of Care Allowance beneficiaries (families with a disabled child), regarding office workers' work before and after social reform and find out the impact of the reform on beneficiaries. The theoretical part contains a short reference to the situation before passing the Law of Social Services, a short introduction of the Law of Social Services (effective from January 1, 2007) and social reform. Next part of the thesis describes Care Allowance after social reform, thus after January 1, 2012. It specifically contains: Care Allowance impact on social services sphere, claim conditions, extend of dependance, benefit amount and its payment, Care Allowance proceedings, terms of authorities, Care <b>Allowance</b> <b>use</b> and duties resulting from the law. The thesis describes in detail a social worker, his or her role and authority. A term "handicap" was defined in the conclusion of the theorethical part. The practical part of the bachelor's thesis elicits communication partners' opinions on office workers' work. The research question was: How do Care Allowance beneficiaries (families with a disabled child) evaluate office workers' work before and after social reform? On the basis of the research question, I set four questions and worked with them during the research. The research sample consisted of twelve families with a disabled child, who were chosen {{on the basis of their}} free decision. These families were Care Allowance beneficiaries before and after social reform, which is essential here. The research was carried out by means of quantitative survey, an inquiry method and a method of semi-structured dialogue with the parent with a disabled child, who draws Care Allowance. According to the facts elicited from the communication partners, social reform is perceived rather negatively than positively. There is a significant difference between work of social workers of municipal authorities in Dačice and work of social workers of employment office in Dačice. Communication partners see differences in helpfulness, satisfaction, knowledge and workers' experience. Employment office workers are evaluated by communication partners very negatively, on the contrary municipal authorities workers' work is evaluated absolutely positively. Communication partners mention another serious problem, which is misfunction of Care Allowance payment, the benefit is paid out late, up to one month later. In the conclusion of the thesis, I suggest solving to the problematic situation, that was revealed in the research...|$|E

40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on whether a publicly funded medical savings account (MSA) program can generate net savings for government. We develop an analytical framework and demonstrate that the savings/cost implications of such a program depend critically on six factors: the size distribution of health-care expenditures, the MSA incentive effect, health-care expenditure expectations and whether they are fixed or flexible, the random incidence of illness, and optimally differentiated MSA <b>allowances.</b> <b>Using</b> the 1999 size distribution of health-care expenditures for the 45 ­ 64 year-old Manitoba population, we show that MSA allowances save the government $ 42 per capita under the most favourable assumptions, but that, under more realistic assumptions, they are consistently more costly than medicare. ...|$|R

We employ results from filtering theory to derive the spot prices of permits and suggest hedging formulas using a local risk minimisation approach.
