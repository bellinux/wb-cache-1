5|$|Agreements between Norwegian and Russian {{authorities}} {{were made on}} 31 August, where Norway resumed full responsibility for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, the crew was allowed to fly in <b>and</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning.

5|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, many Tutsi left Rwanda to escape Hutu purges. The exodus, which began during the November 1959 arson attacks, continued steadily throughout {{the revolution}}. An official, late-1964 total of 336,000 Tutsi settled {{primarily in the}} four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Congo-Léopoldville. The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power <b>and</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> socialist republic.|$|E

5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered.

5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is very cautious and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black mutagen, tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films <b>and</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with an elongated cranium under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms and sharp teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E

5|$|In this, the milieu is {{interested}} in developing unified world views to discover {{the nature of the}} divine <b>and</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement—most notably Fritjof Capra in his The Tao of Physics (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council {{voted to}} send {{assistance}} to the collapsing country and U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered ground troops to the country. U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing {{since the end of}} World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was the closest to the warzone. Under the command of Major General William F. Dean, the division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. In spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth United States Army could arrive <b>and</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> defense.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1943, Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allied powers. Hoping to occupy {{as much of the}} country as possible before the German Army could react, the U.S. Fifth Army prepared to attack Salerno. On 10 September, elements of the division conducted its second landing at Agropoli and Paestum with the 36th Infantry Division, on the southernmost beaches of the attack. Opposing them were elements of the German 29th Panzergrenadier Division and XVI Panzer Corps. Against stiff resistance, the 45th pushed to the Calore River after a week of heavy fighting. The Fifth Army was battered and pushed back by German forces until 20 September, when Allied forces were finally able to break out <b>and</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> more secure beachhead.|$|E
5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme <b>and</b> <b>establish</b> <b>a</b> more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could {{spend most of their}} time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} became {{worse for}} Byzantium {{during the civil}} wars after Andronikos III died.

In 1354, an earthquake at Gallipoli devastated the fort, allowing the Ottomans (who were hired as mercenaries {{during the civil war}} by John VI Kantakouzenos) to establish themselves in Europe. By the time the Byzantine civil wars had ended, the Ottomans had defeated the Serbians and subjugated them as vassals.
