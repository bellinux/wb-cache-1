5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ugly)</b> were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E

25|$|The Good, the Bad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ugly</b> was {{marketed as}} {{the third and final}} {{installment}} in the Dollars Trilogy, following A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years.

25|$|Leone, Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni worked {{together}} on the film’s screenplay {{for three to four}} weeks, discussing characters and scenes for the film. Donati, who had previously acted as an uncredited script doctor for The Good, the Bad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ugly,</b> conceived Juan Miranda’s character as an extension of Tuco from The Good, the Bad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ugly.</b> Meanwhile, Leone was largely responsible for the character of John Mallory, and the film’s focus on the development of John and Juan’s friendship. At times, however, Leone, Donati, and Vincenzoni found that they had highly differing opinions about how the film should be made, with Leone wanting to have the film produced on a large scale with an epic quality, while Donati and Vincenzoni perceived the film as a low-budget thriller.|$|E

25|$|The film's working {{title was}} I due magnifici straccioni (The Two Magnificent Tramps).

In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, River of Dollars, or The Man With No Name, but decided on The Good, the Bad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ugly.</b>|$|E

She was purified from this action by Priam, and in exchange she fought for him and killed many, including Machaon (according to Pausanias, Machaon was killed by Eurypylus), and according to another version, Achilles himself, who was resurrected {{at the request of}} Thetis. Penthesilia was then killed by Achilles who {{fell in love with her}} beauty after her death.

25|$|After {{another very}} long time, the {{mushrooms}} {{also began to}} be exhausted, replaced by cassava or turnip-like plants.

25|$|The Good, the Bad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ugly</b> is {{the last}} film in the Dollars Trilogy, and thus {{does not have an}} {{official}} sequel. Following the film's release, Leone went on to direct two more Westerns (Once Upon a Time in the West and Duck, You Sucker!) and was involved in the production of other Spaghetti Westerns (My Name is Nobody and A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe), but none of these bore direct relations with his previous films.|$|E

Morricone's score became a major success and sold over three million copies worldwide.

25|$|Although never {{a leading}} actor, {{he made a}} number of small {{appearances}} as character actors alongside Italy's leading film stars in films throughout the early to mid-1960s and is arguably best known in world cinema for his role as the store keeper in the Sergio Leone classic Spaghetti Western film The Good, the Bad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ugly</b> in 1966. His roles ranged from storekeepers and cobblers to priests and homeless men. His role of most esteem, however, is perhaps as Napoleon in Sergio Corbucci's comedy Chi si ferma è perduto in 1963.|$|E
3000|$|Picture  8 {{represents}} {{a situation in}} which the student realized that her experiment turned ugly instead of beautiful. The experiment helped her to distance herself from life’s difficulties and to take a bystander’s point of view.

Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> opened up <b>the</b> opportunity to consider things from the perspective of the future. In particular, picture  9 crystallized the need to identify future images based on common expectations, hopes <b>and</b> fears. <b>The</b> <b>ugly</b> served as a tool for students to explore their own hopes <b>and</b> fears for <b>the</b> future <b>and</b> learn to work creatively with them.
