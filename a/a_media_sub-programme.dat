40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} access {{networks}} for proper support of multimedia applications {{requires an understanding}} of how the conditions of the underlying network (packet loss and delays, for instance) affect the performance of <b>a</b> <b>media</b> stream. In particular, network congestion can affect the user-perceived quality of <b>a</b> <b>media</b> stream. By choosing metrics that indicate and/or predict the quality ranking that a user would assign to <b>a</b> <b>media</b> stream, we can deduce the performance of <b>a</b> <b>media</b> stream without polling users directly. We describe a measurement mechanism utilizing objective measurements taken from <b>a</b> <b>media</b> player application that strongly correlate with user rankings of stream quality. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of the chosen metrics as predictors or indicators of user quality rankings, and suggest a new mechanism for evaluating the present and future quality of <b>a</b> <b>media</b> stream.
