5|$|A balustrade, {{punctuated by}} sculptures atop the giant pilasters, capped the composition, {{one of the}} most {{influential}} of Michelangelo's designs. The two massive ancient statues of Castor and Pollux that decorate the balustrades <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as those posed by Michelangelo, which now are in front of the Palazzo del Quirinale.|$|E
5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Servodrive subwoofers {{whose primary}} mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination {{in favor of}} a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing as directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E

50|$|A {{newspaper}} sub-editor who {{was accustomed}} to replacing game with match to avoid repetition may make an error with tennis, where a game <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as a match. Similarly, in cricket a draw (game ran out of time) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as a tie (game finished with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of runs for each side).|$|R

5|$|The four {{denominations}} in {{this series}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> by dimensions as the $25 billion note used different paper from the 500 ZWD banknote of 2001. The $100 billion ($1011) Agro Cheque was {{the largest of the}} second dollar, sharing the record for the most number of zeroes depicted on a banknote with the Yugoslav 500 billion ($5×1011) dinar note of 1993, up until January 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{travel times}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> {{which should be}} {{indicated}} by an interference shift. However, if Fresnel's dragging coefficient {{is applied to the}} water in the aether frame, the travel time difference (to first order in v/c) vanishes. Using different setups Hoek actually obtained a null result, confirming Fresnel's dragging coefficient. (For a similar experiment refuting the possibility of shielding the aether wind, see Hammar experiment).|$|E
5|$|While Voyager 1 is {{commonly}} spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, the two <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> The Solar System is usually {{defined as the}} vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun. The craft is presently less than one seventh {{the distance to the}} aphelion of Sedna, and it has not yet entered the Oort cloud, the source region of long-period comets, regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Food {{security}} and food power <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing. However, {{they are often}} directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away {{in order to get}} something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mixs secret ending {{features}} a character named Ventus who bears a strong {{striking resemblance to}} him. Nomura commented that, despite their similarities, Roxas and Ventus <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> character. He also said that when playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players {{will be able to}} distinguish Roxas from Ventus. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such a connection. For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time. Nomura says this will be {{explained by the fact that}} the character Xehanort whose Heartless and Nobody, Ansem and Xemnas, exist at the same time as the original one.|$|E
5|$|Nomura commented that, despite how similar they are, Roxas and Ventus <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> character. Additionally, {{he stated}} that by playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, players {{will be able to}} {{distinguish}} Roxas from Ventus and that the game explores his true personality. In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection. The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus' heart entered Sora's body and Roxas' birth allowed Ventus to influence his appearance. In early versions of development, Nomura planned to have Ventus' broken heart be healed by the heart of Sora before he was born, but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers it was abandoned. Like Roxas, Ventus has been voiced Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English.|$|E
50|$|Hardware {{virtualization}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as hardware emulation. In hardware emulation, a {{piece of}} hardware imitates another, while in hardware virtualization, a hypervisor ({{a piece of}} software) imitates a particular piece of computer hardware or the entire computer. Furthermore, a hypervisor <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as an emulator; both are computer programs that imitate hardware, but their domain of use in language differs.|$|R

25|$|The atomic form factor, or {{scattering}} power, of {{an element}} {{depends on the}} type of radiation considered.
