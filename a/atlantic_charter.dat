During the 1930s, the British created their own economic bloc to shut out U.S. goods.

50|$|Over {{the years}} several {{international}} flights have been diverted to Iqaluit due to technical reasons, air rage or on-board medical emergencies with no deaths being reported. On 31 May 1996, Virgin Atlantic flight 7 from London to Los Angeles made {{an emergency landing}} at Iqaluit after a passenger had a heart attack.

In the early 1940s, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms themes were still vague and abstract to many, but the government used them to help boost patriotism. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Charter,</b> and it became part of the charter of the United Nations.

25|$|It was {{for this}} reason that Churchill was {{relieved}} when Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940. Upon re-election, Roosevelt immediately set about implementing a new method of providing military hardware and shipping to Britain without the need for monetary payment. Roosevelt persuaded Congress that repayment for this immensely costly service would take the form of defending the US; and so Lend-Lease was born. Churchill had 12 strategic conferences with Roosevelt which covered the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Charter,</b> Europe first strategy, the Declaration by the United Nations and other war policies.|$|E

The so-called Caledonian Case established a precedent and constituted the legal basis for all airlines that {{had always wanted to}} operate charters to and from the US and Canada, but had been unable to overcome the objections of the established airlines, such as Pan Am and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), prior to the enactment of this law. Caledonian's US breakthrough led to it being granted Canadian affinity group charter permission as well.

25|$|The era of European {{colonialism}} {{lasted from}} the 16th to 19th centuries and involved European powers vastly extending their reach {{around the globe}} by establishing colonies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The dismantling of European empires following World War II saw the process of decolonization begin in earnest. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill jointly released the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Charter,</b> which broadly outlined {{the goals of the}} U.S. and British governments. One of the main clauses of the charter acknowledged the right of all people to choose their own government. The document became the foundation for the United Nations and all of its components were integrated into the UN Charter, giving the organization a mandate to pursue global decolonization. Despite a uniform effort by the United Nations, modern postcolonial states vary widely in terms of political and economic stability.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, when Yuriy Andropov's anti-dissident {{campaign}} {{was at its}} peak, the dissidents of the three occupied Baltic republics decided to send a joint memorandum to the UN and the major powers. The petition, known as the Baltic Appeal, was directed to {{the governments of the}} two German states, the USSR, signatories of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Charter</b> and the Secretary General of the UN (Kurt Waldheim). The petition called for the elimination of the consequences of the pact and for self-determination and independence for the Baltic nations. The petition was signed by 37 Lithuanians, 4 Estonians and 4 Latvians. It was handed over to Western representatives in Moscow, August 1979. On August 23, 1979 Baltic Appeal was approved by well-known Moscow dissidents academic Andrei Sakharov, Viktor Nekipelov, Tatyana Velikanova, Malva Landa and Arina Ginzburg. Provided with these names, the document reached West, thus signed by fifty people. A reaction by the international community was the Resolution of the European Parliament, January 13, 1983.|$|E
25|$|It {{must surely}} have a deplorable effect upon our Allies {{to be told}} by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, {{and that there are}} enough anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, it is surely those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Charter,</b> and that ought to be told to America. The second principle of that Charter lays down that the United States and ourselves desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; and the third principle lays down that they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live.|$|E
50|$|Crestview {{was largely}} an {{outgrowth}} of the coming of railroad service to the west Panhandle of Florida. The Pensacola and <b>Atlantic</b> Railroad Company, <b>chartered</b> in 1881, opened its line between Pensacola and Apalachicola in January 1883. Soon two express passenger trains, the Atlantic Express and the Gulf Express, and a local accommodation train that stopped everywhere, were in daily operation. The expresses took about six hours to make the run, the local, thirteen hours. When the railroad company was unable to cover the interest owed bondholders, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad covered the shortfalls until 1885, and then foreclosed, merging the route into their system as the L & N's Pensacola and Atlantic Division.|$|R

Upon their completion Hesperus rejoined the 9th Escort Group before she was attached to Force H in December for convoy duties at Gibraltar.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the months}} that followed, the United States {{gradually}} edged toward war in the Atlantic.

The task force deployed from NS Argentia, Newfoundland, on 1 July, and were back in port by 19 July.
