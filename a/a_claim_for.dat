5|$|Brady was {{admitted}} to the New York Bar in either 1835 or 1836, when he was about twenty years old. His first case was an insurance proceeding, where he opposed the prominent lawyer, Charles O'Connor. The plaintiff staked <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> insurance money from a property allegedly burned down by a fire. Though Brady lost that case, his proficiency for law and oration was immediately noted.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{went back}} to New River and {{discovered}} the Indians had returned to loot the settlement and had burned several other houses and plantations. <b>A</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> restitution of his losses was denied in 1840 by the United States House of Representatives. Arriving at Key West on January 16, 1836, aboard the steamboat Champion, he was appointed temporary lighthouse keeper, staying until April of that year.|$|E
5|$|All {{daughter}} isotopes (decay products) of element 117 {{were previously}} unknown; therefore, their properties {{could not be}} used to confirm the claim of discovery. In 2011, when one of the decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> their findings in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.|$|E

5|$|Blythe also {{alleged that}} after {{learning}} about Nosek's death, {{he had written}} {{a letter to the}} Nosek family, in which he offered help and a meeting in-person. Daniel Nosek's father, however, testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team. Nosek's father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident. The Nosek family's representative brought <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> damages in the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (approx. US$530,000).|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Jones brought <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> {{damages for}} {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis}} that the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, {{on the basis that}} the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012 Novosibirsk {{resident}} Irina Ruzankina filed <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> 30,000 rubles (about $1,000) {{for moral}} damages, claiming that a Pussy Riot video had caused her headaches and increased blood pressure.

5|$|In the 1920s, Wyatt gave Sadie signed legal {{papers and}} filing fees to <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away the filing fees and lied to Wyatt about what {{happened}} to the lease, which later turned out to be valuable. Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Sadie after his death. Henrietta's three children voided the agreement after their mother's death and did not pass on the royalties to her.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> which there is no evidence.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Baxter, {{the leading}} case on {{derivative}} governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd. In Bradken, the High Court upheld <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion {{was that if}} the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements.|$|E

5|$|The Tlaxcalan {{allies of}} the Spanish who {{accompanied}} them in their invasion of Guatemala wrote their own accounts of the conquest; these included {{a letter to the}} Spanish king protesting at their poor treatment once the campaign was over. Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> recompense. Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, which was probably painted in Ciudad Vieja in the 1530s, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala, painted in Tlaxcala.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{remained}} in occupation of San Marino {{for a short}} period following the German surrender. In October 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, the Sammarinese government submitted <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> 732 million lira to the British government for wartime compensation, of which 500 million lira were given as the related costs of the fighting in September and 20 million lira as the costs of the occupation. The British government rejected this claim, arguing that as Germany had breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country, it was not liable; it did, however, offer an ex gratia payment of £26,000 in regard to the June bombing, later increased to £80,000 (about 33.6 million lira).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 {{season the}} New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) {{suspended}} Gallaher from playing after a disagreement over <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> expenses he had submitted to the Auckland Rugby Football Union for travel to play in the match against the British Isles. Eventually the matter was resolved when, under protest, Gallaher repaid the disputed amount. This settlement, coupled with his performance in 26–0 North Island win over the South Island in the pre-tour trial, allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand's 1905–06 tour of Europe and North America. The NZRFU had been trying to secure an invitation to send a team to Britain for some time, and were finally able to secure satisfactory financial guarantees to proceed in 1905. This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour, though a privately organised team, the New Zealand Natives, had preceded them in 1888–89.|$|E

5|$|Lützow claimed nine aerial {{victories}} {{in his first}} week on the Eastern Front. The first victory, an I-18 fighter, {{a variant of the}} Polikarpov I-16, was achieved on the opening day of Barbarossa. On the second day of Barbarossa, he accounted for two Tupolev SB-2 bombers. On 24 June, he filed <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> a Polikarpov I-153 biplane fighter destroyed. Two days later, he destroyed three aircraft, two SB-2 bombers and a Petlyakov Pe-2 ground attack aircraft. On 27 June, he shot down an Ilyushin DB-3 bomber followed by another Pe-2 on the following day, his last victory of June 1941. Following a DB-3 bomber claimed on 7 July, Lützow was credited with four aerial victories on 10 July, consisting of one Vultee V-11 attack aircraft and three I-153s. The next day he claimed an II-16. On 15 July he shot down two further I-16s and another DB-3 taking his total to 36 World War II victories.|$|E
5|$|The Jacksonville Jaguars claimed Kafka off waivers on June 11, 2013, one {{day after}} his release by the Patriots. The Dallas Cowboys had also put in <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> him. The general manager for the Jaguars, Dave Caldwell, said on June 13 that Kafka had as good of a chance at being named the {{starting}} quarterback as Blaine Gabbert, Chad Henne, or Matt Scott had. Kafka was the third quarterback {{to play in the}} first preseason game for the Jaguars on August 9 against the Miami Dolphins after Henne and Gabbert. He went 4-of-8 for 19yards and an interception in the game. In the second week of the preseason, he went 1-for-3 for −4yards. He did not play in the team's third preseason game, but passed for 46yards and a touchdown in the fourth game. The Jaguars signed Ricky Stanzi on August 27 for additional competition for the team's third quarterback job. Kafka and Scott were both released in favor of Stanzi during final roster cuts on August 30, 2013.|$|E

Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, and the Lienzo de Tlaxcala. Accounts of the conquest as seen {{from the point of view}} of the defeated highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels. A letter from the defeated Tz'utujil Maya nobility to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Schindler {{had spent}} his entire fortune on bribes and black-market {{purchases}} of supplies for his workers. Virtually destitute, he moved briefly to Regensburg and later Munich, but did not prosper in postwar Germany. In fact, he was reduced to receiving assistance from Jewish organisations. In 1948 he presented <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> reimbursement of his wartime expenses to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and received $15,000. He estimated his expenditures at over $1,056,000, including the costs of camp construction, bribes, and expenditures for black market goods, including food. Schindler emigrated to Argentina in 1949, where he tried raising chickens and then nutria, a small animal raised for its fur. When the business went bankrupt in 1958, he left his wife and returned to Germany, where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures, including a cement factory. He declared bankruptcy in 1963 and suffered a heart attack the next year, which led to a month-long stay in hospital. Remaining in contact with many of the Jews he had met during the war, including Stern and Pfefferberg, Schindler survived on donations sent by Schindlerjuden from all over the world. He died on 9 October 1974 and is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of the}} Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. For his work during the war, in 1963 Schindler was named Righteous Among the Nations, an award bestowed by the State of Israel on non-Jews who took an active role to rescue Jews during the Holocaust. Other awards include the German Order of Merit (1966).|$|E
5|$|On 8 June {{the final}} {{elements}} of I. Gruppe arrived in Montdidier, making the unit complete. In the evening Weissenberger again claimed two P-47s shot down, his 181st and 182nd aerial victories. The airfield at Montdidier came under heavy fighter bomber attack on 11 June {{followed by another}} attack on 12 June resulting in significant damage to the airfield. On 12 June Weissenberger filed <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> three aerial victories. Together with his wingman, Unteroffizier (Sergeant) Alfred Tichy, he took off at 06:00 and {{during the course of}} 12 minutes shot down three P-47s. After his first victory, Tichy was killed in action, crashing near Évreux. At 07:02 Weissenberger shot down his third P-47 of the day but his Bf 109 G-5 was hit in the engine forcing him to bail out near Saint André. The airfield in Montdidier was rendered unserviceable and I. Gruppe was forced to relocate. It was first moved to Péronne, then to Chauny, a makeshift airfield between Noyon and Tergnier. The constant attacks against German airfields forced another move in July 1944, this time to Frières in the vicinity of Laon.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer had to {{wait two}} months to achieve another victory, {{claiming}} the destruction of two Vickers Wellingtons and one Armstrong Whitworth Whitley within the space of 62 minutes {{in the early hours}} of 1 August. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer flew their first combat mission with the Lichtenstein radar on the night 5/6 August 1942. Though they managed to make contact with an enemy aircraft they failed to shoot it down. On the night of the 24/25 August 1942, Schnaufer became an ace (his fifth aerial victory), when he filed <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> another Wellington. This was the first time Rumpelhardt had guided him into contact using the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C UHF-band airborne radar. His next claim was made on the night of 28/29 August. This was probably a No. 78 Squadron Halifax II W7809, piloted by Sergeant John A. B. Marshall of the Royal Australian Air Force, on a secondary attack against Saarbrücken. The primary attack force was targeting Nuremberg that night. On the night of the 21/22 December 1942, Schnaufer shot down an Avro Lancaster; his first victory against this type. It was Schnaufer's seventh victory. Schnaufer may also have been responsible for the destruction of another Lancaster that night. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer had attacked a Lancaster and observed it catching fire followed by the aircraft plunging earthwards. Hauptmann Wilhelm Herget from I./Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (I./NJG4—1st group of the 4th Night Fighter Wing) had also attacked a four-engined bomber in the same vicinity. The draw decided in favour of Herget who was given credit for the destruction of the Lancaster.|$|E
