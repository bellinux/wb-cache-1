5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps {{believed}} that Charles might have remained along the Rhine and defeated the French armies {{one after the}} other. Unlike the divided command of the French, the Austrians enjoyed unity of command. After Ettlingen, Phipps thought that the correct French strategy was for the two French armies to join. However, this {{was not part of}} Carnot's plan, which was for each army to operate against the Austrian flanks. Carnot's strategy had succeeded in 1794 during the Flanders Campaign and he expected that it would win again. However, in 1794 the Coalition was made up of several countries with different vulnerabilities, while in 1796 Charles could issue a command <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> it to be obeyed. The next clash would be the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August.|$|E
5|$|The deputies and the Junta met on December 18, {{to decide}} what to do. Funes, who was close to Saavedra, argued that Buenos Aires had no right to appoint {{national}} authorities by itself <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> obedience from the provinces. The nine deputies voted for their incorporation, as did Larrea, Azcuénaga, Matheu and Alberti, founding members of the Junta. Saavedra declared that the incorporation was not fully legal, but that he supported it for public convenience. Only Juan José Paso voted with Moreno against the incorporation of the deputies. Left in a minority within the Junta, Moreno resigned. He was appointed to a diplomatic mission in Europe, but died in high seas, in unclear circumstances. Some historians consider that Saavedra plotted to murder Moreno, others that it was a negligence of the captain, and others that it was because of Moreno's frail health.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} value-at-risk (VaR) <b>and</b> <b>expected</b> {{shortfall}} under market stress. Assuming that the multivariate extreme value distribution represents asset returns under market stress, we simulate asset returns with this distribution. With these simulated asset returns, we examine whether market stress affects {{the properties of}} VaR <b>and</b> <b>expected</b> shortfall. Our findings are as follows. First, VaR <b>and</b> <b>expected</b> shortfall may underestimate the risk of securities with fat- tailed properties and a high potential for large losses. Second, VaR <b>and</b> <b>expected</b> shortfall may both disregard the tail dependence of asset returns. Third, expected shortfall has {{less of a problem}} in disregarding the fat tails and the tail dependence than VaR does. ...|$|R

Michigan authorities think the lawsuit is frivolous <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> it to be dismissed, noting that it is legally impossible because of Abuelazam's life without parole status, since convicts can not be deported until their full sentence is served.|$|E

In the Colombo SAF Games, two of his shoot up scores were under ten with a highest of 10.7 where he used to reach 10.8 three to four times.

25|$|Job {{interviews}} {{and other data}} on requirements for lower skilled workers in developed countries – particularly in the growing service sector – indicate that the more workers depend on low wages, and the less skilled or desirable their job is, the more employers screen for workers without better employment options <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> them to feign unremunerative motivation. Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage-dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to feign, which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity.|$|E

In Feyenoord's Youth Project visiting a match is the central point, {{but there is also}} an educative and cultural character included. Feyenoord provide schools and amateur clubs with small teaching books <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> these to be filled in by the visiting youth when they enter the stadium on a match day. The groups that support Feyenoord in the most original way and those who can predict the score correctly are awarded with prizes.|$|E

25|$|According to Kilroy's father, {{the purpose}} of these summer {{activities}} is to keep the youth distracted when they are not in school so they do not get bored and think about consuming drugs. On September 1999, the foundation signed an agreement with the U.S. Federal government to receive ten yearly grants of $100,000. By the tenth year, the government intended to stop the funding <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> the foundation to be self-supporting. However, Kilroy's parents stated that the yearly expenses exceeded $160,000 and that they would need {{to find new ways to}} make up the deficit. The Mark Kilroy Foundation was one of the five non-profit organizations in the Galveston County that receives proceeds from a bingo place in La Marque, Texas. They also receive proceeds from sales of the book Sacrifice, written by Kilroy's father and Bob Stewart in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Persons with narcissistic {{personality}} disorder (NPD) {{are characterized by}} their persistent grandiosity, excessive need for admiration, and a personal disdain for, and lack of empathy for other people. As such, the person with NPD usually displays the behaviors of arrogance, a sense of superiority, and actively seeks to establish abusive power and control over other people. Narcissistic {{personality disorder}} is a condition different from self-confidence (a strong sense of self); people with NPD typically value themselves over other persons {{to the extent that}} they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements. Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego (Self-concept), an inability to tolerate criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. Of all the things said to a Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive bonding process that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> them to return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are no more likely to become overloaded again than are those who have not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E

25|$|From the 9th century onward, {{the power}} to {{interpret}} law in traditional Islamic societies was {{in the hands of}} the scholars (ulema). This separation of powers served to limit the range of actions available to the ruler, who could not easily decree or reinterpret law independently <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> the continued support of the community. Through succeeding centuries and empires, the balance between the ulema and the rulers shifted and reformed, but the balance of power was never decisively changed. Over the course of many centuries, imperial, political and technological change, including the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, ushered in an era of European world hegemony that gradually included the domination of many of the lands which had previously been ruled by Islamic empires. At the end of the Second World War, the European powers found themselves too weakened to maintain their empires as before. The wide variety of forms of government, systems of law, attitudes toward modernity and interpretations of sharia are a result of the ensuing drives for independence and modernity in the Muslim world.|$|E
25|$|Croteam used {{an array}} of {{automated}} and in-place tools to help rapidly design, debug, and test the game for playability. In one aspect, they recognized {{in the development of}} a puzzle game was that while puzzles could be designed with specific solutions, the process of creating the video game around the puzzle could create unsolvable situations or unforeseen shortcuts. To address this, they used a bot, developed by Croteam member Nathan Brown who had previously developed bots for other games including the ones incorporated into ports of Serious Sam 3 for consoles. The bot, named Bot, would watch the playthrough of a puzzle by a human player in terms of broad actions such as placing boxes on a switch for the completion of a puzzle. Then, as the puzzle's environment was tuned and decorated, they would have Bot attempt to solve the puzzle, testing to make sure it did not run into any dead-ends. If it did encounter any, Bot reported these through an in-house bug reporting system and then used game cheats to move on and finish out testing, which took between 30 and 60 minutes for the full game. As such, they were able to quickly iterate and resolve such problems when new features were introduced to the game. Overall, Croteam estimates they logged about 15,000 hours with Bot before the release of the public test version, <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> to use similar techniques in future games. They also used human playtesters to validate other more aesthetic factors of the games prior to the title's release.|$|E
