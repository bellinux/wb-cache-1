40|$|Introduction & Objective: Ficin is {{a member}} of plant cystein proteases that is {{abundant}} in fig. This enzyme has many pharmacological and industrial uses. In the present study, the enzyme was purified by a simple procedure and its proteolytic activity was assayed on several plant and animal proteins. Materials & Methods: Ficin was extracted from unripe fig, precipitated by ammonium sulfate and purified using ion-exchange chromatography on a Carboxymethyl Sepharose column. Proteolytic activities of the purified enzyme were determined in 4 buffering conditions on casein, <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin,</b> beta lactoglobulin and gelatin proteins. Results: Purified enzymes include two bands with molecular mass of 24 and 26 KDa. Re-sults of proteolytic activity showed that ficin can digest casein. It has moderate hydrolytic activity on beta lactoglobulin and gelatin but ficin can not hydrolyze <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin.</b> Conclusion: It seems ficin has selective effects on some proteins so it can be a good candi-date for digestion of casein and making related drugs.

40|$|Inhibiting milking-induced {{prolactin}} (PRL) {{release and}} reducing milking frequency reduce {{the quantity of}} milk produced by dairy cows. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these two parameters modulate milk yield are not clear. To assess the regulation of the cell activity, by PRL and milking frequencies, five Holstein cows in early lactation received daily i. m. injection of 1 mg of Quinagolide, a suppressor of PRL release, for 9 weeks. Four control cows received the vehicle (water). During {{the last week of}} treatment, one half-gland was milked once and the other twice daily. Mammary biopsies were taken after 4 and 8 weeks of quinagolide treatment and epithelial cells were isolated from milk of both halvesudders in both groups of animals during the differential milking. Epithelial cells were prepared after milk centrifugation and by purification using an anticytoketatin antibody bound to magnetic beads. RNA was extracted from mammary biopsies and milk purified epithelial cells. Milk protein mRNA expression were analysed by quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR. Quinagolide treatment induced a faster decline in milk production (- 5. 3 kg/d compared to control during the last 4 weeks of treatments, P 0. 15). Levels of kappa casein (P< 0. 05) and <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin</b> (P= 0. 06) mRNA were lower in mammary biopsies of Quinagolide-treated cows at week 4. Accordingly, the mRNA levels of kappa casein (P< 0. 05) and <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin</b> (P= 0. 06) were also lower in milk purified epithelial cells from Quinagolide treated cows during the differential milking. Milking frequency also induced variations in milk protein mRNA levels in milk purified epithelial cells. Levels of kappa casein (P< 0. 05) and <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin</b> (P< 0. 01) mRNA were downregulated in once daily milked udders compared to twice daily ones. In conclusion, chronic administration of the prolactin-release inhibitor Quinagolide and once daily milking reduced milk production in dairy cows by affecting mammary cell activity at a transcriptionnal level. Moreover milk purified epithelial cells seem to be a valuable source of cells to study transcriptional regulations in mammary cells...|$|E
40|$|Macromolecular {{absorption}} of gliadin, a wheat protein and <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin,</b> a milk protein was evaluated {{in control and}} Escherichia coli enterotoxin (heat-stable, heat-labile, and both heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxin) treated mice. The peak concentration of gliadin and lactalbumin was two hours and three hours after their ingestion, respectively. There was also a significant increase (p < 0. 01) in the {{absorption of}} both the proteins in all the three toxin treated groups compared with the control group. These results suggest that intestinal permeability and macromolecular absorption changes after E coli infection...|$|E
40|$|SEVERAL natural {{components}} {{abundant in}} the fluid phase of human breast-milk {{have been shown to}} be inhibitors of complement activation in vitro, particularly the classical pathway. These include lysozyme, lactoferrin, <b>lactalbumin</b> <b>alpha</b> and other ligand chelators, complement regulator proteins and other specific soluble inhibitors of complement activation. Their physiological significance probably resides in their ability to restrict in vivo complement activation to specialized (compartmentalized) sites on the cellular membrane structures in human milk, represented by the abundant surface area of the milk fat globule membranes. This would serve to prevent inflammatory-induced tissue damage of the delicate immature gastrointestinal tract of the newborn as well as the mammary gland itself. A number of recognized and potential inhibitors of complement activity in human milk and other biological fluids are hereby reviewed, with a proposal of their physiological significance.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{usefulness of}} 8 potential tumour markers has been evaluated in 69 patients with Stage I and II {{breast cancer and}} 57 patients with Stage III and IV. Serum CEA concentrations were raised in 13 % of patients with local and 65 % of those with advanced breast cancer. In patients with clinical evidence of progression or regression of tumour, serum CEA levels changed appropriately in 83 % of cases. Taking 4 of the markers (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), <b>lactalbumin,</b> <b>alpha</b> subunit and haptoglobin) serum concentrations {{of one or more}} were raised in 33 % of patients with local disease and 81 % of those with advanced breast cancer. However, marker concentrations were often only marginally raised, and are unlikely to provide sensitive guide to tumour burden. CEA, <b>lactalbumin</b> and <b>alpha</b> subunit were detectable in 68 %, 43 % and 40 % respectively of extracts of primary breast cancers...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{variation}} at the ovine casein genes {{could have}} important {{effects on the}} composition and coagulation properties of milk. Herewith, we have partially resequenced the promoters and the 3 ′-UTR of the four casein genes in 25 Sarda sheep. Alignment of these sequences allowed us to identify a total of 29 SNPs. This level of polymorphism (one SNP every 250 bp) is remarkably high if compared with SNP densities estimated in human genic regions (approximately one SNP per bp). The 29 SNPs identified in our resequencing experiment, plus three previously reported SNPs mapping to the <b>lactalbumin,</b> <b>alpha</b> (LALBA) and β-lactoglobulin (BLG, also known as progestagen-associated endometrial protein, PAEP) genes, were genotyped with a multiplex TaqMan Open Array Real-Time PCR assay in 760 Sarda sheep with records for milk composition and coagulation properties. Association analysis revealed the existence of significant associations of CSN 1 S 2 and CSN 3 genotypes with milk protein and casein contents. Moreover, genotypes at CSN 1 S 1 {{were significantly associated with}} rennet coagulation time, curd firming time and curd firmness, whereas CSN 2 was associated with curd firming time. These results suggest that SNPs mapping to the promoters and 3 ′-UTRs of ovine casein genes may exert regulatory effects on gene expression and that they could be used for improving sheep milk quality and technological traits at the population level through marker assisted selection. © 2016 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics...|$|R
40|$|Homocysteine thiolactone is a toxic {{metabolite}} {{produced from}} homocysteine by amino-acyl t-RNA synthetase in error editing reaction. The basic cause of toxicity of homocysteine thiolactone {{is believed to}} be due to the adduct formation with lysine residues (known as protein N-homocysteinylation) leading to protein aggregation and loss of enzyme function. There was no data available until now that showed the effect of homocysteine thiolactone on the native state structural changes that led to aggregate formation. In the present study we have investigated the time dependent structural changes due to homocysteine thiolactone induced modifications on three different proteins having different physico-chemical properties (cytochrome-c, lysozyme and <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin).</b> We discovered that N-homocysteinylation leads to the formation of molten globule state [...] an important protein folding intermediate in the protein folding pathway. We also found that the formation of the molten globule state might be responsible for the appearance of aggregate formation. The study indicates the importance of protein folding intermediate state in eliciting the homocysteine thiolactone toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} between nanoparticles (NPs) and proteins in living systems are {{a precursor to}} the formation of a NP–protein ‘‘corona’ ’ that underlies cellular and organism responses to nanomaterials. However, the thermodynamic properties and reversibility of NP–protein interactions have rarely been examined. Using an automated, high-throughput and temperature-controlled dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique we observed a distinct hysteresis in the hydrodynamic radius of branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) coated-silver nanoparticles (bAgNPs) exposed to like-charged lysozyme during the processes of heating and cooling, in contrast to the irreversible {{interactions between}} bAgNPs and oppositely charged <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin</b> (ALact). Our discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations offered a new molecular insight into the differential structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of bAgNPs binding with the two protein homologs and further revealed the different roles of the capping agents of citrate and BPEI in NP–protein interactions. This study facilitates our understanding of the transformation of nanomaterials in living systems, whose implications range from the field study of nanotoxicology to nanomaterials synthesis, nanobiotech-nology and nanomedicine...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the affinity and capacity of ion exchange adsorbents of a given total charge density are improved by immobilization of the charges in pre-ordered clusters, rather than individually in random locations. This previous work used pentalysinamide and pentaargininamide as clustered ligands. This approach allows close control of cluster size, but is uneconomically expensive for some research and most practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate that the inexpensive synthetic analog of the natural polyamine spermine (H 2 N-CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 -NH-CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 -NH-CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 NH 2) also can {{serve as the basis}} of effective clustered adsorbents. The calcium-depleted form of the protein a lactalbumin, and RNA from baker's yeast, were adsorbed on a spermine Sepharose adsorbent. This adsorbent exhibited enhanced <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin</b> binding capacity (Q(max) > 1. 6 and 1. 3 -fold higher than those for Qiagen DEAE and GE DEAE Sepharose adsorbents of much greater charge density) and higher initial binding affinity (Q(max) /K-D 2. 4 and 2. 1 fold higher, respectively). The new spermine-based matrix exhibited a higher value of the Z parameter, suggesting an increased number of apparent interaction sites between the protein and the resin, and functioned well in column mode.

40|$|Age-related {{cognitive}} decline (ARCD) and dementia are {{of increasing}} concern to an ageing population. In recent years, {{there has been}} considerable research focused on effective dietary interventions that may prevent or ameliorate ARCD and dementia. While {{a number of studies}} have considered the impact that dairy products may have on physiological health, particularly with regard to the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular health, further research is currently needed in order to establish the impact that dairy products have in the promotion of healthy brain function during ageing. The present review considers the available evidence for the positive effects of dairy products on the metabolic syndrome and glucose regulation, with consideration of the implications for neurocognitive health. A literature search of current (September 2010) meta-analyses/reviews and original research regarding dairy products and cognition was conducted through SCOPUS using the following search terms for dairy consituents: dairy, milk, cheese, yoghurt, probiotics, whey protein, <b>alpha</b> <b>lactalbumin,</b> calcium, B- 12, bioactive peptides and colostrinin (CLN). These search terms for dairy products were combined with the following search terms related to cognition and health: cognition, cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, insulin resistance and glucose regulation. Concerns regarding SFA and other fatty acids found in dairy products are also reviewed in relation to different forms of dairy products. The review also considers recent evidence for positive neurocognitive effects associated with bioactive peptides, CLN and proline-rich polypeptides, α-lactalbumin, vitamin B 12, calcium and probiotics. Future directions for the extraction and purification of beneficial constituents are also discussed. It is concluded that low-fat dairy products, when consumed regularly as part of a balanced diet, may have a number of beneficial outcomes for neurocognitive health during ageing...|$|E
