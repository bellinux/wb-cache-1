5|$|Sources {{differ on}} why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not {{economical}} to own houses anymore.

5|$|A {{scheme to}} cover the moors with ash from {{coal-fired}} power stations, and possibly municipal rubbish, was proposed in 1962, and again in 1969. Another plan of the 1960s was to build a regional airport on the moors; this proposal was revived in 1971. Further ash-tipping schemes were voiced in 1974, as was a third plan for an airport in 1976. There were also {{plans to use the}} moor as <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> for colliery waste in 1978, when Thorne Colliery was upgraded and reopened.|$|E

5|$|From 1876, the South Saskatchewan river {{crossing}} at St. Louis was via ferry. In 1912, the railway built a rail {{bridge across the}} river, and in 1928, the vehicle lanes were added. After 1907, the highway was constructed south of Chamberlain and reached Buffalo Pound. At this time two horse scrapers and walking plows were the implements of road construction technology. This highway received an improvement in 1926 which then used an elevating grader, 16 horses and <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> wagon.|$|E
5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports {{indicated that the}} Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility. Some members of the Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that {{some members of the}} Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the site for <b>a</b> <b>dump.</b>|$|E

5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} roost communally {{on large}} trees, buildings or on cliffs. Roost sites are usually chosen close to <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> site or other suitable foraging area. In Spain and Morocco, summer roosts are formed mainly by immature birds. The favourite roost trees {{tended to be}} large dead pines. The number of adults at the roost increases towards June. It is thought that breeding adults {{may be able to}} forage more efficiently by joining the roost and following others to the best feeding areas. Breeding birds that failed to raise young may also join the non-breeding birds at the roost during June.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station depot, however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station depot. The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 depot, with the remains taken to <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> in nearby Hillburn.|$|E
5|$|The Buzz on Maggie follows Maggie Pesky (Jessica DiCicco), an {{expressive}} tween fly and her family; parents Chauncey (Brian Doyle-Murray) and Frieda (Susan Tolsky); brothers Aldrin (David Kaufman) and Pupert (Thom Adcox); {{and sister}} Bella (Tara Strong), {{who is still}} a maggot. The family resides in an old milk carton in a suburban fly metropolis called Stickyfeet, which is located in <b>a</b> <b>dump.</b> Maggie has an ambitious and adventurous personality and aspires to become a rock star. Her approach to life often suffers unexpected consequences that puts herself in jeopardy, as she often follows her own impulses although they go against the rules or her parents' wishes. However, she ultimately learns her lesson, {{which was one of}} the core themes for the show's conception.|$|E

5|$|The Buzz on Maggie is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by Dave Polsky for Disney Channel. The series centers on an ambitious and expressive tween fly named Maggie Pesky {{and her family}} and friends. The show is set in Stickyfeet, a city for insects located in <b>a</b> <b>dump.</b> While conceptualizing the series, Polsky wanted it to contain a playful aspect at adolescence and director Dave Wasson formed the overall look of the characters, being heavily influenced by early Walt Disney cartoon shorts. The Buzz on Maggie was Disney's first series to be fully animated in Adobe Flash, a process done by Bardel Entertainment and Future Thought Productions.|$|E
5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E
5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn {{up on the}} old main line. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> in Hillburn, New York.|$|E

5|$|Engineer {{units in}} Port Moresby {{at the end}} of April were the 7th Field Company, 1st Army Troops Company, the field stores section of the 61st Field Park Company, a section of the 1st Mechanical Equipment Company, and the 1st Bomb Disposal Section. The 14th Field Company arrived with the 14th Infantry Brigade in May. The first US troops to be {{stationed}} in New Guinea were an advance party of the African-American 96th Engineer Battalion on 28 April, but the battalion was not complete until June. They were followed by Company E of the 43rd Engineer General Service Regiment and <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> truck section of the 576th Engineer Company. The 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived in July. The 96th Engineer Battalion was reorganised as the 96th Engineer General Service Regiment in September. In response to Kenney's 26 October warning to MacArthur, the 46th and 91st Engineer General Service Regiments {{and the rest of the}} 576th Dump Truck Company were ordered to move to Port Moresby in November.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} <b>a</b> <b>dump</b> truck while {{trying to get to}} her first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E
