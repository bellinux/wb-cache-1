Along the way, he meets Maru, daughter of one of the great sages, and Jairo, a thief who initially steals a crucial item from them, but who ultimately decides to help. As they enlist the sages' help, they learn of <b>a</b> <b>wand</b> {{that could be used to}} defeat Jabou, but are at a loss as to how to retrieve it, as it was recently destroyed by Jabou. Soon after, they find themselves many years in the past by the actions of a stranger, and are able to retrieve the wand there.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Percival Graves {{approaches}} Mary Lou Barebone's adopted son Credence {{and offers}} to free {{him from his}} abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds <b>a</b> <b>wand</b> under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When {{she is about to}} be punished, the Obscurus attacks and kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives and after Credence leads him to the location of Modesty, dismisses him as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the Obscurus's host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms into an Obscurus and attacks the city.|$|E

In her hand she wielded <b>a</b> <b>wand,</b> the symbolic distaff (seiðstafr), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In the saga of Örvar-Oddr, the seiðkona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (<b>a</b> <b>wand</b> which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant {{than the fact that}} it was intended to signify the otherness of the seiðkona.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>wand</b> is {{a wooden}} stick-like object used to channel magical energy and thus {{increase}} its power, and without which only limited magic is possible. Wands {{are used as}} both tools and weapons in the wizarding world. They are thus {{an important aspect of}} nearly all magic, and great importance is placed on wand mastery. Wands are generally carried inside the wizard's robes or otherwise somewhere on their person; however, they can also be placed into other objects. For instance, Rubeus Hagrid hid the broken halves of his wand inside his umbrella, and in the film adaptations, Lucius Malfoy hides his wand in his cane. In the magical world, when a wizard is expelled from Hogwarts, their wands are snapped in half. This type of damage to <b>a</b> <b>wand</b> is nearly irreparable, though Harry is able to mend his wand, which was accidentally broken by Hermione, {{with the help of the}} powerful Elder Wand.|$|E

25|$|Another notable grave was the Oseberg Ship in Norway that {{revealed}} {{two women who}} had received a sumptuous burial.

In the grave, there were also four cannabis seeds, which probably had been in the pillows that supported the corpses. Additional cannabis seeds were discovered in a small leather pouch.|$|E
25|$|These rites {{often include}} a special set of magical tools. These usually include a knife called an athame, <b>a</b> <b>wand,</b> a pentacle and a chalice, but other tools include a broomstick {{known as a}} besom, a cauldron, candles, incense and a curved blade known as a boline. An altar is usually present in the circle, on which ritual tools are placed and {{representations}} of the God and the Goddess may be displayed. Before entering the circle, some traditions fast for the day, and/or ritually bathe. After a ritual has finished, the God, Goddess and Guardians are thanked, the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed.|$|E

25|$|Each {{student is}} allowed to bring a cat, toad, rat or owl. Along with the {{acceptance}} letter, first-year students are sent a list of required equipment which includes <b>a</b> <b>wand,</b> subject books, a standard size 2 pewter cauldron, a set of brass scales, a set of glass or crystal phials, a kit of basic potion ingredients (for Potions), and a telescope (for Astronomy). The Hogwarts uniform consists of plain work robes in black, a plain black hat, a pair of protective gloves, and a black winter cloak with silver fastenings. Each uniform must contain the wearer's nametag. First years are not allowed a broomstick of their own, though an exception to this rule is made for Harry {{in his first year}} after he demonstrates an excellent ability as a Seeker in Quidditch.|$|E
25|$|Rowling {{invented a}} great number of words and phrases for the books such as spells, incantations, magical words, items, and place names. Many of these words involve wordplay, rhyming, and {{historical}} references that are difficult to translate. A large number of spells are drawn from or inspired by Latin, and have a certain resonance with English speakers due to its relatively large proportion of Latinate-derived vocabulary. For example, priori incantatem (a spell which causes the last spells performed by <b>a</b> <b>wand</b> to be reproduced in reverse order) would be familiar to many English-speaking readers as the words prior (previous) and incantation (spell, charm). To create a similar effect in the Hindi version, the Sanskrit, typical in mantras, has been used for the spells. Some translators have created new words themselves; others have resorted to transliteration.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} of later paintings impersonating Circe {{have a history}} of sexual experience behind them, starting with “Mary Spencer in the character of Circe” by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter George Stubbs. A portrait of “Mrs Nesbitt as Circe” by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady’s past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, loose-fitting dress, with <b>a</b> <b>wand</b> in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten on her knee. While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.|$|E

25|$|According to the tale, three {{brothers}} evaded Death, who {{gave them a}} choice of anything they wanted. The first brother chose <b>a</b> <b>wand</b> {{that could not be}} defeated in battle, the second brother asked for a way to bring back someone from the dead, and the third brother selected a cloak that made the wearer invisible, even to Death himself. Eventually, the first brother was killed, the second committed suicide, and finally, the third brother made Death a friend and gave the cloak to his son. The story is generally believed to refer to the Peverell brothers centuries ago, although very few actually believe the story to be fully true. Dumbledore believed that the Peverells were simply particularly powerful and ingenious wizard inventors. The sign of the Deathly Hallows had also been adopted as a personal symbol by dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald; therefore many wizards, such as Viktor Krum, mistakenly understood it to be a symbol of dark magic.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma <b>a</b> <b>wand</b> and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E
25|$|After the crash, many American {{retailers}} considered {{video games}} a passing fad, and greatly reduced sales of such products, or stopped them entirely. To avoid {{the stigma of}} video game consoles, Nintendo marketed the AVS as a full home computer, with an included keyboard, cassette data recorder, and a BASIC interpreter software cartridge. The BASIC interpreter would later be sold together with a keyboard as the Family BASIC package, and the cassette deck for data storage would later be released as the Famicom Data Recorder. The AVS also included a variety of computer-style input devices: gamepads, a handheld joystick, a musical keyboard, and the Zapper light gun. The AVS Zapper is hinged, allowing it to straighten out into <b>a</b> <b>wand</b> form, or bend into a gun form. The AVS uses a wireless infrared interface for all its components, including keyboard, cassette deck, and controllers. Most of the peripherals for the Advanced Video System are {{on display at the}} Nintendo World Store. The toy-like white-and-red color scheme of the Famicom was replaced with a clean and futuristic grey monochrome design, with the top and bottom portions in different shades, a stripe with black and ribbing along the top, and minor red accents. The AVS also features a boxier design than the Famicom: flat on top, and a bottom half that tapered down to a smaller footprint. The front of the main unit features a compartment for storing the wireless controllers out of sight. Its software carries the Nintendo Seal of Quality to communicate the company's approval.|$|E
