S-shaped front rails, also known as S-rails, {{are one of the}} main structural elements and energy absorbers in a car body. <b>Energy</b> <b>absorption</b> in the S-rails happens through local buckling. In order to improve the passenger safety in a frontal crash, S-rails design should be optimised to absorb {{higher level of}} energy while crushing. In this study, using Finite Element Methods, the crashworthiness impact of tapering S-shaped rails is studied through investigating the <b>energy</b> <b>absorption</b> and Specific <b>Energy</b> <b>Absorption</b> of 42 tapered square cross section steel S-rail models subjecting to quasi-static and dynamic loading.

All models are subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. The effectiveness of tapering S-rails is assessed through investigating the Specific <b>Energy</b> <b>Absorption</b> (SEA) variations. In quasi-static loading conditions, tapering type A models showed 144 % increase in <b>energy</b> <b>absorption</b> and 22 % improvement in specific <b>energy</b> <b>absorption.</b> In type B models under quasi-static loading, the <b>energy</b> <b>absorption</b> increased by 118 % and a maximum of 6 % improvement in specific <b>energy</b> <b>absorption</b> was achieved as a result of tapering the S-rails.

These structures consist of solid face sheets and low-density cellular core structures, which are often based upon honeycomb topologies. The recent progress of additive manufacturing (AM) (popularly known as 3 D printing) processes has allowed lattice configurations to be designed with improved thermal-mechanical properties. The aim of this work is to design and print lattice truss structures (LTS) keeping in mind the flexible nature of AM. Several 3 D printed core structures were created using polymeric material and were tested under low-velocity impact loads.
