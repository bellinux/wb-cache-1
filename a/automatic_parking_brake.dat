25|$|The 1976 {{model year}} saw no major {{changes to the}} Torino line-up. The Gran Torino Sport was discontinued, and so the Torino {{consisted}} of 9 separate models; 2- and 4-door versions of the Torino, Gran Torino, and Gran Torino Brougham, along with three station wagon models. New options for the 1976 model year included a power trunk release and an <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> release. Gran Torino 2-doors could now be ordered with the center console when optional bucket seats were specified; previously the console was only available on Sport models. In addition, opera windows and landau roofs were now available options for all 2-door models. There were no styling changes made to Torino for 1976.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum-operated hidden {{headlamps}} were added, which retracted upwards in {{event of}} failure. An <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> release, two-way power seats, power front disc brakes (rear drum), an indicator light for the headlight doors, and adjustable head restraints were all standard features.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} Mégane, {{the new car}} employs {{corporate}} styling cues and new technology including the [...] "Renault Card" [...] keyless immobiliser and an <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> on certain trim levels. It integrates LEDs on all trims since 2006. As with the Scénic I Phase 2, a raised [...] "Mégane" [...] logo appears on the C-pillar. The car received a different dashboard design {{to that of the}} Mégane and featured a digital instrument display.|$|E
25|$|The WN update from July 2013 added a VF Calais V {{interior}} and alloy wheels to the externally unchanged Caprice. The rear LCD screens for the Caprice V's DVD entertainment system now folded {{into the seat}} backs when not in use. The WN Caprice adds trailer stability control, rear cross traffic alert, backup camera, blind spot monitor, lane departure warning system, collision avoidance system, automotive head-up display, electric <b>park</b> <b>brake,</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>parking.</b> For the 2015 model year, the WN dropped the base model Caprice, leaving the Caprice V {{with a choice of}} L77 V8 or LPG-fuelled V6 engine options.|$|R
50|$|Starting on a {{hill with}} the aid of the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is not always {{possible}} since in recent cars that feature an electric <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> can only be released when the brake pedal is engaged.|$|R
25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes.</b> Power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional <b>parking</b> <b>brakes,</b> but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> easier. When releasing the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 {{a modest}} frontal {{revision}} placed {{more emphasis on}} horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid. New standard features included a bumper impact system, <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> release, passenger assist straps and flow through ventilation system. New DeVille signature script was affixed {{to the sides of}} the rear roof panels. Sales reached a record 194,811.|$|E

50|$|The Intelligent Parking Assist System feature (also called Advanced Parking Guidance System) can parallel-park or reverse-park the LS into a {{preselected}} {{space with}} minimal brake input at {{the push of}} a button. This feature utilizes the backup camera and parking sensors. Other drive-assist features include Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, which can accelerate and brake while monitoring traffic (similar to Mercedes-Benz's Distronic Plus), a Brake Hold button, which prevents creeping forward motion when the driver's foot is off the brake pedal, and the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Parking</b> <b>Brake,</b> which can engage the parking brake simultaneously whenever the transmission is shifted to Park.|$|E
5000|$|On car #2080 (May 1975), the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> {{micro switch}} {{was moved to}} a {{different}} position, and was actuated by a plastic collar instead of a detent on the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> shaft.|$|R
50|$|Automobiles {{usually have}} <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> {{on the rear}} wheels. If the rear axle is jacked off the ground with only the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> set, the vehicle may roll on the front wheels and fall. Chocking the front wheels {{prevents}} this mishap.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} important safety subsystems in a vehicle. Its main function is to hold a vehicle in position when parks on a flat or slope road. A typical problem of the mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is that it requires a driver to apply sufficient or sometimes high pulling force to keep the vehicle stationary at any road slopes. Insufficient pulling force may cause the vehicle to move away or known as rollaway phenomenon. In order to overcome such an issue, an electro-mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> (EMPB) is proposed and developed. The EMPB system is then tested using in-house <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. It is found that the EMPB takes within 0. 6 s to fully engage and within 0. 5 s to disengage the system, respectively at 11. 3 degrees of the road slope. Thus, current design of an EMPB system can prevent rollaway problem and also can be used as alternative replacement for the existing fully mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Focusing on auto {{control of}} parking brake {{system of the}} medium and heavy duty vehicles, the key {{problems}} are studied including the system design and control strategies. The structure and working principle of the parking brake system of the medium and heavy duty vehicles are analyzed. The functions of EPB are proposed. The important information of the vehicle are analyzed which could influence the EPB system. The overall plan of the pneumatic EPB system is designed, which adopts the two-position three-way electromagnetic valve with double coil as actuator. The system could keep the vehicle parking brake status or parking release status {{for a long time}} without power supply. The function modules of the system are planned, and the control strategies of <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> and parking release are made. The experiment is performed on a medium-sized commercial vehicle which is experimentally modified. The overall plan of the pneumatic EPB system and the automatic parking function are proved through real vehicle tests...|$|E

5000|$|Electric <b>park</b> <b>brakes</b> (EPB) {{are used}} on {{passenger}} vehicles {{to hold the}} vehicle stationary on grades and flat roads. This was accomplished traditionally using a manual <b>parking</b> <b>brake.</b> With electric <b>park</b> <b>brakes,</b> the driver activates the holding mechanism with a button and the brake pads are then electrically applied onto the rear brakes. This is accomplished by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an actuator mechanism. There are two mechanisms that are currently in production: 1. Cable puller systems and 2. Caliper integrated systems. [...] EPB systems {{can be considered a}} subset of Brake-by-wire technology.|$|R
25|$|Power {{operated}} <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that a vehicle remains {{stationary}} when it is parked at a certain road slope, the driver has to apply sufficient pulling force on the handbrake lever. Otherwise, the vehicle will start to rollaway where the torque generated by the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is lower that the torque required by the vehicle to remain stationary. This poses a danger situation not only to the vehicle's occupants but also to the people surrounding it. Thus, this paper aims to investigate performance of a typical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system used in passenger cars. A theoretical model of drum-type <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is derived and later being validated by test data that measured from the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. A good agreement is achieved between calculated and test results. Results from the model show that the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system used in this work can hold the vehicle stationary at 11 degree slope less than 200 N of the applied force and thus it meets the regulation requirement, and also the vehicle will not rollaway even though there are four adult passengers inside it...|$|R

5000|$|On car #2211 (July 1975), {{a switch}} {{was added to}} the dual master {{cylinder}} along with a small PC board behind the dash to warn of problems with brake hydraulics, as well as indicating if the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is engaged. Before #2211, the brake lamp was a <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> engaged indicator only.|$|R
2500|$|In road vehicles, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> {{also called}} hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. <b>Parking</b> <b>brakes</b> on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a straight pull handle located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. Some automobiles have the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{use for a}} <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is to keep a vehicle {{motionless}} when it is <b>parked.</b> The <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> has a ratchet or other locking mechanism that will keep it engaged until manually released. On vehicles with automatic transmissions, this is usually used in concert with a parking pawl in the transmission.|$|R
50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> air tank via a <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> hand control.|$|R
