5|$|After winning out a close {{competition}} with Jevan Snead, McCoy became the 2006 starting {{quarterback for the}} University of Texas.

Ohio State defeated the Longhorns 24–7, ending the Longhorns 21-game winning streak.|$|E
5|$|Amazon {{went on to}} join Nelson in {{the chase}} to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on {{specific}} instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but {{did not want to}} lose time by ordering his ships to heave to. Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly <b>a</b> <b>yard</b> of ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. Principe was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four swivels. Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain François Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the letter of marque Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard Principe, as was a considerable amount of specie.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} if the castle and town played any {{part in the}} English Civil War between 1642–45, {{although}} cannonballs from the period have been discovered within the castle. Local oral tradition states that the castle was slighted, or deliberately destroyed, during the war. Stones from the castle were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards, and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the castle, along with <b>a</b> <b>yard</b> and garden. A gallows operated at the castle until 1790. Buildings continued to encroach on the castle. By {{the end of the}} 19th century a school and a house, Castle Lodge, had been built in the castle grounds. Other buildings were built as lean-to's against the castle walls.|$|E
5|$|Munnerlyn started 14 {{games at}} right cornerback for the Panthers {{in his third}} season with the team and responded with a then career-high 58 tackles {{to go along with}} two sacks, one quarterback pressure, one forced fumble, one fumble {{recovery}} and seven passes defensed. He also accounted for six special teams tackles. In Week 5 at New Orleans Saints on October 9, he registered his first career sack, dropping quarterback Drew Brees for a six-yard loss on a blitz. In a Week 8 game against the Minnesota Vikings, he got his second sack of the season when he tackled Christian Ponder for a one-yard loss after he scrambled to the right to escape from pressure. Later in the game, he also stripped and recovered a fumble by Vikings wide receiver Percy Harvin <b>a</b> <b>yard</b> shy of the endzone. In Week 15, he suffered a strained left hamstring at Houston and was therefore placed on injured reserve on December 23.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Virginia Tech 25-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their second possession of the game. Parker was stopped for no gain on a run attempt, and another attempt on the next play was stopped for a loss of <b>a</b> <b>yard.</b> Facing third down, Clark attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped after a gain of six yards. Having gone three and out, the Hokies punted again. The kick was downed at the 36-yard line, and North Carolina's offense returned for its second possession of the game. On the first play of the drive, Linton gained two yards on a run up {{the middle of the}} field. On the next play, Keldorf completed a 62-yard pass to Octavus Barnes, who had broken free of the Virginia Tech defense. Barnes sprinted into the end zone for a touchdown, and after the extra point kick, North Carolina led 100 with 6:07 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
