5|$|Plesiorycteropus {{is known}} {{from a number}} of subfossil bones, {{comparable}} to coverage of some of the poorly known subfossil lemurs, such as Daubentonia robusta. The material includes several skulls, all of which are missing the facial bones, complete long bones such as the femur and humerus (upper arm bone), and other bones, but some elements are still unknown, including most of the skeleton of the hand and foot. There is little reason to <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> was similar in general form to the aardvark. No teeth or jaws referable to Plesiorycteropus have been found, and it is generally assumed that the animal was toothless.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made, by many-world advocates and others, {{over the years}} to derive the Born rule, rather than just {{conventionally}} <b>assume</b> <b>it,</b> so as to reproduce all the required statistical behaviour associated with quantum mechanics.

While residents of Dawodiya, are not certain of the village's exact age, they <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> was several centuries ago when some Assyrian Christian families escaped the persecution of Ottoman authorities during their original occupation of Botan in southern Turkey.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{approaches}} to determining when {{the reign of}} Tiberius Caesar started. The traditional approach is that of assuming that the reign of Tiberius started when he became co-regent in 11 AD, placing {{the start of the}} ministry of John the Baptist around 26 AD. However, some scholars <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> to be upon the death of his predecessor Augustus Caesar in 14 AD, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in 29 AD.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} date of St Peter's is also uncertain, but historians <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> to {{be around}} 1222, the year that Robert de Tuardo, the first known rector, was instituted by the Bishop of Lincoln, Hugh of Wells. The Parish of Berkhampstead St Peter was originally part of the huge Diocese of Lincoln (Archdeaconry of Huntingdon), until it was transferred in 1843 to Rochester (Archdeaconry of St Albans) and then again in 1877 to the newly formed Diocese of St Albans.|$|E

25|$|An inscribed altar from Dura-Europos on the Euphrates {{shows that}} Commodus' titles and the {{renaming}} of the months were disseminated to the furthest {{reaches of the}} Empire; moreover, that even auxiliary military units received the title Commodiana, and that Commodus claimed two additional titles: Pacator Orbis (pacifier of the world) and Dominus Noster (Our Lord). The latter eventually would {{be used as a}} conventional title by Roman emperors, starting about a century later, but Commodus seems to have been the first to <b>assume</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|With Burnside's departure, Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin left as well. Franklin {{had been}} a staunch {{supporter}} of George B. McClellan and refused to serve under Hooker, because he disliked him personally and also because he was senior to Hooker in rank. Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner stepped down due to old age (he was 65) and poor health. He was reassigned to a command in Missouri, but died before he could <b>assume</b> <b>it.</b> Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield was reassigned from command of the V Corps to be Hooker's chief of staff.|$|E
25|$|Mario Artist: Polygon Studio, {{released}} on August 29, 2000, is a 3D computer graphics editor that lets the user design and render 3D polygon images {{with a simple}} level of detail. It was originally announced as Polygon Maker at Nintendo Space World '96 and renamed to Polygon Studio at Space World '99. The game {{was scheduled to be}} the final title in the original Starter Kit's mail order delivery of 64DD games, but it didn't arrive on time, leading IGN to <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> was canceled until it was later released. The Expansion Pak and the Nintendo 64 Mouse are supported peripherals.|$|E

25|$|In {{his three}} years in Gotha, he was twice offered positions, in Stuttgart and at Oxford University; he {{declined}} both. Meanwhile, in Nuremberg, when the St. Sebaldus Church organist Georg Caspar Wecker (and his possible former teacher) died on 20 April 1695, the city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel (then a famous Nuremberger) to the position that they officially invited him to <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> without holding the usual job examination or inviting applications from prominent organists from lesser churches. He accepted, was released from Gotha in 1695, and arrived in Nuremberg in summer, with the city council paying his per diem expenses.|$|E
25|$|Apparent superluminal {{motion is}} {{observed}} in many radio galaxies, blazars, quasars and recently also in microquasars. The effect was predicted {{before it was}} observed by Martin Rees and can be explained as an optical illusion caused by the object partly {{moving in the direction}} of the observer, when the speed calculations <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> does not. The phenomenon does not contradict the theory of special relativity. Corrected calculations show these objects have velocities close to the speed of light (relative to our reference frame). They are the first examples of large amounts of mass moving at close to the speed of light. Earth-bound laboratories have only been able to accelerate small numbers of elementary particles to such speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{great success}} of Reese on Play (an {{outstanding}} guide to dummy play and defence) {{was followed by}} an even more ambitious work. The Expert Game was the book which really made his name. As the title suggests, it dealt with card play at the highest level, including some ideas that were novel at the time, for instance, inferences from events that did not occur, and the principle of restricted choice. Examples of bridge logic abound in Reese, for instance, a player who overcalls but does not lead his suit is likely to lack one or two key honours; this concept is often called 'the dog that did not bark in the night' (after Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's Silver Blaze). Another form of logic {{can be seen in}} 'If it must be so, <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> is so'. His examples of counting (and other ways of drawing inferences from the bidding and play) spread such ideas from a coterie of masters in London (or New York) to a much wider group of nascent experts. For at least twenty years after this book was published, one could be sure that virtually every top-class player had studied it minutely.|$|E

25|$|The two {{decide to}} marry {{on the same}} day as lesbian couple Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery. Ryan convinces town psychic Opal Cortlandt to give Greenlee a fake reading saying their wedding will be fine, but Opal {{secretly}} believes that Greenlee could die. When Ryan sees Zach kissing Reese, he cancels the wedding so he won't have to share the day with Reese, who goes through with her wedding to Bianca. When Greenlee tries to confirm that Zach is having an affair with Reese, she drives off on her motorcycle to confront her friend. Kendall is driving on the same road with Zach, and the two are arguing about Reese as well. Kendall ends up in the wrong lane and nearly hits Greenlee, who drives off the road and crashes into a creek below. She washes away but is unknowingly recovered and secretly rehabilitated by David Hayward. When Ryan and Kendall arrive at the morgue, they see her engagement ring on a corpse's hand and <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> is her. Both grieving their loss, Ryan and Kendall sleep together. Ryan feels guilty, and Jack gives him a video that Greenlee made for him, where she states she wants him to be happy with or without her.|$|E
25|$|Taxes {{and fines}} were paid in cash. Javanese economy had been partly monetised {{since the late}} 8th century, using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century Wonoboyo hoard {{discovered}} in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in Sidoarjo in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era. The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars <b>assume</b> <b>it</b> {{was due to the}} increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a currency system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited. These kepeng Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes—the imported Chinese copper coins—enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped celengan (piggy bank).|$|E

The idea for Alpha's voice derived from thinking {{about what would happen}} if someone broke a record player and it always played at a high pitch.
