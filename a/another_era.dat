Straight edge grew out of hardcore punk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was partly characterized by shouted rather than sung vocals.

25|$|The Tang Dynasty {{lasted for}} three centuries before it {{eventually}} succumbed to internal strife. In the Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907–960) that followed, Kaifeng in eastern Henan became {{the capital of}} four dynasties. The Song Dynasty that reunified China in 982 also had its capital at Kaifeng. Under Song rule, China entered <b>another</b> <b>era</b> of culture and prosperity, and Kaifeng overtook Luoyang and Chang'an as the largest city in China and in the world. In 1127, however, the Song Dynasty succumbed to Jurchen (Jin Dynasty) invaders from the north in the Jin–Song war, and in 1142 ceded all of northern China, including Henan. The Song government moved its capital to Hangzhou in Southern China, which, under the Southern Song Dynasty (1127–1279) continued to enjoy relative economic and culture prosperity. A prolonged period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity in the Yangtze River delta Jiangnan region (modern southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, and Shanghai) made this the new center of Chinese culture and economy.|$|E
25|$|Tunipasuluq {{was overthrown}} in 1593 in a palace {{revolution}} most likely led by Karaeng Matoaya, the very {{man who had}} enabled Tunipasuluq's coronation. The erstwhile Karaeng Gowa was exiled east and died in the distant island of Buton in 1617, although he may have continued to maintain close ties with his supporters in Makassar. Karaeng Matoaya was enthroned as Karaeng Talloq and appointed the seven-year-old prince I Manngarangi (later Sultan Ala'uddin) as Karaeng Gowa. Maros regained its own independent Karaeng {{after a few years}} of interregnum. The ousting of Tunipasuluq thus secured the autonomy of the nobility, delineated the limits of the Karaeng Gowa's authority, and restored balance between Gowa, Talloq, and other Makassar polties. Henceforth the dominion of Gowa was ruled by a confederation of powerful dynasties of which the Gowa royalty was nominally primus inter pares, although Talloq, the homeland of the tumabicara-butta, was often the de facto dominant polity. During the following four decades, Karaeng Matoaya spearheaded both the conversion of South Sulawesi to Islam and Gowa-Talloq's rapid expansionism east to Maluku and south to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The ousting of Tunipasuluq and the beginning of Karaeng Matoaya's effective rule may therefore be considered to mark the end of Gowa's initial expansion and the beginning of <b>another</b> <b>era</b> of Makassar history.|$|E

25|$|For {{an empire}} that was {{surrounded}} by enemies the downfall of Byzantium became a greater probability and in 1204 the city of Constantinople was sacked by soldiers of the Fourth Crusade bringing the Empire into <b>another</b> <b>era</b> of chaos. The Seljuqs of Rum under a new Sultan Kaykhusraw exploited this event and attacked the port of Antalya in 1207 capturing it from the weakened splinter Empire of Nicaea. The tide turned however in 1210 when the Sultan himself was killed in single combat by the Emperor of Nicaea at the Battle of Antioch on the Meander {{and from then on}} the eastern frontier was more or less stabilized. In 1243, the Mongol invasion broke Seljuq power in Anatolia. Three years later, the early death of Kaykhusraw II placed his three young sons on the throne. Civil disputes arose once again in the Sultanate of Rum allowing the Empire of Nicaea to recapture Constantinople from the Latins in 1261. In 1283, the Sultanate of Rum took its share of Civil warfare and in 1308 was disbanded; Iconium was taken some time afterward by the Karamanids, another Turkic people. The end of the Sultanate did not end the confrontations between the Turks and the Byzantines; the rising power of one of the nobles of the Sultanate, Osman (Uc Beg) gave rise to the Ottoman Beylik and the Byzantine–Ottoman wars, a continuation of confrontations between the Turks and the Byzantines ultimately leading to the demise of the Byzantine Empire and Islamic domination in Anatolia.|$|E
25|$|The 1989 season {{started with}} a deal that sent Jim McMahon to the San Diego Chargers. The move was made as McMahon fell out of favor with Mike Ditka and the Bears front office with his {{behavior}} and repeated injuries. This gave the starting job to Mike Tomczak, who had already seen considerable playing time as McMahon regularly missed games due to various injuries. The change at quarterback did not help the Bears as they finished 6–10 missing a sixth consecutive division title. The Bears came into the 1990 season bouncing back from a 6–10 season to finish in 1st Place with an 11–5 record. During the season, Head Coach Mike Ditka earned legendary status when he coached the team again just 10 days after a heart attack. This incident had been referenced and used several times in Bill Swerski's Superfans. However, {{a change in the}} playoff system caused the Bears a three seed to play in a wild card game to get to the Divisional Playoffs. In the first ever NFC 3 vs. 6 game the Bears defeated the New Orleans Saints, 16–6, to advance to a Divisional Playoff showdown against the New York Giants. The Bears were trounced 31–3 by the eventual Super Bowl Champion. The Bears made a return trip to the playoffs in 1991 with an 11–5 record in a season that saw Mike Ditka earn his 100th career-coaching win. The Bears did not win the division, but made the playoffs as a Wild Card qualifier. In the wild card round the Bears were defeated by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–13, in Chicago. The 1992 season saw {{the end of an era}} in Chicago. The Bears suffered their worst record of Mike Ditka's tenure, finishing 5–11. As a result, the Mike Ditka era ended as team president Mike McCaskey fired Ditka and hired Dave Wannstedt. <b>Another</b> <b>era</b> that ended that season came with the retirement of Hall of Famer Mike Singletary, who was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year.|$|E

[...] Ultimately, the Byrds' experimentation with the country genre on Sweetheart of the Rodeo was slightly ahead of its time, to the detriment of the band's commercial fortunes, as the international success of country rock-flavored bands like The Eagles, America and Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show during the 1970s demonstrated.|$|E

Romances success encouraged Linda Ronstadt, José Luis Rodríguez and Plácido Domingo to record modern versions of traditional boleros. According to Miguel's former manager Mauricio Abaroa, although boleros were still recorded by traditional musicians at the time, [...] "what made Luis Miguel so successful was that it was a young man singing them and that he sang them like modern ballads".
