5|$|SMS Kaiser Karl VI ("His Majesty's Ship Kaiser Karl VI") was {{the second}} of three armored cruisers built by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste between June 1896 and May 1900, when she was {{commissioned}} into the fleet. Kaiser Karl VI represented <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> over the preceding designbeing faster and more heavily armed and armored.

Having no overseas colonies to patrol, Austria-Hungary built the ship solely to reinforce its battle fleet.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E

5|$|The Phantom {{represented}} <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> to the RAAF's {{ground attack}} capabilities. The F-4Es were more technologically advanced than the Canberra, {{as they could}} fly at supersonic speeds, were equipped with air-to-air radar and missiles, and had an inertial navigation system, ground-attack computer and a cannon. The Phantoms were capable of operating in several roles; the RAAF primarily used them as strike aircraft. This role was selected to prepare aircrew to operate F-111s, and most training exercises were focused on tasks that the F-111s would {{also be able to}} perform.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>improvement.</b> The Vulcan's powered flying {{controls}} were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which {{was driven by}} an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|The first tests using {{electric}} detonators and solid pits {{were performed on}} 7 and 14 February 1945; until then primacord-based initiation was employed.

Based on these results, {{by the end of}} February the design of the gadget, as the bomb was euphemistically known, was settled. Other test methods were also necessary, as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets that plagued the early implosion designs, but RaLa was the most important.|$|E

5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes {{to solve the}} problem of how to take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice embedded in the top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, taking advantage of the growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E

It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>improvement</b> over the old car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy's Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.|$|E
