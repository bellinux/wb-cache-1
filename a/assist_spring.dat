Three types of transient comparison methods were used, with similar results being obtained from all three methods. The experimen-tal results show that the check valves with low inertia, <b>assisted</b> by <b>springs</b> or small travelling distance/angle, gave better performance under pressure transient conditions as compared to check valves without these features. Although different amounts of air entrainment were found to affect the experimental readings, the general characteristics of each check valve remain the same when compared between valves.

40|$|Tests were {{performed}} {{to determine how the}} use of an elastic energy storage mechanism on the Leveraged Freedom Chair would affect the rider's metabolic efficiency. For this test, elastic bands were attached to the levers, and the rider's heart rate was recorded as he rode multiple lengths of a field in a timed trial, in both the <b>spring</b> <b>assisted</b> LFC and the traditional LFC. Efficiency in the <b>spring</b> <b>assisted</b> LFC, normalized by the efficiency measured on the traditional chair, was found to be [epsilon]n =. 684. This may indicate that there is a higher metabolic cost associated with pulling than with pushing in the LFC. The lower efficiency may also have resulted from the arbitrary choice of spring constant, as well as viscoelastic losses in the elastic bands. The user experienced much higher fatigue in the traditional LFC, primarily {{in the latter half of}} the 887 meter course, suggesting that in spite of the current decreases in efficiency, the spring system could add value by allowing users the option to travel longer distances. by Bassey Henry James.

40|$|Abstract—High mobility, {{maneuverability}} and obstacle surmounting {{capabilities are}} highly desirable features for rough-terrain locomotion systems. In past work, we examined kinetostatic optimization of candidate articulated leg-wheel subsystem designs (based on the four-bar mechanism) for enhancing locomotion capabilities of land-based vehicles. Our goal was to: (i) achieve the greatest motion-ranges between wheel axle and chassis while (ii) reducing the overall actuation requirements by <b>spring</b> <b>assist.</b> In the current work, {{we examine the}} possibility of enhancing this terrain-accommodation by: (i) proposing an “adjustable four-bar ” articulated-leg-wheel subsystem; (ii) with active-structural control to actively change subsystem parameters during the terrain traversal. Multiple leg-wheel design- parameters can affect the peak-static torque requirements as well as dynamic-bandwidth requirements for the leg-wheel actuation. The presented results compare and contrast online-structural reconfiguration planning (with multiple alternate active-adjustments) to reduce actuation requirements for a predetermined/sensed terrain traversal profile.
