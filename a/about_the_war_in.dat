He interspersed his non-fiction with further novels, and also wrote ten biographies and four volumes of poetry, as well as numerous articles and stories for magazines and journals. During the war he wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps, the novel which has been adapted for film and television more than any of his other work, (film versions in 1935; 1959; and 1978, as well as a 2008 version for British television).|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 1861, Morton {{addressed}} {{a special session}} of the Indiana General Assembly to obtain the legislature's approval to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana's troops. Morton also urged Indiana's legislators to set aside party considerations {{for the duration of}} the war and unite in defense of the Union, but the Republicans and Democrats did not cooperate for long. Initially, the Democratic-controlled legislature was supportive of Morton's measures and passed the legislation he requested. After the state legislature adjourned in May, however, some of the state's prominent Democrats changed their opinion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> <b>In</b> January 1862 the Democrats clarified their position at a state convention chaired by Thomas Hendricks. Indiana's Democrats stated that their support for the integrity of the Union and the war effort, but opposed emancipation of black and the abolition of slavery.|$|E

25|$|Edward {{was born}} on 15 June 1330 at Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire.

In England, Edward served as a symbolic regent for periods in 1339, 1340 and 1342 while Edward III was on campaign. He was expected to attend all council meetings and he performed the negotiations with the papacy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> 1337.

25|$|The French Right was {{ambivalent}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> late 1939 {{and early}} 1940, {{feeling that the}} Soviets rather than Nazi Germany were the greater long-term threat. Daladier regarded the war with Germany as the greater priority and so refused to send aid to the Finns, who were under attack from the USSR, then loosely allied to Germany, in the Winter War. News that the Finns had sued for peace in March 1940 prompted Flandin and Pierre Laval to hold secret sessions of the legislature that denounced Daladier's actions; the government fell on 19 March. The government named Reynaud Prime Minister of France two days later.|$|E

They agreed to talk on an unattributable basis, which allowed the BBC to report what was said but not to identify the source. Kelly told Gilligan of his concerns over the 45-minute claim and allegedly ascribed its inclusion in the dossier to Alastair Campbell, the director of communications for Tony Blair.|$|E

25|$|After George Galloway's {{expulsion}} from the Labour Party in October 2003 following his controversial statements <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Iraq, he {{became involved in}} Respect - The Unity Coalition (now the Respect Party) in an alliance with the Socialist Workers Party and leading figures from the Muslim Association of Britain. Galloway was elected as a Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow at the 2005 general election, where he defeated sitting Labour MP; Oona King. The association with the SWP ended in 2007. Galloway lost the seat at the 2010 general election, but returned to the House of Commons after winning the Bradford West by-election, 2012. Respect though has suffered from the resignation of leading members over the years, and Galloway lost his seat to Naz Shah of the Labour Party at the 2015 general election.|$|E
25|$|Voltaire's famous {{quotations}} about New France {{were for}} the most part written between 1753 and 1763, shortly before, and then during, the Seven Years' War. Voltaire was living in Switzerland during most of this period. During the war, he sometimes appeared to favor the Prussian king Frederick II (allied to Britain against France), with whom he was maintaining a regular personal correspondence during the war (the two men being again in better terms after their quarrel of 1753). Voltaire was also {{at the same time in}} correspondence with some French ministers. He thus corresponded with both sides of the belligerents in the war, although mostly on a personal and literary level more than a political level. He thought that the war was a mistake for France and he used several opportunities to ask the French ministers to simply quit the war. Boundary disputes in their American colonies had been an early casus belli (1754) between Britain and France in this war, which was later (1756) further complicated by purely European considerations and ended seven years later (1763). Voltaire's position that France should let go of its North American colonies was in accord with his position <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> general. For him, handing over New France would appease Britain. His position about the European war likely increased his tendency to paint New France as being of little value.|$|E

500|$|After {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, Shaw {{increasingly}} propagated his ideas through the medium of his plays. An early critic, writing in 1904, observed that Shaw's dramas provided [...] "a pleasant means" [...] of proselytising his socialism, adding that [...] "Mr Shaw's views are to be sought especially in the prefaces to his plays". After loosening his ties with the Fabian movement in 1911, Shaw's writings were more personal and often provocative; his response to the furore following the issue of Common Sense <b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> 1914, was to prepare a sequel, More Common Sense <b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>War.</b> <b>In</b> this, he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders, and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence. On the advice of Beatrice Webb, this pamphlet remained unpublished.|$|E

500|$|Lyne, who downplayed Rubin's [...] "intimidating" [...] Old Testament themes, {{said that}} he {{prepared}} for making the film by watching [...] "endless" [...] documentary films <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Vietnam and reading [...] "countless" [...] chronicles of near-death experiences. The film's plot device of {{a long period of}} subjective time passing in an instant has been explored by several authors. A particularly strong inspiration for both Rubin and Lyne was Robert Enrico's 1962 short film An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, one of Lyne's favourite movies, which was in turn based on Ambrose Bierce's 1890 short story of the same name.|$|E
500|$|These set {{the model}} for flash fiction– fiction that is {{condensed}} without unnecessary descriptive detail. In A Moveable Feast Hemingway wrote that [...] "Out of Season", written in 1924, was the first story where he applied the theory of omission, known as his Iceberg Theory. He explained that the stories in which he left out the most important parts, such as not writing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", are {{the best of his}} early fiction. As Carlos Baker describes the technique, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.

You will surely remember that in 1939 we were all {{of the opinion that}} Hitler was Germany. Although we were certainly depressed rather than enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Poland, we surely considered that the responsibility for it was {{to be found in the}} provocative conduct by the Poles, and it was the British who made of it a world war."
