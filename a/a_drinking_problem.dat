5|$|Following the {{collision}} Prime Minister Menzies ordered a Royal Commission {{to investigate the}} event. The Commissioner concluded that {{the collision}} was primarily the fault of Voyagers bridge crew not maintaining an effective lookout, but also placed blame on Melbournes Captain John Robertson (who resigned shortly after) and two other officers for failing to alert Voyager or take effective measures to avoid collision.
