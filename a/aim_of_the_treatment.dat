40|$|Port-wine stain is a {{congenital}} birthmark {{consisting of}} an abnormal density {{of blood vessels}} in the upper dermis.

[...] While the primary aim of reminiscence therapy is to strengthen cognitive memory components, a secondary goal may be to encourage either intrapersonal development or interpersonal development. These individual needs will determine whether the therapy is conducted in a group setting or alone with a practitioner. Memories are processed chronologically starting at birth and focusing on major, significant life events. The focus is reflection, not simply recall. Reminiscence therapy may use prompts such as photographs, household items, music, or personal recordings.|$|E

In general, perforations complicating colon cancers are divided into two categor ies, free perforation and penetration with abscess or fistula formation. It is emphasized that surgical outcome for free perforation is unsatisfactory.

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> infections <b>of</b> joint endoprostheses are {{relatively}} rare but {{they represent a}} major complication after <b>the</b> insertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artificial joint. For this reason {{it is very important}} to take measures in order to prevent these infections. <b>The</b> measures consist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following procedures: <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient for the operation, the perioperative antibiotic protection and <b>the</b> postoperative prevention <b>of</b> possible later hematogenically occurring infections. <b>The</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> prosthetic infections are to stop or alleviate the inflammation, to prevent or reduce <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> reoccurrence and to prevent a permanent, chronic infection. Clinically we try to achieve a functionally good result. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> is normally a combination of a surgical and a long-term antibiotic <b>treatment.</b> <b>The</b> patients with a stable implant, short-lived endoprosthetic infection with a microorganism susceptible to an antimicrobial agent can be successfully treated with debridement and specific antibiotics. In all other patients with a long-lived endoprosthetic infection and loose implant a more invasive procedure such as one-stage or even two-stage exchange has to be chosen. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> orthopaedic implants is demanding and complicated. Therefore we think that such patients can get proper medical care only in specialized medical centres. When <b>the</b> right <b>treatment</b> procedure has been chosen <b>the</b> prospects <b>of</b> a successful treatment outcome are favourable. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sjogren's {{syndrome}} (SS) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune disease, characterized by chronic inflammation of exocrine glands {{that results in}} development of xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. <b>The</b> disease activity <b>of</b> SS is not restricted to exocrine glands, and many other organs and organ systems can be involved. Diagnosis <b>of</b> SS in <b>the</b> elderly population can be challenging because xerostomia, dry eyes, symptoms of fatigue, weight loss and muscle pain are also common features of old age. Delay between clinical onset and diagnosis <b>of</b> SS in <b>the</b> elderly {{may be due to}} <b>the</b> shared features <b>of</b> SS and old age. The 2002 revised American European Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria for SS are the preferred tool used to confirm diagnosis of SS, but recently alternative criteria have been put forward by <b>the</b> American College <b>of</b> Rheumatology (ACR). <b>The</b> AECG criteria set combines subjective symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth with objective signs of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, salivary gland dysfunction and histopathological (salivary gland biopsy) and serological (autoantibodies against SSA/Ro and SSB/La antigens) features. <b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> SS in <b>the</b> elderly does not differ from that in younger patients. <b>The</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> SS are to control glandular and extraglandular manifestations, to prevent damage to organ systems and loss of function, and to decrease morbidity and mortality. <b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elderly can be complicated by co-morbidities, an increased rate of adverse events related to therapeutic agents, and polypharmacy.

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> most {{important}} <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> CLC are long-term relief of symptomsand elimination of cysts. Treatment {{of choice is}} yet debated. Methods: Data of patients treated for CLC during a 35 -years experience were retrospectively analyzed. Variables analyzed were: age, sex, hepatic cyst location, cyst diameter, symptoms, surgical procedure, short and long-term outcomes. Results: We examined 49 consecutive patients treated for CLC (mean follow-up, 76 months). The study was divided into two periods: 1975 - 1999 and 2000 - 2010. Procedures performed {{in the first period}} were needle aspiration and sclerotherapy (n= 6), hepatic resections (9), cystojejunostomy (4), open unroofing (10), and laparoscopic unroofing (8). Omentopexy within the residual cystic cavity was associated with seven open and two laparoscopic unroofing cases. Rates of morbidity and recurrence were 23. 5 % and 44. 1 %, respectively. One patient died in the peri-operative period. Procedures performed in the second period were open unroofing (9), laparoscopic unroofing (5), and hepatic resection (1). Omentopexy was associated with all open procedures and two laparoscopic procedures. Overall morbidity in this group was 16. 6 %, and recurrence occurred in one patient (6. 7 %). Conclusions: Cyst unroofing and omentopexy is a safe and highly effective procedure for <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> CLC.
