40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether it is possible to predict migration fat bloom based on measurements shortly after production. At different storage times shortly after production (0, 1, 4 h), the chocolate batches, varying in tempering method, tempering degree and amount of <b>added</b> <b>butter</b> oil, were evaluated by DSC, pNMR and texture analysis. Discriminant analysis and principal component analysis were combined to investigate the potential towards prediction. The batches were classified into groups depending on the time when white spots appeared (13 wk). A good separation (100 % correct classifications, 100 % using cross-validation) was obtained using the afore-mentioned analyses and storage times. It was also shown that it is possible to exclude DSC analyses or analyses at 0 h storage time without compromising the classification performances too drastically. The study further elucidated that the tempering method has no significant effect on visual fat bloom development. Furthermore, undertempered chocolates bloomed quicker than well-tempered ones, while fat bloom was delayed on overtempered chocolates. Addition of 6 % butter oil promoted fat bloom development, while no significant difference was detected between chocolate with no <b>added</b> <b>butter</b> oil and chocolate with 3 % <b>butter</b> oil <b>added.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Asida (عصيدة ‘aṣīdah) is a dish {{made up of}} a cooked {{wheat flour}} lump of dough, {{sometimes}} with <b>added</b> <b>butter</b> or honey. Similar to gruel or porridge, it is eaten in many North African countries. It is particularly popular in Algeria, Libya, Tunisia. It is usually eaten by hand, without the use of utensils. Often served during religious holidays such as Mawlid and Eid, it is also served during traditional ceremonies accompanying the birth of child, such as the ‘aqīqah, the cutting of the hair of a newborn seven days after birth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more modern}} (and popular) {{approach}} is to bake thicker bammies about 6" [...] in diameter. These are often mass-produced in factories. When home-baked, the flour may be store-bought or made by hand-pressing. The bammy can be baked on griddles or in baking pans on a stove top. Some choose to bake it inside an oven, and to <b>add</b> <b>butter</b> and other spices before baking. Baking takes longer due to the thickness, and the final product is then cut into halves or wedges for freezing. When ready to eat, the wedges are soaked in coconut milk and then fried to a golden brown, and served with meat, fish, avocado, or other side dishes.|$|E
50|$|The Vienna bakery of the {{exposition}} year {{made three}} kinds of bread: the sweet-fermented Imperial rolls; wheat and rye as well as rye-only loaves; and a large variety of fancy breads and sweet cakes. The Imperial rolls were made with the finer grades of flour, milk and water in a 50:50 ratio, beer yeast, and salt. Other breads made with the same grades of flour claimed to include: Teacakes, which <b>added</b> <b>butter</b> and may have excluded water in favor of milk; Gipfel or Pinnacle cake, which used milk (no water) and lard; and Brioche, made with milk and sugar.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} ways of {{flavoring}} lefse. The most common is <b>adding</b> <b>butter</b> to the lefse and rolling it up. In Norway, {{this is known as}} [...] "lefse-klenning". Other options include adding cinnamon and/or sugar, or spreading jelly, lingonberries or gomme on it. Scandinavian-American variations include rolling it with a thin layer of peanut butter and sugar, with butter and white or brown sugar, with butter and corn syrup, or with ham and eggs. Also eaten with beef and other savory items like Ribberull and mustard, it is comparable to a tortilla. Lefse is a traditional accompaniment to lutefisk, and the fish is often rolled up in the lefse.|$|R

25|$|Most {{frequently}} {{made from}} cows' milk, butter {{can also be}} manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks.

40|$|AbstractButter is a {{dairy product}} made by {{churning}} fresh or fermented cream or milk. It is generally {{used as a}} spread and as an ingredient in cooking purposes. The incorporation of natural ingredients with health benefits into butter {{is one way to}} increase its intake. The potential health benefits of cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) derived primarily from bioactive ingredients such as antioxidants, polyphenols and flavonoids. The objective {{of the present study was}} to improve the quality of butter made from cream with the addition of cinnamon extract. Milk cream with 36 % fat was churned at 10 oC to maintain the fat at high level with low moisture content. Based on preliminary investigation, soxhelt extraction of cinnamon quills was carried out with 39 % (v/v) ethanol. Butter was prepared by incorporating cinnamon extract into butter at 1, 3, and 5 % (w/w). Sensory evaluation was done using 20 semi trained panelists based on 5 point hedonic scale. It was found that cinnamon extract can be incorporated in to the butter formulation up to 3 % (w/w) without compromising the sensory attributes. It was subjected to further analysis with 1000 ppm potassium sorbate <b>added</b> <b>butter.</b> Changes in peroxide value, free fatty acids value and pH were monitored at weekly intervals. Microbiological studies (Total plate count and yeast and mold) were done at two weeks interval during two months storage period. Storage stability was tested at refrigeration (4 oC) condition. Total phenolic content and free radical scavenging activity of the 3 % cinnamon extract incorporated butter were 135. 62 ± 1. 00 μg GAE/mg and 38. 73 ± 0. 01 % DPPH, respectively. The cinnamon extract incorporated butter has shown low levels of peroxide value, free fatty acids value and low microbial count when compared to ordinary <b>butter</b> (without <b>adding</b> preservative) and potassium sorbate <b>added</b> <b>butter.</b> Antioxidant activity of cinnamon extends the shelf life of butter. This study demonstrates the 3 % cinnamon extract can be used to formulate an antioxidant rich butter and it can be placed as a natural preservative for preparation of butter...|$|R

5000|$|Kolbász is the Hungarian {{word for}} sausage. Hungarian cuisine {{produces}} {{a vast number}} of types of sausages. The most common smoked Hungarian sausages are Gyulai Kolbász, Csaba Kolbász, Csemege Kolbász, Házi Kolbász, Cserkész Kolbász, lightly smoked, like Debreceni Kolbász (or Debreciner) and Lecsókolbász, a spicy sausage made specifically for serving as part of the dish Lecsó, a vegetable stew with peppers and tomatoes. Hungarian boiled sausages are called [...] "Hurka", Liver Sausage, [...] "Májas", and Blood Sausage, [...] "Véres". All three types of blood sausages must be ingested within 6 hours of preparation to ensure a healthy pre and post-consumption experience per Hungarian regulations. It is considered rude not to reach completion of the whole sausage in a timely fashion, though it is not considered a crime. The main ingredient is liver and rice, or blood and rice. Salt, pepper, and spices are optionally <b>added.</b> <b>Butter</b> is not.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of cities and states in the US passed policies to ensure safety of milk. The laws were a response to the food industry's deception at that time. There were types of alteration in milk products on the market, such as water-dilution or <b>adding</b> <b>butter</b> or cheaper substitutes. In addition, spoiled milk is danger to health: infant mortality rate was lower in cities that had monitored milk production and sale. The Association was established in 1911 based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and there were 35 members. One of the members was from Canada, and one from Australia; the rest were from the US. According to the Association's constitution, an object is to develop “uniform and efficient inspection of dairy farms, milk establishments, milk and milk products” by “men who have a thorough knowledge of dairy work.” The object reflects the historical context when the Association was born.|$|R
