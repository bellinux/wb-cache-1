5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>compression</b> on {{the outer}} {{surfaces}} caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E
5|$|Owing to <b>air</b> <b>compression</b> {{in front}} of the plane as it {{travelled}} at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inflation}} valve is {{to compensate}} for <b>air</b> <b>compression</b> on descent. [...] The air inside the suit is compressed on descent squeezing the suit tightly and painfully onto the diver's body, especially where the suit folds. Suit squeeze also compresses insulating garments, reducing thermal protection, hinders the diver's freedom of movement and interferes with buoyancy control. [...] This is avoided by injecting compensating gas from the breathing gas cylinder, a small, dedicated inflation cylinder or the umbilical, via the inflation valve controlled by the diver. [...] Environmentally sealed suits which are sealed to the helmet automatically equalise from the breathing gas.|$|E

The international communities and organizations established relevant laws to restrict the emission and reduce the harm to human being and environment. In this paper, a numerical simulation model for diesel engine was established by GT-POWER in order to study the NO, CO and HC emissions characteristic of the diesel engine and the model was validated by experimental data. Based on the model, the variable parameters including injection timing, intake <b>air</b> temperature, <b>compression</b> ratio and EGR ratio were carried out.

This paper describes the fuzzy models of refrigerating compressor, expansion valve, evaporator and condenser as basic elements of vapor <b>compression</b> <b>air</b> conditioning system. Compressor speed, delivery pressure, refrigerant flow rate, valve opening area, pressure difference across the orifice of expansion valve, evaporator temperature, condenser temperature, evaporator superheat and condenser superheat have been taken as different variables for vapor compression elements. Fuzzy model of all the elements has been compared with their respective mathematical models for their validation.

2500|$|Reciprocating {{compressors}} use pistons {{driven by}} a crankshaft. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Small reciprocating compressors from 5 to 30horsepower (hp) are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty. Larger reciprocating compressors well over [...] are commonly found in large industrial and petroleum applications. Discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure (>18000 psi or 180 MPa). In certain applications, such as <b>air</b> <b>compression,</b> multi-stage double-acting compressors {{are said to be}} the most efficient compressors available, and are typically larger, and more costly than comparable rotary units.|$|E
2500|$|The twin turbos {{operated}} in sequential mode, not parallel. Initially, {{all of the}} exhaust is routed to the first turbine for reduced lag. This resulted in boost and enhanced torque as early as 1800 rpm, where it already produced [...] of torque. At 3500 rpm, some of the exhaust is routed to the second turbine for a [...] "pre-boost" [...] mode, although none of the compressor output {{is used by the}} engine at this point. At 4000 rpm, the second turbo's output is used to augment the first turbo's output. Compared to the parallel mode, sequential mode turbos provide quicker low RPM response and increased high RPM boost. This high RPM boost was also aided with technology originally present in the 7M-GE {{in the form of the}} Acoustic Control Induction System (ACIS) which is a way of managing the <b>air</b> <b>compression</b> pulses within the intake piping as to increase power.|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} {{enhancement of}} cellular metals including aluminium foams and honeycombs under dynamic compression is experimentally {{studied in the}} present paper, {{with a focus on}} the intermediate strain rate from 1 to 200 s 1. Previously data in this range are very limited due to the difﬁculty in the experimental techniques. The plateau stress in relation to the strain rate of these materials is discussed based on experimental results and compared with data from literature. It has been found that the studied cellular metals are sensitive to the strain rate in plateau stress but not in densiﬁcation strain. The causes of the strength enhancement are then discussed with a focus on the contribution of the entrapped <b>air</b> during <b>compression.</b> The results show that the pressure change of the entrapped <b>air</b> during dynamic <b>compression</b> is a direct source of strain hardening for aluminium honeycombs whereas it has less in- ﬂuence on the strain hardening of aluminium foams...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows an}} {{analysis}} of the applicability of an adsorption system for electric vehicle (EV) air conditioning. Adsorption systems are designed and optimized to provide the required cooling for four combinations of vehicle characteristics and driving cycles. The resulting adsorption systems are compared with vapor <b>compression</b> <b>air</b> conditioners that can satisfy the cooling load. The objective function is the overall system weight, which includes the cooling system weight and the weight of the battery necessary to provide energy for air conditioner operation. The system with the minimum overall weight is considered to be the best, because a lower weight results in an increased vehicle range. The results indicate that, for the conditions analyzed in this paper, vapor <b>compression</b> <b>air</b> conditioners are superior to adsorption systems not only because they are lighter, but also because they have a higher COP and are more compact...|$|R
