The exploitation of oil resources has been accompanied by impressive liberalization of the economy by the Government of Sudan.

40|$|Abstract. Since the {{publication}} of Guerre, Perrigne, and Vuong [2000, GPV], their two-step nonparametric estimation method has become the gold standard in empirical auctions work. One drawback of the method stems from a weakness of kernel-smoothed density estimators known as boundary effects: such estimators are inconsistent at the endpoints of the support and exhibit excessive (downward) bias within a neighborhood. Because of this problem, two-stage nonparametric estimators of first-price auctions require sample trimming, or discarding first-stage private value estimates based on bids near the sample extrema. Data loss can significantly reduce inferential power in auctions, where sample sizes are typically small to begin with and convergence rates of nonparametric estimators are relatively slow. In finite samples, this leads to poor performance on {{a substantial portion of}} the valuation support adjacent to the boundaries. It also negatively affects mean squared error on the interior of the support by making optimal bandwidth selection problematic. We propose a modification to the GPV estimator which incorporates a recent boundary-corrected kernel density estimator and allows the researcher to avoid sample trimming and the associated complications. We demonstrate a substantial improvement in finite-sample performance of the estimator through a Monte Carlo study. We then show how boundary correction easily applies to the various extensions of GPV and use it to analyze a dataset involving asymmetric affiliated bidders in oil lease auctions. We document how estimates and inferences change under the improved estimator. In particular, sample trimming masks a substantial degree of bidder asymmetry present in the data, as well as resulting inefficiencies in <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> leases...|$|R

40|$|A {{wealth of}} anecdotic {{evidence}} suggests that diplomacy {{plays an important role}} in the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> and other exaustible resource contracts in developing countries. I present an economic model of energy security that rationalizes the role of governments in facilitating the expansion of national resource FDIs. I begin by showing that the control of a large number of overseas contracts may allow a country to distort the terms of trade to its advantage, and that this may be optimal when prices are high despite the fact that it depresses the value of the contracts themselves. Because the benefit of such distortion are not captured by overseas investors, there is a role for governments to facilitate the expansion of national oil companies to the nationally optimal level. I then argue that natural resource contracts are longterm in nature, making a myopic resource-rich government potentially willing to exchange current transfers for a clientelistic allocation of contracts. The combination of these two elements create the scope for a natural resource diplomacy: this can be offensive (when it aims to make national resource hoarding possible) or simply defensive (when it is concerned with avoiding resource hoarding by other countries). I study the impact of diplomatic competition on the pattern of FDI, trade and welfare. Very preliminary draft, please do not quote or circulate. 1...|$|E
40|$|The armed {{conflict}} between militias and government forces in Nigeria’s Niger Delta region has spanned {{for more than}} two decades, defying all solutions. A disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) program was established in August 2015 in effort to end the violence and has remained in place. It is a radically different approach from past approaches that displayed zero tolerance to all political challenges to oil production or the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> profits. The approach appeared to be immediately successful in that it forced a ceasefire, engaged militants in planned programs to rehabilitate and reintegrate them into civilian society, and opened up the oil wells (many of which had been shut due to the crisis) with the effect of increasing government revenue, which depends 85 % on oil exports. Yet, few studies have attempted to understand the dynamics within the country that are responsible for the design and implementation of this broad policy shift or to understand whether and how the current initiative is able to end the conflict and institute peace beyond the short term. This study, therefore, is important because it provides a critical perspective that anticipates and explains emerging issues with the Niger Delta Amnesty Program, which have implications for DDR adaptation and implementation all over the world. Ultimately, the research demonstrates how the DDR program both transforms the Niger Delta conflict and becomes embroiled in intense contestations not only about the mechanism for transforming the targeted population but also whether and how the program incorporates women who are being deprioritized by the program...|$|E
