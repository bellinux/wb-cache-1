500|$|IV, Diamond Rio's fourth album, was {{released}} in 1996. It was the [...] "first country release recorded entirely on a digital console"; specifically, a Fairlight console which recorded the album directly to a hard drive. Produced by DuBois, Clute, and the band itself, it was also their first album not to have Powell as a co-producer. According to DuBois, Powell left this role on good terms, as he [...] "saw a need {{to go in a}} certain direction, and the guys saw a need to go in a different direction." [...] Roe thought that the album benefited from a new label policy that allowed label personnel to respond more quickly to pitches from songwriters, specifically recalling to Billboard that the label's head of artists and repertoire (A) recommended the lead single [...] "Walkin' Away" [...] while co-writer Craig Wiseman (who co-wrote [...] "Bubba Hyde") was still recording its demo, and the band was able to record the song in the same day that the demo was completed. [...] "Walkin' Away" [...] peaked at No.2 on the country charts in early 1996. Three more singles were released from the album: the top 10 hits [...] "That's What I Get for Lovin' You" [...] and [...] "Holdin'" [...] (also written by Wiseman), with the top 20 [...] "It's <b>All</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Head", co-written by Van Stephenson, in between. The music video for [...] "It's <b>All</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Head" [...] featured Martin Sheen and Ramon Estevez, the former playing the part of a snake handling preacher.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} production, {{the group}} of musicians had to work faster than they intended. [...] "We kind of ran out of time at the end," [...] said Beck. [...] "Joni Mitchell was coming in to do her record, but she works very civilized and she takes the weekend off, so we were sneaking in on the {{weekends}} and trying to finish." [...] Eventually, recording lasted a little over three weeks and the album was mixed from there on, which was completed May 7. At one session, Hansen began strumming his 1995 single [...] "It's <b>All</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Mind" [...] randomly before beginning a new song, and Godrich became ecstatic, remarking [...] "We have to do that." [...] The strikingly different re-recorded version appears on Sea Change as an [...] "evolved song", according to Hansen.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2003, the {{remaining}} four members of No Angels began intensifying work on their third regular album. Encouraged to exercise more self-control on the longplayer, the band took over responsibility in recording and selecting songs to guarantee a more personal effort [...] a step that challenged criticism and growing scepticism among the band's label Cheyenne Records and recording company Polydor. Titled Pure, the album was eventually released in August 2003 and became the band's third number-one album in Germany. Sporting a more mature side of pop music, it earned them their best reactions yet, drawing comparisons to Madonna's album Ray of Light (1998) {{as well as other}} female groups such as All Saints and the Sugababes. With a total of about 150,000 copies sold however, it failed to achieve the success of its two best-selling predecessors, still going gold. Rock pop-influenced leading single [...] "No Angel (It's <b>All</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Mind)" [...] became the group's fourth non-consecutive number-one single in Germany and seventh top ten hit in Austria, while mediterran [...] "Someday" [...] and R-driven [...] "Feelgood Lies" [...] both reached the top five of the charts.|$|E
2500|$|Preceded {{by their}} fourth number-one single, [...] "No Angel (It's <b>All</b> <b>in</b> <b>Your</b> Mind)" [...] and top five single [...] "Someday", the group's third album, Pure, was {{released}} in August 2003. It was their first album as a quartet. Although the album was less successful than its predecessors, it was still certified gold. The album spawned one more single, [...] "Feelgood Lies", which reached number three in Germany. The group announced that they were splitting up in Autumn 2003, and released one final album, The Best of No Angels, a greatest hits album with all of their singles. It peaked at number five in Germany for two weeks. The band re-formed in 2007 and released their fourth studio album, Destiny in April 2007. The album was less successful than their previous albums, peaking at number four in Germany, making it their first studio album not {{to reach the top}} spot. Although the singles produced failed to match the success of its preceders, it produced two top five hits with the comeback single [...] "Goodbye to Yesterday" [...] and the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008, [...] "Disappear". The band's second post-reunion album, Welcome to the Dance, {{was released in}} September 2009. It peaked at number twenty-six, lasting two weeks in the German albums chart, making it both, their lowest-charting and selling album to date. Its first and only single [...] "One Life" [...] peaked at number fifteen in Germany.|$|E
