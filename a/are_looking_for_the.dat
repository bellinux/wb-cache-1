5|$|Phineas and Ferb's parents, Linda and Lawrence, {{are arguing}} over {{something}} Lawrence has forgotten. Linda goes out {{alone for the}} afternoon, leaving Lawrence confused; then Candace informs him that today is his wedding anniversary. Lawrence goes to the garage {{to search for a}} gift and discovers an old album by Love Händel: he explains to the children that he and Linda shared their first kiss at the band's farewell concert. Lawrence despairs of recapturing the moment, but Candace, Phineas, and Ferb watch a Where Are They Now?-type special about Love Händel, and decide to reform the band. Candace tries to keep Linda away from the house while Phineas and Ferb <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> members of the band.|$|E
5|$|The Pasha'a daughter, Murana, {{finds him}} hiding and orders her servant {{to assist in}} Jack's escape. Guards appear and {{announce}} that they <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> escaped prisoner, but they are turned away. Dressed up as a woman, Jack tries to have Murana flee with him. She says that one day she cannot marry him now, but she may come to his country one day. Jack trades a flower for his business card and departs. A year later, Jack and his mother have a visitor ushered and they stand in confusion at the beautiful young woman. Jack does not recognize her until she covers {{her face with her}} veil and she announces her intention to be his bride.|$|E
5|$|Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter) are two {{brothers}} that Ellie and Joel encounter {{while trying to}} escape {{from a group of}} hunters in Pittsburgh. Henry is 25 years old, while Sam is thirteen. Joel and Henry initially think each other are hostile, until they see Sam and Ellie, respectively. Like Joel, Henry is an experienced survivor, and the two decide to team up, since both pairs <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Fireflies. They work together to overpower the bandits guarding the exit to the Quarantine Zone, and escape to an abandoned radio tower in the Suburbs. There, Joel and Henry bond over their mutual love of motorbikes, but Sam becomes morose and introverted, particularly after a conversation with Ellie over death and the Infected. The next day, it emerges that Sam was bitten while escaping the Suburbs, and he attacks Ellie, forcing Henry to kill him. Overcome with grief and guilt at his brother's death, Henry commits suicide with his gun.|$|E

25|$|Venture capitalists are {{typically}} very selective in {{deciding what to}} invest in; as a result, firms <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> extremely rare yet sought-after qualities such as innovative technology, potential for rapid growth, a well-developed business model, and an impressive management team. Of these qualities, funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame (typically 3–7 years) that venture capitalists expect.|$|E
25|$|Others <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> missing {{telemetry}} tapes {{for different}} reasons. The tapes contain {{the original and}} highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They {{have found that the}} Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The tapes are believed to have been stored rather than re-used. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the Moon landings.|$|E

25|$|The actors first {{receive the}} script {{in form of}} a table draft and film the episode the next Monday, by which time the story may have changed drastically. The script keeps {{evolving}} during shooting. The actors first perform scenes as written, then act out the alts or improvise, to later allow the producers and editors to choose the gags that ultimately work best. Morris estimated that 20 percent of each episode are improv. Episodes are generally shot over five days, which may increase to several weeks if weather conditions delay filming outdoor scenes. The scenes are put together in the editing room until they achieve the emotional and comedic tone the producers <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> <b>The</b> first cut of generally 27 minutes has to be cut down to the air version's 21 minutes and 35 seconds, which may air {{as little as a}} few days later. Only upon completion do the producers know what version ends up in the episode.|$|E
25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> <b>the</b> shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

Glass encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc, who says that [...] "revenge is in the Creator's hands." [...] The men share bison meat and travel together. After a hallucinogenic experience, Glass discovers Hikuc hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. He frees her, kills two hunters, and steals Hikuc's horse, leaving his canteen behind. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse. He survives the stormy night by eviscerating the horse and sheltering inside its carcass.|$|E

2500|$|As above, let [...] denote a {{translation}} operator that shifts every wave function {{by the amount}} , where ni are integers. Because the crystal has translational symmetry, this operator commutes with the Hamiltonian operator. Moreover, every such translation operator commutes with every other. Therefore, there is a simultaneous eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian operator and every possible [...] operator. This basis is what we <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> <b>The</b> wavefunctions in this basis are energy eigenstates (because they are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian), and they are also Bloch waves (because they are eigenstates of the translation operators; see Lemma above).|$|E

[...] And in the early 1950s, she thought she had a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to Catholicism. There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir. But West's attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: [...] "I could not go on with being a Catholic... I don't want, I can't bear to, become a Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation." [...] Her writings of the 1960s and early 1970s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: [...] "The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to believe anything it says about Him." ...|$|E

[...] Huckabee responded by saying if voters <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> toughest guy on immigration, he's not their man. [...] Nevertheless, like many in the Republican party, Huckabee's position has evolved, particularly after the bruising immigration reform fight in the summer of 2007. [...] On December 6, 2007, he released a nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. [...] These were modeled on a ten-point plan proposed in 2005 by Mark Krikorian. [...] On January 16, 2008, Huckabee became the first presidential candidate to sign Americans for Better Immigration's No-Amnesty pledge. [...] In response, Roy Beck's organization raised his rating on illegal immigration to EXCELLENT. [...] Huckabee continues to speak for the dignity of legal immigrants. [...] In the January 10 Republican debate he said that all immigrants [...] "ought to live with their heads up.. We ought to have the assumption that everybody here is legal, that nobody here is illegal." ...|$|E
