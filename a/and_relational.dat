25|$|The {{potency of}} the {{personal}} self <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as “group identification”. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is growing evidence of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.|$|E

40|$|Distinguishing between <b>relational</b> <b>and</b> {{physical}} aggression {{has become a}} key feature of many developmental studies in North America and Western Europe, but very little information is available on <b>relational</b> <b>and</b> {{physical aggression}} in more diverse cultural contexts. This study examined the factor structure of, associations between, and gender differences in <b>relational</b> <b>and</b> physical aggression in China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States. Children ages 710 years (N = 1, 410) reported on their relationally and physically aggressive behavior. <b>Relational</b> <b>and</b> physical aggression shared a common factor structure across countries. In all nine countries, <b>relational</b> <b>and</b> physical aggression were significantly correlated (average r =. 49). Countries differed in the mean levels of both <b>relational</b> <b>and</b> physical aggression that children reported using and with respect to whether children reported using more physical than relational aggression or more relational than physical aggression. Boys reported being more physically aggressive than girls across all nine countries; no consistent gender differences emerged in relational aggression. Despite mean-level differences in <b>relational</b> <b>and</b> physical aggression across countries, the findings provided support for cross-country similarities in associations between <b>relational</b> <b>and</b> physical aggression as well as links between gender and aggression.

Functional analytic psychotherapy is one form of this approach. By nature, behavioral therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused {{on the environment and}} context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behavior ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behavior as statistically predictable), monistic (rejecting mind-body dualism and treating the person as a unit), <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> (analyzing bidirectional interactions).|$|E

25|$|Swiss {{psychiatrist}} Carl Jung, {{influenced by}} Freud, elaborated {{a theory of}} the collective unconscious—a primordial force present in all humans, featuring archetypes which exerted a profound influence on the mind. Jung's competing vision {{formed the basis for}} analytical psychology, which later led to the archetypal and process-oriented schools. Other well-known psychoanalytic scholars of the mid-20th century include Erik Erikson, Melanie Klein, D. W. Winnicott, Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, John Bowlby, and Sigmund Freud's daughter, Anna Freud. Throughout the 20th century, psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools of thought which could be called Neo-Freudian. Among these schools are ego psychology, object relations, and interpersonal, Lacanian, <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> psychoanalysis.|$|E
25|$|Martin and Sugarman {{describe}} {{memory and}} imagination as two ontic (real) characteristics {{of human nature}} which are vital to humans' capacity for dialogue. According to Martin and Sugarman, it is through both that {{people are able to}} remember the conversations that “we furnished with the symbolic <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> tools we require to consider past experiences and previous learning, and to entertain future possibilities” because memory allows humans to reconstruct their past while imagination allows them “to project selves into the future”. In other words, when humans converse with others, they recall memories and imagine future possibilities to help themselves mentally construct potential ways for understanding themselves (self-interpretation) and their world, and their place in it, so they know how to relate to others.|$|E
25|$|Emotions play an {{important}} part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the decision {{as to whether or not}} to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior, and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> outcomes and may play out differently across cultural boundaries.|$|E

25|$|When {{first asked}} to {{distinguish}} between all, some, and one Genie would interpret some to mean all, but by 1975 she reversed this and began mistaking some for one, which Curtiss interpreted {{as a sign of}} progress. This contrasted with her distinction between more and less, which she had demonstrated by at least August 1973, and her understanding of the qualifiers one and all in everyday conversations. When learning relative terms such as large and small or narrow and wide she simultaneously learned both words in the pair, whereas most people acquire either the marked or the negative form first, and never mistakenly used one term in a pair to mean the other. Although she had difficulty with different pairs of relative <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> terms on tests, she showed significantly greater comprehension outside of test settings.|$|E
25|$|Alex Comfort {{and others}} propose three {{potential}} social aspects {{of sexual intercourse}} in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational. The development of the contraceptive pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also {{as a means of}} emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive <b>and</b> <b>relational).</b>|$|E
25|$|Youth {{exclusion}} is multi-dimensional in that age, race, gender, {{class and}} lifestyle all affect youth life experiences {{within a given}} culture. This intersectionality affects {{the degree to which}} an individual youth experiences exclusion. Similarly, youth exclusion is context specific. This means that youth are excluded from society in different ways depending on their cultural and spatial locations. A simple difference between the opportunities and resources provided in one neighborhood can create a divide among youth who are included and youth who are excluded from their communities. Another consideration is that youth exclusion is relational insofar as social exclusion contains two parties, the excluders and the excluded. Pertaining to youth exclusion, the excluders are often older generations who believe that the economic support services and institutions that help the youth puts their own comfortable standard of living at risk. All of these demographic, cultural, spatial <b>and</b> <b>relational</b> factors contribute to the worldwide experiences of youth exclusion.|$|E

Few research {{studies have examined the}} relationship between parenting <b>and</b> childhood <b>relational</b> aggression. Furthermore, only one previous published investigation has examined the relationship between observed parenting <b>and</b> child <b>relational</b> aggression. The current study examined the relationship between six observed parenting factors (laxness, overreactivity, negative affect, disparagement, problem-solving, and positive emotional support) <b>and</b> teacher-reported <b>relational</b> aggression. Forty-six children, mainly of European-American and Puerto-Rican descent, between 7 and 10 years old (M = 8. 29, SD =. 75), participated in the study. Observational data from a discipline (clean-up) task and a problem-solving task were used to assess the six parenting factors. In the overall sample, none of the parenting factors predicted child relational aggression. However, laxness significantly predicted relational aggression for girls. Furthermore, for Puerto Rican children, negative affect <b>and</b> disparagement predicted <b>relational</b> aggression. Future studies should continue to explore the relationship between <b>relational</b> aggression <b>and</b> parenting and attempt to identify protective factors for relational aggression...|$|R
