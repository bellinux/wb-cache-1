5|$|During Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), {{the use of}} Pe̍h-ōe-jī was {{suppressed}} and it faced further countermeasures {{during the}} Kuomintang martial law period (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China (1949) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there. Taiwanese Christians, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> continue to use Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on fonts, input methods, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is ongoing debate within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement as to which system should be used. Versions of pe̍h-ōe-jī have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min.|$|E

5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. <b>Among</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. <b>Among</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} hurricane of 1842 severely affected coastal North Carolina from Wilmington to Currituck on July 12. Its center likely remained {{just east}} of Cape Hatteras as it washed away houses, drowned livestock, and wreaked havoc on shipping interests. Nearly 30 ships ran aground near Ocracoke Inlet, and two unidentified vessels were wrecked on the shoals near Cape Hatteras with all hands lost; seven more men drowned while trying to salvage goods from the shipwrecks. In late October, a message in a bottle was recovered at Bermuda with {{an account of the}} storm from the captain and first mate of the imperiled schooner Lexington, presumed lost at sea. In total, around 40 ships were lost. Although sparse records preclude an accurate death toll, the National Hurricane Center lists the cyclone <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> may have caused 25 or more fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. <b>Among</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 1963, the CIP {{was briefly}} {{suspended}} by the United States {{in the wake}} of the McNamara Taylor mission, a fact-finding expedition to South Vietnam conducted by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Maxwell D. Taylor to investigate the progress of the fight against the communist Vietcong insurgency. The report concluded that Diem was not concentrating on fighting the insurrection but was instead preoccupied with quelling Buddhist protests for religious equality, such as raiding pagodas and firing on Buddhist dissidents. One of the reasons for the CIP suspension was to give military officers a signal that Washington was unhappy with Diem and therefore increase the prospects of a coup, as well as to try and foster urban resentment towards Diem <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> had previously benefited from the CIP. Another was that Diem might change his policy direction in accordance with US wishes, although they considered this to be unlikely. Funding was restored in early November 1963, about a month later, after the deposal and assassination of Diem in a military coup.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{southern}} Massachusetts, from its border with New York toward Worcester {{and to the}} ocean, experienced flooding. Most streams in western Massachusetts overflowed their banks, and in southeastern Massachusetts, which is largely flat terrain, streams flooded large areas along their channels; these streams moved slowly, while other areas in New England sustained damage due to the fast-moving nature of the floods. Record flooding was reported along 24stream gauges in the state, including ones that surpassed the peak set by the 1938 New England hurricane. Both the Charles and Neponset rivers were <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> flooded. About 40% {{of the city of}} Worcester was flooded during Diane, and in Russell, the state police forced many residents to evacuate. In Weymouth, the floods were considered at least a 1 in 50 year event. The Little River in Buffumville, Massachusetts had a peak discharge of 8,340ft³/s (236m³/s), which was 6.2times greater than the previous peak and 28.5times the average annual flooding. Flooded rivers breached run-of-the-river dams and covered nearby roadways, although dams with reservoirs resulted in less flooding. Nearly all dams along the French River were severely damaged or destroyed. One failed dam in West Auburn washed out a portion of U.S. Route 20, and the same route was washed out near Charlton. An overflown brook also damaged the Massachusetts Turnpike. A train on the Boston and Albany Railroad line plunged into a washed out portion along the Westfield River. Along the same river, floods destroyed roads and tobacco farms. In the state, 97houses were destroyed. Damage in Massachusetts was second worst of the affected states, totaling $110million; the damage was largely due to flooded basements. There were 12deaths in the state.|$|E
