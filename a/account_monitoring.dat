It also explores some of the key impacts of austerity and <b>accounting</b> <b>monitoring</b> and how arts organisations coped with them. The findings suggest that the discourses of accounting and austerity were associated with a variety of forms of colonisation and limited resistance along a continuum. The discourse of austerity was portrayed as much more problematic and colonising than the extensive <b>accounting</b> <b>monitoring</b> which was taken for granted. The discourses and practices of austerity were implicated in morally ambiguous and role-conflicted organisational behaviour suggesting sublimated legitimation crisis tendencies but there was no evidence of widespread Habermasian motivation crisis in relation to austerity or <b>accounting</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Some organisational members responded actively to accounting colonisation, and as a reorientation or reversal of colonisation, created transformations of accounting through a range of narrative and visual reporting methods. Their evaluation of such qualitative data revealed an expression of autonomy in the face of pathological accounting colonisation, whilst paradoxically creating self-challenging monitoring procedures...|$|R

Given plausible parameter values, the model predicts asymmetric preferences for the timing of resolution of uncertainty: Individuals should monitor and attend to information more actively given preliminary good news but “put their heads in the sand ” by avoiding additional information given adverse prior news.

Consumers may develop attitudes based on previous experience with identity theft and fraud. These attitudes affect {{the wide variety of}} behaviours consumers employ to prevent identity theft, detect identity fraud, and mitigate the impacts of identity fraud. Using survey data, this paper examines the relationship between past experience of consumers and their levels of concern, and derives the principal components that make up consumer behaviours. The components are physical prevention measures, <b>account</b> <b>monitoring,</b> agency monitoring, password security, and risky behaviour avoidance. These components were found to be almost orthogonal, implying that consumers tend to 'buy into ' a particular component of behaviour, employing all the behaviours in that component without regard to other components. This can leave 'holes ' in consumer defence against identity theft and fraud. Finally, the relationship between the levels of concern and these components of consumer behaviour are also examined...|$|E

From this standpoint, thermography can be indicated as a valid tool to monitor damage initiation and its evolution during testing, and to estimate fatigue life...|$|E

Results from a Belgium-wide survey of Campylobacter contamination in chicken meat preparations (n = 656 samples) showed that Campylobacter was detected in 24. 2 % {{of the samples}} by enrichment, compared with 41 % detected by direct plating.

The parallel use of direct plating and enrichment culture adds value for Campylobacter detection from chicken meat preparations, but the false-negative results from each culture method must be taken into <b>account.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> data could be strongly biased by the microbiological techniques used to generate it.

Limited knowledge of irrigated crop production among farmers {{has been identified as}} one of the constraints to improved crop productivity, but research that investigates the relationship between farmer practices and productivity is lacking. A monitoring study was therefore conducted at the Zanyokwe Irrigation Scheme (ZIS) in the Eastern Cape to identify cropping systems and management practices used by farmers and to determine how these were related to performance. Evidence from 2 case studies showed that water management limited crop productivity. Irrigation application and system efficiencies were below the norm and irrigation scheduling did not take crop type and growth stage into <b>account.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> of 20 farmers over a 3 -yr period showed that cropping intensity averaged only 48 % and that the yields of the 2 main summer crops, grain maize (Zea mays L.) and butternut (Cucurbita moschata) averaged only 2. 4 and 6. 0 t∙ha- 1, respectively. In addition to poor water management, other main constraints to crop productivity were inadequate weed and fertiliser management and low plant populations. The results indicated that a lack of basic technical skills pertaining to irrigated crop production among farmers was a possible cause of inadequate management. In this regard, it is expected that farmers could benefit from ‘back to basics ’ trainin...|$|E

Moreover it is oftentimes very difficult to balance the importance of multiple ecological, social, and economical metrics. Metric selection process is a complex and must simultaneously take into <b>account</b> <b>monitoring</b> data, environmental models, socio-economic considerations, and stakeholder interests. We propose multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, broadly defined, for the {{selection of}} optimal sets of metrics to enhance evaluation of ecosystem restoration alternatives. Two MCDA methods, a multiattribute utility analysis (MAUT), and a probabilistic multicriteria acceptability analysis (ProMAA), are applied and compared for a hypothetical case study of a river restoration involving multiple stakeholders. Overall, the MCDA results in a systematic, unbiased, and transparent solution, informing restoration alternatives evaluation. The two methods provide comparable results in terms of selected metrics. However, because ProMAA can consider probability distributions for weights and utility values of metrics for each criteria, it is suggested as the best option if data uncertainty is high. Despite the increase in complexity in the metric selection process, MCDA improves upon the current ad-hoc decision practice based on the consultations with stakeholders and experts, and encourages transparent and quantitative aggregation of data and judgement, increasing the transparency of decision making in restoration projects. We believe that MCDA can enhance the overall sustainability of ecosystem by enhancing both ecological and societal needs...|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} of metrics for ecosystem restoration programs {{is critical for}} improving the quality and utility of design and monitoring programs, informing adaptive management actions, and characterizing project success. The metrics selection process, that in practice is left to the subjective judgment of stakeholders, is often complex and should simultaneously take into <b>account</b> <b>monitoring</b> data, environmental models, socio-economic considerations, and stakeholder interests. With limited funding, it is often very difficult to balance the importance of multiple metrics, often competing, intended to measure different environmental, social, and economic aspects of the system. To help restoration planners and practitioners develop the most useful and informative design and monitoring programs, we propose the use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, broadly defined, to select optimal ecosystem restoration metric sets. In this paper, we apply and compare two MCDA methods, multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), and probabilistic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (ProMAA), for a hypothetical river restoration case study involving multiple stakeholders with competing interests. Overall, the MCDA results in a systematic, quantitative, and transparent evaluation and comparison of potential metrics that provides planners and practitioners with a clear basis for selecting the optimal set of metrics to evaluate restoration alternatives and to inform restoration design and monitoring. In our case study, the two MCDA methods provide comparable results in terms of selected metrics. However, because ProMAA can consider probability distributions for weights and utility values of metrics for each criterion, it is most likely the best option for projects with highly uncertain data and significant stakeholder involvement. Despite the increase in complexity in the metrics selection process, MCDA improves upon the current, commonly used ad-hoc decision practice based on consultations with stakeholders by applying and presenting quantitative aggregation of data and judgment, thereby increasing the effectiveness of environmental design and monitoring and the transparency of decision making in restoration projects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} EDF practice about {{concrete structure}} ageing management, from the mechanisms analysis {{to the formal}} procedure which allows the French company to increase 900 MWe NPP lifetime until 40 years; it will also introduce its action plan for 60 years lifetime extension. This practice {{is based on a}} methodology which identifies every ageing mechanism; both plants feedback and state of the art are screened and conclusions are drawn up into an “ageing analysis data sheet”. That leads at first to a collection of 57 data sheets which give the mechanism identification, the components that are concerned and an analysis grid which is designed to assess the safety risk. This analysis screens the reference documents describing the mechanism, the design lifetime hypotheses, the associated regulation or codification, the feedback experiences, the accessibility, the maintenance actions, the repair possibility and so one. This analysis has to lead to a conclusion about the risk taking into <b>account</b> <b>monitoring</b> and maintenance. If the data sheet conclusion is not clear enough, then a more detailed report is launched. The technical document which is needed, is a formal detailed report which summarizes every theoretical knowledge and monitoring data: its objective is to propose a solution for ageing management: this solution can include more inspections or specific research development, or additional maintenance. After a first stage on the 900 MWe units, only two generic ageing management detailed reports have been needed for the civil engineering part: one about reactor building containment, and one about other structures which focuses on concrete inflating reactions. The second stage consists on deriving this generic analysis (ageing mechanism and detailed reports) to every plant where a complete ageing report is required (one report for all equipments and structures of the plant, but specific for each reactor). This ageing management is a continuous process because the 57 generic data sheets set is updated every year and the detailed generic reports every five years. After this 40 year lifetime extension, EDF is preparing a 60 years lifetime action plan which includes R&D actions, specific industrial studies and also monitoring improvements...|$|E
40|$|River {{discharges}} have a {{great effect}} on oceanographic properties and production processes in the marine ecosystem of the Northern Adriatic Sea. The combination between meteorological forcings and the spreading of river waters, mainly from the Po River, determine formation and dynamics of the coastal fronts in the Western and Northern part of this continental shelf area, through the generation of alternated vertical and horizontal density gradients that drive the circulation of surface waters and the pattern of Southward flowing West Adriatic Current. High inputs of river borne nutrients sustain the peaks of production in this marine system, in particular during spring and autumn. However, they may also cause hypoxic or anoxic crises in the deeper waters, in case of weak circulation. Strong density gradients coupled to alternate ambient conditions experienced by plankton communities in the coastal area, due to the dynamics of low and high salinity waters, are also at the basis of dystrophic events that have often occurred in this area, such as the appearance of large dinoflagellate blooms and mucilage phenomenon. Despite its basic importance, the role of river loads in the Northern Adriatic Sea has been poorly studied, to date. A number of studies {{were published in the}} literature, mostly for Po and Adige rivers, {{as a result of the}} efforts addressed to the mitigation of eutrophication problems in the coastal zones carried out during the 19702 ̆ 7 and the 19802 ̆ 7, while the comparison of river loads at sub-regional scale still remains largely incomplete.
