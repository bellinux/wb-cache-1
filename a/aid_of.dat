5|$|Although Sicily {{had been}} raided by the Muslims since the mid-7th century, these raids did not {{threaten}} Byzantine {{control over the}} island, which remained a largely peaceful backwater. The opportunity for the Aghlabid emirs of Ifriqiya came in 827, when {{the commander of the}} island's fleet, Euphemius, rose in revolt against the Byzantine Emperor Michael II. Defeated by loyalist forces and driven from the island, Euphemius sought the <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> the Aghlabids. The latter regarded this as an opportunity for expansion and for diverting the energies of their own fractious military establishment and alleviate the criticism of the Islamic scholars by championing jihad, and dispatched an army to aid him. Following the Arab landing on the island, Euphemius was quickly sidelined. An initial assault on the island's capital, Syracuse, failed, but the Muslims were able to weather the subsequent Byzantine counter-attack and hold on to a few fortresses. With the <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements from Ifriqiya and al-Andalus, in 831 they took Palermo, which became the capital of the new Muslim province.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> elevators.|$|E
