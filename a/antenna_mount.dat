50|$|In use, {{the antenna}} was swung by command from the {{operations}} van, the angle being read by reading numbers {{painted on the}} <b>antenna</b> <b>mount.</b> The radar operated at 106 MHz, using a pulse width from 10 to 25 microseconds, and a pulse repetition frequency of 621 Hz. With a wavelength of about nine feet, the SRC-270 was comparable to the contemporary Chain Home system being developed in England, {{but not to the}} more advanced microwave systems in Germany. This frequency did turn out to be useful, as it is roughly the size of an airplane's propeller, and provided strong returns from them depending on the angle. Generally it had an operational range of about 150 mi, and consistently picked up aircraft at that range. A nine-man field operating crew consisted of a shift chief, two oscilloscope operators, two plotters, two technicians, and two electricians.|$|E
5000|$|After trials, the {{original}} XAF was improved and designated CXAM; these 200-MHz (1.5-m), 15-kW sets went into limited production with first deliveries in May 1940. The CXAM was refined into the SK early-warning radar, with deliveries starting in late 1941. This 200-MHz (1.5-m) system used a [...] "flying bedspring" [...] antenna {{and had a}} PPI. With 200-kW peak-power output, it could detect aircraft at ranges up to 100 miles, and ships at 30 miles. The SK remained the standard early-warning radar for large U.S. vessels throughout the war. Derivatives for smaller vessels were SA and SC. About 500 sets of all versions were built. The related SD was a 114-MHz (2.63-m) set designed by the NRL for use on submarines; with a periscope-like <b>antenna</b> <b>mount,</b> it gave early warning but no directional information. The BTL developed a 500-MHz (0.6-m) fire-control radar designated FA (later, Mark 1). A few went into service in mid-1940, but with only 2-kW power, they were soon replaced.|$|E

5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod <b>antenna</b> <b>mounted</b> on the turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star <b>antenna</b> D"), <b>mounted</b> on an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfuß Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod <b>antenna</b> <b>mounted</b> on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod <b>antenna</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rear deck.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the keyhole {{problems}} associated with present antenna mounting systems and to meet the requirements of acquisition and tracking for high gain and narrow beamwidth antennas, a novel <b>antenna</b> <b>mount</b> system is developed. The antenna is mounted on a microprocessor controlled robotic platform with six degrees of freedom. The mechanism is based on the principles of Stewart platform, which employes six variable length actuators constrained between a fixed base and a movable platform. This <b>antenna</b> <b>mount</b> is especially suitable for high gain antennas using high frequency band widths for marine satellite communications. The kinematics and geometry of the parallel link mechanism has been studied in detail. The kinematic analysis for the parallel manipulator consists of developing a set of kinematic equations for the six linear actuators in terms of the "world coordinates" (Ф,θ,α,x,y,z). These kinematic equations are then solved for the "machine coordinates'" (L 1,L 2,L 3,L 4,L 5,L 6), which are the six actuator lengths. A computer simulation has been done to model the motion of the platform. The simulation has simplified the task of examining various mechanism configurations, the range of motion and the mechanism mechanical constraints. A six motor controller board based on the motion controller microprocessors has been developed. Limited unipolar pulse width modulated servo drives are used to drive the permanent magnet DC motors of the linear actuators. A desktop computer is used as the host processor to generate the command data. The motion control microprocessors generate the velocity and acceleration profiles and drive the six axes simultaneously. The main control programme residing in the host processor schedules the overall operation. The orbital satellite bearings are calculated on a minicomputer and downloaded to the control desktop computer. A prototype <b>antenna</b> <b>mount</b> based on the descriptions above was designed, constructed and tested for tracking a high pass and low pass of an orbiting weather satellite, (the NOAA- 7). A microwave antenna mounted on the platform was found to be capable of tracking an orbital satellite throughout the visible hemisphere, although the reception tracking has not been inplemented. This <b>antenna</b> <b>mount</b> offers a light weight, structurally strong and fast dynamic response tracking system for land and marine applications. This parallel robotic mechanism has potential for further applications such as a prepackaged portable communications system which can be deployed rapidly at remote construction sites or during civil defence emergencies. In addition it may be employed as a stabilized platform which can be used for marine VTOL aircraft recovery during rough weather. The application of this <b>antenna</b> <b>mount</b> in a low cost marine satellite communications system is emphasized since the fast dynamic response of the system will eliminate the need for an expensive stabilized platform...|$|E

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) {{networks}} {{are being built}} and expanded around the world, contributing to the definition and realisation of geodetic reference frames {{as well as providing}} reliable and accurate positioning infrastructure {{for a wide range of}} applications. Depending on the purpose of the GNSS station, CORS antenna monuments typically vary from concrete pillars anchored to bedrock to masts attached to buildings. An <b>antenna</b> <b>mount</b> is used to connect the GNSS antenna to the monument. In all cases it is desired that the CORS antenna is oriented to True North in order to gain maximum benefit from GNSS antenna modelling. Other requirements generally include the unambiguous definition of the survey mark and Antenna Reference Point (ARP), and a zero or minimal antenna height. This paper introduces the CORSnet-NSW Adjustable <b>Antenna</b> <b>Mount</b> (CAAM), developed by NSW Land and Property Information (LPI) for CORSnet-NSW, LPI’s rapidly growing GNSS CORS network covering the state of New South Wales, Australia. The CAAM was purposely designed to be incorporated into (rather than simply attached to) antenna masts located on buildings or free-standing pole monuments but can also be used for pillar monuments. Being free of removable parts, it is adjustable in order to orient the antenna to True North without introducing an antenna height, thereby allowing clear definition and maximum traceability of the survey mark and the ARP. LPI encourages adoption of the CAAM for use in other GNSS CORS networks...|$|E
