40|$|The {{legal basis}} of {{functioning}} of the local-government <b>appeal</b> <b>boards</b> is an Act of 12 October 1994 on local government <b>appeal</b> <b>boards.</b> Functioning of the local-government <b>appeal</b> <b>boards</b> is {{closely linked to the}} principle of a two-instance system of administrative proceedings (Article 15 Code of Administrative Proceedings). Specific feature of these bodies is adjudication in panels of three and independence from the executive. In addition to this members of <b>appeal</b> <b>boards</b> during the course of adjudication are bound only by the provisions of prevailing law. An in-depth analysis of the presented issues points out the need for more provisions relating to proceedings before the collegiate bodies of public administration in the Code of Administrative Proceedings...|$|R

500|$|In the November 1960 {{elections}} Agnew {{decided to}} seek {{election to the}} county circuit court, against the local tradition that sitting judges seeking reelection were not opposed. He was unsuccessful, finishing last of five candidates. This failed attempt raised his profile, and he was regarded by his Democratic opponents as a Republican on the rise. The 1960 elections saw the Democrats win control of the county council, and one of their first actions was to remove Agnew from the Zoning <b>Appeals</b> <b>Board.</b> According to Agnew's biographer, Jules Witcover, [...] "The publicity generated by the Democrats' crude dismissal of Agnew cast him as the honest servant wronged by the machine." [...] Seeking to capitalize on this mood, Agnew asked to be nominated as the Republican candidate in the 1962 U.S. Congressional elections, in Maryland's 2nd congressional district. The party chose the more experienced J. Fife Symington, but wanted {{to take advantage of}} Agnew's local support. He accepted their invitation to run for county executive, the county's chief executive officer, a post which the Democrats had held since 1895.|$|E

[...] Independent of the existing system, it will circle the city center and connect the areas of Østerbro, Nørrebro and Vesterbro to Frederiksberg and Indre By.

Preparations began by moving utilities etc. in 2010, and construction of work sites and stations began in 2011. Drilling of tunnels will begin in 2013. On 7 January 2011 the new project called Cityringen started with the signature by Metroselskabet of new contracts, with Ansaldo Breda and Ansaldo Sts (Finmeccanica Group) for the supply of trains and control systems and with an Italian joint-venture led by Salin Construttori (about 60%) and Tecnimont (about 40%) with Seli as third partner for the construction part.
