You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to give a better {{understanding}} of the linear complementarity problem with a P-matrix (PLCP).

Most of the papers dealing with the PLCP look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> algebraic point of view. We analyze the combinatorial structure of the PLCP. Wherever possible, we state our results for the generalized PLCP (PGLCP), a natural generalization of the PLCP. In the first part of the thesis, we present further generalizations of the PGLCP. We show that the PGLCP fits into the framework of unique sink orientations (USO) of grids. Finding a solution to the PGLCP can therefore be done by finding the sink in a grid USO. Several algorithms are known for this latter task, and we analyze the behavior of some of them on small grids. W...|$|R

Construction on the Koubek-designed , $23 million L'Enfant Plaza Hotel and office building began until June 1971. In July 1970, construction began on his 37-story, pink granite United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company Building in Baltimore. It was the largest building yet constructed in the United States to employ the slipform method of continuously poured concrete. The USF Building successfully sparked the economic revival of the Inner Harbor. Opened in 1974, as of 2010 it remained the tallest building in Baltimore. Forty years later, it is considered a Baltimore landmark. Richard Burns of Design Collective Inc. has said, [...] "In my opinion, his USF tower, now Legg Mason, {{is one of the}} best if not the best office buildings in downtown Baltimore. It is simple, direct and honest..." [...] David Wallace, whose Wallace Roberts and Todd designed the master site plan for the Inner Harbor, declared it the [...] "linchpin for the Inner Harbor. If you look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> boat, it's a punctuation point at one corner of the Inner Harbor, signifying where the central business district meets the waterfront." [...] Construction started on his eight-story 2021 K Street NW office building in November 1970. In the summer of 1971, he completed his site plan for Friendship Heights, a [...] site straddling the boundary between the District of Columbia and Maryland border at Friendship Heights/Friendship Village. The plan contemplated several high-rise office buildings, a loop roadway around the site, pedestrian concourses, and several multi-story shopping malls clustered around the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Western Avenue. (The project was built throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s.) In March 1971, the American Automobile Association commissioned him to design a six-story, $10-million headquarters for the group at 8111 Gatehouse Road in Fairfax, Virginia. Eight months later, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) began construction on a Koubek-designed headquarters at 1625 Massachusetts Avenue NW, three blocks northwest from his 1965 office building and across the street from the Philippine Embassy. In March 1974, developer Melvin Lenkin commissioned Koubek to design an all-glass Modernist building for 1900 M Street NW. [...] Koubek designed an eight-story cubist building with an all-glass facade; cutaway, cantilevered front corner; and ground floor arcade. In March 1975, the National Bank of Washington, one of the city's oldest and most storied banks, commissioned a new operations center (4340 Connecticut Avenue NW) from Koubek. In May 1975, Koubek joined a consortium of prominent local architects to design the Washington Harbor complex of buildings on the Georgetown waterfront. The three-block-long, eight-building complex, which contained luxury condominiums, office space, restaurants, luxury retail space, a boardwalk, and plaza, was the first large-scale redevelopment of Georgetown's waterfront in the city's history. By the end of 1975, The New York Times was reporting that Koubek's firm had designed roughly half the office buildings built in the District of Columbia since the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the final}} parts of the {{heuristics}} would be the scaling-up of the vibrating fluidized bed from laboratory scale to industrial scale. There are some factors which {{should be taken into}} consideration when proceeding with the scaling-up. One would be the energy consumption of an industrial scale vibrating fluidized bed. This is because a potential customer would want to know the requirements of the process. Therefore, individual energy consumption for each part of the vibrating fluidized bed should be taken into account. The same can be said about the vibrating fluidized bed when we look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> economical perspective. Most buyers of the vibrating fluidized bed would most likely use it for a process to achieve an income profit. Hence, a detail cost analysis should be done,. <b>From</b> <b>an</b> environmental point of view, there is not much to be worried off except for possible safety issues, because the vibrating fluidized bed itself is generally considered to be environmentally friendly due the fact that the waste produced are already treated in the process.

Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt {{that the only way to}} tell this story was to come <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> completely real place.

He stood out in my youth as a great composer because of what he did with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.'

30|$|Organization of rights, {{duties and}} tasks for data {{security}} represents a central component of information systems, {{and the same}} is true for cloud (eco-) systems. The aim is to protect user data from unauthorized access, transfer and commercialization by third parties. With today’s authentication technologies, authorization technologies and encryption technologies, communication and protection from unauthorized data access can be guaranteed, but looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> organizational view, the problem concerning data security cannot be solved. Here, control over data of the cloud services provider, or rather cooperation partner, lies with the recipient. Therefore, a decentralized data keeping in cloud systems has to make it possible for all parties to decide on their own which data security regulations apply to their own data. Their adherence has to be transparent and controllable. The cloud system has to be designed so that changing data access regulations can be determined by the cloud user. Further, technological requirements and country-specific laws as well as “aspects of trust” have to be able to be integrated into the data access management and data access rights management. Data security principles such as “a specific purpose”, “transparency”, and “reliability of data generation and processing” apply to decentralized cloud systems, too [18]. It was shown that a decentralization makes an increasing adherence to data security requirements possible since control over data and applications is transferred to the user [10, 19]. Deriving from this motivation, forms and gradations of decentralization and its suitability for fulfilling requirements beyond data security have to be analyzed.|$|R
