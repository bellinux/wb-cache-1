In order to prevent breaches of contract, the contractual designs between farmers and <b>agricultural</b> <b>processors</b> (Dragon Head Firms) in China are innovating in two ways: organizational innovations and contractual innovations. Due to contractual innovations, simple price-quantity contracts are evolving into complex cooperation contracts. Using data for over 500 state key processors in 2003 from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, we construct econometric models to study contractual choices, contract intensity, and their impacts on sales and profits for <b>agricultural</b> <b>processors</b> in China. The results indicate that capital {{and the number of}} contracted farmers are endogenous to contract choices. Processors are more likely to use cooperation contracts compared with price-quantity contracts as the number of contracted farmers increases, because the costs of coordinating, monitoring and enforcing price-quantity contracts may increase dramatically under these circumstances. On the other hand, contract types are not important for the number of contracted farmers, the intensity of contracts, or sales and profits for processors. The results also indicate that the elasticity of profits with respect to capital is 0. 52, which implies that the returns to investing in the food processing industry are relatively high in China.

40|$|Value at Risk (VaR) is a {{relatively}} new methodology used to quantify risk exposure. Although widely used in the financial and energy sectors of the economy, VaR has yet to gain the same acceptance in the field of agriculture. This thesis provides an introduction to Value at Risk and explains both its strengths and weaknesses. Empirical case studies are developed, and VaR calculation is shown for the unique portfolios of three different <b>agricultural</b> <b>processor</b> situations. The procurement division of a domestic bread baking company is used to empirically demonstrate how VaR could be implemented to evaluate the price risk associated with both the ingredient and energy inputs. A second case considers the same input portfolio; however, the analysis is expanded to include output price risk and show how considering input and output risk simultaneously impacts the risk-reducing effects of numerous hedging strategies. The third case introduces foreign currency exchange risk as VaR is computed for the portfolio of a Mexican flour milling company that purchases its inputs in a foreign currency. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present paper investigates price {{volatility}} along the agri-food chains using the monthly series of <b>agricultural,</b> <b>processor</b> and consumer price indices. The analysis is made at sectoral level {{and it is}} also particularized for the wheat and bakery products chain and for the chain of meat and meat products. Among the most important conclusions following the analysis, in the first place we mention that the prices in the first stages of the chains, i. e. the agricultural prices and the prices in the first stage of the processing segment feature the highest volatility, while the final consumer prices are much more stable. This remark is true both for the crop products and for the animal products. The consumer prices and the processor prices attenuate and level the excessive variations of agricultural prices. Another conclusion of the paper is that the transmission of agricultural price variation in the period of agricultural crisis, which in Romania was manifested in the period March 2007 – May 2008, had an asymmetric character, i. e. the increase of agricultural prices was almost simultaneously accompanied by the increase of processor and consumer prices. On the contrary, in the period of agricultural price decrease, which followed after the month of May 2008, the processor and consumer prices continued to increase slowly, or stagnated in the best case, while the prices of crop products (mainly cereals) experienced significant decrease...|$|E
40|$|In Macon County, Illinois, one of {{the most}} recent and high profile {{economic}} development strategies involves the creation of the Midwest Inland Port (MIP), an inland port and intermodal facility. A privately owned public initiative, MIP is an infrastructure-strategy package. Part of the infrastructure includes an intermodal ramp, which is privately owned by ADM, a multinational <b>agricultural</b> <b>processor.</b> The intermodal ramp was funded, in part, {{by a grant from the}} state of Illinois. However, neither the grant application nor agreement required an impact assessment of the facility. I argue that a unique confluence of place-based factors facilitated the creation of the MIP and that a preliminary impact assessment should have been included as part of the grant application and agreement, especially in light of the high expectations for the facility. I propose a potential impact assessment methodology that considers transportation and economic impacts at the state, region, and county scales. I apply this methodology to MIP as an illustrative example. Though it is realistically too soon to determine the measurable impact of MIP, I show a means of measuring the potential impact on rail shipments and on local residents. This research enumerates a methodology that examines multi-scale impacts of transportation projects; it explains how a confluence of factors aligned to create a hybrid economic development-infrastructure model; and finally, it raises the possibility of utilizing large transportation infrastructure projects as a means of understanding industrial relations in Illinois. by Erin Kenney.

The analysis is made at sectoral level and it is particularized for a few important chains, such as the wheat and bakery products chain and the chain of meat and meat products. The main characteristic of {{price transmission}} by chains, as revealed by the data series analysis, is the apparent stability of consumer and processor prices and the strong volatility of agricultural prices. Hence, the agricultural prices and the consumer prices follow different evolutions: consumer prices have a much lower volatility and generally a constant growth trend, while the agricultural prices have strong fluctuations, both on the medium term and on seasonal term. This remark is true both for the crop products and for the animal products. The consumer prices and the processor prices attenuate and level off the excessive variations of agricultural prices. Another conclusion of the paper is that the transmission of agricultural price variation {{in the period of}} agricultural crisis, which in Romania was manifested in the period March 2007 – May 2008, had an asymmetric character, i. e. the increase of agricultural prices was almost simultaneously accompanied by the increase of processor and consumer prices (attenuated transmission amplitude).

40|$|Contracts {{are widely}} used by <b>agricultural</b> <b>processors</b> for {{purchasing}} inputs not only in developed countries but also in developing countries such as China. The total number of formal, written contracts between farmers and food processors is increasing rapidly in China, and the formal contracts that exist are becoming more complex. Contractual design in China is evolving from simple price-quantity contracts toward more complicated arrangements known as cooperation contracts or joint-stock cooperation contracts, designed to share risk and mitigate opportunistic behaviors by the contracting parties. Due to small farm sizes, the contracted amount in the typical contract in China is very small compared with Western countries, and each processor usually has {{a large number of}} contracted farmers. This paper uses data from a 2003 survey of food processing firms by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture to analyze the determinants of contractual choices between these firms and farmers and the number of farmers that each firm contracts with. An important issue identified in the literature in analyzing the determinants of contractual choices is endogenous matching between parties to a contract and the effects of this endogenous matching on contract choice. We find strong evidence to support endogenous matching. In particular, our results indicate that firms which contract with a larger number of farms are more likely to use cooperation contracts than relational contracts.

To better understand the needs and perceptions of residents in a small midwestern town (population: 4, 151), a multidisciplinary research team from the College of Architecture at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln conducted a study between September 1995 and May 1996. The focus of the project was to explore the effects of recent population growth on housing and other physical environmental factors related to the quality of life. Data was collected from both long-time residents (more than 15 years) and newly-arrived residents (less than five years), utilizing a door-to-door survey technique. The data was analyzed through frequency distribution, means, and variances. The data was examined in both an aggregated manner as well as separated to determine what the similarities and differences were between the long time and newly arrived residents. The survey results clearly show that many issues exist in which long-time and newly-arrived residents perceptions are quite similar.

40|$|The {{financial}} stress and economic difficulties which characterized {{sectors of the}} agriculture industry during the 1980 s may continue to trouble some producers into the 1990 s {{as a result of}} drought and international competition. This report explains legal alternatives available to creditors for using a borrower's personal property to satisfy debt secured with personal property as well as unsecured debt. A debt is secured when a creditor has a lien; that is, the legal right to seize and use some of the borrower's property to pay an obligation. An unsecured debt is not accompanied with a legal right entitling the creditor to seize some of the borrower's property if the obligation is not paid. Instead, a creditor must convince a court that an amount is owed, but unpaid. The creditor will then proceed to collect payment as prescribed by statute and the court. The two most common means for a creditor to acquire a lien are 1) for the borrower to voluntarily grant a lien (a voluntary lien), and 2 } for the creditor to acquire a lien according to statutory law and without the borrower's consent. This second category of liens {{is often referred to as}} statutory, involuntarily, or nonconsensual liens. The most common statutory liens that apply to agriculture in North Dakota are the agricultural supplier's lien, <b>agricultural</b> <b>processor's</b> lien, and agister's lien (which encumbers livestock being kept or fed for their owner). The typical voluntary lien to encumber personal property is a security interest which empowers creditors to repossess the encumbered property as long as there is no breach of the peace. The alternative for creditors is to rely on the judicial proceeding of claim and delivery to seize the property. The law specifies limitations as well as protection for debtors. For example, a debtor is not relieved of an obligation even though the debtor's assets are not sufficient to pay the obligation. Likewise, a debtor cannot give away property to frustrate a creditor's collection attempts. However, a debtor is allowed to retain exempt assets; that is, those items state statutory law specifies as beyond the reach of creditors. Exempt personal property includes the family's clothing; one year's supply of provisions for the family (including fuel); a trailer, mobile home, or $ 7, 500 (substitute for a homestead); property valued between $ 5, 000 and $ 8, 000 ($ 2, 500 for a single person); a vehicle up to $ 1, 200 in value; and certain pensions, annuities, life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and limited payments from specified pension programs (such as social security). Financial disputes are not limited to debtors and creditors. Creditors also compete with each other to collect their obligation from the borrower's assets. Such conflicts are resolved according to the priority of the creditors. Few financial disputes will be litigated; instead, most culminate with the parties negotiating a settlement that is preferrable to litigation. The parties must fully understand their legal rights and the likely result of litigating (including the cost and time necessary to litigate), however, in order to recognize an acceptable settlement.

40|$|The strong {{integration}} of markets occurred in the last 20 years both in and outside Europe has determined an exponential growth of competitive pressure on the agricultural supply side, especially in less advanced and developed regions.
