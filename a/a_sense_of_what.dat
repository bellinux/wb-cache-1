She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{it would be like to}} be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband.

25|$|Otto {{was still}} a minor, when he {{inherited}} his father's estates in 1213. As in 1212 his uncle Henry V had renounced the County Palatine of the Rhine in favour of his sole male heir Henry VI the Younger, whose early death in 1214 {{may be said to}} have opened to his cousin Otto a more splendid succession than what belonged to the very circumscribed patrimony of his father. However, his uncle Henry V hesitated between a desire to aggrandize his own children (daughters) and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was due to the male representative of his name and family, and Otto at first reaped little advantage from these enlarged prospects.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} other {{necessary}} reforms, the new president, Allan McEvey, {{set up a}} new review committee of two, Dom Serventy and himself. Serventy, a scientist with the CSIRO, was the principal writer of the review report and he addressed both the need for <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the RAOU should be doing, and the structure that would allow it to do so. Although there was considerable vocal opposition to the reform proposals (including cutting the number of people on Council from an unwieldy forty to just nine) the report was ratified by Council in April 1969 and adopted at an Extraordinary General Meeting in June 1969, with the vote being over 80% in favour. Later that year came the first issue of the RAOU Newsletter, a publication that would evolve to become the magazine Wingspan.|$|E

Wolfe stated, [...] "Events {{in the world have}} sharpened <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> at stake." [...] Wolfe claimed that Israel was [...] "more isolated than ever", with the effect of [...] "causing American Jewish defenders of Israel to become more aggressive".|$|R

The bottom line is we're just trying to give you <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it was like to hang out around this person. That's really it. And the scenes were chosen strictly on the basis of, 'Yeah, what does that tell us about his character?'".|$|E
500|$|The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani wrote a more {{critical}} review, describing the opening as [...] "heavy-handed" [...] and early {{events in the}} novel as [...] "soap-opera-ish". Despite these objections, she concluded, [...] "Gradually, however, Mr. Hosseini's instinctive storytelling skills take over, mowing down the reader's objections through sheer momentum and will. He succeeds in making the emotional reality of Mariam and Laila's lives tangible to us, and by conjuring their day-to-day routines, {{he is able to}} give us <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> daily life was like in Kabul — both before and during the harsh reign of the Taliban." [...] Similarly, Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor concluded that A Thousand Splendid Suns was ultimately [...] "a little shaky as a work of literature".|$|E
500|$|Neal Purvis and Robert Wade wrote a {{draft of}} a remake of the 1969 British crime comedy The Italian Job which was {{rejected}} by Paramount. Screenwriting team Donna and Wayne Powers were subsequently commissioned to write a remake. The duo viewed the original film, which neither had seen before, only once [...] "because [...] wanted to get <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it was about" [...] in regards to its tone. Over {{the course of two}} years and through 18 drafts, they developed a screenplay which was described by director F. Gary Gray as [...] "inspired by the original." [...] Gray, Powers and Powers, and executive producer James Dyer identified the most prominent similarities as the trio of Mini Coopers used by the thieves, as well as the titular heist involving the theft of gold bullion. Some sequences of the film were storyboarded and previsualized by Gray before production began.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, after a {{four-year}} disappearance, the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams. Beginning with Batman #251's [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character {{returns to his}} roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman. This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character. O'Neil said his idea was [...] "simply {{to take it back}} to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Kane and Finger were after." [...] O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to Arkham Asylum (introduced by O'Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison. Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.|$|E
500|$|Jamahl Epsicokhan on {{his website}} [...] "Jammer's Reviews", {{thought that the}} episode's story bore {{similarities}} to the [...] episode [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] due to the alternative timeline and also the film Memento due to the memory issues suffered by Archer. Epsicokhan also suggested that the flashback sequences were similar to the [...] episode [...] "", but was a [...] "substantially less poignant take on hypothetical material". He said that the episode had [...] "something for everyone", with an [...] "apocalyptic" [...] action storyline which tied in neatly to an interesting character drama. He gave the episode a score of {{three and a half}} out of four. The review on Ain't It Cool News also suggested that the storyline had been inspired by a number of different episodes in the Star Trek franchise, including the Voyager episodes [...] "Year of Hell" [...] and [...] "", as well as The Next Generation [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] and [...] "". But the reviewer thought that the episode presented the viewer with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is at stake with the fight against the Xindi for the first time, and gave the episode a score of four out of five, a grade described as [...] "better than most motion pictures".|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Nolan {{directed}} and produced Dunkirk, {{based on his}} own original screenplay. The story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940. During the year-long production of his first film, Following (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the English Channel and retrace the journey of the little ships of Dunkirk. [...] "We did {{it at the same}} time of year to get <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it was like, and it turned out to be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs dropping on us." [...] For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and [...] (1927) as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, he wanted to make a [...] "sensory, almost experimental movie" [...] with minimal dialogue. Nolan said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, [...] "Knowing and respecting that Chris [...] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama." [...] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theaters on 21 July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results, grossing over $520 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in his review: [...] "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times lauded the film, calling it [...] "a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's." ...|$|E

But sometimes it's a delay of two months, or four or six.
