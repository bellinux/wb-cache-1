The experiment showed that the correlation function value is inversely proportional to the amount of change of the video surveillance image; the autocorrelation function value can be used to determine when to trigger the <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm</b> system.

40|$|Abstract—Fire {{disaster}} {{is a great}} threat to lives and property. <b>Automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system provides real-time surveillance, monitoring and <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm.</b> It sends early alarm when the fire occurs and helps to reduce the fire damage. Wireless sensor network {{has become the most}} important technology in environmental monitoring and home or factory automation in recent years. In this paper, an <b>automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system based on wireless sensor networks is developed, which is designed for high-rise buildings. In order to provide early extinguishing of a fire disaster, large numbers of detectors which periodically measure smoke concentration or temperature are deployed in buildings. Those scattered detectors report their monitoring information to the surveillance center via the self-organizing hierarchical wireless sensor networks. Test results from the prototype system show that the <b>automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system achieves the design requirements.

A {{multidisciplinary}} research project has been launched in Sweden with the long-term goal to reduce these arson trends. As a part of this project a smaller project has been conducted where cases studies of arson fires in schools have been preformed to identify technical deficiencies and suggest solutions to mitigate the consequences of arson fires.

Solutions for these deficiencies can be <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm</b> systems with efficient location of different type of detectors, good illumination, surveillance cameras and sprinklers.

5000|$|Often {{coverage}} maps show general {{coverage for}} large regions and therefore any boundary indicated {{should not be}} interpreted as a rigid limit. The biggest cause of uncertainty for a coverage map is the quality (mainly sensitivity) of <b>receiving</b> <b>apparatus</b> used. A coverage map may be produced to indicate the area in which a certain signal strength is delivered. Even if it is 100% accurate (which it never is), a major factor on whether a signal is receivable depends very much on whether the <b>receiving</b> <b>apparatus</b> is sensitive enough to use a signal of that level. Commercial receivers can vary widely in their sensitivity, thus perception of coverage can vary widely.|$|R
