5|$|Hungary {{passed laws}} on 28 May 1938 and 5 May 1939 banning Jews from various professions. A third law, added in August 1941, defined Jews as <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> {{at least two}} Jewish grandparents, and forbade sexual {{relations}} or marriages between Jews and non-Jews.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July, Heydrich {{announced}} that all Jews {{were to be}} regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot. On 17 July Heydrich ordered that the Einsatzgruppen were to kill all Jewish Red Army prisoners of war, plus all Red Army prisoners of war from Georgia and Central Asia, as they too might be Jews. Unlike in Germany, where the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined as Jewish <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> at least three Jewish grandparents, the Einsatzgruppen defined as Jewish <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> at least one Jewish grandparent; in either case, whether or not the person practised the religion was irrelevant. The unit was also assigned to exterminate Romani people and the mentally ill. It was common practice for the Einsatzgruppen to shoot hostages.|$|E

5|$|After its {{ratification}} of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes. The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> more than one black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and had few Constitutional rights. Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to taking the written exam, {{all of the}} applicants {{had to take a}} horse-riding test as well. Having grown up riding horses on his family's plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge thought that he would want to go into the cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to go into the infantry, leaving the officer stunned that <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking instead of riding a fine horse.|$|E

5|$|Nominees were {{originally}} selected by a voting poll conducted by program directors and disc jockeys at Spanish-language {{radio stations in}} Texas. Winners were previously chosen by Tejano radio station KIWW listeners in the 1980s, and later by fans of Tejano musicians in the Southwest of the United States.

5|$|Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood {{directors}} and writers, the Hollywood Ten, intending {{to ask them}} to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a blacklist which prohibited <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged, prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress Jean Muir, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.|$|E

5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} the Mormon History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington's article caused the suspension of BYU studies, BYU Studies was wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> an interest in Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted {{and members of the}} Mormon History Association submitted papers to Dialogue.|$|E
5|$|First rescue efforts {{came from}} {{surviving}} neighbours and co-workers who pulled and dug out victims from buildings. The initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen, firefighters and military personnel {{who began to}} arrive, as did <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> a working vehicle; cars, trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded. A flood of victims soon began {{to arrive at the}} city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December.|$|E
5|$|The content {{ranges from}} {{extremely}} difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered {{at school and}} often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, {{as there is a}} principle that <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate {{command and control}} methods applied by the Sisak Operational Group {{in charge of the}} offensive. It also lacked clear objectives. Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated the offensive, but found that there was very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo to conclude that the offensive was not formally authorised. The formal investigation did not specifically charge <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{local governments}} {{assisted}} the affected storm victims by providing food, water, and clothing, even traveling by canoe to distribute aid. However, residents in Yuyao complained about insufficient assistance, {{as many people}} were without food or clean water for several days, due to ongoing flooding making distribution difficult. This sparked thousands of people to protest the government, although they dispersed after increased numbers of policemen. Residents were initially required to show food coupons to receive meals, but later <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> a residence permit could receive the meals; however, the food distribution was disorganized, and {{there were reports of}} people looting for food. By October18, the flooding in Yuyao had subsided and roadways had reopened, and power service was gradually restored. Due to the extended disruptions to the city, garbage service was halted. Two people in Yuyao were arrested after spreading false rumors online that reservoir collapsed during the storm, killing 40people.|$|E
5|$|Pets {{are allowed}} in {{developed}} areas and along hiking trails {{but must be}} leashed or otherwise restrained. Horses are not allowed on hiking trails, in picnic areas, or on bare rock exposures in undeveloped areas of the monument. Digging, disturbing, or collecting any of the park's natural resources, including fossils, is prohibited. Fossil theft is an ongoing problem. No mountain biking is allowed on monument land, although the Malheur National Forest east of Dayville has biking trails. Fishing is legal from monument lands along the John Day River for <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> an Oregon fishing license. Rafting on the John Day River is seasonally popular, although the favored runs begin at or downstream of Service Creek and do not pass through the monument. Risks to monument visitors include extremely hot summer temperatures and icy winter roads, two species of venomous rattlesnakes, two species of poisonous spiders, ticks, scorpions, puncturevine, and poison ivy.|$|E

5|$|The {{police are}} upset about Abbott’s death and blame Scully while Doggett reminds them {{that only the}} thing that killed Abbott and the others is to blame. Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who {{came in contact with}} the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E
5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork as the key to success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where <b>anyone</b> <b>with</b> a Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E
