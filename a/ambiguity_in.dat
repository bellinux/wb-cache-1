5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and <b>ambiguity</b> <b>in</b> the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E

Our analysis contains a simple {{argument that the}} <b>ambiguities</b> <b>in</b> the short-distance coefficients and operator matrix elements are artifacts of dimensional-regularization factorization schemes and are absent in cutoff schemes. We also present a method for computing the renormalon <b>ambiguities</b> <b>in</b> operator matrix elements {{and apply it to}} a computation of the <b>ambiguities</b> <b>in</b> the matrix elements that appear in the NRQCD factorization formulas for the annihilation decays of S-wave quarkonia. Our results, combined with those of Braaten and Chen for the short-distance coefficients [1], provide an explicit demonstration that the <b>ambiguities</b> cancel <b>in</b> the physical decay rates. In addition, we analyze the renormalon <b>ambiguities</b> <b>in</b> the Gremm-Kapustin relation and in various definitions of the heavy-quark mass. Typeset using REVTEX 1 I...|$|R

5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. <b>Ambiguity</b> <b>in</b> those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of the details in the written version.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an <b>ambiguity</b> <b>in</b> the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|In a dance club, a {{young man}} is taken by a young woman, Marty (Kate Twa), for casual sex. The man dies afterwards, and Marty leaves the room as a man (Peter Stebbings). FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called to the scene; Mulder {{believes}} that the man's death {{was caused by a}} fatal dose of pheromones. There is also <b>ambiguity</b> <b>in</b> similar murders as to the sex of the killer.

40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{theoretical}} studies explain empirical puzzles <b>in</b> finance with <b>ambiguity</b> aversion, {{it is not a}} given that individual <b>ambiguity</b> attitudes survive <b>in</b> markets. In fact, despite ample evidence of <b>ambiguity</b> aversion <b>in</b> individual decision making, most studies find no or only limited <b>ambiguity</b> aversion <b>in</b> experimental financial markets, even when they exclude arbitrage. We argue that <b>ambiguity</b> effects <b>in</b> markets depend on market feedback and on a sufficiently strong bias toward ambiguity among the participants. Accordingly, we find significant <b>ambiguity</b> effects <b>in</b> low-feedback call markets for assets that provoke high ambiguity aversion, but no <b>ambiguity</b> effects <b>in</b> high-feedback double auctions...|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} of extrasolar planets {{led to another}} <b>ambiguity</b> <b>in</b> defining a planet: {{the point at which}} a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the referential properties of definite NPs and introduces a homogeneous framework {{for coping with}} <b>ambiguities</b> <b>in</b> reference and with the generic/specific and referential/attributive dichotomies. The basic assumption is that an ambiguous &quot;logical form&quot; is the most reasonable tool for carrying out the interpretation process without propagating existing <b>ambiguities</b> <b>in</b> unnecessary ways. The <b>ambiguities</b> <b>in</b> reference arc shown to be analyzable perspicuously in terms of three independent parameters: the context, the world, and the time in which the sentence is used. Different readings of NPs arise from the fixing {{of one or more}} of these parameters, going from the most general (the &quot;intension &quot; or &quot;concept&quot;, where nothing is fixed) to the least general (the usual &quot;definite specific &quot; reading, where all the parameters are fixed). Beyond the <b>ambiguities</b> <b>in</b> reference, the distinction between collective and distributive readings and the one between the readings we call relational and non relational arc analyzed and the relationships among the different kinds of ambiguities arc examined. ...|$|R
