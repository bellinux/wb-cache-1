50|$|Blood type are {{an example}} of how glycolipids on cell {{membranes}} mediate cell interactions with the surrounding environment. There are four different blood types present in humans (A, B, AB, O) that are determined by the sugar moiety attached to a specific glycolipid on blood cells. Blood type <b>A</b> <b>individuals</b> have an N-acetylgalactosamine sugar attachment as the main determining structure, blood type B has a galactose, and Blood type O has no extra addition to the oligosaccharide. Erythroctes have the specific glycolipid for that individuals blood type covering their surface (with AB individuals have both types of antigens). Antibodies are produced in the body and bind to a specific blood type's glycolipids. Blood type <b>A</b> <b>individuals</b> produce antibodies that bind to the B antigen and so forth, so that any cells possessing the corresponding antigen will be targeted by the antibodies.|$|E

5000|$|Goals {{that are}} pursued to fulfill {{intrinsic}} values or to support <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> self-concept are called self-concordant goals. Self-concordant goals fulfill basic needs and align with what psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott called <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> [...] "True Self". Because these goals have personal meaning to <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> and reflect <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> self-identity, self-concordant goals {{are more likely}} to receive sustained effort over time. In contrast, goals that do not reflect <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> internal drive and are pursued due to external factors (e.g. social pressures) emerge from a non-integrated region of a person and are therefore more likely to be abandoned when obstacles occur.|$|R

Operational values are individual values and are functional or dysfunctional to <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> physical survival.

Longitudinal social network analysis is used to study both the impact of <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> self-view as <b>a</b> leader on leadership emergence and how the process of leadership emergence influences <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> self-view as <b>a</b> leader over time. Results suggest a reciprocal process: An <b>individual’s</b> self-view as <b>a</b> leader influences the number of leadership nominations <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> receives over time and the number of leadership nominations received over time influences <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> self-view as <b>a</b> leader...|$|R
5000|$|The entry [...] {{denotes the}} {{probability}} {{to go from}} state i to state j. To understand the formulas for the transition probabilities one {{has to look at}} the definition of the process which states that always one individual will be chosen for reproduction and one is chosen for death. Once the <b>A</b> <b>individuals</b> have died out, they will never be reintroduced into the population since the process does not model mutations (A cannot be reintroduced into the population once it has died out and vice versa) and thus [...] For the same reason the population of <b>A</b> <b>individuals</b> will always stay N once they have reached that number and taken over the population and thus [...] The states 0 and N are called absorbing while the states [...] are called transient. The intermediate transition probabilities can be explained by considering the first term to be the probability to choose the individual whose abundance will increase by one and the second term the probability to choose the other type for death. Obviously, if the same type is chosen for reproduction and for death, then the abundance of one type does not change.|$|E
50|$|In a {{framework}} similar to Stiglitz and Weiss, {{one can imagine}} a group of individuals, prospective borrowers, who want to borrow funds in order to finance a project, which yields uncertain returns. Let there be two types of individuals, who are observationally identical, and only differ in the riskiness of their projects. Assume type <b>A</b> <b>individuals</b> are low risk compared to type B, {{in the sense that}} the expected return on type B projects is a mean preserving spread of type A projects; they have the same expected return, but higher variance.|$|E
50|$|In {{the initial}} study {{describing}} {{the development and}} evaluation of the DOCS, the instrument's factorial validity was supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of 3 samples, including (<b>a)</b> <b>individuals</b> with OCD, (b) those with other anxiety disorders, and (c) non treatment-seeking individuals. Scores on the DOCS displayed excellent performance on indices of reliability (test-retest, internal consistency) and validity (convergent, divergent, construct), and the measure appears {{to be sensitive to}} treatment. The DOCS is also diagnostically sensitive and thus holds promise as a useful measure of OCD symptoms in clinical and research settings.|$|E
50|$|A job {{security}} score is a numerical expression of <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> unemployment risk {{based on a}} statistical analysis of <b>a</b> person's <b>individual</b> demographics, such as location, industry, and occupation, as well as external factors, such as technology, outsourcing, and overseas competition, which is captured in macroeconomic data and trends. Job Security Score also represents the creditworthiness of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> based on their ability-to-pay by predicting <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> probability of unemployment risk. It {{is similar to the}} Credit Score, which represents the creditworthiness of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> based on their willingness-to-pay by evaluating <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> probability of paying debts in a timely manner. The Job Security Score is a patent-pending payment risk scoring technology that was first developed by Scorelogix http://www.scorelogix.com/jss.asp, a pioneer in consumer risk analytics.|$|R

5000|$|Idiosyncrasy {{credit is}} a concept in social {{psychology}} that describes <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> capacity to acceptably deviate from group expectations.

50|$|Grunig's {{model of}} segmentationGrunig {{proposed}} a theory-based model of segmentation which comprises {{a series of}} inner and outer nests. The inner nests contain (<b>a)</b> <b>individuals</b> (individual communication behaviors and effects) and (b) publics (groups of people sharing common interests and issues). The outer nests consist of (c) communities, (d) psychographics, lifestyles and subcultures, and social relationships, (e) geodemographics, (f) demographics/social categories and (g) mass audience. The nests display increasing specificity instead of generality as they move towards the inner center; more specificity provides more audience details and insights that allow communication campaigns to create more precise messages for the target audience.|$|E
50|$|Maintaining healthy {{magnesium}} (Mg) {{levels in}} the body plays a strong role in protecting the cardiovascular health of an individual. An analysis of the literature suggests the possible role of Mg deficiency in the susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases, observed among subjects displaying a type A behavior pattern. Experimental data which support this hypothesis are reviewed. Type A subjects are more sensitive to stress and produce more catecholamines than type B subjects. This, in turn, seems to induce an intracellular Mg loss. In the long run, type <b>A</b> <b>individuals</b> would develop a state of Mg deficiency, which may promote a greater sensitivity to stress and, ultimately, {{lead to the development}} of cardiovascular problems.|$|E
50|$|Similar to how {{self-awareness}} impacts {{the availability}} of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, {{through the development of}} the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between Type A and Type B behavior patterns, focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type <b>A</b> <b>individuals</b> were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.|$|E
