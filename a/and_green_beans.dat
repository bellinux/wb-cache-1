5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>beans</b> are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

500|$|The {{maintenance}} dose of warfarin can fluctuate significantly {{depending on the}} amount of vitamin K1 in the diet. Keeping vitamin K1 intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations. Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K1. Green parts of members of the family Apiaceae, such as parsley, cilantro, and dill, are extremely rich sources of vitamin K; cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli, as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens, are also relatively high in vitamin K1. Green vegetables such a peas <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>beans</b> do not have such high amounts of vitamin K1 as leafy greens. Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K1.

The old woman of eighty-four winters was already out in the cold morning wind, bareheaded, {{tripping}} about like a young girl, and driving up the cow to milk. She got the breakfast with despatch, and without noise or bustle; and meanwhile the old man resumed his stories, standing before us, who were sitting, {{with his back to the}} chimney, and ejecting his tobacco juice right and left into the fire behind him, without regard to the various dishes which were there preparing. At breakfast we had eels, buttermilk cake, cold bread, green beans, doughnuts, and tea. The old man talked a steady stream; and when his wife told him he had better eat his breakfast, he said: [...] "Don't hurry me; I have lived too long to be hurried." [...] I ate of the apple-sauce and the doughnuts, which I thought had sustained the least detriment from the old man's shots, but my companion refused the apple-sauce, and ate of the hot cake <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>beans,</b> which had appeared to him to occupy the safest part of the hearth. But on comparing notes afterward, I told him that the buttermilk cake was particularly exposed, and I saw how it suffered repeatedly, and therefore I avoided it; but he declared that, however that might be, he witnessed that the apple-sauce was seriously injured, and had therefore declined that. After breakfast we looked at his clock, which was out of order, and oiled it with some [...] "hen's grease," [...] for want of sweet oil, for he scarcely could believe that we were not tinkers or pedlers; meanwhile he told a story about visions, which had reference to a crack in the clock-case made by frost one night. He was curious to know to what religious sect we belonged. He said that he had been to hear thirteen kinds of preaching in one month, when he was young, but he did not join any of them,--he stuck to his Bible. There was nothing like any of them in his Bible.

Different plant structures (flowers, vegetative flush, and different sized fruit) of avocado, lime, and papaya crops <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> pods (a known suitable host) were evaluated for their suitability as hosts for A. l. lutescens. Neonate to imago survivorship, the time taken to complete neonate to imago development, preovipositional period, and fecundity were assessed for each crop. Of all the different phenological stages of the plants investigated, A. l. lutescens could complete development to imago on vegetative flush of papaya and lime, papaya flowers, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> pods but on no other structures tested. There was higher survivorship to the second instar when neonates fed on <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> pods or flowers or vegetative flush of avocado, lime, or papaya crops than when neonates fed on small, medium, or large fruit of these crops. Insects that developed to the imago on <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> pods were significantly heavier than insects that developed on papaya flowers or papaya vegetative flush. The mean preoviposition period was shorter, and adult females more fecund, if they completed immature development and then fed as adults on papaya vegetative flush or <b>green</b> <b>beans</b> rather than papaya flowers. The data indicate that avocado is not a suitable host for A. l. lutescens, suggesting that adult populations that cause significant pest damage to the fruit of this crop originate elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to model the potential impact of climate change on food production, in the Fraser Valley and Peace River regions of British Columbia (BC), using historical crop yield and climate data. We identified eight indicator crops of importance for these regions of BC and utilized historical Census of Agriculture and climate data (temperature and precipitation) to model future potential impacts of climate change on agriculture. We developed three climate change scenarios for these eight indicators crops (extreme, moderate, and business as usual). Under the most extreme climate model scenario the Fraser Valley is expected to experience cooler summers and springs and wetter summers, with incremental increases in oat, blueberry <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> yields by 2050.
