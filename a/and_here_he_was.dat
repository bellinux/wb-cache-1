Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial).

I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of}} his hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
