50|$|The Christological {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} God is based on certain claims about Jesus. The argument, which exists in several forms, holds that if these claims are valid, one should accept God exists. There are three main threads; <b>the</b> <b>Argument</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wisdom of Jesus, <b>the</b> <b>Argument</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> claims of Jesus as son of God and <b>the</b> <b>Argument</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> resurrection.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> skeptical {{hypotheses}} for external world skepticism derive their support <b>from</b> a skeptical <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> distinction between appearance and reality. This skeptical <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> appearance/reality distinction gives {{the external world}} skeptic her conclusion without appealing to skeptical hypotheses and without assuming that knowledge is closed under known entailments. If this is correct, then this skeptical <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> appearance/reality distinction poses a new skeptical challenge that cannot be resolved by denying skeptical hypotheses or knowledge closure...|$|R

40|$|How can we {{know that}} our world {{is not the only}} {{possible}} one? Leibniz’s claim that this world is {{the best of all possible}} worlds obviously presupposes the modal thesis that more than one world is possible. Moreover, the possibility of alternative worlds is also the crucial premise for Leibniz’s most popular defence of contingency. Even if this commitment to possible worlds may appear unproblematic to us, Leibniz’s immediate followers felt that the pluralist assumption about possible worlds required some justification. Aim of this paper is to reconstruct Leibniz’s arguments for possible worlds and contingentism, as they are stated in the Theodicy, by taking into consideration Wolff’s and Bilfinger’s critical (albeit sympathetic) discussion. Following Bilfinger’s classification, three main arguments are explored: <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> conceivability of counterfactual situations, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> fiction, and <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> contingency of natural laws...|$|R
