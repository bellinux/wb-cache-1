Traditionally, constituency grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject {{the existence of a}} finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas constituency grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Eric Olson, a U.S.-Mexico {{security}} co-operation scholar {{from the}} Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, advocates a similar {{strategy for the}} reduction of violence. Olson acknowledged {{that the government should}} slow down its attacks against cartels that are less violent than others, and focus on Mexico's [...] "biggest problem, the violence that is terrorizing the population and undermining the legitimacy of the state." [...] Olson said that crime will always exist, but one can make it less harmful by getting it out of people's lives as much as possible. He concluded by saying that this proposal is not a [...] "de facto negotiation" [...] with the cartels—but rather <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> comes first. Some U.S. officials, however, are concerned that Peña Nieto's strategy will mean the return to the old and corrupt practices of the PRI regime, where the government made deals and turned a blind eye on the cartels in exchange for peace. After all, they worry that Mexico's drug war, which has cost over 50,000 lives, will make Mexicans question on why they should [...] "pay the price for a US drug habit." [...] Peña Nieto denies, however, that his party will tolerate corruption and stated he will not make deals with the cartels.

40|$|Anyone who {{has seen}} a recent summer {{blockbuster}} has witnessed the dramatic increases in computer-generated realism in recent years. Visual effects supervisors now report that bringing even the most challenging visions of film directors to the screen is no longer <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>what’s</b> possible; with today’s techniques {{it is only a}} matter of time and cost. Driving this increase in realism have been computer graphics (CG) techniques for simulating how light travels within a scene and for simulating how light reflects off of and through surfaces. These techniques—some developed recently, and some originating in the 1980 ’s—are being applied to the visual effects process by computer graphics artists who have found ways to channel the power of these new tools. RADIOSITY AND GLOBAL ILLUMINATION One of the most important aspects of computer graphics is simulating the illumination within a scene. Computer-generated images are two-dimensional arrays of computed pixel values, with each pixel coordinate having three numbers indicating the amount of red, green, and blue light coming from the corresponding direction within the scene. Figuring out what these numbers should be for a scene is not trivial, since each pixel’s color is based both on how the object at that pixel reflects light and also the light that illuminates it. Furthermore, the illumination does not only come directly from the lights within the scene, but also indirectl...|$|R
