5|$|Abbas Kiarostami's film Ten (2002) was an {{experiment}} that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. Kiarostami fastened cameras to the dashboard of a car, and then <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> actors to act. There was no film crew in the car, and no director. There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} movement of the car which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing.|$|E
5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> two servants {{to hear a}} case that should have been heard by the justice. The litigants charged that the two servants had wrongly decided the case, and after hearing the allegations, the royal justices at Westminster agreed and restored the disputed property to the litigants.|$|E

After another quarrel with Philip, Mary retired to Turnhout. She remained in the Netherlands one more year.|$|E
5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing the}} treaty, John {{returned}} to Sulmona. According {{to the contemporary}} Matthew Paris, he <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> soldiers to plunder nearby monasteries to obtain money. John lifted the siege of Sulmona in early 1229 to join Cardinal Pelagius, who launched a campaign against Capua. Frederick II (who had crowned himself king of Jerusalem in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre) returned to Italy, forcing the papal troops to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|After the war Alvarez was {{involved}} in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He {{was involved}} in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, he developed the Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} lawyer and court clerk, White conducted {{the teaching of}} jurisprudence in both his Clerk of Court office and residence, where he <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> law students to reside during their studies. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including: Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark; James Dillon Armstrong, Hampshire County Circuit Court judge and son of William Armstrong; Dr. Robert White, Presbyterian minister of Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Virginia lawyers Newton Tapscott, Alfred P. White, and Philip B. Streit.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had {{considered}} {{running for the}} United States House of Representatives from Maineâ€™s 4th district in 1860, but agreed to step aside when Anson P. Morrill, a former governor, announced {{his interest in the}} seat. Morrill was successful, but after redistricting placed Blaine in the 3rd district for the 1862 elections, he <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> name to be put forward. Running on a campaign of staunch support for the war effort, Blaine was elected with an ample majority despite Republican losses across the rest of the country.|$|E

Boro pleaded for a second penalty when Nicky Hunt pulled Job, but referee Riley did not give it.|$|E

Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives {{as a result of his}} failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children. To {{compensate}} for the lack of his own children, he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in the home. He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.|$|E

5|$|Hogg's mother Prudentia died in 1839. As a {{condition}} of his father's will, upon {{the death of his}} mother, Thomas Jefferson Hogg could purchase his brother's share of Norton House. He decided not to, because of the potential cost of maintaining the house and the hostility Jane could face there. Instead, he <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> brother to buy his interest in the house, a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and timing of the sale. They eventually worked out the details, and their relationship became friendlier once the sale was completed.|$|E
5|$|In another two-day non-first-class match, Scotland batted {{better than}} in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat, but still lost. Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts' 178, before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool, {{promoted}} to open, made 108, while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5. Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring. Bradman <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball, and the wickets were shared, with nobody taking more than four.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before his death, Goldstein's {{behavior}} had been erratic {{and he had been}} missing appointments. His manager and sponsor were both so concerned that they flew to New York to visit him two days before his death. Goldstein refused to see his manager, but <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> sponsor into his apartment, consuming pills and smoking crack cocaine in front of him. He promised to check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that Friday. When he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.|$|E

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1728, a {{few weeks}} after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The {{inheritance}} did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson <b>allowed</b> <b>his</b> son to borrow a hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.|$|E
5|$|Production of Anderson's {{adaptation}} of Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel Inherent Vice began in May 2013 {{and ended in}} August of the same year.

The supporting cast includes Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Jena Malone, Martin Short, Benicio Del Toro, Katherine Waterston, Josh Brolin, Peter McRobbie, Michael K. Williams and Eric Roberts. Following its year-end release in December 2014, the film received two nominations at the 87th Academy Awards: Anderson for Best Adapted Screenplay and Mark Bridges for Best Costume Design.|$|E
