During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful <b>anodizing</b> which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E

40|$|A {{compilation}} of reported {{analyses and results}} obtained for <b>anodized</b> aluminum flown on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) was prepared.

The vast majority of the <b>anodized</b> surface on LDEF was chromic acid <b>anodize</b> because of its selection as a thermal control coating for use on the spacecraft primary structure, trays, tray clamps, and space end thermal covers. Reports indicate that the chromic acid <b>anodize</b> was stable in solar absorptance and thermal emittance, but that contamination effects caused increases in absorptance on surfaces exposed to low atomic oxygen fluences. There were some discrepancies, however, in that some chromic acid <b>anodized</b> specimens exhibited significant increases in absorptance. Sulfuric acid <b>anodized</b> surfaces also appeared stable, although very little surface area was available for evaluation.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of <b>anodized</b> film on fatigue strength of aluminum alloy, A 2014 -T 6, repeated tensile fatigue test was conducted in laboratory air under the stress ratio, R, of 0. 01 using smooth specimen with <b>anodized</b> film thickness of 3 μm. Fatigue strength of <b>anodized</b> specimen tested under R= 0. 01 decreased by 18 ～ 20 % as {{compared with that of}} the untreated one, even though the <b>anodized</b> film did not affect the fatigue behavior under the rotating-bending fatigue test of R=- 1. The <b>anodized</b> film is fractured at an early stage of repeated tensile fatigue process, because it is too brittle to accommodate the substrate metal. Many cracks are induced to initiate at the substrate by flaws of the <b>anodized</b> film.

25|$|Strong bases attack aluminium. Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{reacts with}} aluminium {{and water to}} release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes the oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes the oxygen atom from the water, and releases the two hydrogen atoms, The reaction thus produces hydrogen gas and sodium aluminate. In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in. This reaction {{can be useful in}} etching, removing <b>anodizing,</b> or converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further passivation such as <b>anodizing</b> or alodining the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anodizing</b> is very {{resilient}} to weathering and corrosion, so it {{is commonly}} used for building facades and other areas where the surface will come into regular contact with the elements. While being resilient, it must be cleaned frequently. If left without cleaning, panel edge staining will naturally occur. Anodization is the process of converting an anode into cathode by bringing a more active anode in contact with it.|$|E
25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} to avoid contact, an effective method of material separation is required. If paints or coatings are used for isolation, they should be compatible with both metals. Bituminous or zinc chromate primers can be used between copper and aluminum. Bituminous, zinc chromate, or a red lead primer can be effective in separating copper from iron and other ferrous metals. Taping or gasketing with non-absorptive materials or sealants are effective in separating copper from all other metals. In areas with severe exposure, lead or similar gasketing materials should be used, except between copper and aluminum. Water draining from copper surfaces should be prevented from exposure to aluminum and galvanized steel as traces of copper salts may accelerate corrosion. In some cases, <b>anodizing</b> may protect thicker aluminum, such as aluminum window system mullions.|$|E
5000|$|Type 1 {{photosensitive}} <b>anodized</b> aluminum is <b>anodized</b> aluminum {{that has}} been impregnated with a silver compound which, when exposed to a light source, creates an activated latent image.

40|$|Abstract. The {{titanium}} anodizations in 0. 1 M {{sulfuric acid}} solution at different treated potentials {{and the effects}} of UV-irradiation on the <b>anodized</b> films were investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

The features of parameters tanΨ and cos ∆ in SE were in accord with the polarization curve and the thickness of <b>anodized</b> films, respectively. UV-irradiation could greatly decrease the thickness of the <b>anodized</b> films and provably assisted the reconstruction of <b>anodized</b> titanium films from an amorphous and porous structure to a compact structure. Regardless of UV-irradiation, the cos ∆ and tanΨ were still in good agreements with the thickness of <b>anodized</b> films and the polarization curve, respectively. It was also found that UV-irradiation could decrease the surface roughness and make a wider atomically flat terrace on the <b>anodized</b> titanium surface...|$|R
2500|$|Aluminium oxide can {{be grown}} as a coating on {{aluminium}} by <b>anodizing</b> or by plasma electrolytic oxidation (see the [...] "Properties" [...] above).

Instead, with plasma electrolytic oxidation, the coating is porous only on the surface oxide layer while the lower oxide layers are much more compact than with standard DC <b>anodizing</b> procedures and present a higher crystallinity due to the oxide layers being remelted and densified to obtain α-Al2O3 clusters with much higher coating hardness values circa 2000 Vickers hardness.|$|E

40|$|Photocatalytic-activation of <b>anodized</b> TiO 2 -surfaces {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to yield antibacterial and tissue integrating effects, but effects on simultaneous growth of tissue cells and bacteria in co-culture have never been studied. Moreover, it is unknown how human-bone-marrow-mesenchymal-stem (hBMMS) cells, {{laying the groundwork for}} integration of titanium implants in bone, respond to photocatalytic activation of <b>anodized</b> TiO 2 -surfaces. Photocatalytically-activated, <b>anodized</b> titanium and titanium-alloy surfaces achieved 99. 99 % killing of adhering Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, an effect that lasted for 30 days of storage in air. Surface coverage by osteoblasts was not affected by photocatalytic activation of <b>anodized</b> TiO 2 -surfaces. Co-cultures of osteoblasts with contaminating S. epidermidis however, enhanced surface coverage on photocatalytically-activated, <b>anodized</b> titanium-alloy surfaces. hBMMS cells grew less on photocatalytically-activated, <b>anodized</b> titanium surfaces, while not at all on photocatalytically-activated, <b>anodized</b> titanium-alloy surfaces and did not survive the presence of contaminating staphylococci. This reduced surface coverage by hBMMS cells disappeared when photocatalytically-activated, <b>anodized</b> titanium-alloy surfaces were exposed to buffer for 60 mm, both in absence or presence of contaminating S. aureus. Consequently, it is concluded that photocatalytically-activated, <b>anodized</b> titanium and titanium-alloy surfaces will effectively kill per-operatively introduced staphylococci contaminating an implant surface and constitute an effective means for antibiotic prophylaxis in cementless fixation of orthopaedic hardware.
