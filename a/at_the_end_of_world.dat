5|$|The {{development}} of effective time-delay shells <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War I made this scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode {{deep inside the}} ship.

The 24th Division retained the 19th, 21st, and 34th regiments, but the formations were undermanned and ill-equipped due to the post-war drawdown and reduction in military spending.|$|E
