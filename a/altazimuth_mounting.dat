50|$|Each Keck Observatory {{telescope}} sits on an altazimuth mount. Most current 8-10 m class telescopes use altazimuth designs due to {{the reduced}} structural requirements compared to older equatorial designs. This mounting style provides the greatest strength and stiffness for {{the least amount of}} steel, which, for Keck Observatory, totals about 270 tons per telescope. The total weight of each telescope is more than 300 tons. Two of the proposed designs for the next generation 30 and 40 m telescopes use the same basic technology pioneered at Keck Observatory, a hexagonal mirror array coupled with an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mounting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The BTA-6 ( [...] , or Large Altazimuth Telescope), {{with first}} light in 1975, was {{for several years}} the world's largest single primary mirror optical {{reflecting}} telescope. The BTA-6's primary mirror has a diameter of 6 metres (236 inches) and is housed in a 48 m (157.5 ft) diameter dome {{at an altitude of}} 2,070 m (6,791 ft). It held the record from its completion until 1993, when it was surpassed by the Keck 1 telescope, Hawaii. Telescopes of comparable or larger size have subsequently employed flexible or segmented mirrors, and the BTA-6 remained the world's largest rigid-mirror telescope until the advent of spin-casting technology (which produced, for example, the single 8.4-meter primary mirror of the Large Binocular Telescope in the late 1990s). Its <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mounting</b> dictates the need for a field derotation mechanism to maintain the orientation of the field of view.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> {{does have}} its own limitations. Un-driven <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mounted</b> telescopes need to be [...] "nudged" [...] every few minutes along both axes to {{compensate}} for the rotation of the Earth to keep an object in view (as opposed to one axis for un-driven equatorial mounts), an exercise that becomes more difficult with higher magnifications. The <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> does not allow for the use of conventional setting circles to help in aiming the telescope at the coordinates of known objects. They are known for being difficult to point at objects near the zenith, mainly because a large movement of the azimuth axis is needed to move the telescope pointing by even a small amount. <b>Altazimuth</b> <b>mounts</b> are also not well suited for astrophotography.|$|R

5000|$|Mounts {{for very}} large telescopes. In the largest telescopes the mass {{and cost of}} an {{equatorial}} mount is prohibitive {{and they have been}} superseded by computer-controlled <b>Altazimuth</b> <b>mounts.</b> The simple structure of an alt-azimuth mount allows significant cost reductions, in spite of the additional cost associated with the more complex tracking and image-orienting mechanisms. An <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> also reduces the cost in the dome structure covering the telescope since the simplified motion of the telescope means the structure can be more compact.|$|R

50|$|Altazimuth mount: An {{equatorial}} telescope mount with clock drive was {{left out of}} the design. Equatorial mounts tend to be massive (less portable), expensive, complicated, and have the characteristics of putting the eyepiece of Newtonian telescopes in very hard to access positions. <b>Altazimuth</b> <b>mounts</b> cut the size, weight and cost of the total telescope and keep the eyepiece in a relatively easy to access position {{on the side of the}} telescope. The <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> design used in Dobsonian designs also adds to simplicity and portability; there is no added mass or need to transport counter weights, drive components, or tripods/pedestals. Setting up for hard tube dobs simply involves placing the mount on the ground, and setting the tube on top of it. The weight of the Dobsonian style <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> is distributed over large simple bearing surfaces so the telescope can move smoothly under finger pressure with minimal backlash.|$|R
50|$|A ball turret was a spherical-shaped, <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> gun turret, {{fitted to}} some American-built {{aircraft}} during World War II. The name {{arose from the}} turret's spherical housing.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s many {{innovations}} in mount design and electronics by amateur telescope makers and commercial manufacturers have allowed users to overcome {{some of the}} limitations of the Dobsonian style <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{horizontal}} {{coordinate system}} is sometimes {{also called the}} az/el system, the Alt/Az system, or the altazimuth system, from {{the name of the}} <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> for telescopes, whose two axes follow altitude and azimuth.|$|R
5000|$|Equatorial platform: The use of {{equatorial}} platforms (such as the Poncet Platform) fitted {{under the}} <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> has given users limited equatorial tracking for visual and astrophotographic work.

50|$|The BTA-6 {{achieved}} {{first light}} in late 1975, {{making it the}} largest telescope in the world until 1990, when it was surpassed by the partially constructed Keck 1. It pioneered the technique, now standard in large astronomical telescopes, of using an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> with a computer-controlled derotator.|$|R
2500|$|The Rapid Eye Mount {{telescope}} {{is a small}} rapid-reaction automatic telescope with a primary [...] mirror. The telescope, in an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount,</b> began operation in October 2002. The {{primary purpose of the}} {{telescope is}} to follow the afterglow of the GRBs detected by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission satellite.|$|R
50|$|The {{telescope}} has an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount.</b> It {{is guided}} by a small mock-telescope placed within the structure at the same rotational axes as the dish, but with an equatorial mount. The two are dynamically locked when tracking an astronomical object by a laser guiding system. This primary-secondary approach was designed by Barnes Wallis.|$|R
50|$|The AAT {{was one of}} {{the last}} large telescopes built with an {{equatorial}} mount. More recent large telescopes have instead adopted the more compact and mechanically stable <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount.</b> The AAT was, however, one of the very first telescopes to be fully computer-controlled, and set new standards for pointing and tracking accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|In astronomical {{telescope}} mounts, {{the equatorial}} axis (the right ascension) is {{paired with a}} second perpendicular axis of motion (known as the declination). The equatorial axis of the mount is often equipped with a motorized [...] "clock drive", that rotates that axis one revolution every 23 hours and 56 minutes in exact sync with the apparent diurnal motion of the sky. They may also be equipped with setting circles {{to allow for the}} location of objects by their celestial coordinates. Equatorial mounts differ from mechanically simpler <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mounts,</b> which require variable speed motion around both axes to track a fixed object in the sky. Also, for astrophotography, the image does not rotate in the focal plane, as occurs with <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mounts</b> when they are guided to track the target's motion, unless a rotating erector prism or other field-derotator is installed.|$|R
50|$|A classic zenith telescope, {{also known}} as a zenith sector employs a strong <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount,</b> fitted with {{levelling}} screws. Extremely sensitive levels are attached to and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a micrometer. They are used for the measurement of small differences of zenith distance, and used in the determination of astronomic latitude.|$|R
5000|$|Dobsonian telescopes. John Dobson popularized a {{simplified}} <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> design for Newtonian reflectors {{because of its}} ease of construction; Dobson's innovation was to use non-machined parts for the mount that {{could be found in}} any hardware store such as plywood, formica, and plastic plumbing parts combined with modern materials such as nylon or teflon.|$|R
50|$|The Faulkes Telescope South is a clone of the Liverpool Telescope and {{is located}} at Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales, Australia. It is a 2 m Ritchey-Chrétien telescope.

50|$|The BMEWS radar {{operated}} on a frequency of 448 MHz with a peak design power of 2.5 MW and maximum average power of 100 kW. The output was fed via waveguide to an 84 foot parabolic reflector <b>mounted</b> on an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount.</b> It {{was equipped with}} a conical scanning feed, providing higher resolution and making automatic tracking easier.|$|R

50|$|Some telescopes {{designed}} to measure star transits are zenith telescopes {{designed to}} point straight up {{at or near the}} zenith for extreme precision measurement of star positions. They use an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount,</b> instead of a meridian circle, fitted with leveling screws. Extremely sensitive levels are attached to the telescope mount to make angle measurements and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a micrometer.|$|R
5000|$|The late 1970s saw the {{publication}} of Adrien Poncet's [...] "Poncet Platform", a very simple design for amateur telescope makers that used a pivot point and an inclined plane that made a very low profile [...] "table". This type of mount has been a popular retrofit for <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mounted</b> telescopes, such as the common Dobsonian telescope type, adding equatorial tracking for high magnification work and astrophotography.|$|R
50|$|The US B-29 Superfortress {{had four}} remote {{controlled}} turrets, comprising two dorsal and two ventral turrets. These were controlled from {{a trio of}} hemispherically glazed gunner-manned sighting stations operated from the pressurised sections in the nose and middle of the aircraft, each housing an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mounted</b> pivoting gunsight to aim {{one or more of}} the unmanned remote turrets as needed, in addition to a B-17 style flexible manned tail gunner's station.|$|R
50|$|The {{telescope}} is a 10-meter (394 in) diameter off-axis Gregorian telescope in an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> (at the poles, an <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mount</b> is effectively identical to an equatorial mount). It {{was designed to}} allow a large field of view (about 1 square degree) while minimizing systematic uncertainties from ground spill-over and scattering off the telescope optics. The surface of the telescope mirror is smooth down to roughly 25 micrometers (one thousandth of an inch), which allows sub-millimeter wavelength observations. The secondary mirror is cooled to 10 K, and metal mesh filters block excess high frequency radiation to keep the thermal loading on the camera down. A key advantage of the SPT observing strategy is that the entire {{telescope is}} scanned, so the beam does not move relative to the telescope mirrors. The fast scanning of the telescope and its large field of view makes SPT efficient at surveying large areas of sky, which is required to achieve the science goals of the SPT cluster survey and CMB polarization measurements.|$|R

The telescope control system also controls movement of the dome automatically. The telescope itself was manufactured in Tucson, Arizona at EOS Technologies, Inc. (EOST). The primary mirror was fabricated and polished at the Lytkarino Optical Glass Factory (LZOS) in Russia. It is the largest optical telescope in the region. The TNT is used for research by NARIT astronomers and visiting researchers.|$|R
5000|$|The 2.3 metre {{telescope}} at Siding Spring Observatory is {{operated by the}} Australian National University. The Advanced Technology Telescope was constructed during the early 1980s and featured at-the-time radical features: an unusually thin mirror, an alt-az mount and co-rotating dome.

[...] It is housed in a box-shaped building which rotates as the telescope tracks objects.|$|R
50|$|The use of heliostats, mirrors {{which are}} moved {{automatically}} to reflect sunlight {{in a constant}} direction as the sun moves across the sky, is gaining popularity as an energy-efficient method of lighting.

50|$|An {{equatorial}} platform or equatorial {{table is}} an equatorial telescope mount {{in the form}} of a specially designed platform that allows any device sitting on it to track astronomical objects in the sky on an equatorial axis. They are used to give equatorial tracking to any device sitting on them, from small cameras up to entire observatory buildings. They are often used with <b>altazimuth</b> <b>mounted</b> telescopes, such as the common Dobsonian telescope type, to overcome that type of mount's inability to track the night sky.|$|R
