5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special brake circuit {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} WrestleMania {{to be held}} entirely outdoors, Vince McMahon also {{announced}} that the show would have taken place regardless of the weather conditions. In the March 2008 issue of WWE Magazine, WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel rig with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent rain from falling on the ring. In that same issue, an initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a larger rig surrounding the tarpaulin rig, with lighting and two giant screens attached. The final design had the lighting and video screens on the tarpaulin rig, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned that video reinforcement should prevent anyone's view from being obstructed by the steel structure. Up to seven generators were used to power up the show.|$|E
5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up to an early {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, {{introduced him to the}} musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk and soul music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel and soul, and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and Sly & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E
5|$|In 1910s, London, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) {{is called}} to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a {{sapphire}} ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over {{a glass of water}} which drips on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, and the lights in her apartment go out <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed. It rises and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.|$|E

25|$|Depending on the {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} the vehicle and various ambient atmospheric conditions, a train would begin to exhibit transonic airflow {{in the vicinity of}} Mach 0.8 (988km/h) and higher.

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{environmental}} benefits of using recycled material, plastic ties usually replace timber ties soaked in creosote, the latter being a toxic chemical, and are themselves recyclable. Hybrid plastic railroad ties and composite ties are used in other rail applications such as underground mining operations, industrial zones, humid environments and densely populated areas. Hybrid railroad ties are also used to be partly exchanged with rotten wooden ties, which will result in continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic ties and composite ties also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast. This is due to better damping properties of hybrid plastic ties and composite ties, which will decrease the intensity of vibrations as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> production.|$|E
25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} is defined <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> power output {{divided by the}} electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main {{reason for this is}} the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E
25|$|The East River is a {{salt water}} tidal estuary in New York City. The waterway, which is {{actually}} not a river despite its name, connects Upper New York Bay on its south end to Long Island Sound on its north end. It separates the borough of Queens on Long Island from the Bronx on the North American mainland, and also divides Manhattan from Queens and Brooklyn, which is also on Long Island. Because of its connection to Long Island Sound, it was once also known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> River. The tidal strait changes its direction of flow frequently, and is subject to strong fluctuations in its current, which are accentuated by its narrowness and variety of depths. The waterway is navigable for its entire length of , and was historically the center of maritime activities in the city, although {{that is no longer}} the case.|$|E

25|$|It was {{eventually}} embraced, {{or at least}} accepted, by go-go fans both young and not so young. In a city that considers “swing” go-go the soundtrack of its story, this was no tiny feat. Even old-timers who deny the appeal of bounce beat understand why it exists. The brash style not only changed the way people danced and partied but became the music for {{a new chapter in}} D.C.’s story. If the swing sound carried a generation of Washingtonians through the rough ’70s and ’80s, a time when funk, jazz, and soul was a much-needed salve, bounce grounded them in the ’00s and ’10s, helped them keep their bearings at a time of shifting city demographics, when go-go’s epicenter realigned <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of black Washington, at least from the ’70s onward, was pushed to the suburbs. With its pummeling tone and tempo, bounce beat remains a perfect musical metaphor for what young people have experienced as they’ve watched their city be slowly replaced by something unrecognizable.|$|E
