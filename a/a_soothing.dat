5|$|The {{shifting}} {{position of}} the Court led to personal animosity between members of its two wings. Despite his disappointment over the Court's positions on some issues, Minton remained popular among his colleagues on the Court as he didn't take sides in their personal disagreements; he proved <b>a</b> <b>soothing</b> presence during a period marked by bitter personal feuds between strong personalities such as William O. Douglas and Felix Frankfurter.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that these}} heavy-handed tactics were {{the source of}} the {{alienation}} of the native population to Soviet rule, in 1921 Moscow appointed an experienced administrator, Alexander Miasnikian, to carry out a more moderate policy and one better attuned to Armenian sensibilities. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under the Soviet rule proved to be <b>a</b> <b>soothing</b> balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from the central government and extensive literacy reforms were carried out. The situation was difficult for the Armenian Apostolic Church, however, which became a regular target of criticism in educational books and in the media and struggled greatly under Communism.|$|E

25|$|Another meta-study {{examined}} the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapy's effects on these patients. Many authors suspect that music has <b>a</b> <b>soothing</b> {{effect on the}} patient by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous noise in their environment. Others suggest that music serves {{as a sort of}} mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.|$|E
25|$|Olmsted {{designed}} {{primarily in}} the pastoral and picturesque styles, each to achieve a particular effect. The pastoral style featured vast expanses of green with small lakes, trees and groves and produced <b>a</b> <b>soothing,</b> restorative effect on the viewer. The picturesque style covered rocky, broken terrain with teeming shrubs and creepers and struck the viewer {{with a sense of}} nature's richness. The picturesque style played with light and shade to lend the landscape a sense of mystery.|$|E

25|$|The actress {{was known}} for her {{kindness}} to animals. She {{could not bear to}} see them abused or badly treated. Wheatley came upon a mule being beaten on Forsyth Street while {{she was a member of}} the Fawcett Stock Company in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1907. The animal was being beaten by a man with a hickory stick. She implored him to stop. Wheatley gave him a half dollar and begged him to restrain his temper. When she left the mule's handler was coaxing him in <b>a</b> <b>soothing</b> manner, which pleased Wheatley. Previously she had intervened to prevent small children from rocking a dog and stopped a cab driver from abusing an old horse.|$|E
25|$|The terminal's design {{focuses on}} {{creating}} a calm and easy travel experience for passengers but also honours {{aspects of the}} region through the display of various art by commissioned Canadian artists. <b>A</b> <b>soothing</b> water feature representing {{the meeting of the}} region's three rivers runs throughout the terminal. Copper and limestone finishes are visible throughout, representative of the capital's Parliament Buildings. Other Canadian features include an inukshuk commissioned and sponsored by First Air, and a rare traditional birch bark canoe built by the master craftsman and Algonquin leader who created an identical one for the late Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. The airport features a large-scale carved glass sculpture by Canadian glass artist, Warren Carther.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{sections}} {{are frequently}} used in reggae, often playing introductions and counter-melodies. Instruments {{included in a}} typical reggae horn section include saxophone, trumpet or trombone. In more recent times, real horns are sometimes replaced in reggae by synthesizers or recorded samples. The horn section is often arranged around the first horn, playing a simple melody or counter melody. The first horn is usually accompanied by the second horn playing the same melodic phrase in unison, one octave higher. The third horn usually plays the melody an octave and a fifth higher than the first horn. The horns are generally played fairly softly, usually resulting in <b>a</b> <b>soothing</b> sound. However, sometimes punchier, louder phrases are played for a more up-tempo and aggressive sound.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{opens in}} the World State city of London in AF 632 (AD 2540 in the Gregorian calendar), where {{citizens}} are engineered through artificial wombs and childhood indoctrination programs into predetermined classes (or castes) based on intelligence and labour. Lenina Crowne, a hatchery worker, is popular and sexually desirable, but Bernard Marx, a psychologist, is not. He is shorter in stature {{than the average}} member of his high caste, which gives him an inferiority complex. His work with sleep-learning allows him to understand, and disapprove of, his society's methods of keeping its citizens peaceful, which includes their constant consumption of <b>a</b> <b>soothing</b> drug called soma. Courting disaster, Bernard is vocal and arrogant about his criticisms, and his boss contemplates exiling him to Iceland because of his nonconformity. His only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a gifted writer who finds it difficult to use his talents creatively in their pain-free society.|$|E
500|$|Allmusic says [...] "the music {{takes the}} concept of a power ballad to epic heights: the verses build from somber {{softness}} to piercing heights of drama before giving way to a chorus that releases the tension with a meditative melodic figure that underlines the hypnotically-repeated title in <b>a</b> <b>soothing</b> fashion." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the Beatles' {{official}} biographer, Hunter Davies, {{writing in}} 1968, some contemporary reviewers {{speculated that the}} burst of laughter {{at the end of}} [...] "Within You Without You" [...] was inserted by Harrison's bandmates to mock the song. Davies corrected this misconception, saying: [...] "It was completely George's idea." [...] In a review published five months after the release of Sgt. Pepper, Hit Parader considered that the album had not endured as well as the Beatles' previous works, and opined: [...] "Harrison has produced <b>a</b> <b>soothing,</b> sinuous, exotic sound for 'Within You Without You'. But even though his repetitious recitation of elementary Far Eastern philosophy is probably intended to reflect the infinity of the universe, it soon becomes a bit monotonous. The laughter at the end seems to be deflating the pretentiousness of the lyrics." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Air {{took the}} bishōjo gaming world by storm," [...] as states {{a review of}} the Dreamcast game by MobyGames. Air was {{described}} as a game that stands out, much like Key's first title Kanon, due to an intricate plot that keeps the player interested, and has a good replay value as well.
