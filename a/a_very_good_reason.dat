However her behaviour within the league became difficult and Athens started to realise that Thebes was not necessarily to be trusted. For example, Thebes destroyed Plataea in 372 BC, which had only recently been refounded. Athens started to think about negotiating peace with Sparta; it was while Athens was discussing this with Sparta that Thebes defeated the Spartan army conclusively at Battle of Leuctra (371 BC).|$|E

As demonstrated later during the Chinese Civil War, the warlords would often simply refuse to take the commands or send their own troops during the campaigns and battles just to keep their own strength.|$|R
40|$|J. L. Schellenberg {{argues that}} divine hiddenness {{provides}} {{an argument for}} the conclusion that God does not exist, for if God existed he would not allow non-resistant non-belief to occur, but non-resistant non-belief does occur, so God does not exist. In this paper, I argue that the stakes involved in theistic considerations put pressure on Schellenberg’s premise that non-resistant non-belief occurs. First, I specify conditions for someone’s being a resistant non-believer. Then, I argue that many people fulfill these conditions because, given some plausible assumptions, there is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> pragmatic <b>reason</b> to be a theist rather than an atheist. I assume {{it is more likely}} that theists go to heaven than atheists, and I argue there is a non-zero probability that one can receive infinite utility and a method of comparing outcomes with infinite utilities in which the probability of each outcome affects the final expected values. Then, I show how this argument entails there is no <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to think that there are very many non-resistant non-believers...|$|R

The latter option deserves more {{attention}} and we derive therefore analytic expressions describing the renormalization group evolution of mixing angles {{and of the}} CP phase for Dirac neutrinos. Radiative corrections to leptonic mixings are in this case enhanced compared to the quark mixings because the hierarchy of neutrino masses is milder and because the mixing angles are larger. The renormalization group effects are compared to the precision of current and future neutrino experiments. We find that, in the MSSM framework, radiative corrections of the mixing angles are for large tan β comparable to the precision of future experiments. ...|$|R
500|$|Much of the {{argument}} for Al-Kateb centred {{on the fact that}} he was a stateless man. Kateb's lawyer, O'Connor, noted that the provisions in the Migration Act about refugees were based on the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, both of which overlooked the situation of stateless persons. Several exchanges during the hearings illustrated the way in which the usual processes of the immigration system were not adapted well, if at all, to dealing with stateless people. In one such exchange, O'Connor referred to Al-Kateb both by his name and by the identifier used on the formal documents, [...] "SHDB" [...] (in matters concerning asylum seekers, names are usually suppressed in order to prevent persecution should they return to their country of origin). After some debate about whether to suppress Al-Kateb's name, Justice Kirby said that [...] "there often is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason...</b> because people suffer great risks if their name goes on the Internet that that will become known to the country that they want to avoid," [...] to which Al-Kateb's lawyer replied, [...] "That is correct, but, of course, with Mr Al-Kateb there is no country." ...|$|E

Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode's stand-outs. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh-out-loud moments, but was effective because the characters are so well developed: [...] "The Office has, over the years, become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy. ... The characters are so well-drawn by now, {{and for the most part}} so likable, that a sweet, low-key episode about Michael and the staff bonding over their singlehood worked even without a lot of memorable jokes." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as [...] "familiar territory, but it has plenty of fun moments." [...] Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman, and Jim and Pam's lunch. But Fickett said the series needed to address why Pam was staying with the company: [...] "Jim and Pam still work there because, well, that's part of the show – but there really isn't <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> as to why these two would still be at this dead end job." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{patrons of}} these artists were most often monastic establishments or wealthy {{families}} endowing a church. Because the paintings often had devotional purpose, the clients tended to be conservative. Frequently, it would seem, the wealthier the client, the more conservative the painting. There was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> for this. The paintings that were commissioned made a statement about the patron. Thus the more gold leaf [...] it displayed, the more it spoke to the patron's glory. The other valuable commodities in the paint-box were lapis lazuli and vermilion. Paint made from these colours did not lend itself to a tonal treatment. The azure blue made of powdered lapis lazuli went on flat, the depth and brilliance of colour being, like the gold leaf, {{a sign of the}} patron's ability to provide well. For these reasons, altarpieces are often much more conservatively painted than frescoes, which were often of almost life-sized figures and relied upon a stage-set quality rather than lavish display in order to achieve effect.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{activity}} of the authors, concerning different types of small PM machines, brought to the necessity to measure the respective cogging torques. Normally such a measure (including the hysteresis and bearing torque components), is realized with a prime motor to drag the machine under exam at very low speed and adopting <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> gearbox (classical method). During the activity a new method has been introduced adopting a step motor dragging directly the machine to be tested. The measure {{has been carried out}} with both systems; the results obtained with the classical method constitute the reference for the new one adopting the step motor, with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> agreement. The <b>reason</b> to adopt the new method is related to the great elasticity which the step motor and its control may allow; that appears useful, for example, to try to separate the actual cogging torque from the hysteresis and bearing torque components, which results impossible with the classical method...|$|R
30|$|Every {{individual}} desirability (di) of {{all three}} effecting factors is correlated perfectly by the logarithm function (Fig.  5). The combined desirability (D) is also found a good logarithm correlation with the recovery factor (RF). This agrees to the conclusion by Jeirani et al. (2013) that the oil-aqueous IFT correlates to the oil recovery factor. It {{should be noted that}} the combined desirability (D) has slightly lower R 2 than the individual desirability (di) although it is higher than 0.9 indicating <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> fitting. The <b>reason</b> could be explained that the summation of individual desirability (di) makes the combined desirability (D) dispersed or scattered because the individual desirability (di) is calculated from different value ranges. In addition, this example demonstrates that the desirability model is clearly able to predict the trend or indicate the relationship of the IFTs and the recovery factor (i.e. the oil recovery).|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} foreign {{languages}} {{has historically been}} a cornerstone in higher education for <b>a</b> variety of <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons,</b> one being that it will help students develop a sensitivity to diversity. This rationale is compelling in theory, but requires a practical approach for instruction that actually guides students towards such a learning outcome. Current research (e. g., Byrnes, 2006; Kramsch, 2006; Swaffar, 2006) {{has argued that the}} traditional focus on the development of communicative competence often promotes a functional understanding of the target language and dominant cultural values, thereby obscuring examples of linguistic ambiguity, power dynamics, and even cultural diversity. According to Kramsch (2009) these concepts can be highlighted by prioritizing symbolic competence, which is the “ [...] . ability to draw on the semiotic diversity afforded by multiple languages to reframe ways of seeing familiar events, create alternative realities, and find an appropriate subject position ‘between languages,’ so to speak” (pp. 200 – 201). This article discusses why the notion of symbolic competence is so important when teaching foreign language courses at the university level, and explains why theater offers a salient opportunity to engage with semiotic diversity. Specifically, theater allows students to interpret and play with meaning, and in the context of semiotics, students are able to observe, enact, and even dismantle meaning-making devices such as symbolic representation, symbolic action, and symbolic power. This article illustrates classroom activities and examples of student work from an intermediate (200 -level) French course, and concludes by discussing the larger implications for foreign language teaching and learning...|$|R
2500|$|While at Cambridge, Sharp {{heard the}} lectures of William Morris {{and became a}} Fabian Socialist and lifelong vegetarian. He was {{cautious}} in his public statements, however, feeling that he had much to lose, since, unlike Morris, he was not independently wealthy but dependent on outside funding for his researches. Respectability was important to him, increasingly so as he got older. According to his biographer, Maud Karpeles: [...] "Any display of singularity was displeasing to him; and he followed the convention in behaviour {{as well as in}} appearance unless there was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> for departing from them.

This critique was from a Marxist perspective: Lloyd (1908-82) had associated himself with the Communist Party since the 1930s. ...

40|$|David Foster Wallace’s novel Infinite Jest {{is usually}} touted by its fans {{as being a}} postpostmodern opus of unparalleled genius; this {{reaction}} is inconvenient for me insomuch as I don’t actually agree. More specifically, I have difficulty with the way Infinite Jest’s thematic content is framed by the techniques used to express it, {{despite the fact that}} Wallace’s verbal acrobatics are the stuff of legend. This paper argues that the style in which Infinite Jest is written consistently undermines the thematic considerations being simultaneously addressed, creating a dissonance that interferes with the reader’s ability to engage the novel on the emotional and personal level Wallace apparently craves. Infinite Jest is conceptually dense and requires significant commitment from its readers, as most “serious works of fiction” tend to do. It concerns itself with addiction and recovery, self-control and excess, the nature of communication and the pitfalls of ironic detachment. But Wallace’s trump card is not in thematics but in the nature of their deployment, and as a result readers are thrown instantly into a world riffled with footnotes, neologisms, and unexpected abbreviations. The book is chronologically disorganized, its prose unpredictable, and the grammar often stuffed to the ears with clauses meant to disorient; these disruptions are the hallmarks of Wallace’s work, much more so than his numerous and recurring conceptual interests, and are at the root of my criticism. He distracts, digresses, and details his readers often to the point of frightening them away altogether, and he does it for <b>a</b> lot of <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons.</b> But are these <b>reasons</b> <b>good</b> enough? My main concern is that {{as much as it is}} possible to see many of these digressive tactics parried by the book’s thematic undercurrents, there still seems to be a serious disjunction between what the novel is saying and how the novel is saying them. Although Wallace is of the strict and open opinion that postmodern irony has passed its peak and that “avant-garde irony and rebellion have become dilute and malign” (E Unibus Pluram), this doesn’t seem to stop him from using it and other devices that inhibit the novel’s efforts to posit a world in which ironic detachment is a pitfall and a danger. Since Wallace has proclaimed that “really good work probably comes out of a willingness to disclose yourself” (E Unibus Pluram), is there any acceptable way to defend his technique without positing a sort of disclosure-inhibiting mask...|$|R
40|$|For {{the case}} of 8 disks, the {{increase}} of the speed up drops when more than 10 processors are used. In contrast to this observation, the speed up is linear for {{the case of}} n disks. The speed up for n = d = 24 is 22. 6 which is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> result. One <b>reason</b> for this high speed up is the good performance of the bus of the KSR 1. An additional explanation is given {{by the number of}} disk accesses (also depicted in Figure 10) : Using a growing global buffer, the number of disk accesses decreases and compensates for some of the additional communication and synchronization cost The total run time of all tasks was about 7 % higher for 4 processors than for 1 processor in our experiments. Using more than 4 processors, this time even falls with an increasing number of processors. Therefore, we expect that there will be only a modest decline of the throughput by using the parallel spatial join with a large number of processors. 4. 6 Summary The major results of our experimental investigations are as follows: • The global buffer combined with a dynamic task assignment is the most efficient assignment technique according to our tests. This technique preserves spatial locality. Consequently, most of the page requests can be satisfied by the LRU-buffer. • By a task reassignment on all levels of the R*-tree directories, the load is balanced and the response time is additionally shortened. For local buffers, the selection of the processor with the most extensive work load shows the best performance. Otherwise, an arbitrary processor can be chosen for the reassignment. • Using only one disk, the speed up will not improve for more than 4 processors computing the spatial join. • We achieve a linear speed up close to n when the data is stored on n disks (e. g. the speed up is 22. 6 for 24 processors and disks). • Using the parallel spatial join with a large number of processors, has almost no influence on the total run time of all tasks and hence, we also expect almost no decline of the throughput. ...|$|R
