40|$|AbstractThe {{temperature}} dependencies of {{the infrared}} absorption CO bands of carboxy complexes of horseradish peroxidase (HRP(CO)) in glycerol/water mixture at pH 6. 0 and 9. 3 are interpreted using {{the theory of}} optical absorption bandshape. The bands’ anharmonic behavior is explained assuming {{that there is a}} higher-energy set of conformational substates (CSSh), which are populated upon heating and correspond to the protein substates with disordered water molecules in the heme pocket. Analysis of the second moments of the CO bands of the carboxy complexes of myoglobin (Mb(CO)) and hemoglobin (Hb(CO)), and of HRP(CO) with benzohydroxamic acid (HRP(CO) +BHA), shows that <b>the</b> low energy <b>CSSh</b> exists also in the open conformation of Mb(CO), where the heme pocket is spacious enough to accommodate a water molecule. In the HRP(CO) +BHA and closed conformations of Mb(CO) and Hb(CO), the heme pocket is packed with BHA and different amino acids, <b>the</b> <b>CSSh</b> has much higher energy and is hardly populated even at the highest temperatures. Therefore only motions of these amino acids contribute to the band broadening. These motions are linked to the protein surface and frozen in the glassy matrix, whereas in the liquid solvent they are harmonic. Thus the second moment of the CO band is temperature-independent in glass and is proportional to the temperature in liquid. The temperature dependence of the second moment of the CO peak of HRP(CO) in the trehalose glass exhibits linear coupling to an oscillator. This oscillator can be a moving water molecule locked in the heme pocket in the whole interval of temperatures or a trehalose molecule located in the heme pocket...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on a {{particular}} chapter {{in the history of}} the Christian study of Hinduism. Perspectives and attitudes from the mid-twentieth century will be studied as seen in the Christian Society for the Study of Hinduism (CSSH, 1940 - 1956), the first organization or society ever to focus on the Christian encounter with Hinduism, and the first forty issues of its quarterly publication, The Pilgrim (1941 - 1952). 1 <b>The</b> <b>CSSH</b> made no attempt to spell out what it meant by "Hinduism," nor what particular variety of "Christianity" was brought to the study. The non-reflective use of these terms is not surprising for that time but demands examination in this thesis, which focuses on the Christian understanding of Hinduism that is discernable in the work of the society. The meaning of "Hinduism" has become a hotly contested issue, as has the role of Christians in developing that term and its various shades of meaning. This thesis does not attempt to resolve all the questions and controversies surrounding the study of Hinduism, but does intend to contribute to the ongoing engagement between Christians and Hindus by highlighting an impressive (and neglected) chapter in the history of that interreligiousReligious Studies and ArabicD.

The papers in this conference are welcome additions to this literature. One prominent set of arguments by one or both of the authors of this chapter has as its starting point the idea that monetary policy in this period was misguided because of imperfect knowledge about the Phil-lips curve and the natural rate of unemployment (or productivity growth). Monetary policy was not sufficiently tight because the estimates of the natu-ral rate of unemployment were too low, so that higher actual unemployment was thought to indicate slack in the economy. 1 Explanations of <b>the</b> Great Infl <b>ation</b> that are based on imperfect knowl-edge and misperceptions by policymakers and / or private agents can be use-fully formulated in terms of a learning model rather than a model relying on a rational expectations equilibrium (REE).

40|$|During the Cold War, economists {{utilizing}} mathematical {{methods in}} both the Soviet Union and the United States found they shared a common research project. After the Stalinist years {{in which they could}} communicate very little, they found that they had much to learn from each other. Mathematical economics came to bridge the divide between East and West even though the meetings and collaborations between American and Soviet colleagues were fraught with tension and misunderstanding. The Cold War excitement about mathematical economics and the East-West cooperation it allowed, however, dwindled with the end of détente, the global shift in economic science away from mathematical economics, and the end of state socialism in the East Bloc. To understand {{the rise and fall of}} this cooperation and convergence, we examine the case of the connection between Tjalling C. Koopmans, a Dutch economist living in the United States as a result of World War II, and Leonid V. Kantorovich, a Russian scientist living in the Soviet Union.
