500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 November 1940, Conte di Cavour and Giulio Cesare were at anchor in Taranto harbor when they were {{attacked}} by 21 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier , along with several other warships. One torpedo exploded underneath 'B' turret at 23:15, and her captain requested tugboats to help ground the ship on a nearby [...] sandbank. His admiral vetoed the request {{until it was too}} late and Conte di Cavour had to use a deeper, , sandbank at 04:30 on 12 November. In an effort to lighten the ship, her guns and parts of her superstructure were removed and Conte di Cavour was refloated on 9 June 1941. Temporary repairs to enable the ship to reach Trieste for permanent repairs took until 22 December. Her guns were operable by September 1942, but replacing her entire electrical system took longer <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> under repair when Italy surrendered a year later. The Regia Marina made plans to replace her secondary and anti-aircraft weapons with a dozen [...] dual-purpose guns in twin mounts, twelve 64-caliber , and twenty-three 65-caliber 20mm AA guns. Her hulk was damaged in an air raid and capsized on 23 February 1945. Refloated shortly after the end of the war, Conte di Cavour was scrapped in 1946.|$|E
500|$|When the {{war started}} in September 1939, Lynx belonged to the 4th Large Destroyer Division (4e {{division}} de contre-torpilleurs) with her sisters [...] and [...] She {{was assigned to the}} Western Command (Forces maritimes de l'Ouest) for convoy escort duties from October to May 1940 where she guarded convoys traveling between Gibraltar and Brest as well as Casablanca, French Morocco, and Le Verdon-sur-Mer. In January 1940, the ship had a British Type 123 ASDIC installed; several months later Lynx had two depth-charge throwers reinstalled, No. 3 gun removed, and her depth charge stowage reduced to a dozen 200kg and eight 100kg depth charges to improve her stability. She was transferred to Mers-el-Kébir, French Algeria, on 27 May <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> there on 25 June after France surrendered. The ship managed to escape the harbor during the British attack on Mers-el-Kébir on 3 July and together with her sister Tigre briefly engaged the destroyer [...] The sisters then depth charged the submarine [...] as the French ships headed for Toulon, where they arrived the following day. As the oldest contre-torpilleurs in French service, Lynx and her sisters were reduced to reserve and stripped of their light anti-aircraft armament. On 27 November 1942, Lynx was scuttled at Toulon {{with the rest of the}} French fleet to prevent her capture by the Germans. She was refloated on 23 January 1944 and beached at the adjacent port of Brégaillon. The wreck was raised in 1948 and broken up.|$|E

500|$|The ship escorted a {{force of}} minelayers on the nights of 29/30 April and 9/10 May 1940 in the {{vicinity}} of the Great Fisherman's Bank, but the second sortie turned back when British destroyers were spotted. Bruno Heinemann began a lengthy refit later that month <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> not combat worthy in November. On 5 April 1941, Bruno Heinemann left Germany for Occupied France and she was attacked by two torpedo bombers en route, but suffered no damage. The ship and the other destroyers present escorted commerce raiders, blockade runners and major warships as they used the French Atlantic coast ports until she was recalled on 6 September for another refit. Bruno Heinemann probably was fitted at this time with a four-barrel 2-centimeter AA gun on her aft deckhouse that replaced the pair of 2-centimeter guns originally mounted there. She escorted the battleship [...] in mid-January 1942 as she sailed from the Baltic to Trondheim. Bruno Heinemann, together with the rest of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, sailed from Kiel on 24 January for France as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash. On the evening of 25 January, she struck two mines laid by [...] off the Belgian coast. The first detonated beneath the ship and knocked out Nos. 2 and 3 boiler rooms and the second blew the ship's bow off shortly afterwards. 98 members of the ship's crew lost their lives: 93 were lost at sea, while another five, who had originally been among the 234 men rescued, died of their wounds.|$|E

Her brother Greg later recalled several times she had gone out with a man before moving to Sarasota, but agreed she had trouble connecting socially in the beach resort town. He believed her constant self-deprecation for being [...] "dateless" [...] contributed to her ongoing depression. In a later interview, Greg stated that Christine had been in two serious relationships: the first had been when she was a teenager and was with a man in his twenties who had subsequently died in a car accident, and the second had been as an adult, but she had broken it off under pressure from her antisemitic father because the boyfriend was Jewish.|$|E
2500|$|King Henry died in January 1547 and was succeeded {{first by}} his son Edward VI, and then by both his daughters in turn. It was to Hampton Court that Queen Mary I (Henry's elder daughter) retreated with King Philip to spend her honeymoon, after their wedding at Winchester. Mary chose Hampton Court as the place {{for the birth of}} her first child, {{which turned out to be}} the first of two phantom pregnancies. Mary had {{initially}} wanted to give birth at Windsor Castle as it was a more secure location, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> fearful of rebellion. But Hampton Court was considerably larger, and could accommodate the entire court and more besides. Mary stayed at the Palace awaiting the birth of the [...] "child" [...] for over five months, and only left because of the inhabitable state of the court being kept in the one location for so long, after which her court departed for the much smaller palace of Oatlands. Mary was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth I, and it was Elizabeth who had the eastern kitchen built; today, this is the palace's public tea room.|$|E
