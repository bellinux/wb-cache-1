40|$|AbstractRecently, on the {{background}} of energy-saving and emission reduction, coalbed methane (CBM) as an important new type of clean energy is paid more and more attention to. However, the current research mainly focuses on the technology level of CBM mining, and the research on mining cost and other economic evaluation has been absent, which is a disadvantage for industrialization of the CBM resources. In this paper, the cost of CBM mining with pressure-releasing in Yangquan minefield was investigated and analyzed through spot investigation firstly, and the advanced <b>activity-based</b> <b>cost</b> management (ABM) was implanted. The {{results show that the}} mining cost of CBM structure is closely related with the <b>activity-based</b> <b>cost</b> driver, and the correct division of the <b>activity-based</b> <b>cost</b> driver is the key to accurate cost measurement. Through comparing the mining cost of No. 3 Mine with that of No. 5 Mine, it is found that there is a significant effect of mining method, mining technology, and the exploitation time on the mining cost of CBM. The research not only has laid a foundation for the analysis about mining cost level, composition and influencing factors, but also provided the basis for the government to make the relevant economic policy of CBM mining project...|$|R

50|$|<b>Activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> (ABC) recognizes that, {{in modern}} factories, most {{manufacturing}} costs {{are determined by}} the amount of 'activities' (e.g., the number of production runs per month, and the amount of production equipment idle time) and that the key to effective cost control is therefore optimizing the efficiency of these activities. Both lifecycle costing and <b>activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> recognize that, in the typical modern factory, the avoidance of disruptive events (such as machine breakdowns and quality control failures) is of far greater importance than (for example) reducing the costs of raw materials. <b>Activity-based</b> <b>costing</b> also de-emphasizes direct labor as a cost driver and concentrates instead on activities that drive costs, as the provision of a service or the production of a product component.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{management accounting}} technique, specifically <b>activity-based</b> <b>cost</b> management, as a modelling process. Particularly in Anglo-Saxon capitalism, various institutional pressures {{have worked to}} dissociate management from expertise in the managed process. Management of this character can only engage with concrete processes by modelling them in terms which it can comprehend and with which it can engage. The result is a market in management and accounting techniques for producing these simplified representations. Those discussed in this paper consist essentially of a reporting framework which is imposed on the expert practitioner, so that the process is re-described in modelled form. Precisely because the resulting models are simplified, however, the consequences of managing through them are dysfunctional in various ways. In order to show the underlying similarities between apparently unconnected instances of this process, the paper discusses some attempts to open up aesthetic design to management control before proceeding {{to the analysis of}} <b>activity-based</b> <b>cost</b> management.

40|$|Understanding how the {{building}} design influences construction costs is a challenging task for estimators. Estimators {{must recognize the}} design conditions that affect construction costs and customize the cost estimate accordingly. Estimators have different preferences for {{how and when to}} adjust a project’s activities, resources, and resource productivity rates that form the basis of a cost estimate. Current tools and methodologies lack ways to help estimators customize construction cost information according to their preferences and maintain cost estimates as the design changes based on those preferences. This paper describes the <b>activity-based</b> <b>cost</b> estimating process we formalized to help estimators customize a project’s activities, resources, and resource productivity rates based on their preferences and the particular features in a given product model. We implemented and tested the process in a prototype called <b>Activity-based</b> <b>Cost</b> Estimating (ACE). ACE creates a set of project-specific activities that know why they are needed in the cost estimate, what feature requires their execution, what resources are executing the activity and why, and what their labor and material costs are. Our tests show that ACE helps estimators to generate and maintain cost estimates more completely, consistently, and quickly than state-of-the-art cost estimating software...|$|R
