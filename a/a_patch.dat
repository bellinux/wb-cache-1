5|$|On January 3, 2008, IGN {{reported}} that Valve employees {{had created a}} thread on Valve's website forums for players to list the problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version, such as the frame rate issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, and the slow loading times in Portal. <b>A</b> <b>patch</b> for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, it {{made no mention of}} fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{original}} release, <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> was available for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, which contained over 200 quest and scripting-related fixes. The update released on December 14, 2010, has fixed further glitches and save game problems, including companion-related bugs. Subsequent updates were released in February and April that corrected numerous bugs and gameplay issues. <b>A</b> <b>patch</b> was released on July 5, 2011, that included a provision that automatically creates a save prior to the endgame sequence. After credits, the user is prompted to load this save game, allowing single save players to play DLC without creating a new game.|$|E
5|$|A {{demonstration}} of the game was released on 26 June 2002, featuring tutorial missions and a full single-player mission. The game was released on 19 August in North America and on 30 August in Europe. The Creative Assembly released <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> on 5 November 2002, which was targeted to fix the several bugs that were still present in the game. A new historical battle based on the Battle of Stamford Bridge was later released by The Creative Assembly, made available through Wargamer.|$|E
5|$|A glitch was {{observed}} by players on Xbox 360 where, {{if they were}} playing while online and had exactly 100 friends attached to their account, the game would freeze and/or they {{would be unable to}} play online.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>patch</b> of {{coloured}} feathers {{found on}} the throat or upper breast of some species of birds. It is a feature found on many male hummingbirds, particularly those found in North America, whose gorgets are typically iridescent. Other species have gorgets, such as the purple-throated fruitcrow and the chukar partridge. The term {{is derived from the}} gorget used in military armor to protect the throat.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> {{of missing}} data in Google Sky near {{the constellation of}} Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers.

5|$|Bennie Oosterbaan's jersey number 47 was {{the first}} Michigan {{football}} jersey number retired, and until 2011, {{it was one of}} only five numbers retired by the Michigan football program. In 2012, the Michigan Football Legends program led to the reissue of the No. 47 jersey to linebacker Jake Ryan, bearing <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> (pictured at right) honoring Oosterbaan. Each player to wear the jersey will also dress at a locker bearing a plaque with Oosterbaan's name and his time of tenure at Michigan.|$|E

5|$|The game {{took the}} form of a ROM hack of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of Chrono Trigger. It was coded using Chrono Trigger ROM editing software, and was meant to be played on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. The {{finished}} game was intended to be released as <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> file in the IPS (International Patching System) format, so as to avoid illegal distribution of a full Chrono Trigger ROM.|$|E

5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly on <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> of mud. The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.|$|E
5|$|The {{velvet belly}} is grouped with the Caribbean lanternshark (E. hillianus), fringefin lanternshark (E. schultzi), brown lanternshark (E. unicolor), broadbanded lanternshark (E. gracilispinis), combtooth lanternshark (E. decacuspidatus), and dwarf lanternshark (E. perryi) in having irregularly arranged, {{needle-shaped}} dermal denticles.

5|$|After the {{completion}} by the 2015 Group {{takeover of the}} club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the Animo et Fide motto was removed, along with <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> of green {{at the base of}} the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010â€“11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> for the game to keep its multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. <b>A</b> <b>patch</b> of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
