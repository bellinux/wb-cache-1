5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, <b>a</b> <b>gorgeous</b> young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in his new film, leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number {{of men and women in}} the past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E
5|$|Bizen Province {{became an}} early center of iron {{production}} and swordmaking {{because of the}} proximity to the continent. Conditions for sword production were ideal: good iron sand; charcoal and water were readily available; and the San'yōdō road ran right through the province. Bizen {{has been the only}} province to produce swords continuously from the Heian to the Edo period. In kotō times, a large number of skilled swordsmiths lived along the lower reaches of the Yoshii river around Osafune making it the largest center of sword production in Japan. Bizen province not only dominated in the numbers of blades produced but also in quality; and Bizen swords have long been celebrated for excellent swordsmanship. The peak of the Bizen tradition, marked by <b>a</b> <b>gorgeous</b> and luxurious style, was reached in the mid-Kamakura period. Later, in the 13th century, the Ichimonji and Osafune schools, the mainstream schools of Bizen Province, maintained the Heian style of the Ko-Bizen, the oldest school in Bizen province. After the 13th century, swords became wider and the point (kissaki) longer, most likely {{as a response to the}} thick armour of the invading Mongols. Mass production due to heavy demand for swords from the early 15th to the 16th century led to a lower quality of blades. The Bizen tradition is associated with a deep koshi-zori, a standard mihaba, bigger kasane with medium kissaki. The jihada is itame-hada often accompanied by utsuri. The hamon is chōji midare in nioi deki.|$|E

25|$|After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus {{is taken}} to Pilate's court in the praetorium. Only in the Gospel of Luke, finding that Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas' jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send Jesus to Herod. Herod Antipas (the same man who had {{previously}} ordered the death of John the Baptist) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time, {{because he had been}} hoping to observe one of the miracles of Jesus. However, Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put <b>a</b> <b>gorgeous</b> robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity. After questioning Jesus and receiving very few replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate.|$|E

5000|$|The song <b>A</b> Jagged <b>Gorgeous</b> Winter was {{included}} in Rock Band 2 as a playable song on the disc and also on a Target commercial for Rock Band 2.

500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated, [...] "The ballads are lavishly melodic.

[...] The song features Tyler, the Creator pining [...] "for <b>a</b> <b>gorgeous</b> girl" [...] while [...] "crooner Frank Ocean chimes in with a vocal hook". The track is [...] "delivered with sweetly juvenile expressions of desire, except that Tyler peppers the track with a single-word epithet that would earn him a kick in the groin from any self-respecting woman." [...] HipHopDX's Sean Ryon mused that [...] "even the more subdued songs like [...] "She" [...] with Frank Ocean" [...] embody [...] "Tyler’s middle-fingers-up attitude, as he twists perverted tales of stalking girls and “stabbing Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus” into anathematic odes to unbridled individualism." ...|$|E

And yet, for me, Barfi was a singularly frustrating experience {{there was so much}} to like, but the film never became {{more than the sum of}} its parts". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Barfi had the potential to be great cinema, but as it stands it's a respectable film that's still better than a lot else you're likely to see." [...] On the contrary, Namrata Joshi of Outlook felt that [...] "The flashback within flashback narrative gets way too clumsy and turgid, the thriller twist absolutely pointless [...] appears much too crafted and self-consciously gorgeous, and feels eminently facile and plastic".|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the PopMatters {{review of the}} album, critic Adrian Begrand wrote: [...] "It's the excellent, and much talked-about 'Talk' that has the band showing tremendous creativity, delving straight into mid-'70s krautrock, and piecing together <b>a</b> <b>gorgeous</b> pop song." [...] Bud Scoppa of Paste magazine wrote: [...] "'Talk' stands out as an anthem in an album full of them." [...] Dan Tallis of the BBC noted that the track was [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "positively gargantuan". Jonathan Keefe of Slant magazine wrote: [...] "'Talk' is given one of the album's most memorable melodies, but its impact is reduced by the song's structure, in which the lead guitar echoes Martin's vocal melody after every line, so that melody becomes tiresome well before the first chorus hits." [...] Despite the positive reception of [...] "Talk", Martin has stated that Berryman dislikes it, and thus they no longer perform the song live.|$|E
500|$|Asked in July 2006 {{what she}} hoped for Kyla {{in the long}} run, Ayola responded: [...] "Most of all I’d {{like to see her}} laugh, big belly laughs as she has not done much of that! ...I also would like her to find a man that she is with not just because he is {{attractive}} but someone who can work her out and understand her".

Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s <b>a</b> <b>gorgeous</b> man."

500|$|... "Devil in a New Dress" [...] has {{received}} general acclaim from music critics, and was {{noted for its}} soulful production, {{as well as the}} verse provided by Ross. It was considered a highlight of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and has been described as [...] "perhaps the easiest song to like on first listen." [...] It was compared favorably to songs from West's debut studio album The College Dropout by Jon Caramanica of The New York Times. Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic felt that the track brought out the best in Ross. Slant Magazine viewed that on [...] "Devil in a New Dress", West perfected the sampling style he helped make popular, and commented that West [...] "manipulates the pitch and tempo of Smokey Robinson's 'Will You Love Me Tomorrow?' until it crawls luxuriantly out of the speakers like wine poured in slow motion. It's <b>a</b> <b>gorgeous</b> slow burner that turns tragic in its third act, as Kanye's rhymes swap lust for heartache before distorted guitar lines and a muscular verse from Rick Ross close it out".|$|E
