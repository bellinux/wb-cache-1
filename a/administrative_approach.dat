40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship of the Utah State University concurrent enrollment program to the achievement (GPA), recruitment, and retention of program participants after joining Utah State University. Three <b>administrative</b> <b>approaches</b> to the management of concurrent enrollment programs were identified for the {{purpose of this}} study: Level One, Level Two, and Level Three. Level One involved high school teachers who taught and graded the concurrent enrollment program courses. In Level Two, high school teachers taught the courses, but University professors prepared exams and graded the papers. In Level Three, teaching, exam preparation, and paper grading were all executed by university faculty. To determine the effects of the three different <b>administrative</b> <b>approaches</b> on concurrent enrollment programs, four research questions were formulated: (1) For the three different <b>administrative</b> <b>approaches</b> to the management of the concurrent enrollment program practiced by Utah State University, are there different GPAs for comparable selected major courses for program participants? (2) For the three different <b>administrative</b> <b>approaches,</b> are there differences in the proportion of high school students recruited to Utah State University? (3) For the three different <b>administrative</b> <b>approaches,</b> are there different rates of retention for participating students one year after joining Utah State University? (4) For the three different <b>administrative</b> <b>approaches,</b> are there greater GP As and retention rates when compared with Utah State University 2 ̆ 7 s regular freshmen population? A sample from the target population of concurrent enrollment program participants from 1988 to 1991 was used. The data were collected from existing Utah State University records. The dependent variables were GPA, recruitment, and retention, while <b>administrative</b> <b>approaches</b> were the three levels of the independent variable. The means for the Level One approach were statistically and educationally significant as compared to the remaining two levels. One year after joining Utah State University, the recruited concurrent enrollment program participants tended to remain with Utah State University. Therefore, it was recommended that the program be supported with the emphasis on encouraging more high school teachers to teach concurrent enrollment courses in the future...|$|R

5000|$|After 1945 free {{elections}} were held, {{in which many}} parties (among them the Smallholders, the Social Democrats, and the Communists) were voted into Parliament. Due to Soviet pressure the government coalition, led by the Social Democrats, accepted the small Communist Party into the coalition. By the next election, most of the former government MEPs were entered into the Communist Party. In the election of 1949, the party, with Soviet backup resources, used the flaw in the so-called 'blue-ticket' election system, from which this election got its name, to have its voters transported in trucks to all voting offices, where with reproduced and collected blue tickets they could vote away from their home address district.The Communists gained power while the Soviet Army propped up the Hungarian state. Under their auspices, the former Arrow Cross torture chambers in the prisons filled up with their opponents. Arrests, beatings or summary executions were used as a standard tool by the Secret Police, who employed an extensive net of informants. Random arrests without charge were commonly initiated by regime informants, some of these abductees were never heard from again. By this time the administration was composed predominantly of hardline communists or careerists, who made up the Soviet-accepted controllers of wealth and power. Materials were routinely confiscated from the Hungarian populace and taken to the USSR for [...] "War Repairs". These administrators' actions were rewarded with position and favour. In Budapest this <b>administrative</b> <b>approach</b> was paired with aggressive industrialisation, militarisation, collectivisation and politicisation of the economy. Factories, chimneys, bridges, and railways were rapidly constructed. Workers during rest time were often subjected to Soviet propaganda and had to practice self-criticism in public meetings, negatively appraising their own performance. Rákosi's government {{was one of the}} most dictatorial and most exploitative of the Warsaw Pact countries.The political situation was centred on advancing the interest of those informal factions, which had their primary focus on well-being. In this situation, Imre Nagy was elected as next Prime Minister. He had gained widespread popularity by distributing land to farmers, and the support of the elite by practicing self-criticism and completing party programs, even when it conflicted with his proposals. He moved to create a multiparty system, winning the support of the MEP majority. He declared Hungarian sovereignty and self-governance, its departure from the Warsaw Pact and its willingness to co-operate with all countries. During this time, the CIA-sponsored Radio Free Europe broadcast effective methods of urban combat, including constructing barricades and producing explosives. In Budapest, peaceful protests demanding Soviet withdrawal, free press, freedom of expression and {{free elections}}, were organized by university students, professors and intellectuals. The Soviet Minister for War Issues ordered the brigades to move into the city. In response to this action, the protesters set up defenses. When the tanks and elite forces opened fire on the mass protest situated in front of the Parliament buildings, they caused a national uprising overnight. There were examples of long-stationed Soviet soldiers refusing to accept the authority of their officers and defecting to the revolutionary forces.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{science has}} been {{evolving}} in {{faster and more}} effective ways {{in order to find}} innovative solutions to reduce the impact that every human activity and new technology have on the environment. This scenario should be the same in the field of environmental law. However, the evolution of environmental laws and policies has been different. Particularly, the harmonization of laws to assess risks of damage to the environment has developed significantly compared to the existing liability systems to address environmental damage. Traditionally, the actions of liability for environmental damage at an international level have been governed by civil liability provisions which have led to unnecessary complexity, overlap of jurisdictions and an unsuccessful restoration of the environment in some cases. This is shown in the efforts of the International Law Commission (ILC) to develop international law to address environmental damage by effective response measures for restoration in addition to compensation. Some other examples followed the same tendency to the <b>administrative</b> <b>approach</b> to liability by means of response measures. The Protocol on Civil Liability and Compensation for Damage Caused by the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary Waters included the concept of response measures following an industrial accident notwithstanding the civil liability nature of the protocol. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty rephrases a similar procedure to the <b>administrative</b> <b>approach</b> to liability implementing response actions in case of an environmental emergency. However, the first legal instrument addressing environmental damage via an <b>administrative</b> <b>approach</b> to liability is the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (The Nagoya Protocol). This paper will analyze the Nagoya Protocol as an example of <b>administrative</b> <b>approach</b> to liability in case of damage to biodiversity and will examine the challenges to implement this Protocol in domestic legislation. Key issues will be explored such as the distinction between <b>administrative</b> <b>approach</b> to liability and administrative liability in the sense of State liability, the concept of operator linked to causality, and a clear distinction between, regulatory measures targeted to minimizing risk; and, liability measures applicable after the damage has occurred, in order to provide for restoration or compensation...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{widespread}} {{dissatisfaction with}} the perceived poor quality of issued patents has spurred a diverse range of groups to call for reform of administrative procedures.

In this Article, Professors Benjamin and Rai contend that this treatment is doctrinally incorrect and normatively undesirable.

40|$|Utilities {{regulators}} can use {{a variety}} of approaches to calculate transition costs. We categorized these approaches along three dimensions. The first dimension is the use of administrative vs. market procedures to value the assets in question. <b>Administrative</b> <b>approaches</b> use analytical techniques to estimate transition costs. Market valuation relies on the purchase price of particular assets to determine their market values. The second dimension concerns when the valuation is done, either before or after the restructuring of the electricity industry.

40|$|An inquiry {{committee}} of the Dutch parliament concluded that the capital Amsterdam - and especially the famous Red light district - is a centre of national and international organized crime. The city of Amsterdam set up a project {{to develop and implement}} an <b>administrative</b> <b>approach</b> to combat the organized crime problem: the Van Traa-project. This project is internationally recognized as a successful example of such an approach. Elaborating on an evaluation study this article critically analyses the policy theory and the effects of this project. This analysis shows that the assumptions that underlie the project are debatable, or proved hard to employ in practice. Despite {{the fact that in the}} policy plans the necessity of a multi-agency approach is stressed, external parties such as the police and the public prosecutors department take a rather passive stand, preventing the <b>administrative</b> <b>approach</b> of becoming a part of a truly integrative approach to organized crime. Furthermore, this article proves that it is hard to confirm this successfulness in a sound scientific manner. Many positive results can be observed, but it remains unclear to what extent these results have an impact on organized crime. Although some indications of a plausible impact of the measures taken in the Van Traa-project on organized crime were found, this article also refers to some indications of counterproductive effects. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.

Thus comparing them can help identify areas of divergence that might explain these differences and assist in the project of theory building. Several salient explanations are rooted in Japan's labor market: it exacts high opportunity costs from parents who interrupt their careers to raise children, keeps ideal workers from having much time for their families, assumes and reinforces a traditional gender ideology, and hires few young workers into good jobs.
