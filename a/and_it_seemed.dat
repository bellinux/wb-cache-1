5|$|Australia fell to {{successive}} defeats in {{the opening}} two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that the captaincy was affecting his form. The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|A {{shakedown}} of {{the system}} {{took place during the}} first two weeks of November 1967 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an operational test. The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, Muscle Shoals had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop movements in the vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops moving toward a fixed location like Khe Sanh was not the same as doing it on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 Tange and the {{architectural}} journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe {{were invited to}} attend {{the reconstruction of the}} Ise Shrine. The shrine has been reconstructed every 20years and in 1953 it was the 59th iteration. Normally the reconstruction process was a very closed affair but this time the ceremony was opened to architects and journalists to document the event. The ceremony coincided {{with the end of the}} American Occupation <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to a modernist structure: an honest expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.|$|E

5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway, settling a rivalry with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway that led to disputes over the route and planning. It opened in 1851 after several false starts, followed by branch lines to Rye Harbour in 1854, Dungeness in 1881 and New Romney in 1884. The line struggled to be profitable <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> likely that it would close following the Beeching Report. All the branch lines were closed by 1967 but the main line was kept open because of poor road connections in the area. Services are currently being provided by Southern.|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E

5|$|Klaipėda (German: Memel), an {{important}} seaport in East Prussia, was detached from Germany by Article 28 of the Treaty of Versailles and was {{governed by the}} Allies according to Article 99. France assumed administration of the region while Lithuania continued to lobby for its control, claiming that it should belong to Lithuania as it had a significant Lithuanian population (see Lithuania Minor) and was that country's only access to the Baltic Sea. Poland also laid claim to the territory. As the Allies were hesitant {{to make a decision}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that the region would remain a free state much like the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania took the initiative and organized the Klaipėda Revolt in January 1923. Soviet Russia and Germany supported the action. The region, as an autonomous territory with its own parliament (Klaipėda Parliament), was attached to Lithuania. The region covered about 2,400km² and had a population of approximately 140,000.|$|E
5|$|Charles V {{ascended the}} thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire {{following}} {{the deaths of}} his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. Francis I likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515, leaving three relatively young rulers and {{an opportunity for a}} clean slate. The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe {{in the wake of a}} new Ottoman threat, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that peace might be secured. Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable. Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy, then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles. A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Sensing this, Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally, signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525.|$|E
5|$|England captain Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat despite the dull light; Trent Bridge had {{reputation}} for being favourable to batsmen, and in the previous Test between Australia and England at the ground in 1938, four Englishmen scored centuries as the hosts made 658, before Stan McCabe of Australia made 232 runs himself. The first innings set {{the pattern of the}} series as the English top order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather, and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton {{had to deal with the}} contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall—with a low, somewhat round-arm action—and Miller, who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at the point of delivery. In the first two overs, the Australian pairing extracted little bounce <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> as though the hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a solid start. Lindwall bowled the first ball of the match at a moderate pace, and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Gradually, the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace. Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it bounced before reaching a fielder. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The ball went between bat and pads as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad.|$|E

5|$|The Rock {{lost the}} WWF Championship to Angle at No Mercy in October. Around this time, The Rock feuded with Rikishi and {{defeated}} him at Survivor Series. The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell {{match for the}} WWF Championship at Armageddon, which Kurt Angle won to retain the title. On December 18 on Raw, The Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, then losing it back to them the next night at a SmackDown! taping. In 2001, The Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out in February, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time. The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Mr. McMahon, who interfered on his behalf. On the next night's Raw Is War, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H came to the ring with a sledgehammer <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> he would help The Rock, because of the rivalry between Austin and Triple H (and an argument with McMahon earlier in the night), but he attacked him instead, allying with McMahon and Austin. Austin and Triple H formed a tag team called The Power Trip, while The Rock was indefinitely suspended. Johnson used this time off {{to act in the}} movie The Mummy Returns.|$|E
