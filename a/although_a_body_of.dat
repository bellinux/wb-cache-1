40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} evaluates the {{accuracy}} of clinical and archival predictors of patients' aggressive behaviour on a locked admissions ward. Method: Over a 9 -month period, staff members estimated the likelihood that patients would become aggressive during their stay in the ward. These unaided clinical assessments were obtained with Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) administered {{before the end of}} the first full day of admission. Archival predictions were based on demographic variables (e. g. gender, number of previous admissions, diagnosis) derived from patients' admission forms. Aggressive behaviour was recorded with the Staff Observation Aggression Scale-Revised (SOAS-R). Results: Clinical predictions of aggression were found to be moderately accurate. On the basis of clinical estimates, 75 % of the patients were correctly classified as becoming aggressive or not.

40|$|Despite renewed {{interest}} in traditional trait approaches to leadership and despite recent demographic trends towards an aging workforce, research on leaders' age as a specific demographic trait variable has remained surprisingly sparse and fragmented. This article provides {{a comprehensive review of}} the empirical literature on this issue. <b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> research relating leaders' age with their behaviors and outcomes has emerged, the existing findings exhibit little consistency and lack theoretical coherence. Integrating theories of emotional aging with research on emotions and leadership, we therefore develop a novel, emotion-based framework that explicates key mechanisms and boundary conditions underlying age-leadership linkages. Moreover, we outline opportunities for further theoretical extensions and provide recommendations for future empirical work.

This raises the threat of fraud by adulteration using coffee grains from other countries, thus creating a demand for robust and cost-effective methods for the determination of geographical origin of coffee samples. Spectroscopic techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), near infrared (NIR), and mid-infrared (mIR) have arisen as strong candidates for the task. <b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> work exists that reports on their individual performances, a faithful comparison has not been established yet. We evaluated the performance of 1 H-NMR, Attenuated Total Reflectance mIR (ATR-mIR), and NIR applied to fraud detection in Colombian coffee.

40|$|SUMMARY Biochemical {{riboflavin}} {{status was}} measured in 68 preterm infants who were receiving either human milk or a preterm infant formula (containing riboflavin, 1 - 8 mg/l) {{during the first few}} weeks of life. The relation between riboflavin status, type of diet, and time of introduction of a multivitamin supplement containing riboflavin was analysed and the duration of phototherapy was recorded. Those who received the multivitamin supplement on or before day 7 of life seldom became deficient and no significant difference between diets was seen in this group. Of those who received the supplement after day 7, human milk fed infants commonly developed abnormal riboflavin status (18 out of 23 infants) compared with a small and significantly lower incidence in the formula fed group. Dietary effects on riboflavin status seemed to outweigh in importance those of phototherapy. It is concluded that the riboflavin content of human milk, which may be lowered by photodegradation, is not sufficient to ensure normal biochemical status in preterm infants. The larger amounts provided by a multivitamin supplement or by a preterm infant formula may, however, prevent biochemical deficiency. The desirability (and safety) of routine riboflavin supplementation of preterm infants is discussed. <b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> experimental evidence suggest...|$|E
40|$|Rho family GTPases are key signal {{transducers}} in cell regulation. <b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> {{literature has}} implicated the Rho family members Rac 1 and Rac 2 in multiple hematopoietic-cell functions, {{the role of}} Cdc 42 in hematopoiesis remains unclear. Here we have examined the hematopoietic properties and the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSP) functions of gene-targeted mice carrying null alleles of cdc 42 gap, a negative regulator of Cdc 42. The Cdc 42 GAP-/- fetal liver and bone marrow cells showed a 3 -fold increase in Cdc 42 activity but normal Rac and RhoA activities, indicating that Cdc 42 GAP knockout resulted in a gain of Cdc 42 activity in the hematopoietic tissues. Cdc 42 GAP-/- mice were anemic. The cellularity of fetal liver and bone marrow, the number and composition percentage of HSPs, and the erythroid blast-forming unit and colony-forming unit (BFU-E/CFU-E) activities were significantly reduced in the homozygous mice. The decrease in HSP number was associated with increased apoptosis of the Cdc 42 GAP-/- HSPs and the activation of JNK-mediated apoptotic machinery. Moreover, homozygous HSPs showed impaired cortical F-actin assembly, deficiency in adhesion and migration, and defective engraftment. These results provide evidence that Cdc 42 activity is important for erythropoiesis and for multiple HSP functions, including survival, adhesion, and engraftment...|$|E

As homeotherms, avian divers regulate their body temperature within a narrow range, with core body temperatures typically between 38 and 42 °C (Dawson and Whittow, 2000). Water has a heat capacity 4000 {{times greater than}} that of air and a thermal conductivity 25 times that of air. Hence, cold water is an enormous heat sink. Unless properly insulated, birds will lose heat very rapidly in cold water, and the thermoregulatory costs might be a great burden to the overall energy budget. <b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> information on the diving energetics of wing-propelled divers (especially penguins) has emerged in recent years (for a review, see Ellis and Gabrielsen, 2002), measurements of diving costs for foot-propelled divers are scarce.

30|$|The {{countries}} of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have each set targets for renewable energy deployment at the national or local level. To date, however, renewable energy deployment in the GCC has been minimal. Stated targets must, therefore, be supported by defined policies and regulations that reflect regional context, and thus have the highest likelihood of achieving stated ambitions. <b>Although</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> literature does exist {{on the topic of}} renewable energy policy in the GCC [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], it generally does not seek to identify the optimal regional policy framework based on underlying motivations for regional energy system diversification and the most recent trends in global renewable energy policy. Hence, this paper reviews global trends in renewable energy policy and then specifically focuses on the application these trends to the GCC. The GCC context is reviewed with consideration of the rationale for regional renewable energy deployment, regional energy market structures and institutional capacity for renewables. The role that renewable energy is intended to play in defined regional energy strategies is assessed as well as supportive renewable energy targets and policy measures that are already in place. Sectors in the GCC where renewable energy deployment is most relevant are identified and the policies that afford the greatest opportunity for renewables in these sectors are proposed based on regional and global best practices. The findings show that utility-scale renewable energy auctions are a primary mode of stimulating renewable energy deployment internationally and this mechanism is optimally aligned with catalyzing renewable energy deployment in the GCC countries.|$|E

Application of fertiliser to urine patches did not significantly increase either the cumulative yearly N 2 O emissions or the N 2 O emission factor in comparison to urine and fertiliser applied separately with the emissions re-aggregated. However, there was a consistent trend for approximately 20 % underestimation of N 2 O loss generated from fertiliser and urine applied separately when compared to figures generated when urine and fertiliser were applied together. N 2 O emission factors from fertilisers were 0. 02 %, 0. 06 %, 0. 17 % and 0. 25 % from urea ± dicyandiamide (DCD), urea + N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) + DCD, urea + NBPT and urea, respectively, while the emission factor for urine alone was 0. 33 %.

For the purposes of this thesis, cultural heritage represents the intangible aspect of these important things, places and practices. It will be argued that despite the existence of various cultural heritage principles which represent the different types of value, public legacy and associated norms with its subject matter, these principles are not always effectively upheld in the governing legal regime, <b>although</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> principles akin to legal ones has developed, from professional practice, codes of ethics and non-legal decision-making bodies. Recent legal intervention has responded to political imperatives at the risk of a clear and consistent regime to effectively meet the underlying principles of cultural heritage. The most effective means of fulfilling these principles and norms is by treating cultural heritage as an intangible legal concept, akin to property which in its English common law form is really a bundle of rights associated with things tangible or intangible rather than simply ownership and possession or the physical things themselves. In this thesis a system is proposed whereby decision-makers take account of the intangible nature in a holistic manner within a legal framework.
