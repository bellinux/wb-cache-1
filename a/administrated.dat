5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who <b>administrated</b> the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were {{converted}} to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E
