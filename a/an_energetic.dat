5|$|Wollstonecraft later repudiated Mary, {{writing that}} it was laughable. However, {{scholars}} have argued that, despite its faults, the novel's representation of <b>an</b> <b>energetic,</b> unconventional, opinionated, rational, female genius (the {{first of its kind}} in English literature) within a new kind of romance is an important development {{in the history of the}} novel because it helped shape an emerging feminist discourse.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of <b>an</b> <b>energetic</b> response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>energetic</b> {{and ambitious}} ruler, Michael Shishman led an {{aggressive}} but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, {{which ended in}} the disastrous battle of Velbazhd which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political hegemony of the Bulgarian Empire over the Balkans {{and the last one}} who attempted to seize Constantinople. He was succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen and later by his nephew Ivan Alexander, who reversed his policy by forming an alliance with Serbia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, <b>an</b> <b>energetic</b> {{movement}} arose, centered in Greenwich Village, that sought to overturn bans on free speech.Kersch, Kenneth Ira, Freedom of Speech: Rights and Liberties under the Law, ABC-CLIO, 2003, pp. 109–110. Supported by radicals, feminists, anarchists, and atheists such as Ezra Heywood, Moses Harman, D. M. Bennett, and Emma Goldman, these activists regularly battled anti-obscenity laws and, later, the government's effort to suppress speech critical of involvement in World War I. Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, and rarely addressed contraception.|$|E

The direct acceleration regime of laser driven dense electron sheet requires high laser intensity to function efficiently. We demonstrate this requirement can be relaxed by applying chirped lasers. The acceleration becomes more efficient while driven by a pulse with a proper linear chirp, leading to <b>a</b> dense <b>energetic</b> electron sheet in nanoscale, and therefore requires lower laser intensity...|$|R

5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters.

They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, Ordener {{organized}} {{and led the}} controversial kidnapping of the Duke d'Enghien. In 1805, he commanded a regiment of the Imperial Guard cavalry at several important battles, including the Battle of Austerlitz; although he led <b>an</b> <b>energetic</b> and opportune charge, Napoleon noted that Ordener seemed tired and predicted that the general would last only {{five or six years}} more. Ordener participated in one more campaign and then accepted a post in the Senate. Napoleon appointed him as Josephine Bonaparte's equerry, supervising the care and maintenance of her horses. He followed this with the post as governor of the Emperor's household in Compiegne, where Ordener died on 30 August 1811.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{the site}} was {{proposed}} for commercial development, provoking <b>an</b> <b>energetic</b> campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group, formed in March 1982, which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust. The threat to {{the site was}} one of the first to be highlighted by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981. The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983, which determined that the site should be devoted to nature conservation. This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in a city, and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{according}} to Sean Wilentz, favorable views of Hamilton and his reputation have decidedly gained the initiative among scholars, who portray {{him as the}} visionary architect of the modern liberal capitalist economy and of a dynamic federal government headed by <b>an</b> <b>energetic</b> executive. Modern scholars favoring Hamilton have portrayed Jefferson and his allies, in contrast, as naïve, dreamy idealists. The older Jeffersonian view attacked Hamilton as a centralizer, sometimes {{to the point of}} accusations that he advocated monarchy.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{endorsed}} Humphrey at the convention, to {{the dismay}} of some anti-war figures who considered it a betrayal. Humphrey went on to lose the general election to Richard Nixon. McGovern returned to his Senate reelection race, facing Republican former Governor Archie M. Gubbrud. While South Dakota voters sympathized with McGovern over his daughter's arrest, he initially suffered a substantial drop in popularity over the events in Chicago. However, McGovern conducted <b>an</b> <b>energetic</b> campaign that focused on his service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort. In November, McGovern won 57percent of the vote in what he would consider the easiest and most decisive victory of his career.|$|E
