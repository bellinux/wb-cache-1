5|$|The Code of Hammurabi was {{inscribed on}} a stele {{and placed in}} a public place so that <b>all</b> <b>could</b> see it, {{although}} it is thought that few were literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, Susa; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in Iran and is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by scribes on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.|$|E

25|$|According to Frederick Fleays, lines 3-4 are {{possible}} references to plagues {{that occurred in}} 1592–1593, and the dearths that followed in 1594–1596.

25|$|Two hundred {{prisoners were}} sent, loaded with chains, to the Bardo palace, despite having bring promised amnesty.

For ten days the tribal sheikhs, their wrists and ankles bound and their faces to the ground, were savagely beaten, receiving up to 2,000 blows.

25|$|According to Exodus, Shabbat (Sabbath) was reinstituted {{the first}} week manna appeared. It states that twice as much manna as usual was {{available}} on the sixth morning of the week, and none at <b>all</b> <b>could</b> {{be found on the}} seventh day; although manna usually rotted and became maggot-infested after a single night, that which had been collected on the sixth day remained fresh until the second night. Moses stated that the double portion of Preparation Day was to be consumed on Shabbat; and that God instructed him that no one should leave his place on Shabbat, so that the people could rest during it.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a slight}} romantic aspect to the story, which is {{sometimes}} played down or omitted completely. Wendy's flirtatious desire to kiss Peter, his desire for a mother figure, his conflicting feelings for Wendy, Tiger Lily, and Tinker Bell (each representing different female archetypes), and the symbolism of his fight with Captain Hook (traditionally played by the same actor as Wendy's father), <b>all</b> <b>could</b> possibly hint at a Freudian interpretation (see oedipus complex). Most children's adaptations of the play, including the 1953 Disney film, omit any romantic themes between Wendy and Peter, but Barrie's 1904 original, his 1911 novelisation, the 1954 Mary Martin musical, the 1924 and 2003 feature films, all hint at the romantic elements.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{think it}} was shortly after the {{discovery}} of wine itself, the alcoholic product of fermented grape juice, that cultures realized its value as a trade commodity. Although wild grapes of the Vitis genus could be found throughout the known world and <b>all</b> <b>could</b> be fermented, it took some degree of knowledge and skill to turn these grapes into palatable wine. This knowledge was passed along the trading routes {{that emerged from the}} Caucasus and Zagros Mountains down through Mesopotamia and to the Mediterranean, eventually reaching Phoenicia. Specific varieties of grapevines of the V. vinifera species were identified as especially favorable for winemaking, cuttings of which were spread via these trade routes.|$|E

25|$|When W.A. Riedmann of Geestemünde {{entered the}} {{petroleum}} trade in 1877, {{he noted the}} difficulties of using barrels, and began to experiment with the former emigrant ships Adona and Derby, filling their large iron drinking water tanks with oil. In October 1879 he purchased the Andromeda at Liverpool, an 1876-ton full-rigged composite ship built in 1864, brought it to Teklenborgs Werft, and added seventy iron tanks to the hold. The piping between the tanks was connected so that <b>all</b> <b>could</b> be filled from a single tank. The composite hull, with structural members of iron covered with wooden planking, was especially suitable for the addition of tanks, because they could be firmly fastened to the iron beams. Andromeda made seven trips from Germany to North America as a sailing oil tanker.|$|E
25|$|According to the APSAC Task Force, {{there are}} controversies within the {{attachment}} therapy community about coercive practices. There {{has been a}} move away from coercive and confrontational models towards attunement and emotional regulation amongst some leaders in the field, notably Hughes, Kelly and Popper. A number of therapies are quite different from those {{that have led to}} the abuse and deaths of children in much publicized court cases. The Task Force, however, points out that all the therapies, including those using frankly coercive practices, present themselves as humane, respectful and nurturing, therefore caution is advised. Some practitioners condemn the most dangerous techniques but continue to practice other coercive techniques. Others have taken a public stand against coercion. The Task Force was of the view that <b>all</b> <b>could</b> benefit from more transparency and specificity as to how the therapy is behaviorally delivered.|$|E
25|$|On 22 January 1808, {{the ship}} {{of the prince}} regent and two others arrived in Baía de Todos os Santos, Brazil. The streets of Salvador were deserted, because the governor, the Count of Ponte, {{preferred}} to await the prince's orders before permitting the people to receive him. Finding this attitude odd, John ordered that <b>all</b> <b>could</b> come as they wished. However, to allow the nobility to compose themselves after such an arduous journey, the landing was postponed until the next day, when they were received joyfully amidst a procession, the ringing of bells and a celebration of a Te Deum at the Cathedral of Salvador. In the following days, the prince received all who wished to give homage, granting the ceremony of the beija-mão (the kissing of the monarch's hand) and conceding various mercies. Among the latter, he decreed {{the creation of a}} public lecture series on economics and a school of surgery, but his most decisive action at this moment was the Decree of Opening the Ports to Friendly Nations (Decreto de Abertura dos Portos às Nações Amigas), a measure of vast political and economic importance and the first of many that went to improve conditions in the colony. Britain, however, whose economy depended in great part on maritime commerce, and for whom the Portuguese and Brazilian monarchy was now something of a protectorate, was the most direct beneficiary.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} {{about the fate of}} the Polish prisoners was raised soon after Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941. The Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet government signed the Sikorski–Mayski agreement, which announced the willingness of both to fight together against Nazi Germany and for a Polish army to be formed on Soviet territory. The Polish general Władysław Anders began organizing this army, and soon he requested information about the missing Polish officers. During a personal meeting, Stalin assured him and Władysław Sikorski, the Polish Prime Minister, that all the Poles were freed, and that not <b>all</b> <b>could</b> be accounted because the Soviets [...] "lost track" [...] of them in Manchuria. Józef Czapski investigated the fate of Polish officers between 1941 and 1942.|$|E
