5|$|Generally, {{during her}} reign, Anne {{and her husband}} spent the winter at Kensington and St James's Palaces, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> at Windsor Castle or Hampton Court Palace, where the air was fresher. George had {{recurrent}} asthma, and the cleaner air in the country was better for his breathing. They visited the spa town of Bath, Somerset, in mid-1702, {{on the advice of}} George's doctors, and again in mid-1703. They occasionally visited Newmarket, Suffolk, to view the horse racing. On one visit, Anne bought George a horse, Leeds, for the vast sum of a thousand guineas.|$|E

5|$|Hitler's {{government}} sponsored architecture on {{an immense}} scale. Albert Speer, instrumental in implementing Hitler's classicist reinterpretation of German culture, {{was placed in}} charge of the proposed architectural renovations of Berlin. Despite a threatened multi-nation boycott, Germany hosted the 1936 Olympic Games. Hitler officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> Games in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} Scotland's west coast are known collectively as the Hebrides; the Inner Hebrides are {{separated}} from the Outer Hebrides by The Minch {{to the north and}} the Sea of the Hebrides to the south. The Inner Hebrides that lie respectively north and south of Ardnamurchan are administered by two separate local authorities as part of larger territories. The northern Inner Hebrides, including Skye, the Small Isles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> Isles, are part of the Highland unitary council region. The southern group, including Islay, Jura, the Slate Islands and Gigha are part of the Argyll and Bute council region.|$|E

25|$|In general, Egypt is a {{very dry}} country. The Western Desert {{receives}} only occasional rainfall, the winters being mild <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summers</b> very hot. <b>The</b> Eastern Desert receives some precipitation {{in the south in}} the form of orographic rainfall from winds that have crossed the Red Sea; this may cause torrential flows in the wadis. The winters here are mild <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summers</b> hot, <b>and</b> Gebel Elba is cooler and wetter than other parts. The northern areas of the country, particularly close to the coast, receive some precipitation from Mediterranean weather systems.|$|R

5|$|However, no {{progress}} was made with the airfield for over a decade. Instead, the water aerodrome at Bukta was upgraded. Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat, {{but after a few}} years a floating dock was built. Services were only provided during five summer months, from May through September. During the rest of the year, Alta had no airline service; travel time to Oslo was then six days, largely by ship. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to serve a route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø. In Tromsø, the routes connected with a Norwegian Air Lines' seaplane service to Oslo. Bukta had 2,000 annual passengers in 1957, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> route was flown daily beginning in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E
5|$|In {{partnership}} with the goddess Brìghde, the Cailleach {{is seen as a}} seasonal deity or spirit, ruling the winter months between Samhainn (1 November or first day of winter) and Bealltainn (1 May or first day of summer), while Brìghde rules the summer months between Bealltainn and Samhainn. Some interpretations have the Cailleach and Brìghde as two faces of the same goddess, while others describe the Cailleach as turning to stone on Bealltainn and reverting to humanoid form on Samhainn in time to rule over the winter months. Depending on local climate, the transfer of power between the winter goddess <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> goddess is celebrated any time between Là Fhèill Brìghde (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at the latest, and the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Brìghde.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low flow conditions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E
5|$|Posen {{participated in}} several {{training}} exercises {{with the rest}} of the fleet before the outbreak of war. In late 1910 the fleet conducted a training cruise into the Baltic Sea. The following year the fleet conducted maneuvers in May; the annual summer cruise to Norway followed in July. The fleet participated in another round of fleet exercises in the Baltic in September, followed by another set at the end of the year. The next year followed a similar pattern, though the summer cruise to Norway was interrupted by the Agadir crisis; as a result, the summer cruise only went into the Baltic. The September exercises were conducted off Helgoland in the North Sea; another winter cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. The training schedule returned to normal for 1913 and 1914, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> cruises again went to Norway. For the 1914 cruise, the fleet departed for Norwegian waters on 14 July, some two weeks after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. The probability of war cut the cruise short; Posen and the rest of the fleet were back in Wilhelmshaven by 29 July.|$|E
5|$|Since 2001, Hamar Olympic Amphitreatre {{has hosted}} the annual Idrettsgallaen, a {{television}} show that honors the past year's Norwegian sports and athlete achievements. Hamar was selected to host the event because its main sponsor, the national lottery company Norsk Tipping, has its head office in Hamar. Idrettsgallaen is held in early January, when many of winter sports athletes are home <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> athletes are off season. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen was hosted in Lillehammer because the weekend crashed with the 2010 European Speed Skating Championships in Vikingskipet and Hamar lacks sufficient hotel capacity to host both simultaneously. Concerts hosted at the arena since the opening concert with Fats Domino on 25 November 1992 include Little Richard in 1993, Vamp in 2005, Willie Nelson in 2008 and José Carreras in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The four Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP World Tour Finals, nine ATP Masters 1000s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summer</b> Olympics, {{make up the}} 15 {{most coveted}} {{top-level}} tournaments in men's tennis. Although no player has won each of these 15 events in men's singles, this feat has been achieved in men's doubles by Canada's Daniel Nestor and the United States' Bryan Brothers, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan. Djokovic matches the result in men's singles of Andre Agassi, who ended his career having won 13 of these 15 events, achieving a Career Grand Slam (winning all four majors in a career), a Career Golden Slam (winning all four majors and the Olympic singles gold medal in a career), and what Sports Illustrated called a Career Super Slam (winning all four majors, the Olympic singles gold medal, and the ATP World Tour Finals).|$|E
5|$|Three Olympiads had to {{pass without}} {{a celebration of the}} Games because of war: the 1916 Games were {{cancelled}} because of World War I, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The Russo-Georgian War between Georgia and Russia erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both President Bush and Prime Minister Putin were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese president Hu Jintao. When Nino Salukvadze of Georgia won the bronze medal in the 10metre air pistol competition, she stood on the medal podium with Natalia Paderina, a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicised event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.|$|E
