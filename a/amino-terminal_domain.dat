Understanding the role of these domains relies on the development of an understanding of their metal-binding properties and structural properties. The second conserved sub-domain of MNK was over-expressed, purified and its copper-binding properties characterised. Reconstitution studies demonstrate that copper binds to MNKr 2 as Cu(I) with a stoichiometry of one copper per domain. This is the first direct evidence of copper-binding to the MNK amino-terminal repeats.

This interaction {{is essential for}} polyomavirus-mediated transformation of cells in culture and tumor formation in animals. To determine the domain of c-Src directing association with middle-T, mutant c-Src proteins lacking the <b>amino-terminal</b> unique <b>domain</b> and the myristylation signal, the SH 2 domain, the SH 3 domain, or {{all three of these}} domains were coexpressed with middle-T in NIH 3 T 3 cells. All mutants were found to associate with middle-T, demonstrating that the kinase domain of c-Src, including the carboxy-terminal regulatory tail, is sufficient for association with middle-T. Moreover, we found that Hck, another member of the Src kinase family, does not bind middle-T, while chimeric kinases consisting of the <b>amino-terminal</b> <b>domains</b> of c-Src fused to the kinase domain of Hck or the <b>amino-terminal</b> <b>domains</b> of Hck fused to the kinase domain of c-Src associated with middle-T. Hck mutated at its carboxy-terminal regulatory residue, tyrosine 501, was also found to associate with middle-T. These results suggest that in Hck, the postulated intramolecular interaction between the carboxy-terminal regulatory tyrosine and the SH 2 domain prevents association with middle-T. This intramolecular interaction apparently also limits the ability of c-Src to associate with middle-T, since removal of the SH 2 or SH 3 domain increases the efficiency with which middle-T binds c-Src...|$|R

EBV recombinants with specific deletions in the <b>amino-terminal</b> cytoplasmic <b>domain</b> have now been constructed and {{tested for the ability}} to growth transform primary B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines. Surprisingly, deletion of DNA encoding EHDLER or GPPLSSS from the full LMP 1 <b>amino-terminal</b> cytoplasmic <b>domain</b> (MEHDLERGPPGPRRPPRGPPLSSS) had no discernible effect on primary B-lymphocyte transformation. These two motifs distinguish the LMP 1 <b>amino-terminal</b> cytoplasmic <b>domain</b> from other arginine-rich membrane proximal sequences that anchor hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Two deletions which included the ERGPPGPRRPPR motif adversely affected but did not prevent transformation. This arginine- and proline-rich sequence is probably important in anchoring the first transmembrane domain in the plasma membrane, since these mutated LMP 1 s had altered stability and cell membrane localization.

[...] Shown by x-ray crystallography, glycogen branching enzyme has four marginally asymmetric units each that are organized into three domains: an <b>amino-terminal</b> <b>domain,</b> involved in determining {{the length of the}} chain transfer, a carboxyl-terminal domain, involved in substrate preference and catalytic capacity, and a central (α/β) barrel catalytic domain. The <b>amino-terminal</b> <b>domain</b> consists of 128 residues arranged in seven β-strands, the carboxyl-terminal domain with 116 residues also organized in seven β-strands, and the (α/β) barrel domain with 372 residues.

Additionally, there are striking differences between the loops connecting elements of the secondary structure among these various α-amylase members, especially around the active site. In comparison to the other family members, glycogen binding enzyme has shorter loops, which result in a more open cavity, favorable to the binding of a bulkier substrate such as branched sugar.

Clathrin aids in the congression of chromosomes by stabilizing kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle. The <b>amino-terminal</b> <b>domain</b> of the clathrin heavy chain and the TACC domain of TACC3 make the microtubule binding surface for TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin to bind to the mitotic spindle.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The rsk 1 gene encodes the 90 kDa ribosomal S 6 kinase 1 (RSK 1) protein, which {{contains}} two kinase domains. RSK 1, which {{is involved in}} regulating cell survival and proliferation, lies {{at the end of}} the signaling cascade mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. ERK activation and subsequent phosphorylation of the RSK 1 carboxy-terminal catalytic loop stimulates phosphotransferase activity in the RSK 1 <b>amino-terminal</b> kinase <b>domain.</b> When activated, RSK 1 phosphorylates both nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates through this <b>amino-terminal</b> catalytic <b>domain.</b> It is thought that stimulation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway is sufficient for RSK 1 activation, but how ERK phosphorylation activates the RSK 1 <b>amino-terminal</b> kinase <b>domain</b> is not known. Results: The individual isolated RSK 1 kinase domains were found to be under regulatory control. In vitro kinase assays established that ERK phosphorylates RSK 1 within the carboxy-terminal kinase domain, and the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK 1) phosphorylates RSK 1 within the <b>amino-terminal</b> kinase <b>domain.</b> In transiently transfected HEK 293 E cells, PDK 1 alone stimulated phosphotransferase activity of an isolated RSK 1 <b>amino-terminal</b> kinase <b>domain.</b> Nevertheless, activation of full-length RSK 1 in the absence of serum required activation by both PDK 1 and ERK. Conclusions: RSK 1 is phosphorylated by PDK 1 in the amino-terminal kinase-activation loop, and by ERK in the carboxy-terminal kinase-activation loop. Activation of phosphotransferase activity of full-length RSK 1 in vivo requires both PDK 1 and ERK. RSK 1 activation is therefore regulated by both the mitogen-stimulated ERK/MAP kinase pathway and a PDK 1 -dependent pathway...|$|R

The DNA-dependent interaction between the <b>amino-terminal</b> DNA-binding <b>domain</b> and the catalytic domain of PARP 1 increased V(max) and decreased the K(m) for NAD. Furthermore, we show that glutamic acid residues in the auto-modification domain of PARP 1 are not required for PAR formation.

Three alternative lin- 14 transcripts are predicted to encode isoforms of a novel nuclear protein that differ in their <b>amino-terminal</b> <b>domains.</b> In this paper, we report that the alternative <b>amino-terminal</b> <b>domains</b> of LIN- 14 are dispensable and that a carboxy-terminal region within exons 9 to 13 is necessary and sufficient for in vivo LIN- 14 function. A transgene capable of expressing {{only one of the}} three alternative lin- 14 gene products rescues a lin- 14 null mutation and is developmentally regulated by lin- 4. This shows that the deployment of alternative lin- 14 gene products is not critical for the ability of LIN- 14 to regulate downstream genes in diverse cell types or for the in vivo regulation of LIN- 14 level by lin- 4. The carboxy-terminal region of LIN- 14 contains an unusual expanded nuclear localization domain which is essential for LIN- 14 function. These results support the view that LIN- 14 controls developmental timing in C. elegans by regulating gene expression in the nucleus.

50|$|IκB kinase {{activity}} {{is essential for}} activation {{of members of the}} nuclear factor-kB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors, which play a fundamental role in lymphocyte immunoregulation. Activation of the canonical, or classical, NF-κB pathway begins in response to stimulation by various pro-inflammatory stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed on the surface of pathogens, or the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-1 (IL-1). Following immune cell stimulation, a signal transduction cascade leads to the activation of the IKK complex, an event characterized by the binding of NEMO to the homologous kinase subunits IKK-α and IKK-β. The IKK complex phosphorylates serine residues (S32 and S36) within the <b>amino-terminal</b> <b>domain</b> of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) upon activation, consequently leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Degradation of IκBα releases the prototypical p50-p65 dimer for translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to κB sites and directs NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity. NF-κB target genes can be differentiated by their different functional roles within lymphocyte immunoregulation and include positive cell-cycle regulators, anti-apoptotic and survival factors, and pro-inflammatory genes. Collectively, activation of these immunoregulatory factors promotes lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation, growth, and survival.|$|E
50|$|GCDH is a tetramer with {{tetrahedral}} symmetry, {{which allows}} it {{to be seen as}} a dimer of dimers.

The flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is located at the junction between the middle beta-strand and the carboxyl terminal alpha-helix domain of one subunit and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the neighboring subunit. The most distinct difference between GCDH and other ACDs in terms of structure is the carboxyl and amino-terminal regions of the monomer and in the loop between beta-strands 4 and 5 because it is only made up of four residues, whereas other ACDs have much more. The substrate-binding pocket is filled with a string of three water molecules, which gets displaced when the substrate binds to the enzyme. The binding pocket is also smaller than some of the other ACD binding pockets because it is responsible for the chain-length specificity of GCDH for alternate substrates.
