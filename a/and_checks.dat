Lynette tries {{to organize a}} last-minute party, but mistakenly has the wrong name written on her cake. Penny runs away <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> into a hotel room, where Lynette tracks her and apologizes. Penny said she is jealous of her unborn sister, but Lynette jokes the women will outnumber {{the men in the}} family when the baby is born.|$|E

Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge that he got rid of the gun.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} and investigation on {{a large number of}} striped <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> patterns in silk fabric of the Republic of China (1912 - 1949) and some relevant historical records, this paper mainly reviews the types of striped <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> patterns in silk fabric of the Republic of China. It also discusses the use of weave design in striped <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> patterns, <b>and</b> points out that striped <b>and</b> <b>checked</b> patterns turned {{to be one of the}} most popular patterns in silk fabric during this period, only ranking second to floral pattern. The influence of western design, changes in fashion and technological innovations are main reasons for this transition...|$|R

5|$|Topological sorting is the {{algorithmic}} {{problem of}} finding a topological ordering of a given DAG. It can be solved in linear time. Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex ordering directly. It maintains a list of vertices that have no incoming edges from other vertices that have not already {{been included in the}} partially constructed topological ordering; initially this list consists of the vertices with no incoming edges at all. Then, it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list {{to the end of the}} partially constructed topological ordering, <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> whether its neighbors should be added to the list. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been processed in this way. Alternatively, a topological ordering may be constructed by reversing a postorder numbering of a depth-first search graph traversal.|$|E
5|$|When Kosseff asks Charlie {{about the}} incident, {{he insists that}} he was not in his grandmother's room, and that it was a boy named Michael. Maggie is terrified at the claim, {{explaining}} to the agents that Michael was Charlie’s stillborn twin, about whom she and Steve agreed to never tell Charlie. Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the spirits of the twins, but Steve refused. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie, by pretending to be Charlie, to take him home. Scully sees them leaving, <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> on Charlie. They find the nurse and Charlie still in the hospital room. Mulder, now convinced that Michael's spirit is behind the killings, sends Scully to the Holvey residence to stop him.|$|E
5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew which one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After disassembly <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth and}} final entry in the Uncharted series, , was showcased at E3 2014, during Sony's press conference. A trailer {{features}} a wounded Drake washing ashore an island. He rises, grabs his gun, <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> its ammo before walking into a jungle-like area, as the camera pans to show hanging cages with skeletons inside. The trailer also features a conversation between Drake and Sully, where Drake asks for Sully's help, having seemingly just laid out a plan. Sully warns Nate against it, but Nate responds {{that he has no}} choice, and asks if he can count on Sully one last time, who confirms that he can. A Thief's End takes place three years after the events of Drake's Deception. Drake has retired from fortune hunting, and is seemingly still married to Elena, as he still wears his ring in the trailer, but is dragged back into the profession by his thought dead older brother, Sam Drake (voiced by Troy Baker), after the latter discovers a lead to the semi-mythical anarchist colony of Libertalia and with it, the possible location of the treasure stolen by the legendary pirate captain Henry Avery.|$|E

25|$|The {{roll test}} can {{determine}} whether the horizontal semicircular canal is involved. The roll test requires the patient {{to be in a}} supine position with their head in 30° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> for vertigo and nystagmus. This is followed by gently bringing the head back to the starting position. The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side, <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> again for vertigo and nystagmus. In this roll test, the patient may experience vertigo and nystagmus on both sides, but rotating towards the affected side will trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated towards the affected side, the nystagmus will beat towards the ground and be more intense.|$|E

If this defense is used, the black king should be on the second rank. The {{principle}} is the same: Black keeps his rook on the fourth rank, keeping the white king from advancing to that rank.

25|$|Traditional {{business}} suits are generally in solid colours or with pin stripes; windowpane checks are also acceptable. Outside business, {{the range of}} acceptable patterns widens, with plaids such as the traditional glen plaid and herringbone, though apart from some very traditional environments such as London banking, these are worn for business now too. The colour of the patterned element (stripes, plaids, <b>and</b> <b>checks)</b> varies by gender and location. For example, bold checks, particularly with tweeds, have fallen out of use in the US, while {{they continue to be}} worn as traditionally in Britain. Some unusual old patterns such as diamonds are now rare everywhere.|$|E

He also tells her about his inner Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia wishes him luck and leaves the room, Riggan picks up a real gun <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> that it is loaded for the final scene in which his character commits suicide.

The Census Bureau in 2012 reported that the United States received rough diamond imports from approximately 24 KP participants including Liberia, Mexico, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Israel, and Japan.
