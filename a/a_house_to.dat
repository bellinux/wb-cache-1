5|$|Meeker's first {{employment}} in the Pacific Northwest was unloading a ship that had docked at Portland. He moved to {{the nearby town of}} St. Helens, where construction of a wharf in competition with Portland's was under way—Oliver rented <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> lodge workers in, and Ezra went to help his brother. By this time, Ezra Meeker and his wife were determined to fulfill their original plan to farm, and when work was abandoned on the wharf, he went to find land which could be cultivated.|$|E
5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> {{the sounds}} of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a party for the 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E

5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

25|$|The {{range of}} auctions {{that take place}} is {{extremely}} wide and one can buy almost anything, from <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> an endowment policy and everything in-between.

25|$|In Armenia, {{celebrations}} at the Presentation {{have been}} influenced by pre-Christian customs, such as: the spreading of ashes by farmers in their fields each year to ensure a better harvest, keeping ashes on the roof of <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> keep evil spirits away, and the belief that newlywed women needed to jump over fire to purify themselves before getting pregnant. Young men will also leap over a bonfire.|$|E
25|$|The memoirs, however, {{extend this}} {{assistance}} to {{all facets of}} Bahá'u'lláh's life. In one edition of the memoir, Dolgorukov {{is said to have}} provided money for Bahá'u'lláh to build a house in Acre, but Dolgorukov died in 1867, before Bahá'u'lláh arrived in Acre. Thus newer editions of the memoir state that Dolgorukov sent money for <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> be built in Edirne. As Dolgorukov left the Russian diplomatic service in 1854 and died in 1867, he was unable to interact with Bahá'u'lláh {{in the manner in which}} the memoir states.|$|E

25|$|These new fashions made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} life of the servant. From the 1760s Palladianism was slowly superseded by Neoclassicism. A defining feature of the Neoclassical house was the absence of the first floor piano nobile. This was in part due to the picturesque values then coming into vogue. During this—the era of Humphrey Repton's idyllic landscapes—it became desirable to step from any of the main rooms directly into the landscape. It was also desirable for all four sides of <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> enjoy this luxury.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, the {{plaintiff}} {{in the first}} action in 1934 was Olive Ida Burke, who brought the suit {{on behalf of a}} property owners' association to enforce racial restrictions. Her husband, James Burke, later sold <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> Carl Hansberry (Lorraine's father) when he changed his mind about the validity of the covenant. Mr. Burke's decision may have been motivated by the changing demographics of the neighborhood, but it was also influenced by the Depression. The demand for houses was so low among white buyers that Mr. Hansberry may have been the only prospective purchaser available.|$|E
25|$|His {{coalition}} partners in government, the Progressive Democrats, {{said that he}} had questions to answer as details of an £8,000 (€11,800) payment for speaking engagements, in Manchester in 1994, emerged. The continued appearance of details of his appearances in Manchester and the names of those who were present at functions threatened to destabilise his Coalition Government, especially so when it transpired that one of the businessmen Micheál Wall subsequently sold <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> Ahern. The strains in the coalition eased after Ahern apologised for a second time in the Dáil and agreed to tighten up on ethics legislation.|$|E

25|$|The last {{significant}} {{buildings in}} the future district came to South Highland {{at the end of}} the decade. On the corner just south of the First Baptist Church, the Cynthard Building was erected in 1930 when the Romanesque Revival doctor's office that had replaced the Union Hotel in 1890, and <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> the south, were themselves demolished. The Cynthard was a single-story commercial block faced in terra cotta topped by a polychrome parapet. Also that year, the third and last bank building downtown was built at 13 Croton Avenue, the corner with North Highland. The First National Bank, which had occupied the spot since 1880, moved into the district's only Art Deco building. It has an unusual neoclassical door surround.|$|E
25|$|Described as “a strange person full of acerbity against {{everything}} and every one”, Pigasov frequently visits Dar’ya Mikhailovna prior to Rudin’s appearance and amuses {{her with his}} bitter remarks, mostly aimed at women. Coming from a poor family, he educated himself, but never rose above the level of mediocrity. He failed his examination in public disputation, in government service {{he made a mistake}} which forced him to retire. His wife later left him and sold her estate, on which he just finished building <b>a</b> <b>house,</b> <b>to</b> a speculator. Since then he lived in the province. He is the first victim of Rudin’s eloquence, as at Rudin’s first appearance he challenged him to a debate and was defeated easily. He ends up living with Lezhnev and Aleksandra Pavlovna.|$|E
25|$|A crew {{of workers}} was hired and {{construction}} on Snively's road {{began in the}} late fall of 1899 and continued into the following summer. During the road's construction phase, Snively was also building <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> serve as a centerpiece to his hilltop farm. By the Spring of 1900 the road reached about a mile up from its starting point just north of Lester Park. Snively built the road {{in a way that it}} crossed the Amity creek in nearly a dozen places, creating the need for the construction of many rustic wooden bridges. Upon its completion, Snively presented his new road to the city of Duluth as a designated parkway, and turned his attention to his farm and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|The station serving Thorverton village {{opened with}} the railway in 1885. Two {{platforms}} were provided {{as it was}} a passing place. The main buildings and goods yard were on the southbound side, while a wooden shelter was provided on the opposite platform for passengers travelling towards Tiverton. The station master had <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> the north of the station. The village was not on a main road and had no bus service with the result that the station was one of the best-used on the line and also generated a lot of freight due to nearby Thorverton Mill, a watermill that was connected to the station by a siding. Camp coaches were based here from 1936 to 1939 which provided accommodation for holiday visitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} first appears with Wanda, {{now called}} the Scarlet Witch, {{as a part of}} the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

After several confrontations with the X-Men, they depart when Magneto and his lackey the Toad are abducted by the cosmic entity the Stranger. They then travel back to Europe. Pietro and his sister reform and are recruited by Iron Man to the superhero team the Avengers, after they discover they are advertising for new members and want to get support for themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{phrase is}} said to have {{originated}} one day when Coggeshall's town clock chimed 11 times at noon. When the villagers heard that the town clock at Lexden had struck 12 times at 11 o'clock, they rode to the town to collect the missing stroke. Other jobs included winching up a cow onto the church roof to eat the grass growing there, knocking down one of two windmills as there would not be enough wind for both of them, attempting to divert the course of the river with hurdles, hanging sheets over roads to prevent the wind from blowing disease into the town, chopping the head off a lamb to free it from a gate, removing stairs from <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>to</b> stop flood water entering and some appropriated from other 'fool centres', for example the classic 'fishing for the moon'.|$|E
