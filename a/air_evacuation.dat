5|$|The Sea King {{participated in}} the UN's {{intervention}} in Bosnia. 845 Naval Air Squadron and their Sea Kings had been dispatched to the region in late 1992 in response to escalating tensions in the region. They performed various logistical and transport missions, such as the repositioning of Royal Artillery L118 Light Guns {{in the region and}} in the evacuation of casualties. In one incident on 24 March 1993, during an attempt to establish an <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> route to a UN-declared safe zone, a flight of French Aérospatiale Pumas and Sea King HC4 helicopters were shelled while taking off from an improvised landing zone. Two further Sea Kings arrived to evacuate several UN casualties, managing to fly the wounded to the Bosnian city of Tuzla, where they came under further enemy fire while unloading.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{government}} {{responded by}} deploying ships and planes to Yemen to evacuate stranded Indians. India began evacuating its citizens on 2 April by sea. An <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> of Indian nationals from Sana'a to Djibouti started on 3 April, after the Indian government obtained permission to land two Airbus A320s at the airport. The Indian Armed Forces carried out rescue operation codenamed Operation Raahat and evacuated more than 4640 overseas Indians in Yemen along with 960 foreign nationals of 41 countries. The <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> ended on 9 April 2015 while the evacuation by sea ended on 11 April 2015. The United States has {{assets in the}} region, but through its Yemen diplomatic mission website, instructed its citizens to evacuate using Indian assistance.|$|E

25|$|A hasty last-minute <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> from Long Tieng on 14 and 15 May 1975 moved 2,500 Hmong to Thailand. However, the {{overwhelming}} majority of the Hmong were left on foot to find their way as best they could. Many of them walked south to Thailand for refuge. By the end of 1975, there were 54,000 Hmong refugees known to be in Thai refugee camps; an equal number were believed to have found shelter with relatives in northern Thailand.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} a staff tour in Europe, Jackson volunteered {{to go to}} Vietnam. He {{was assigned to the}} 311th Air Commando Squadron as a commander flying the C-123 Provider over South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The unit flew flare, communications cover, <b>air</b> <b>evacuation,</b> and search and rescue missions for downed aircraft. While he flew 298 combat missions during this period, it was his daring C-123 rescue mission on May 12, 1968 during the Battle of Kham Duc near Laos that earned him the nation's highest personal award for military valor. The other four crew members of Jackson's plane also received decorations.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} Emergency Medical Service (EMS) innovations, {{treating}} patients in flight {{originated in the}} military. The concept of using aircraft as ambulances is almost as old as powered flight itself. Although balloons {{were not used to}} evacuate wounded soldiers at the Siege of Paris in 1870, <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> was experimented with during the First World War. The first true Air Ambulance flight was made when a Serbian officer was flown from the battlefield to hospital by a plane of the French Air Service. French records at the time indicated that the mortality rate of the injured was reduced from 60% to just under 10% if they were evacuated by air.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Brooks was {{transformed}} from a flying training center to a center for modern medical {{research and development and}} education. The transition started in the summer of 1959 when the School of Aviation Medicine returned to Brooks from Randolph AFB. Brooks became the headquarters for the School of Aerospace Medicine (SAM). In 1957, SAM scientists moved into the newly completed center at Brooks AFB. SAM aided the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with Project Mercury and served as a back-up site for lunar samples brought back to Earth on the Apollo missions between 1969–1972. The <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> program at Brooks AFB proved vital to the care of wounded personnel in the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{delivery}} of its B-24s, No. 102 Squadron began an intensive training program; however, the war ended before this was completed. The unit began practising formation flying in early August, and on the 16th of the month nine of its B-24s flew in formation over Brisbane to mark Victory in the Pacific Day. From September to the late December 1945, No. 102 Squadron aircraft operated out of RAAF Station Amberley, from where they flew supplies to Australian forces in Morotai, Finschhafen in New Guinea and Bougainville and returned with demobilised personnel. Two officers from the squadron were also assigned to No. 82 Wing's headquarters on Morotai from September to assist with planning <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> flights.|$|E

25|$|With {{the three}} American planes, the {{evacuation}} {{began in earnest}} on 13 May with each transport aircraft making four flights each that day from Long Tieng to Udorn, Thailand and transporting more than 65 people per airplane on each trip– {{far more than the}} 35 maximum passengers dictated by safety conditions at mountain-ringed Long Tieng. Thousands of Hmong clustered around the airstrip at Long Tieng awaiting evacuation and the situation became increasingly ugly. On 14 May, Vang Pao and Jerry Daniels were evacuated secretly by helicopter to Thailand and the <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> came to an end. The next day the Pathet Lao marched into Long Tieng unopposed. Daniels accompanied Vang Pao to exile in Montana and then returned to Thailand to help the Hmong refugees there.|$|E
25|$|As the {{survivors}} {{attempt to escape}} Gunnison, they make radio contact with Colonel Stevens and are told that an <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> is being staged {{at the center of}} town. Kelly does not believe him and convinces a small group {{to go to the hospital}} where they hope to escape by helicopter, while Sheriff Morales and Darcy head to the evacuation zone. However, the hospital has been invaded and overrun by the Aliens and the Predalien, who has impregnated some pregnant women to breed more Aliens. Wolf soon arrives and in the ensuing battle, Jesse is killed, Ricky is injured by the Predalien, and Dallas takes possession of Wolf's blaster cannon after the Predator is attacked by an Alien and both tumble down an elevator shaft.|$|E
25|$|The {{group was}} {{reactivated}} in Japan at Brady Air Base on 10 June 1952 after being redesignated as the 315th Troop Carrier Group, Medium. It {{was assigned to}} the Far East Forces, for duty during the Korean War. The group took over the Curtiss C-46 Commando transports of the 437th Troop Carrier Group, a reserve unit that had been called up for the war and was being inactivated. The group flew troop and cargo airlift and airdrop, leaflet drops, spray missions, <b>air</b> <b>evacuation,</b> search and rescue, and other aerial missions between Japan and Korea. During US Army exercises in Japan between 1952 and 1953, it transported units. In March 1953, all C-119s in the theater were grounded as a result of malfunctioning propellers and the group's C-46s were made responsible for moving all personnel between southern Japan and Korea up {{to the end of the}} war. The group airlifted the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team along with other XVI Corps units to Korea in June and July 1953. For its actions, the group received the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. It remained in the Far East after the war to fly transport missions and paratroop training flights. The group flew missions in Japan, Korea, French Indo-China, and other points until December 1954. The group was inactivated in Japan on 18 January 1955.|$|E

After three days deliberation, Tito agreed on 3 June and Street arranged the evacuation the same night from an RAF-operated airfield near the town of Kupres. Seven Douglas C-47 Skytrain aircraft, one with a Soviet crew and the remainder with US crew, carried Tito and his party, the Allied missions and 118 wounded Partisans to Bari in Italy. Late on 6 June, Tito was delivered by the Royal Navy escort destroyer [...] to Vis, where he re-established his headquarters and was joined by the Allied missions. The Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, believed that the British had known more about the attack than they claimed, based on the absence of both Maclean and Churchill from Drvar {{at the time of the}} attack. On 28 May, he sent a message to Korneev detailing his suspicions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first group}} of 24 Naval Flight Nurses {{graduated}} from the Navy Flight Nurse School at the Naval Air Station Alameda, California on 22 January 1945. In addition to flight nurse procedures, they were trained to swim one mile, tow or push a victim for 220 yards, and swim 440 yards in 10 minutes. The newly minted flight nurses soon began active flying service on 24 flying teams, consisting of a nurse and a pharmacist's mate. Each 12-plane squadron operated with the following medical personnel: 24 flight nurses, 24 pharmacists' mates, one flight surgeon, and one Hospital Corps officer. After {{a certain number of}} transcontinental trips with wounded servicemen, the teams were sent to the Pacific to serve in the Naval <b>Air</b> <b>Evacuation</b> Service, the first arriving in Guam in early February 1945. There were three main flights of <b>air</b> <b>evacuation</b> planes to which flight nurses were assigned. [...] First, from target areas to forward hospitals, such as Guam: second, from those forward hospitals to Pearl Harbor; and third, from Pearl Harbor to the contiguous United States. Nurses were rotated so that flight hours did not exceed 100 per month and they were also rotated between combat and noncombat flights.|$|E
