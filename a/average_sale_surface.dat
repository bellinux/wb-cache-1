40|$|Artículo de publicación ISISales {{forecasting}} {{consists of}} calculating the expected sales {{of a specific}} product or company. An important issue when dealing with sales forecasting is the calculation of the <b>average</b> <b>sales,</b> usually using the arithmetic mean or the weighted average. This study introduces new methods for calculating the <b>average</b> <b>sales.</b> These methods are two modern aggregation operators: the ordered weighted average, and the unified aggregation operator. The main advantage {{of this approach is}} the possibility to deal with uncertain and complex environments in a more complete way. The study develops some key examples through multi-person and multi-criteria techniques. The study also presents a numerical example regarding the calculation of the <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> of a product in a set of countries.

The estimated hedonic price index for house sales on the secondary market is practically always below the index based on <b>average</b> <b>sales</b> values for the period considered. This demonstrates the need to collect more extensive data on the characteristics of the dwellings sold in Belgium. ...|$|R
