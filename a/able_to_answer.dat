When the boats, loaded with the first wave lof British troops, were {{challenge}}d, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.|$|E

The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them {{of the existence of}} the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 Gator Bowl {{was played}} on January 2, 2006 at 12:30p.m. EST in Jacksonville, Florida. Louisville led {{for much of}} the game, {{beginning}} with an 11-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter by quarterback Hunter Cantwell. Tech was only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> with a field goal while Louisville was able to add another touchdown {{before the end of the}} quarter. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech fought back and narrowed Louisville's lead to a single touchdown. At halftime, the score was 17–10 in Louisville's favor.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans {{began the}} season by {{traveling}} to Hawaii {{to face the}} Warriors led by sixth–year head coach June Jones and quarterback Colt Brennan, Leinart's backup in high school. The Trojans opened the scoring on a 65-yard interception return by Darnell Bing. The Warriors answered with a field goal, however the Trojans scored 14points {{in the second quarter}} to take a 21–3 lead into half-time. After Leinart threw his second touchdown of the game to start the second half, Brennan was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> with his own touchdown pass to keep the deficit to 18, however, {{before the end of the}} quarter Leinart threw his third touchdown, Bush rushed for his second touchdown, and the Trojan defense returned a fumble for the fourth Trojan touchdown of the quarter. In the fourth quarter, most of the Trojan starters were out of the game, and backup quarterback John David Booty threw a touchdown to Dwayne Jarrett, his third touchdown catch of the game. Tyler Graunke threw a touchdown for the Warriors to bring them within 39, but backup running back Desmond Reed rushed for the last Trojan touchdown of the game to bring the final score to 63–17 and bringing the Trojans' win streak to 23games.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.|$|E

The Aggies scored two more field goals before the Red Raiders scored on an eight-yard pass from Graham Harrell to Baron Batch. Cory Fowler's extra point was good and Tech held a 20–16 advantage before A scored another touchdown to take a 20–23 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|DHCP is used {{to provide}} the {{appropriate}} client network parameters and specifically the location (IP address) of the TFTP server hosting, ready for download, the initial bootstrap program (NBP) and complementary files. To initiate a PXE bootstrap session the DHCP component of the client's PXE firmware broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER packet containing PXE-specific options to port 67/UDP (DHCP server port); it asks for the required network configuration and network booting parameters. The PXE-specific options identify the initiated DHCP transaction as a PXE transaction. Standard DHCP servers (non PXE enabled) will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> with a regular DHCPOFFER carrying networking information (i.e. IP address) but not the PXE specific parameters.

25|$|Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood (also {{known as}} Ode, Immortality Ode or Great Ode) is {{a poem by}} William Wordsworth, {{completed}} in 1804 and published in Poems, in Two Volumes (1807). The poem was completed in two parts, with the first four stanzas written among a series of poems composed in 1802 about childhood. The {{first part of the}} poem was completed on 27 March 1802 and a copy was provided to Wordsworth's friend and fellow poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who responded with his own poem, , in April. The fourth stanza of the ode ends with a question, and Wordsworth was finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it with 7 additional stanzas completed in early 1804. It was first printed as Ode in 1807, and it was not until 1815 that it was edited and reworked to the version that is currently known, Ode: Intimations of Immortality.|$|E
25|$|A new rite for Thanksgiving after Adoption {{preceded the}} {{revision}} of the Old 'Churching of Women' service. Baptism could now {{be incorporated into the}} main Sunday service, the result of other influences intended to bring it back into the mainstream of worship. The Baptism of those <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> for themselves was much more prominent, a result of the influence of those who questioned infant baptism in a post-Christian society. The questions, however, now addressed to the godparents or the person baptised directly, no longer required the renunciation of the devil or 'the vain pomp and glory of the world' or 'the carnal desires of the flesh' but instead a turning to Christ, a repentance from sin and a renunciation of evil. Likewise the ancient Apostles Creed was replaced by three tritheistic questions, which were criticised (by, among others, John Habgood, sometime Archbishop of York) as being unknown to the credal discussions of the Church, Eastern or Western, modern or ancient.|$|E
25|$|Iowa {{opened up}} Big Ten play against the #12 {{team in the}} country, the Penn State Nittany Lions.

When Penn State finally got on the scoreboard, Iowa quickly answered back with a Nate Kaeding 55-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. Holding a 3513 lead going into the 4th quarter, things were looking ripe for a Hawkeye upset. But Penn State quarterback Zach Mills had the game of his career and threw three touchdown passes in the final 7:13 {{to tie the game}} at 35. Mills had a total of 399 passing yards in the game.
