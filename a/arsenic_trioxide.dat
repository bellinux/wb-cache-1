50|$|Nigeria is {{currently}} a dumping ground for electronic products, which leach toxic metals and substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, <b>arsenic,</b> antimony, and <b>trioxide</b> into water sources. When burned, carcinogenic dioxins and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are emitted and toxic chemicals like barium are transmitted into the soil. The 1989 Basel Convention established an international treaty designed to regulate hazardous waste from being dumped into the developing world.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease of insidious onset, and {{is responsible for}} up to 30, 000 deaths {{per year in the}} U. S. Excessive production of extracellular matrix by myofibroblasts {{has been shown to be}} an important pathological feature in IPF. TGF-β 1 is expressed in fibrotic lung and promotes fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) as well as matrix deposition. Methods To identify the mechanism of <b>Arsenic</b> <b>trioxide’s</b> (ATO) ’s anti-fibrotic effect in vitro, normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were treated with ATO for 24  hours and were then exposed to TGF-β 1 (1  ng/ml) before harvesting at multiple time points. To investigate whether ATO is able to alleviate lung fibrosis in vivo, C 57 BL/ 6 mice were administered bleomycin by oropharyngeal aspiration and ATO was injected intraperitoneally daily for 14  days. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescent staining were used to assess the expression of fibrotic markers such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and α- 1 type I collagen. Results Treatment of NHLFs with ATO at very low concentrations (10 - 20 nM) inhibits TGF-β 1 -induced α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and α- 1 type I collagen mRNA and protein expression. ATO also diminishes the TGF-β 1 -mediated contractile response in NHLFs. ATO’s down-regulation of profibrotic molecules is associated with inhibition of Akt, as well as Smad 2 /Smad 3 phosphorylation. TGF-β 1 -induced H 2 O 2 and NOX- 4 mRNA expression are also blocked by ATO. ATO-mediated reduction in Smad 3 phosphorylation correlated with a reduction of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and PML protein expression. PML-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed decreased fibronectin and PAI- 1 expression in response to TGF-β 1. Daily intraperitoneal injection of ATO (1  mg/kg) in C 57 BL/ 6 mice inhibits bleomycin induced lung α- 1 type I collagen mRNA and protein expression. Conclusions In summary, these data indicate that low concentrations of ATO inhibit TGF-β 1 -induced fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and decreases bleomycin induced {{pulmonary fibrosis}}...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic {{is present}} in all copper, lead, and zinc sulfide ores and is carried along with those metals in the mining, milling and concentrating process. Separation, final {{concentration}} and refining of by-product <b>arsenic</b> as the <b>trioxide</b> is achieved at smelters. Arsenic is the essential consistent element of many compounds important and widely used in agriculture and wood preservation. Lesser amounts are used in metal alloys, glass-making, and feed additives. There is no significant recycling.

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} <b>arsenic</b> <b>trioxide</b> and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} {{the toxic}} heavy metal arsenic {{from the soil}} {{in the form of}} the compound methylarsonic acid. Although less toxic than <b>arsenic</b> <b>trioxide,</b> it is still relatively dangerous. Concentrations over 1000mg/kg (dry weight) are often reached. As reported in one 2004 publication, a mature specimen collected near the town of Český Šternberk in the Czech Republic was found to have an arsenic content of 7090mg/kg dry weight, the highest concentration ever reported in a mushroom. Typically, the arsenic content of mycorrhizal mushrooms collected from unpolluted areas is lower than 1mg/kg. In a 2007 Turkish study of 23 wild edible mushroom species (collected from areas not known to be polluted), S.coronaria had the highest concentration of arsenic at 8.8mg/kg dry weight, while the arsenic concentration of the other tested mushrooms ranged from 0.003mg/kg (in Sarcodon leucopus) to 0.54mg/kg (in Lactarius salmonicolor).|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. <b>Arsenic</b> <b>trioxide</b> has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|E
40|$|Mass spectrometric {{studies of}} the vapours over solid lead oxide in a flow of gaseous <b>arsenic</b> and {{antimony}} <b>trioxides</b> were conducted. The following ions of the ternary oxides were detected: Pb 3 As 2 O 6 +, Pb 3 AsO 4 +, PbAs 2 O 4 +, PbAsO 2 +, PbSb 2 O 4 +, and PbSbO 2 +. The origin of these species produced by the ionisation and/or fragmentation of ternary gaseous oxides is discussed. The PbAs 2 O 4 species was undoubtedly identified by {{the determination of the}} appearance energy. Presumably, the Pb 3 As 2 O 6 and PbSb 2 O 4 species also existed in the gas phase. Thermodynamic data for the ternary oxides were obtained experimentally by means of a mass spectrometric Knudsen-cell method and were confirmed by quantum chemical calculations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicro(mi) RNAs {{are small}} noncoding RNAs that orchestrate many {{key aspects of}} cell {{physiology}} and their deregulation is often linked to distinct diseases including cancer. Here, we studied the contribution of miRNAs in a well-characterized human myeloid leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), targeted by retinoic acid and <b>trioxide</b> <b>arsenic</b> therapy. We identified several miRNAs transcriptionally repressed by the APL-associated PML-RAR oncogene which are released after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid. These coregulated miRNAs were found to control, in a coordinated manner, crucial pathways linked to leukemogenesis, such as HOX proteins and cell adhesion molecules whose expressions are thereby repressed by the chemotherapy. Thus, APL appears linked to transcriptional perturbation of miRNA genes, and clinical protocols able to successfully eradicate cancer cells may do so by restoring miRNA expression. The identification of abnormal miRNA biogenesis in cancer may therefore provide novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in myeloid leukemias...|$|R
5000|$|Arsine, stibine and bismuthine {{are highly}} toxic, {{thermally}} unstable, and colourless gases. No appreciable hydrogen bonding {{is found in}} phosphine, arsine, stibine or bismuthine, {{and there is no}} appreciable tendency to dissociate like ammonia to [...] and [...] (M = P, As, Sb, Bi). The pnictogen hydrides become denser down the group and the M-H bond lengths increase, while the H-M-H bond angle decreases slightly. The standard enthalpies of formation reflect the increasing thermal instability going down the group. Arsine decomposes to arsenic and hydrogen at 250-300 °C, stibine to antimony and hydrogen at room temperature, and bismuthine to bismuth and hydrogen above −45 °C. Arsine and stibine are very easily oxidised to <b>arsenic</b> or antimony <b>trioxide</b> and water; a similar reaction happens with sulfur or selenium. Reaction with metals at elevated temperatures leads to arsenides and antimonides. A few lower hydrides are known, such as As2H4, but they are even more unstable and their properties are unknown.|$|R

25|$|Chronic arsenic {{poisoning}} {{is known}} as arsenicosis. This disorder affects workers in smelters, in populations whose drinking water contains high levels of arsenic (0.3–0.4ppm), and in patients treated for long periods with arsenic-based pharmaceuticals. Similarly, studies on workers exposed in copper foundries in the U.S., Japan and Sweden indicate a risk of lung cancer 6–10 times higher for the most exposed workers compared with the general population. Long-term ingestion of <b>arsenic</b> <b>trioxide</b> either in drinking water or as a medical treatment can lead to skin cancer.

25|$|One of the {{simplest}} arsenic compound is the trihydride, the highly toxic, flammable, pyrophoric arsine (AsH3). This compound is generally regarded as stable, since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of 250–300°C decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid. Several factors, such as humidity, presence of light and certain catalysts (namely aluminium) facilitate the rate of decomposition. It oxidises readily in air to form <b>arsenic</b> <b>trioxide</b> and water, and analogous reactions take place with sulfur and selenium instead of oxygen.|$|E
25|$|The first {{symptoms}} of acute arsenic {{poisoning by ingestion}} are digestive problems: vomiting, abdominal pains, diarrhea often accompanied by bleeding.
