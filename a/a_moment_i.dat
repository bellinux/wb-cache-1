500|$|The puzzle was {{simplified}} in The Shadow of the Templars 2009 [...] by, {{according to}} Cecil, adding a more logical solution. This {{version of the}} game includes a diary, in which the character takes notes; After completing the goat puzzle, George's diary reads: [...] "So the 'ghost of Lochmarne' {{is no more than}} a fierce Billy goat. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> thought it was going to be incredibly awkward to get past, but in the end it was surprisingly simple. Who would have known?", as a reference to the original puzzle's reputation. An easter egg involving a talking goat was included in The Shadow of the Templars sequel, [...] (1997). A goat puzzle was featured in , in the beginning and ending of 2014 second and final episode of the title, as part of the achieved $800,000 Kickstarter [...] "stretch goal".|$|E
500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{got into}} a slight panic. None of the letters looked like Bembo! For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} July 14, 2014, with scenes filmed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and northern Ontario. [...] For {{the scene in}} which Zev kills John Kurlander, Egoyan intended to use a stunt double for Plummer, but Plummer demanded he perform the scene himself. Plummer later told CBC News, [...] "For <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>I</b> {{was a little bit}} pissed off.... Because it made me feel suddenly rather old." [...] However, he admitted firing the gun [...] "frightened" [...] him because [...] "they pack the kick of an elephant" [...] and that he was [...] "terrified" [...] of the dog in the scene. Dean Norris said Plummer used this fear in his performance. The film had a $13 million budget.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry. For <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> thought you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E

In his first ever solo tour Cornell spent seven months on the road from September 13, 1999 to [...] March 7, 2000 playing 61 shows in support of Euphoria Morning. Cornell performed two of those coinciding with the debut of the album on September 21 and 22, 1999 at the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood California. Attendance for the shows were high, considering he performed the initial shows before fans were even familiar with the music. The touring band {{was made up of}} some of the contributing musicians Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, Rick Markmann, and Greg Upchurch. The album proved commercially unsuccessful selling 393,000 copies in the U.S., although the album's single [...] "Can't Change Me" [...] was nominated for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 2000 Grammy Awards. Cornell recorded a version of Can't Change Me in French, this version is a bonus on Euphoria Morning’s deluxe version. The album includes [...] "Wave Goodbye", Cornell's tribute to his late friend Jeff Buckley. It has been noted that Euphoria Morning is influenced by Buckley's songwriting and distinctive vocal style. The album was re-released in 2015 on CD and vinyl and retitled Euphoria Mourning, with Cornell stating in the press release that he had originally intended the album to be called that, but his manager at the time, Jim Guerinot, suggested that [...] "Euphoria Morning" [...] without the [...] "u" [...] would be a better title. [...] "The title was so beautifully poetic to begin with, just the concept of euphoria in mourning; it was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> felt inspired and I let all the air out of it. So when we decided to do its first vinyl release I thought, I want to change the fuckin’ title! [...] It’s time to change it", Cornell stated.|$|E
