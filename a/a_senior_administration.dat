Senior U.S. {{officials said the}}y {{had no choice but to}} abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. <b>A</b> <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official said: [...] "That is the price we pay.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies describes the FATA as: [...] "ground zero in the U.S. Jihadist war, and home to many al-Qaeda operatives, especially the numerous foreigners from the Arab world, Central Asia Muslim areas of the Far East, and even Europe who flock to this war zone for training [...] indoctrination."

2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E

This bomb was also apparently a timed device and was planted inside a ditch near to the busy used car market, <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> local <b>administration</b> official later confirmed. It is also known that Pakistani security forces have conducted a number of operations against Taliban militants within this area of the Khyber region and that the town itself is on the NATO supply route into Afghanistan.

40|$|More {{than fifteen}} {{years after its}} {{ratification}} of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and nearly a decade after its signing of the Kyoto Protocol, the American federal government has maintained its posture of disengagement on climate change policy. Congress rejected a series of legislative proposals in 2005 that would have established modest targets for containing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions from major sources. Even Congressional passage {{of one of these}} bills would likely have been blocked by a Presidential veto. At about the same time, President George W. Bush rejected strong overtures from his closest foreign ally, United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, to take some new greenhouse gas initiatives as the G- 8 group of developed nations gave new attention to climate change. American federal intransigence on this issue was further illustrated when it was revealed in June 2005 that <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> Bush <b>Administration</b> official had quietly downplayed the severity of climate change through substantial modification of a major federal government report on the topic, only to resign shortly thereafter and assume <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> position with <b>a</b> major oil company known for its hostility to any early action to reduce greenhouse gases...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> {{officials have}} on political decisions at the municipal level in Denmark {{is the focus}} for this paper. The study is based on research on how three different dimensions - paradigms, the effects of governmental regulations {{and the relationship between}} <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> officials and politicians – affect the role and job of the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official. The project concludes that three paradigms, Traditional Bureaucracy, New Public Management (NPM) and New Public Governance (NPG) is present and affects the municipal level but that the emergence of NPM and later NPG has increased the “zone” in which <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> officials and politicians both act. This has resulted in a bigger influence on the political level for the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official. Furthermore, it’s concluded that the governmental regulations have more of an effect on the politicians than the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official; however, if any effect it’s to the benefit of the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official in the dialog with the politician. Lastly, it’s concluded that the politician appears more dependent on the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official than the reverse. In addition, any possibility of influence the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official may have on political decisions is mostly related {{to the way in which}} the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official recommends the decisions, and therefore, as an indirect power. Despite this fact, the <b>senior</b> <b>administration</b> official seemingly attempts to recommend decisions in a way they believe corresponds to the wishes of the politicians. There are also indications, in some cases, that the official’s personal beliefs do play a role when recommending decisions. This indicates that the official do have significant influence on political decisions...|$|R
