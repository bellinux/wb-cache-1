He played in goal, which he wrote suited the loner in him and gave him a sense of living on the edge between hero and villain.|$|E

Sir Nicholas himself believed this was undeserved, because unlike Schindler, his life had never been in danger.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 works. His desire to be comprehensive meant {{that he would take}} both sides of an argument and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others. He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be seen as a preeminent authority for the school.|$|E

Amid the post-war environment, the profiles of Arafat and Fatah were raised by this important turning point, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be regarded as a national hero who dared to confront Israel. With mass applause from the Arab world, financial donations increased significantly, and Fatah's weaponry and equipment improved. The group's numbers swelled as many young Arabs, including thousands of non-Palestinians, joined the ranks of Fatah.|$|E
5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was bored by {{the manner in which}} they taught him Classics. Instead he developed a keen interest in Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E
5|$|Neilson {{started his}} career {{alongside}} his brother, Tony, at first Hertford Town and then Ware, before he earned a move to Cambridge City. He made his name in non-league as a goal-scoring winger <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{the attention of a}} number of league clubs. He had trials with three of them and eventually won a move to League Two side Bradford City. He scored a goal on his full debut but Bradford soon changed manager and Neilson dropped back into non-league, first out on loan to Cambridge United and then signed by Crawley Town, having spent less than 12months with Bradford. Neilson spent a short but successful loan spell with Grimsby Town in 2012, and then joined Luton on a short-term contract in January 2013 before his release a few months later. He returned to Grimsby permanently before joining Whitehawk.|$|E

5|$|James VI's {{visit to}} Denmark in 1589, where witch-hunts were already common, may have {{encouraged}} {{an interest in}} the study of witchcraft, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> see the storms he encountered on his voyage as the result of magic. After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act and the first known to successfully involve the diabolic pact. Several people, most notably Agnes Sampson and the schoolmaster John Fian, were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches. He subsequently believed that a nobleman, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. Inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 he wrote the Daemonologie, a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth, which contains probably the most famous literary depiction of Scottish witches. James imported continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil. However, after the publication of Daemonologie his views became more sceptical, and in the same year he revoked the standing commissions on witchcraft, limiting prosecutions by the central courts.|$|E
5|$|One of the Sinhala legends tells {{that when}} Skanda-Kumara moved to Sri Lanka, {{he asked for}} refuge from Tamils. The Tamils refused, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> live with the Sinhalese in Kataragama. As a penance for their refusal, the deity forced Tamils to indulge in body {{piercing}} and fire walking in his annual festival. This legend tries to explain {{the location of the}} shrine as well as the traditional patterns of worship by Tamils. Another Sinhala legends attests that Kataragama deviyo was the deity worshiped by Dutugamunu in the 1st century BCE, before his war with Ellalan, and that Dutugamunu had the shrine erected to Skanda-Kumara at Kataragama after his victory. This legend has no corroboration in the Mahavamsa, the historic annals about Dutugamunu. Another Sinhala legend makes Kataragama deviyo a deification of a Tamil spy sent by Elara to live amongst the Sinhalese or a Tamil juggler who made the locals deify him after his death. Yet another legend says that Kataragama deviyo is a deification of the legendary king Mahasena, who is born as a bodhisattva or Buddha in waiting. Anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere were able to identify new strands of these legends and the originators of these legends since the 1970s, with the burgeoning popularity of the shrine and its deity amongst the Sinhala Buddhists.|$|E

From the 1920s he {{became involved in}} the study of marsupials, in 1947 developing his palimpsest theory by showing a connection between the monotremes and early reptiles. Around the early 1920s he also became interested in recent human evolution particularly after the discovery of the early African hominids. His specialist knowledge of mammalian dentition led him to pursue the same path with regard to human evolution <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be regarded as the world's leading expert on the evolution of human dentition, a reputation secured by the 1922 publication of The Evolution of the Human Dentition.

A left-wing admirer of Russia, he was devastated when Hitler's tanks rolled across the Soviet border.

When he met Hitler in May 1942, his suspicions were confirmed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men to win propaganda victories than military ones. So, in February 1943, Bose turned his back on his legionnaires and slipped secretly away aboard a submarine bound for Japan. This left the men he had recruited leaderless and demoralised in Germany.|$|E
25|$|That year, Terzaghi {{was finally}} {{fed up with}} MIT and its {{president}} and determined to return to Europe. He accepted {{a chair at the}} Vienna Technische Hochshule in the winter of 1929. He married Ruth, who became his editor and collaborator as well. A short consulting trip to the Soviet Union before taking up his post horrified him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> oppose the communist system there, as a regime exemplified by its brutality and chaos. Using Austria as his base, he traveled ceaselessly throughout Europe, consulting, lecturing and making new professional contacts and collaborations. His teaching workload was now relatively light so he continued his experimental investigations and became especially interested in the problems of the settling of foundations, and of grouting. He began writing the manuscript for a much updated and expanded version of Erdbaumechanik, now set for two volumes. However, the political turmoil in Austria began to interfere with his work, and in 1935, he decided to take a leave from Vienna from 1935 to 1936.|$|E

25|$|Late in his life, Shockley became {{intensely}} {{interested in}} questions of race, human intelligence, and eugenics. He thought {{this work was}} important to the genetic future {{of the human species}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> describe it as the most important work of his career, even though expressing his views damaged his reputation. Shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect, and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization. With regard to racial differences he used the following standard statement, e.g., on a debate with Afro-centrist Frances Welsing and on Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr.:My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro's intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment.Shockley's published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist Cyril Burt and were funded by the Pioneer Fund. Shockley also proposed that individuals with IQs below 100 be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization.|$|E
