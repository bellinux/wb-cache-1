40|$|Radionuclide {{contamination}} {{in the soil}} and groundwater at U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites is a severe problem requiring monitoring and remediation. Radionuclide measurement techniques are needed to monitor surface waters, groundwater, and process waters. Typically, water samples are collected and transported to the analytical laboratory where costly radiochemical analyses are performed. To date, there has been very little development of selective radionuclide sensors for alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides such as {sup 90 }Sr, {sup 99 }Tc, and various actinides of interest. The objective of this project is to investigate novel sensor concepts and materials for sensitive and selective determination of beta- and <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> contaminants in water. To meet the requirements for low-level, isotope-specific detection, the proposed sensors are based on radiometric detection.

Tumor targeting molecules carrying a cytotoxic moiety is then an attractive approach. In this thesis, an affibody molecule with high affinity for the protein HER- 2, that is strongly associated with aggressive forms of breast cancer, was selected. After radiolabeling with 125 I, the affibody molecule, in monovalent and bivalent form, was tested in vitro in HER- 2 overexpressing tumor cells and in transplanted tumors in mice. It was shown that the HER- 2 targeting affibody molecule bound its target in a specific manner, both in vitro and in vivo. The small size of the affibody molecule resulted in fast clearance through the kidneys. An impressive tumor-to-blood ratio of 10 eight hours post injection was achieved and the tumors could easily be visualized in a gamma camera. The biologic effects of the bivalent affibody molecule and a monovalent affinity maturated version was measured and compared {{with the effects of}} the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. It was found that although all molecules target the same protein, the effects differed greatly. The affibody molecule was also labeled with the <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> 211 At. Specific decrease in survival was seen in HER- 2 overexpressing cells receiving the 211 At labeled affibody molecule. The sensitivity to the treatment differed between cell lines, probably as a result of differences between the cell lines in internalization and nuclear size. The 211 At labeled affibody molecules were also tested in vivo, where stability of the 211 At label was a problem. To circumvent this problem, more stable conjugation chemistry was tested, as well as strategies to prevent uptake of released 211 At by normal organs.

40|$|We have briefly {{reviewed}} the biological hazards {{associated with the}} actinide elements. The most abundant transuranium element produced by both industrial nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons programs is plutonium. It is also potentially the most toxic - particularly due to its long-term hazard as a carcinogen if it is introduced into the body. This toxicity is {{due in large part}} to the chemical and biochemical similarities of Pu(IV) and Fe(III). Thus in mammals plutonium is transported and stored by the transport and storage systems for iron. This results in the concentration and long-term retention of an <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> ({sup 239 }Pu) at sites such as the bone marrow where cell division occurs at a high rate. The earliest attempts at removal of actinide contamination by chelation therapy were essentially heuristic in that sequestering agents known to be effective at binding other elements were tried with plutonium. The research described here is intended to be a rational approach that begins with the observation that since Fe(III) and Pu(IV) are so similar, and since microbes produce agents called siderophores that are extremely effective and selective sequestering agents for Fe(III), the construction of similar chelating agents for the actinides should be possible using the same chelating groups found in the siderophores. The incorporation of four such groups (primarily catechol and hydroxamic acid) results in multidentate chelating agents that can completely encapsulate the central actinide(IV) ion and achieve the eight-coordinate environment most favored by such ions. The continuing development and improvement of such sequestering agents has produced compounds which remove significant amounts of plutonium deposited in bone and which remove a greater fraction of the total body burden than any other chelation therapy developed to date...|$|E

We report {{the development and}} testing of Bi- 213 (an <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide)</b> labeled bevacizumab for in vitro and in vivo studies using two different chelators viz cDTPA and CHX-A¬ø. The developed labeling method showed high labeling yields of 93. 6 % and 89. 7 % for cDTPA and CHX-A¬ø respectively {{and the results were}} reproducible. The in vitro and in vivo stability tests were carried out using Bi- 213 and long half-life Bismuth isotope (Bi- 205 / Bi- 206) for pharmacokinetics. The in vitro results showed remarkable stability of the radiolabeled bevacizumab regardless of the chelator. The in vivo pharmacokinetics studies however, showed that the uptake and retention of cDTPA- bevacizumab was significantly higher in kidneys (p-value 0. 02) and lower in liver and spleen (p-value < 0. 0001 and 0. 0009 respectively). The values for the two conjugates compared well in blood but the longer term data for CHX-A¬ø conjugate showed slow clearance resulting in a significantly longer blood half-life of the product (211 hours compared to 4 hours for cDTPA- bevacizumab). Preliminary in vivo results showed increased efficacy of the combination therapy compared to bevacizumab only. The tumour area (mm 2) decreased from 24. 8 √É¬ø√Ç¬ø√É¬ø√Ç¬± 3. 6 and 12. 8 √É¬ø√Ç¬ø√É¬ø√Ç¬± 1. 7 for 1 and 3 mg/kg cold bevacizumab only to 6. 5 √É¬ø√Ç¬ø√É¬ø√Ç¬± 0. 7 and 7. 5 √É¬ø√Ç¬ø√É¬ø√Ç¬± 4. 8 when single dose of 333 MBq/kg of 213 Bi-bevacizumab was administered as combination therapy.

The shorter blood half-life with cDTPA- bevacizumab may not be a major concern with Bi- 213 as its own half-life is 46 minutes only. The combination therapy proved superior to bevacizumab alone therapy, a phenomenon that can be particularly useful in cancers where bevacizumab alone has shown limited success like prostate cancer.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) has {{expressed}} {{a need for}} an on-line, real-time instrument for assaying alpha-emitting radionuclides (uranium and the transuranics) in effluent waters leaving DOE sites to ensure compliance with regulatory limits. Due to the short range of alpha particles in water ({approximately} 40 Tm), it is necessary now to intermittently collect samples of water {{and send them to}} a central laboratory for analysis. A lengthy and costly procedure is used to separate and measure the radionuclides from each sample. Large variations in radionuclide concentrations in the water may go undetected due to the sporadic sampling. Even when detected, the reading may not be representative of the actual stream concentration. To address these issues, Tecogen, a division of Thermo Power Corporation, a Thermo Electron company, is developing a real-time, field-deployable, alpha monitor based on a solid-state silicon wafer semiconductor (patent pending, to be assigned to the Department of Energy). The Thermo Alpha Monitor (TAM) will serve to monitor effluent water streams (Subsurface Contaminants Focus Area) and will be suitable for process control of remediation as well as decontamination and decommissioning operations, such as monitoring scrubber or rinse water radioactivity levels (Mixed Waste Focus Area and D&D Focus Area). It would be applicable for assaying other liquids, such as oil, or solids after proper preconditioning. Rapid isotopic alpha air monitoring is also possible using this technology. This instrument for direct counting of alpha-emitters in aqueous streams is presently being developed by Thermo Power under a development program funded by the DOE Environmental Management program (DOE-EM), administered by the Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC). Under this contract, Thermo Power has demonstrated a solid-state, silicon-based semiconductor instrument, which uses a proprietary film-based collection system to quantitatively extract the radionuclides of interest from the water sample. The new instrument permits extremely sensitive counting of alpha-emitters in water, and it also provides high-resolution alpha spectrometry so that individual radionuclides can be identified and assayed simultaneously, based on their different alpha energies. The specialized film captures a broad (or narrow by choice of film) range of <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> ions dissolved in the liquid.

With the {{increasing}} awareness of water contamination issues and the rising consequences of any form of contamination, real-time continuous monitoring is rapidly becoming a necessity. In particular, monitoring {{for the presence of}} any radioactive material is paramount. The most difficult of such monitoring tasks is that of detecting <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in water.

By maximizing the surface to volume ratio of the scintillator, the response to alpha particles is favored over other types of radiation. Several configurations of scintillator and light collection schemes have been investigated to optimize the detection efficiency.

Tests also provided confirmation that MST performs well at much larger laboratory scales (300 - 700 times larger) and exhibits little affinity for desorption of strontium and plutonium during washing...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} alpha-emitters in targeted alpha therapy (TAT) goes together with developments in radionuclide production and labelling chemistry. Especially profound {{understanding of the}} coordination chemistry of the respective metal ion-ligand system is of major importance to develop protocols for the synthesis of radioimmunoconjugates and to predict the fate of radionuclides in vivo. Radioconjugates of the therapeutic alpha-emitter Ac- 225 with polyamino-polycarboxyl ligands as chelating agents are being actively studied [1, 2, 3, 4]. In particular the macrocyclic ligand 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraacetic acid (DOTA) has shown promise due to the high kinetic- and thermodynamic stability (log K > 20) of its complexes with trivalent metal cations [5]. The scope of the presented work was the experimental characterisation and evaluation of DOTA as a suitable chelator for trivalent actinides (An(III)), particularly in terms of stable binding of the long-lived <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> Ac- 225 to biomolecules for safe application in radioimmunotherapy (RIT). The project included not only basic studies {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the complexation mechanisms and kinetics, but, based on these findings, was aimed at the development of a robust labelling protocol for facile and effective synthesis of an Ac- 225 -DOTA-MabThera¬Æ conjugate. In the course of the investigations, focus was set on in vitro testing of the obtained radioimmunoconjugate, in particular the evaluation of the kinetic stability in presence of competing agents as well as in human blood serum. Assessment of the antigen binding affinity of the antibody conjugate completed the work. The protocol for the design and synthesis of Ac- 225 radiopharmaceuticals of McDevitt et al. provided the starting point for this study [6]. This research group developed a synthetic scheme to radiolabel DOTA-proteins with Ac- 225. Later, the protocol was applied to antibodies in form of a two-step synthesis, with the first step being the Ac- 225 DOTA-Bn-NCS complexation, followed by the coupling of the Ac- 225 -DOTA-Bn-NCS to the mAb. The idea behind this two-step approach was that, when the complexation of Ac(III) with DOTA is conducted at elevated temperatures and basic pH (first step), presumably a more stable complex is formed. However, since higher temperature / pH are known to have a negative effect on the antibody efficiency, the conjugation to the biomolecule can hence only be conducted at lower temperatures in a second step. This two-step synthesis though suffers from yields below 10...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Pretargeted {{radioimmunotherapy}} (PRIT) {{with the}} anti-CEA x anti-HSG bispecific antibody TF 2, and 177 Lu-labeled di-HSG-DOTA peptide IMP 288, can delay growth of CEA-expressing colon cancer xenografts. A phase I study {{has shown the}} safety and feasibility of PRIT in colorectal cancer patients. The therapeutic efficacy of PRIT may be improved by using alpha-emitting radionuclides. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of 213 Bi and 177 Lu for PRIT of CEA-expressing xenografts. Material and methods: The vitro binding characteristics (IC 50, Kd, internalization) of 213 Bi-IMP 288 were compared with those of 177 Lu-IMP 288. Tumor targeting of 213 Bi-IMP 288 and 177 Lu-IMP 288 was studied in mice with s. c. LS 174 T that were pretargeted with TF 2. Finally, the effect of 213 Bi-IMP 288 (6, 12, or 17 MBq) and 177 Lu-IMP 288 (MTD: 60 MBq) on tumor growth and survival was assessed. Toxicity was determined by monitoring body weight and by analyzing blood samples for haematological toxicity (haemoglobin, leucocytes, platelets). Results: Binding characteristics of 213 Bi-IMP 288 were similar to those of 177 Lu-IMP 288 (Kd = 0. 8 nM). Tumor uptake was observed as early as 15 min post injection (9. 2 ¬± 2. 0 %ID/g) and the peptide cleared rapidly from the circulation. At 30 min post injection the blood level of 213 Bi-IMP 288 was 0. 44 ¬± 0. 28 %ID/g. Uptake of 213 Bi-IMP 288 in other normal tissues was very low, except for some uptake in the kidneys (1. 8 ¬± 1. 1 %ID/g). The biodistribution was comparable to that of 177 Lu-IMP 288. PRIT treated mice showed significant inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival. Mean doubling time of the tumor following treatment with PBS, 6 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288, 12 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288, 17 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288, and 60 MBq 177 Lu-IMP 288 group was 3. 3 ¬± 0. 3, 6. 5 ¬± 1. 2, 11. 1 ¬± 3. 2, 37. 1 ¬± 25. 0, and 11. 8 ¬± 9. 3 days. Median survival for the PBS, 6 MBq, and 17 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288 group was 22, 31, and 24 days, respectively. The 12 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288 and 60 MBq 177 Lu-IMP 288 groups did not yet reach the median survival at day 35. No changes in haemoglobin, platelets, and leucocytes were observed. Conclusion: This study showed that PRIT with the <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> is feasible and at least as effective as 177 Lu-IMP 288. Haematological toxicity and survival of mice treated with 12 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288 and 60 MBq 177 Lu-IMP 288 were comparable. Future experiments should study the effect of multiple cycles of 213 Bi- and 177 Lu-IMP 288 on tumor growth, survival, and haematological and renal toxicity. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic cancer (PCa) {{is one of}} {{the deadliest}} cancers, {{carrying}} a very poor prognosis. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, synonymous to pancreatic cancer, is the 4 th leading cause of cancer deaths. The ‚Äúsilent killer‚Äù is characterized by its metastatic behavior even before the primary tumor can be detected (1), resulting in a five-year survival rate of only 4 %. Gemcitabine and erlotinib, FDA-approved drugs for pancreatic cancer treatment, improve median survival by less than six months in advanced stage patients (2 - 4), underscoring the need for alternative approaches. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) relies on antigen-antibody binding to deliver cytotoxic doses of alpha- or beta radiation to tumor cells (5, 6). RIT has been successfully used to treat refractory and recurrent lymphomas, with two radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeted against CD 20 (Zevalin¬Æ and Bexxar¬Æ) (7). More recently FDA has approved Zevalin as a first-line therapy for newly diagnosed patients with non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (NHL). The power of RIT in comparison with many other therapeutic modalities is its cytocidal nature, when particulate radiation emanating from the mAbs causes physical destruction of the cell. This is very different from trying to abrogate a single step in a multistep pathway as cancer cells often find alternative ways to thrive. In addition, RIT has an excellent safety record, having many fewer side effects than conventional chemotherapy, and its efficacy is not subject to multidrug resistance mechanisms. The antigens that have been traditionally targeted in PCa are surface proteins such as MUC 1 or CEA (carcinoembriogenic antigen) (8, 9) which are also expressed on healthy tissues, thus limiting the dose which can be safely delivered to the tumor. Targeting of intracellular antigens that become available for mAb binding in aggressively growing tumors as a result of fast cellular turnover was first suggested two decades ago as an alternative to targeting surface antigens in RIT (10). The advantage of this approach is that mAbs to intracellular antigens have very low cross-reactivity with irrelevant surface antigens on healthy tissues, allowing high specificity and low toxicity of treatment. It is important to emphasize that when treating cancers by targeting intracellular antigens ‚Äì {{only a limited number of}} cells in the tumor need to be non-viable to allow radiolabeled mAb targeting. Ionizing radiation is emitted in a 360 o sphere and as alpha- and beta-particles have a range in tissue which covers at least several cells‚Äô diameters, even distant cancer cells will be killed via the so called ‚Äúcross-fire‚Äù effect (Fig. 1). In this regard a human-mouse chimeric mAb chTNT 3 to single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and RNA (11) has been already used in its radiolabeled form in patients with advanced lung cancer with encouraging results (12). We hypothesized that in aggressively growing pancreatic tumors there will be a sufficient number of non-viable cells for the radiolabeled chTNT 3 mAb to get access to its antigen and to deliver cytocidal radiation to the rest of the tumor. We also hypothesized that preceding RIT with administration of a chemotherapeutic agent would kill some of tumor cells thus providing more target for the radiolabeled mAb to bind, resulting in a higher radiation dose to the tumor. Here we describe our results on combining RIT with chTNT 3 mAb radiolabeled with powerful <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> 213 -Bismuth (213 Bi) with chemotherapy with gemcitabine or cisplatin for treatment of experimental PCa.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>alpha-emitting</b> bone-seeking <b>radionuclides</b> {{and the relationship}} between bone tumor incidence and the local dosimetry of radionuclides in bone are investigated. The microdistributions of <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides</b> in the trabecular bone from the proximal humerus, distal humerus, proximal ulna, proximal femur, and distal femur of six young adult beagles injected with Am- 241 (three with 2. 8 micro-Ci/kg and three with 0. 9 micro-Ci/kg) are estimated using a computer-controlled microscope photometer system; the components of the University of Utah Optical Track Scanner are described. The morphometric parameters for the beagles are calculated and analyzed. It is observed that the beagles injected with 0. 9 micro-Ci of Am- 241 /kg showed an increase in the percentage of bone and trabecular bone thickness, and a reduction in the width of the bone marrow space and surface/volume ratio. The data reveal that radiation damage causes abnormal bone structure...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{developing}} radiation-induced lung cancer is currently estimated using models based on epidemiological data from populations exposed either to relatively uniform, low-LET radiation, or from uranium miners exposed to radon and its progeny. Because inhaled <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides</b> (e. g., Pu, Am) produce nonuniform, chronic irradiation of the parenchymal region of the lung, a better scientific basis is needed for assessing the risk {{of developing}} radiation-induced disease from these radionuclides. Scientists at FIB- 1 and LRRI are using a unique resource at the FIB- 1, i. e., a set of about 600 lung specimens fixed in 10 % formalin, and obtained from a population of workers at the Mayak Production Association, many of whom inhaled significant quantities of Pu and other <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides</b> during their careers. The objectives of this research are 1) to measure the microscopic distribution of Pu by quantitative autoradiography, 2) to determine the spatial distribution of Pu in human lung tissue with respect to specific lung structures and 3) to determine the effect of chronic tobacco-smoke exposure on the distribution of local Pu radiation dose. The approach to analyzing these lung samples is to utilize contemporary stereological sampling and analysis techniques together with quantitative alpha-particle autoradiography. Our initial results have validated the usefulness of these lung specimens for determining Pu particle distribution with respect to anatomic location, as well as identifying normal and diseased compartments i...|$|R

In recent years, radium has been used primarily as a tracer to study the migration of radioactive substances in environmental systems. Tracing the naturally occurring radium isotopes in mineral and water sources allows for the determination of source location, residence time, and concentrations. An understanding of the concentration of radionuclides in our food and water sources is essential to everyone‚Äôs health as alpha particle decay is highly damaging in vivo. Due to this high radiobiological effectiveness, there is increased interest in using <b>alpha-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides</b> to prepare new, therapeutic radiopharmaceutical drugs.
