40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the ascorbate-activated cleavage of sinigrin to mustard oil has been postulated as enzymatic hydrolysis of the thioglucoside to the <b>aglucone,</b> which undergoes spontaneous Lossen rearrangement to allyl isothiocyanate. Potassium silver sinigrate (I) served as a convenient source of the <b>aglucone</b> (II) for comparison. When the potassium salt was decomposed with iodide at pH 2, 97 % of the product was allyl cyanide; at pH 5, 97 % was allyl isothiocyanate; and at pH 3. 53, the two compounds were formed in equal amounts. The ratio of nitrile to isothiocyanate was proportional to hydrogen ion concentration. Enzymatic hydrolysis of sinigrin at pH 3. 2 - 5, with or without ascorbate, gave essentially the same product distribution. Treatment of potassium silver sinigrate with hydrogen cyanide at pH 6. 6 allowed spectroscopic observation of the <b>aglucone.</b> It (II) has an ultraviolet absorption maximum at 245 mu, E 11, 000, and a half-life of 37 seconds at 20 ° (estimated 1 minutes at 0 °). These results agree with data for and the resulting <b>aglucone</b> either undergoes Lossen rearrangement or is captured by another enzyme ("thiocyanase") and converted to allyl thiocyanate. Isothiocyanate once formed is not isomerized. That the thiocyanate {{is derived from the}} <b>aglucone</b> was demonstrated by reaction of potassium silver sinigrate with iodide and ground Thlaspi seed. The <b>aglucone</b> thus produced was converted efficiently to thiccyanate. Allyl isothiocyanate and allyl thiocyanate reached an equilibrium in the undiluted liquid, with 5. 1 % allyl thiocyanate at 24 ° and 8. 2 % at 100 °. Equilibrium is approached at 24 ° with a half-life of 17 - 19 days. In dilute aqueous and methanolic solutions, which decompose rapidly, the apparent equilibrium is 35 - 40 % allyl thiocyanate...|$|E

On the basis of transport studies in intact cells, a binding site for phlorizin was suggested in the region between amino acids 604 - 610 of the C-terminal loop 13. To further investigate phlorizin binding titration experiments of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of isolated wild-type loop 13 and two mutated loops (Y 604 K and G 609 K) were carried out. Phlorizin (135 M) produced approximately 40 % quenching of the fluorescence of wild-type loop 13; quenching could also be observed with the two mutated loops. The apparent Kd was lowest for the wild-type loop 13 (Kd 23 M), followed by mutant G 609 K (57 M) and mutant Y 604 K (70 M). Binding of phlorizin was further confirmed by a decrease of the accessibility of loop 13 to the collisional quencher acrylamide. The interaction involves the aromatic moiety of the <b>aglucone</b> since phloretin (the <b>aglucone</b> of phlorizin) showed almost the same effects as phlorizin, while D-glucose did not. MALDI-TOF experiments revealed that loop 13 contained a disulfide bond between Cys 560 and Cys 608 {{that is very important}} for phlorizin-dependent fluorescence quenching. These studies provide direct evidence that loop 13 is a site (important amino acids including 604 - 609) for the molecular interaction between SGLT 1 and phlorizin.

40|$|Flavor is {{the main}} {{limiting}} factor affecting soybean acceptability in the Occidental countries. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effects of isoflavones on soybean flavor. Differences in beany flavor and astringency of soymilk and cooked whole soybean grains, prepared with cultivar IAS 5 and BR- 36 (136 and 54 mg of total isoflovones/ 100 g of sample, respectively) with pre-soaking and pre-heading of grains, were sensorially analised, by an unstructured category scale of ascending intensity. Differences in isoflavone content for both soybean cultivars were maintained in the two products, despite the pre-treatments in the processing. Pre-soaking of grains intensified beany flavor in the soymilk, reducing the perception of astringency, which is caused by the <b>aglucones</b> that were developed in reduced amounts. The whole soybean grains cooked under pressure (1. 5 kgf/cm 2 at 127 Graus C.) presented reduced levels of isoflavones malonyl-glucosides. Due to thermal instability, these compounds were converted to conjugated glucosides, genistin and daidzin. In the cooked whole soybean grains, no <b>aglucones</b> were formed and consequently it was not possible to detect differences in astringency.

40|$|Extraction of {{isoflavone}} malonylglucosides {{from red}} clover (Trifolium pratense L.) {{is a complicated}} procedure. This {{is due to the}} relatively unstable character of the thermolabile glucoside malonates as well as by action of native β-glucosidases, resulting in a rapid degradation of malonylated glucosides into their corresponding <b>aglucones.</b> In this study, Tris was identified as a suitable β-glucosidase inhibitor in red clover extracts, optimized at 350 mM Tris in 80 % ethanol at pH 7. 2. Extraction of fresh red clover leaves using Tris increased the concentration of malonate conjugated isoflavones approximately 13 to 24 times as opposed to extraction without Tris. A comparison of isoflavone profiles obtained after extraction with and without Tris of different plant organs of red clover and several species within the family Fabaceae suggests that the amount and/or activity of the degenerative β-glucosidase enzymes vary for the different plant parts of red clover and among the species studied.

Thiocyanate-forming protein (TFP) from field-penny cress, Thlaspi arvense (Brassicaceae), is a representative of specifier proteins, a group of kelch proteins involved in plant specialized metabolism. As components of the glucosinolate-myrosinase system of the Brassicaceae, specifier proteins determine the profile of bioactive products formed when plant tissue is disrupted and glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by myrosinases.

40|$|Insect {{herbivory}} {{is often}} restricted by glucosylated plant chemical defence compounds that are activated by plant β-glucosidases to release toxic <b>aglucones</b> upon plant tissue damage. Such two-component plant defences are {{widespread in the}} plant kingdom and examples of these classes of compounds are alkaloid, benzoxazinoid, cyanogenic and iridoid glucosides as well as glucosinolates and salicinoids. Conversely, many insects have evolved a diversity of counter-adaptations to overcome this type of constitutive chemical defence. Here we discuss that such counter-adaptations occur at different time points, before and during feeding as well as during digestion, and at several levels such as the insects' feeding behaviour, physiology and metabolism. Insect adaptations frequently circumvent or counteract {{the activity of the}} plant β-glucosidases, bioactivating enzymes that are a key element in the plant's two-component chemical defence.

Plant tissue damage results in hydrolysis of glucosinolates by endogenous thioglucosidases known as myrosinases.

Recently, simple nitriles were recognized to serve distinct functions in plant-insect interactions. Here, we show that simple nitrile formation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia- 0 rosette leaves increases in response to herbivory and that this increase is independent of the known epithiospecifier protein (ESP). We combined phylogenetic analysis, a screen of Arabidopsis mutants, recombinant protein characterization, and expression quantitative trait locus mapping to identify a gene encoding a nitrile-specifier protein (NSP) responsible for constitutive and herbivore-induced simple nitrile formation in Columbia- 0 rosette leaves. AtNSP 1 is one of five Arabidopsis ESP homologues that promote simple nitrile, but not epithionitrile or thiocyanate, formation. Four of these homologues possess one or two lectin-like jacalin domains, which share a common ancestry with the jacalin domains of the putative Arabidopsis myrosinase-binding proteins MBP 1 and MBP 2. A sixth ESP homologue lacked specifier activity and likely represents the ancestor of the gene family with a different biochemical function.

Many terpene structures, phenylpropane derivatives (Fig. 6), as well as aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, carbonyls, fatty acids and others were identified (Fig. 5). The chemotypes of Origanum vulgare ssp. hirtum, Artemisia absinthium and Myrtus communis were determined and some uninvestigated or insufficiently investigated plants (Micromeria juliana, Sequaoiadendron giganteum, Populus nigra, Prunus mahaleb, Ailanthus altissima and others) were analyzed. A newly developed method of co-distillation enabled isolation of unstable volatile compounds without formation of artefacts (Fig. 1). The volatile aglycones liberated by enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding glycosides were aliphatic and phenylpropanoic derivatives, as well as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and others (Fig. 7). Only partial similarity was observed in the composition of volatile aglycones and corresponding free volatiles of the same plant. Furthermore, glucosides of ubiquitous monoterpene and aliphatic alcohols and phenols were prepared by Koenigs-Knorr glucosylation (Fig. 8), by enzymatic condensation and transglucosidation from cellobiose (Fig. 11) and by direct glucosylation with FeCl 3 (Fig. 13).

In the present experiments the effect of myrosinase type on the products obtained in the hydrolysis of glucosibarin was studied by MECC using two B. carinata myrosinase preparations differing on their affinity to the Con A material, Con A 1 (first eluting fractions) and Con A 2 (last eluting fractions). At pH 3 Con A 1 isoenzymes were more active than Con A 2 isoenzymes. At pH 5 and 6. 5 Con A 1 isoenzymes produced oxazolidine- 2 -thione to a higher extent than Con A 2 isoenzymes. The production of nitriles by Con A 1 isoenzymes was not influenced by pH and at pH 5 and 6. 5 the amount of nitrile produced by Con A 1 isoenzymes was lower than that produced by Con A 2 isoenzymes. Formation of nitriles requires {{the presence}} of two redox equivalents which leads to the release of the sulphur atom from the <b>aglucone.</b> Isothiocyanates and nitriles differ in their bioactivity towards different targets; therefore the possibility for directing the glucosinolate hydrolysis towards the desired compound in a particular situation is of great relevance...|$|E
40|$|The syrB gene is {{required}} for syringomycin production by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and full virulence during plant pathogenesis. Strain B 3 AR 132 containing a syrB::lacZ fusion was used to detect transcriptional activation of the syrB gene in syringomycin minimal medium by plant metabolites with signal activity. Among 34 plant phenolic compounds tested, arbutin, phenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and salicin were shown to be strong inducers of syrB, giving rise to approximately 1, 200 U of beta-galactosidase activity at 100 microM; esculin and helicin were moderate inducers, with about 250 to 400 U of beta-galactosidase activity at 100 microM. Acetosyringone and flavonoids that serve as signal molecules in Agrobacterium and Rhizobium species, respectively, did not induce the syrB::lacZ fusion. All syrB inducers were phenolic glucosides {{and none of the}} <b>aglucone</b> derivatives were active, suggesting that the beta-glycosidic linkage was necessary for signal activity. Phenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside containing galactose substituted for glucose in the beta-glycosidic linkage also lacked inducer activity. Phenolic signal activity was enhanced two- to fivefold by specific sugars common to plant tissues, including D-fructose, D-mannose, and sucrose. The effect of sugars on syrB induction was most noticeable at low concentrations of phenolic glucoside (i. e., 1 to 10 microM), indicating that sugars such as D-fructose increase the sensitivity of P. syringae pv. syringae to the phenolic plant signal. Besides induction of syrB, syringomycin biosynthesis by parental strain B 3 A-R was induced to yield over 250 U of toxin by the additions of arbutin and D-fructose to syringomycin minimal medium. These data indicate that syringomycin production by most strains of P. syringae pv. syringae is modulated by the perception of two classes of plant signal molecules and transduced to the transcriptional apparatus of syringomycin (syr) genes such as syrB...|$|E

This {{review paper}} {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} the research of free and glycosidically bound volatiles in the 2001 - 2006 period obtained by work in the Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Technology, University of Split, Croatia. Many terpene structures, phenylpropane derivatives (Fig. 6), as well as aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, carbonyls, fatty acids and others were identified (Fig. 5). The chemotypes of Origanum vulgare ssp. hirtum, Artemisia absinthium and Myrtus communis were determined and some uninvestigated or insufficiently investigated plants (Micromeria juliana, Sequaoiadendron giganteum, Populus nigra, Prunus mahaleb, Ailanthus altissima and others) were analyzed. A newly developed method of co-distillation enabled isolation of unstable volatile compounds without formation of artefacts (Fig. 1). The volatile aglycones liberated by enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding glycosides were aliphatic and phenylpropanoic derivatives, as well as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and others (Fig. 7). Only partial similarity was observed in the composition of volatile aglycones and corresponding free volatiles of the same plant. Furthermore, glucosides of ubiquitous monoterpene and aliphatic alcohols and phenols were prepared by Koenigs-Knorr glucosylation (Fig. 8), by enzymatic condensation and transglucosidation from cellobiose (Fig. 11) and by direct glucosylation with FeCl 3 (Fig. 13). The products were characterized by GC-MS analysis of prepared tetraacetyl glucosides. Fragment ion characteristics of the <b>aglucone</b> moiety were present in all mass spectra, along with the fragments obtained from acetylated glucose (Fig. 12 and Fig. 14). Acetylated glucosides were separable on the HP- 101 column, Fig. 9 (even diastereomeric tetraacetyl ß-glucosides of enantiomeric alcohols, Fig. 10) ...|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] is the major diglucoside isolated from the corms of the plant family Hypoxidaceae, It contains an. unusual E-pent-l-en- 4 -yne 5 -carbon bridging unit with two distal catechol groups to which the glucose moieties are attached, It is non-toxic for BL 6 mouse melanoma cells in tissue culture on condition that the fetal calf serum in the medium is heat-inactivated for 1 hour at 56 °C in order to destroy endogenous beta-glucosidase activity. The latter catalyses hypoxoside conversion to its cytotoxic <b>aglucone,</b> rooperol, which, when tested as a pure chemical, caused 50 % inhibition of BL 6 melanoma cell growth at 10 μg/ml, Light and electron microscopy revealed that the cytotoxic effect of rooperol manifested as vacuolisation of the cytoplasm and formation of pores in the plasma membrane. Indications of apoptosis were also found. Pharmacokinetic studies on mice dosed intragastrically with hypoxoside showed that it was deconjugated by bacterial beta-glucosidase to form rooperol in the colon, Surprisingly, no hypoxoside or rooperol was detectable in the serum, Only phase II biotransformation products (sulphates and glucuronides) {{were present in the}} portal blood and bile, In contrast, however, in human serum after oral ingestion of hypoxoside, the metabolites can reach relatively high concentrations, Rooperol metabolites isolated from human urine were non-toxic for BL 6 melanoma cells in culture up to a concentration of 200 μg/ml. In the presence of betaglucuronidase, which released rooperol from the metabolites, 50 % growth inhibition was achieved at a 75 μg/ml metabolite concentration, The supernatant of a human melanoma homogenate could also cause deconjugation of the metabolites to form rooperol,It can be concluded from these findings that rooperol has promising properties as an oral prodrug for cancer therapy in humans given its complete first-pass metabolism into non-toxic conjugates which may be activated in tumours with high deconjugase activity, Rodent cancer models are, however, not applicable since rooperol metabolites are completely sequestered in the bile.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] To study the pharmacokinetic behaviour of hypoxoside taken orally by 24 patients with lung cancer. Design. Randomised open study with three single doses of 1 600, 2 400 and 3 200 mg standardised Hypoxis plant extract (200 mg capsules) and a multiple-dose. study on the first 6 patients taking 4 capsules 3 times daily for 11 days. Participants and setting. Patients with histologically proven squamous, large-cell or adenocarcinoma were hospitalised at the Radiation Oncology Ward, Karl Bremer Hospital, Bellville, W Cape. Methods. Blood was drawn at regular intervals up to 75 hours after single doses and the concentrations of metabolites of the <b>aglucone</b> of hypoxoside, rooperol, were measured with a high-performance liquid chromatography method. For the multiple-dose study blood was drawn before the first dose each day. Concentration-time relationships were analysed according to a conventional single open-compartment model and also by using the NONMEM digital computer programme. Results. Neither hypoxoside nor rooperol appear in circulation. This is due to complete phase II biotransformation to diglucuronide, disulphate and mixed glucuronide-sulphate metabolites, of which the latter is the major component. Considerable interpatient variation in concentration-time relationships {{was found in the}} singledose studies. It was due to an active enterohepatic recirculation in some patients and a distinct lag phase in others together with zero-order rate of formation of rooperol in the colon. Computer modelling indicated a single open-compartment model in which the mass of the patient did not influence volume of distribution and clearance because formation of the metabolites is dependent on the metabolising capacity of the patient. However, the elimination of the metabolites follows first-order kinetics with half-lives ranging from 50 hours for the major metabolite to 20 hours for the two minor metabolites. Multiple-dose studies also showed large interpatient variation. Conclusion. In order to reach metabolite levels near 100 μg/ml, which {{have been shown to be}} tumouricidal after enzymatic deconjugation to rooperol, maintenance doses need to be individualised for each patient. For most patients, however, a daily dose of 2 400 mg was sufficient. Publisher’s versio...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic B-cells {{exposed in}} vivo or in vitro to {{streptozotocin}} (SZ), the N-nitrosourea derivative of glucosamide, present a long-lasting impairment {{in the production}} and release of insulin while other cell functions are better preserved. This functional impairment {{is associated with a}} defective mitochondrial function. To further study the mechanisms behind SZ actions, mouse pancreatic islets were exposed in vitro to SZ (1. 5 mM) or to different concentrations of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; 2, 4 and 6 mM). The effect of the <b>aglucone</b> moiety of SZ, nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU; 2, 4 and 6 mM) was also tested. Islets were either studied immediately after exposure to the drugs (day 0) or after six days in culture following toxin treatment (day 6). On day 0 the islets showed a decrease in the NAD + NADH content, decreased glucose oxidation rates and an impaired insulin release in response to glucose. Six days after exposure to SZ there was still impaired glucose oxidation and insulin release, and decreased islet insulin mRNA and insulin content, but the NAD + NADH content was again similar to the control group. On the other hand, islets which survived for 6 days in culture following exposure to either MMS or NMU were able to regain normal B-cell function. The mouse islets exposed to SZ, NMU and MMS showed on day 6 a 30 - 40 % decrease in the content of the mitochondrial DNA encoded cytochrome b mRNA and a 60 - 70 % decrease in total mitochondrial DNA, as evaluated by dot and Southern blot analysis. Only SZ decreased the insulin mRNA content whereas both MMS and NMU decreased the glucagon mRNA content. As a whole, the data obtained indicate that SZ, NMU and MMS induce damage to the mitochondrial genome, and this may contribute to the B-cell dysfunction observed after SZ treatment. It is conceivable that the glucose moiety of SZ may direct the methylation to other intracellular sites besides the mitochondrial DNA, thus explaining the different functional responses of islets following exposure to SZ and NMU.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of a proposed defense system in the Poaceae, consisting of glycosylated substrates being activated by β-glucosidase enzymes upon tissue rupture. The cyclic hydroxamic acids 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one (DIBOA) and 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxy- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one (DIMBOA) are secondary metabolites that occur in high abundance as glucosides in the Poaceae, among them the cereals maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale). Upon tissue disruption the hydroxamic acid glucoside is cleaved by β-glucosidase to release a toxic <b>aglucone</b> that is unstable and decomposes to the reactive benzoxazolinones. To protect the intact plant itself from the toxic products released by hydrolysis of the glucosides, the glucoside substrates and the enzyme need to be compartmentalized. In this study, the β-glucosidases in rye, wheat and maize seedlings are shown to {{be located in the}} epidermis and in cells associated with the vascular tissues. At the cellular level, β-glucosidase enzyme was located to plastids, cell walls and cytoplasm in all three species. To locate the hydroxamic acid glucoside substrates in rye, wheat and maize seedlings, tissue sections were stained with ferric chloride. In all three species staining was observed in the vascular bundles of shoots and coleoptiles, in the vascular cylinder in roots and in the outer cell layers of shoots, coleoptiles and roots. In order to characterize the enzymatic part of the defense system a rye β-glucosidase cDNA was isolated. It was identified as a gene for a plastid located β-glucosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 21) of glycoside hydrolase family 1. The sequence corresponding to the mature protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and compared to purified intracellular β-glucosidase of rye. The recombinant protein was found to be homologous to the intracellular rye enzyme. In addition a cell wall enzyme from rye has been purified and identified as a glucan 1, 3 -β-glucosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 58) of glycoside hydrolase family 3. Both the plastidic and the cell wall enzyme exhibited activity with DIBOA-glucoside and DIMBOA-glucoside as substrates and may therefore both be involved in the activation of the defense response...|$|E
40|$|Brassicaceous {{food crops}} contain in their tissues {{different}} quantities of the glucoside allelochemicals known as glucosinolates (Bellostas et al., 2004; Sørensen, 1990). These compounds are alkyl-N-hydroximine sulphate esters with a β-D-thioglucopyranoside group {{attached to the}} hydroximine carbon in Z-configuration relative to the sulphate group (Ettlinger and Kjær, 1968; Kjær, 1960). Glucosinolates are biosynthetically derived from amino acids (Hill et al., 2003) and they occur in all plants of the order Capparales and in some other plants (Bjerg and Sørensen, 1987; Kjær, 1960; Rodman, 1978). These compounds co-occur with myrosinase isoenzymes (Thioglucosidase; EC 3. 2. 1. 147), which catalyze the hydrolysis of the β-D-thioglucopyranoside bond releasing an <b>aglucone</b> that forms a variety of biologically active products with structures defined {{by the type of}} glucosinolate and the reaction conditions (Bjergegaard et al., 1994; Buskov et al., 2000 a; Buskov et al., 2000 b; Buskov et al., 2000 c; Palmieri et al., 1998). These breakdown products are chemically very reactive and they have for a long time been related to the pungent odour and flavour typical for Brassicaceous plants. These compounds show a various range of biological activities that goes from antinutritional (Bjerg et al., 1989; Hansen et al., 1997), to fungicidal, nematicidal and bactericidal (Brown and Morra, 1997; Buskov et al., 2002; Kirkegaard and Sarwar, 1998). In the last years, interest in their anticarcinogenic properties has increased and research has mainly focused on the effect of the isothiocyanates present in sprouts of certain Brassica food crops, especially broccoli (Zhang et al., 1992; Zhang, 2004). These isothiocyanates have been related to the increase in the activity of the Phase 2 enzymes, which is related to detoxification of xenobiotica and protection against cancer (Bonnesen et al., 1999). They have also been related to an increased antioxidative metabolism by induction of the scavenging of oxygen radicals, which may contribute to a decreased risk of coronary diseases (Wu et al., 2004). Given the biological effects of Brassica crops used for food, it was considered of interest to investigate the glucosinolate profile during early development of the Brassica plant {{in order to be able}} to determine the stages at which the desired biologically active compounds are present. It would also allow determining the presence of other potentially active compounds as well as to allow better understanding the metabolic changes occurring during germination and early growth. Five B. oleracea used for food (white cabbage, red cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and savoy cabbage) and two B. napus (a low and a high-glucosinolate rapeseeds) were used in the present experiments. The content of glucosinolates in seeds, seedlings and the individual parts of grown plants was followed from germination to one-month growth. Samples were taken at one, two, three, four, seven, 14, 21 and 28 days and plants were separated into cotyledons, leaves, epicotyle and roots. Glucosinolates were isolated and their concentration determined by HPLC following standard procedures developed at our laboratory...|$|E
