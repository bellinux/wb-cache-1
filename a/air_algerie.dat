2500|$|On 24 December 1994, at Houari Boumedienne Airport, Algiers, Algeria, four {{armed men}} dressed as Algerian presidential police boarded Air France Flight 8969 bound to depart for Orly Airport, Paris at 11:15am.

The Algerian military felt suspicion when it noticed that the Air France flight had {{what appeared to be}} an unauthorised delay, so members began surrounding the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled seeing a group of Special Intervention Group, known as [...] "ninjas," [...] outside the aircraft. Kakachi recalled hearing one of the [...] "police" [...] say [...] "taghut," [...] an Arabic word for [...] "infidel", upon seeing the [...] "ninjas" [...] gathering outside the A300; therefore, she discovered that they were terrorists. The four men revealed then that they were not police, but mujahideen seeking to establish an Islamic state in Algeria. The men hijacked the aircraft because, {{as a part of the}} national airline Air France, it was a symbol of France, which they viewed as infidel foreign invaders.|$|E
