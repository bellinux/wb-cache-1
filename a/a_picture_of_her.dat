5|$|Runnels {{debuted in}} the World Wrestling Federation at the Royal Rumble in 1996 as Marlena, a {{character}} modeled after Marlene Dietrich.

During a feud between Goldust and Triple H over the Intercontinental Championship, on February 16, 1997 at , Marlena was choked by Chyna, who debuted as a plant from a ringside seat and later became the bodyguard for Triple H.
