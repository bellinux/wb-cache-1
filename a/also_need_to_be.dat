This must be clearly labelled and may <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> colour coded to avoid inadvertent use as a breathing gas, which could be fatal as argon is an asphyxiant.|$|E
5|$|The Department for Transport (DfT) is {{currently}} investigating {{the possibility of}} extending the M54 westward to Shrewsbury, thereby placing the county town on the UK motorway map for the first time. Currently traffic has to continue onto the dual carriageway A5 when the M54 ends at Wellington although the road surface or speed limits do not change at all but the road. It is not motorway standard from the M54 J7 to the Shrewsbury ring road, because laybys {{would need to be}} removed and a hard shoulder would <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built which could cause delays to traffic.|$|E
5|$|Townsend {{subsequently}} then {{reported that}} he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength with support weapons—likely D445 Battalion—while the level of proficiency indicated that it might also include North Vietnamese Army (NVA) elements. However, due to earlier warnings that the Viet Cong were preparing to attack Nui Dat that evening, {{prior to the start}} of the operation Graham had ordered Townsend to return to base that afternoon, and this restriction remained extant. Likewise, with Operation Renmark scheduled to start the following morning, A Company 5 RAR—then at Dat Do protecting the artillery—would <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released before nightfall, adding to the requirement to conclude the operation that afternoon. Regardless, this restriction had only served to make B Company's task all the more difficult, with Mackay facing demands to complete the action while at the same time not become decisively engaged and unable to withdraw his company. At 16:17 Townsend was ordered to prepare his battalion for a helicopter extraction which was due to begin an hour later, while at 17:15 he was ordered to break contact immediately, however this proved impossible as 5 Platoon remained in heavy contact. Mackay now estimated that he would be unable to get forward to support the beleaguered platoon for a further 30 minutes; however, by 17:50 he realised that the Viet Cong had moved between them and A Company. Yet even while the Viet Cong continued to heavily engage both A and B Companies, the remainder of the Australian battalion and the APCs were beginning to line up on the landing zone in preparation for returning to Nui Dat. The order was finally rescinded when it became clear that both companies were unable to break-off the engagement. Meanwhile, a number of bush fires were now burning through the area, detonating discarded ammunition and adding to the noise of the battle.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} twenty years, {{substantial}} housing {{will need to be}} completed due to increased freshman enrollment and the deteriorated conditions of surrounding neighborhoods. By 2010, the university is currently planning to achieve 33% undergraduate housing, requiring the construction of an additional 2,500 units. By 2020, due to fast undergraduate growth, the university wants to raise the undergraduate housing percentage to at least 40%, requiring the construction of at least 2,800 additional units. The ratio of graduate students to graduate units in Cooperstown and Greg Page Apartments would <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> increased from 11% to 15%. The existing facilities would <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. By 2010, 350 new units would need to be constructed, followed by an additional 250 units by 2020.|$|E

25|$|The semidiurnal {{amplitude}} of terrestrial tides can reach about 55cm at the equator {{which is important}} in GPS, VLBI, and SLR measurements.

25|$|In general, it is {{the psychosocial}} model rather than, or in {{addition}} to, the dominant medical model, that is the underlying rationale for mental health social work. This may include a focus on social causation, labeling, critical theory and social constructivism.

25|$|Thermal {{control is}} {{maintained}} {{through the use}} of radiators, multi-layer insulation, and actively controlled heaters. The spacecraft must provide a benign environment for the instruments and on-board equipment. Two instruments, PFS and OMEGA, have infrared detectors that need to be kept at very low temperatures (about −180°C). The sensors on the camera (HRSC) <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kept cool. But the rest of the instruments and on-board equipment function best at room temperatures (10–20°C).|$|E
25|$|Metal pots {{are made}} from a narrow range of metals because pots and pans need to conduct heat well, but <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{chemically}} unreactive {{so that they do}} not alter the flavor of the food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more reactive metal, and then tinned or clad with another.|$|E

25|$|Because {{a maximum}} of five teams from one {{association}} can enter the UEFA Champions League, if both the Champions League title holders and the Europa League title holders are from the same top three ranked association and finish outside the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of their association will be moved to the Europa League and enter the group stage, which means changes to the access list of the Europa League may <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made.|$|E
25|$|Women {{suffering}} from anorgasmia with no obvious psychological cause {{would need to}} be examined by their GP to check for absence of disease. Blood tests would <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done (full blood count, liver function, oestradiol/estradiol, total testosterone, SHBG, FSH/LH, prolactin, thyroid function, lipids and fasting blood sugar) to check for other conditions such as diabetes, lack of ovulation, low thyroid function or hormone imbalances.
