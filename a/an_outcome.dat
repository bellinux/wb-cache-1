5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting <b>an</b> <b>outcome</b> of those processes in the future.|$|E

The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances <b>an</b> <b>outcome</b> other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that the}} natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

5|$|A {{challenge}} to world conscience {{was provided by}} an influential 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of conscience-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such <b>an</b> <b>outcome</b> is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation {{of the role of}} conscience in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as sustainability and sustainable development of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under United Nations treaties (see common heritage of humanity). Areas designated common heritage of humanity under international law include the Moon, Outer Space, deep sea bed, Antarctica, the world cultural and natural heritage (see World Heritage Convention) and the human genome. It will be a significant challenge for world conscience that as world oil, coal, mineral, timber, agricultural and water reserves are depleted, there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind areas.|$|E
5|$|At the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in 1990, {{under the}} Australian-sponsored Cambodian Peace Plan, {{representatives of the}} CGDK and the PRK agreed to a power-sharing {{arrangement}} by forming a unity government known as the Supreme National Council (SNC). The SNC's role was to represent Cambodian sovereignty on the international stage, while the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was tasked with supervising the country's domestic policies until a Cambodian government was elected by the people through a peaceful, democratic process. Cambodia's pathway to peace proved to be difficult, as Khmer Rouge leaders decided {{not to participate in}} the general elections, but instead they chose to disrupt the electoral process by launching military attacks on UN peacekeepers and killing ethnic Vietnamese migrants. In May 1993, Sihanouk's FUNCINPEC movement defeated the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), formerly the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), to win the general elections. However, the CPP leadership refused to accept defeat and they announced that the eastern provinces of Cambodia, where most of the CPP's votes were drawn from, would secede from Cambodia. To avoid such <b>an</b> <b>outcome,</b> Norodom Ranariddh, the leader of FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government with the CPP. Shortly afterwards, the constitutional monarchy was restored and the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the newly formed Cambodian Government.|$|E
50|$|Another {{factor that}} determines {{how much we}} use {{counterfactual}} thought is how close we were to <b>an</b> alternative <b>outcome.</b> This is especially true when there is <b>a</b> negative <b>outcome</b> that was this close to <b>a</b> positive <b>outcome.</b> For example, {{in a study by}} Meyers-Levy and Maheswaran, subjects were more likely to counterfactual think alternative circumstances for a target if his house burned down three days after he forgot to renew his insurance versus six months after he forgot to renew his insurance.

In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the Rive Gauche, which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde Mouvement Jariviste, <b>an</b> <b>outcome</b> which reportedly pleased him. In August 1960, one year after the Fifth Republic had been established by President Charles de Gaulle, French forces were confronting the Algerian rebels (see Algerian War). Together with Simone de Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras, Jérôme Lindon, Alain Robbe-Grillet and other intellectuals, he addressed Premier Michel Debré a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence. As a result, Minister of Culture André Malraux announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others might contribute, and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned French Broadcasting Service.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, the Perushim felt ready to attempt the {{building}} a larger synagogue on he-Hasid's original site. <b>An</b> <b>outcome</b> of the Crimean War was the British Government's {{willingness to use}} its increased influence at Constantinople to intervene on behalf of its Jewish subjects who resided in Jerusalem. On July 13, 1854, James Finn of the British consulate in Jerusalem wrote to the British ambassador in Constantinople describing {{the wishes of the}} 2,000 strong Ashkenazic community to build a new synagogue. He noted that funds for construction had been collected by Moses Montefiore twelve years earlier. He also enclosed a 150-year-old firman, which authorised the Ashkenazic Jews to rebuild their ruined synagogue. As the title to the plot of land was held by the Amzalag family, who were British subjects, they designated London-born Rabbi Hirschell, son of Chief Rabbi of Great Britain Solomon Hirschell, to negotiate the transfer. The British consulate agreed to lend its sanction to the contract in order to avoid possible intrusion by the Turks. At issue was {{the question of whether the}} building of a synagogue at the site constituted the repair of an old house of non-Muslim worship or the establishment of a new synagogue. The Turks would have to grant a special license for the latter. This was received through the efforts of Francis Napier and Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, British ambassadors to the Sublime Porte, who secured the necessary firman in 1854. In July 1855, while in Constantinople, Montefiore was handed the firman, which he hand-delivered during his fourth visit to Jerusalem in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Much of Suffolk's early {{activity}} in East Anglian local politics was probably at the instigation of his mother, Alice, {{and he would}} later spend as much {{of his adult life}} at her manor of Ewelme as he did at his own manors. Suffolk played a prominent role in Commissions of the Peace in Norfolk and Suffolk, and these became a permanent position from 1464. On at least two occasions, Suffolk attempted to affect the outcome of a local parliamentary election, and the appointment of the county sheriff. Furthermore, he was a justice of the peace in Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the later 1460s. He involved himself {{in some of the most}} controversial episodes in East Anglian society of the time, for instance, attempting to purchase part of the by-then somewhat infamous Fastolf inheritance in 1461. This was another occasion in fact where we may in fact see his mother's guiding hand at work, as she is known to have been canvassing for support at court for such <b>an</b> <b>outcome,</b> and even Margaret Paston believed her to be personally behind the attacks. Both of them were involved in a severe feud with the Paston family as a result of conflicting interests in the Fastolf inheritance. The duke also made other disputed (and in some cases outrightly illegal) claims to other properties in the region over the following decade, and in 1465, a group of his retainers destroyed the manor house of Hellesdon, ransacking its church. For these and other illegalities alleged by contemporaries, Suffolk escaped retribution, probably due to his royal connections. On the other hand, he was never able to use such connections to his advantage and persuade the king to intercede in any disputes on the duke's behalf.|$|E

5|$|The pope {{referred}} {{the dispute}} to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council {{decided that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River.

By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England– such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.|$|E

40|$|Aim Structural anal {{sphincter}} damage may be {{secondary to}} obstetric anal sphincter injury, perineal trauma or anorectal surgery. We reviewed {{the spectrum of}} anal sphincter injuries and their <b>outcomes</b> in <b>a</b> tertiary care colorectal unit. Methods Data of patients who underwent anal sphincter repair between 2004 and 2008 were analyzed retrospec-tively. Outcomes were compared with respect to etiology, type of repair, previous attempts at repair and manometry findings. Outcomes were defined as good or poor based on patient satisfaction as the primary criteria. Results Thirty-four patients underwent anal sphincter re-pair. Twenty-two injuries were obstetric, eight traumatic, and four iatrogenic. All patients underwent overlap sphinc-teroplasty with six additional anterior levatorplasty and seven graciloplasty. Twenty-three (67. 6 %) patients had <b>a</b> good <b>outcome</b> while nine (26. 4 %) had <b>a</b> poor <b>outcome.</b> All patients who had augmentation anterior levatorplasty had <b>a</b> good <b>outcome.</b> Fifty percent of patients with a previous sphincter repair and 42. 9 % requiring augmentation gracilo-plasty had <b>a</b> poor <b>outcome.</b> Median resting and squeeze anal pressures increased from 57. 5 to 70 cmH 2 O and 90. 25 to 111 cmH 2 O in those with <b>a</b> good <b>outcome.</b> Conclusions Overlap sphincteroplasty has <b>a</b> good <b>outcome</b> in majority of the patients with incontinence due to a structural sphincter defect. Additional anterior levatorplasty may improve outcomes. Previous failed repairs or use of a gracilis muscle augmentation may have <b>a</b> worse <b>outcome</b> secondary to poor native sphincter muscle.

40|$|BACKGROUND Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is frequently performed during follow-up {{in patients with}} known lumbar-disk herniation and persistent symptoms of sciatica. The association between findings on MRI and clinical outcome is controversial. METHODS We studied 283 patients in a randomized trial comparing surgery and prolonged conservative care for sciatica and lumbar-disk herniation. Patients underwent MRI at baseline and after 1 year. We used a 4 -point scale to assess disk herniation on MRI, ranging from 1 for "definitely present" to 4 for "definitely absent. " <b>A</b> favorable clinical <b>outcome</b> was defined as complete or nearly complete disappearance of symptoms at 1 year. We compared proportions of patients with <b>a</b> favorable <b>outcome</b> among those with a definite absence of disk herniation and those with a definite, probable, or possible presence of disk herniation at 1 year. The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve {{was used to assess}} the prognostic accuracy of the 4 -point scores regarding a favorable or unfavorable outcome, with 1 indicating perfect discriminatory value and 0. 5 or less indicating no discriminatory value. RESULTS At 1 year, 84 % of the patients reported having <b>a</b> favorable <b>outcome.</b> Disk herniation was visible in 35 % with <b>a</b> favorable <b>outcome</b> and in 33 % with <b>an</b> unfavorable <b>outcome</b> (P = 0. 70). <b>A</b> favorable <b>outcome</b> was reported in 85 % of patients with disk herniation and 83 % without disk herniation (P = 0. 70). MRI assessment of disk herniation did not distinguish between patients with <b>a</b> favorable <b>outcome</b> and those with <b>an</b> unfavorable <b>outcome</b> (area under ROC curve, 0. 48).
