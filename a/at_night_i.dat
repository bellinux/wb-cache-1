25|$|When Dr Johnson and I were by {{ourselves}} <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> observed of our host, aspectum generosum habet. Et generosum animum, he added. For {{fear of being}} overheard in the small Highland houses, I often talked to him in such Latin as I could speak, and with {{as much of the}} English accent as I could assume, {{so as not to be}} understood, in case our conversation should be too loud for the space.|$|E
500|$|Lydia {{discovered}} Zoe's true intentions for befriending her, {{and set out}} to take revenge. In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{feeling of}} melancholy, even of uneasiness, attends our first {{entrance}} {{into a great}} town, especially <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>Is</b> it that the sense of all this vast existence with which we have no connexion, where we are utterly unknown, oppresses us with our insignificance? Is it that it is terrible to feel friendless where all have friends? ...|$|R
6000|$|He went. But yet I {{felt more}} and more that his love must be dwindling to make him act as he did. I thought it all over wearily enough and asked myself whether I had done {{everything}} I should to hold my husband's love. I had kept him in <b>at</b> <b>nights.</b> <b>I</b> had cut down his smoking. I had stopped his playing cards. What more was there that I could do? ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the mid-1990s}} Beccy Cole and Gina Jeffreys were flatmates, while Mick Albeck and Rod McCormack were also flatmates. Cole {{was married to}} Albeck for one-and-a-half years (1998–99), writing songs as Rebecca Diane Albeck. The couple have a son. Not long after he was born their friends, Jeffreys and McCormack, married each other. Cole's second album, Wild at Heart, dealt with her divorce; the track [...] "Lazy Bones" [...] was written about Albeck and their short marriage. According to Albeck [...] "it was tough {{sometimes}} when we were touring together, living together, bringing up the baby together and having to be on stage together <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> guess I decided I didn't want the relationship anymore. That was pretty tough for Bec at the time".|$|E
2500|$|When Romanian Premier Alexandru Marghiloman {{traveled}} to Bessarabia to canvass for the unionist cause, {{he found the}} Peasant Faction divided between followers of Ion Inculeț, who endorsed the Romanian viewpoint, and deputies who sided with Tsyganko. Zamfirescu, who traveled with Marghiloman, recalls that Tsyganko [...] "thrice in one month" [...] attempted to recall the Republic's Directorate, his moves resisted by Inculeț. He also protested the selection of pro-Romanian students from Kiev and Odessa as representatives of the Transnistrian Moldavians, in which he saw efforts to shake {{the balance of power}} inside the Sfatul. Zamfirescu claims to have saved Tsyganko from an undisclosed mortal danger, and then to have conversed with him, trying to gain insight into his political motivations. The latter, he concluded, were [...] "most phantasmagorical socialist ideas", not dissuaded by the prospect of [...] "death, suffering, military disaster, sheer destitution, or degeneracy". He adds: [...] "It was late <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> was experiencing chills, and so I believe I have insulted the convictions of this visionary youth, reassuring him that all opinions lead to a ministerial chair, provided one makes sure to discard them on cue." ...|$|E

"Ah, you'll find {{it will be}} {{a capital}} thing <b>at</b> <b>nights.</b> <b>I</b> know she could never stand the exposure, and canvas don't keep out the rain well; so I thought of rigging up a large box, into which she can creep. I'll make air-holes in the roof that will let in air, but not water; and I'll caulk the seams with oakum, so as to keep it quite dry inside." ...|$|R
