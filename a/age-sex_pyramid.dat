40|$|Long-term {{demographic}} {{observations on}} a large-sized unit-group of chimpanzees in the Mahale Mountains, Tanzania, are summarized. The unit-group, the M group, contains over 100 individuals, {{which makes it}} the largest unit-group ever reported. The age-sex composition, natality, mortality and transfers of the M group are analyzed. An attempt is made to illustrate an <b>age-sex</b> <b>pyramid</b> of the group by estimating the ages of all the individuals in the group. The results reveal that: (1) the mortality rate of the male infants within 1 year almost doubled that of female infant; (2) adult male to adult female ratio of the M group is considerably higher than any other unit-groups elsewhere; and (3) the M group contains a relatively large number of old animals over 40 years of age, suggesting that the longevity of wild chimpanzees might be greater than estimated so far...|$|E
40|$|The {{demographic}} {{implications of}} socioeconomic transition are studied {{among the three}} subsistence categories of the Gangte, a little known tribe from northeast India. Reproductive histories of 444 evermarried women and other data on the 343 households from which these women were drawn were collected from 11 villages representing the 3 transitional groups. A trend of increasing household income and literacy of couples was observed from shifting cultivators to settled agriculturists to the town-dwelling Gangte. The effect of socioeconomic transition is also seen in the constriction {{at the base of}} the <b>age-sex</b> <b>pyramid</b> of the town dwellers compared with the other subsistence categories, suggesting a relatively lower proportion of children in the 0 - 5 -year-old age group. Although exogamy is practiced among all the subsistence categories, a considerably higher percentage of admixture with non-Gangte is observed among the town dwellers compared with the others. Overall infant and child mortality among the Gangte is low. However, variation exists among the three subsistence groups in the sense that a considerable reduction is seen from the traditional shifting cultivators to the urbanized town dwellers, reflecting better socioeconomic conditions and greater awareness and accessibility of the town dwellers to public health amenities. No consistent or perceptible trend is evident in mean number of live births. The genetic implications of this demographic transition are reflected in Crow’s indexes of selection...|$|E
5000|$|The {{total number}} of deaths {{attributable}} to the Emergency {{has been a source of}} dispute: Caroline Elkins claims it is [...] "tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands". Elkins numbers have been challenged by the British demographer John Blacker, who demonstrated in detail that her numbers were overestimated, explaining that Elkins' figure of 300,000 deaths [...] "implies that perhaps half of the adult male population would have been wiped out—yet the censuses of 1962 and 1969 show no evidence of this—the <b>age-sex</b> <b>pyramids</b> for the Kikuyu districts do not even show indentations." ...|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{population}} scenarios, these cover years (2015 – 2020) when several {{countries in the}} Mediterranean region are going {{through a period of}} political and social transition of which the outcome is yet uncertain. We assumed that by 2025 this transition will have been completed resulting in a new status quo which does not lead to major shifts in demographic behaviour. However, is this reasonable to assume? What would happen in terms of demographic behaviour if Arab Spring-related protests would lead to the establishment of anti-western, conservative governments in these four countries? Can the presented population scenarios encompass working-age population growth trajectories emerging out of such kind of context? We think the answer is affirmative for the following reasons. The first and main reason is that the ‘population momentum’ embedded in <b>age-sex</b> <b>pyramids</b> in base year 2015 leaves little room for effects of changes in, say, fertility and mortality, due to a political reorientation between 2015 and 2035. For instance, regarding the impact on the working-age population, change of fertility rates during the period 2015 – 2025 will only become visible after 2035. The second reason is that effects of changes in fertility and mortality are attenuated because to some extent they cancel out such {{as in the case of}} higher fertility rates and lower life expectancies.|$|R
40|$|It was focuse on the ageing {{process in}} Brazil, giving {{evidence}} of the boom of elderly people in the country, bearing in mind {{that by the year}} 2025 they will represent the 6 th largest elderly population in the world. Data are presented showing that both Infant Mortality Rates and Fertility Rates have been decreasing significantly for the whole population since 1940 and 1960 respectively. <b>Age-sex</b> <b>pyramids</b> are analysed {{in the light of the}} demographic changes. It is stressed that the elderly have been the fastest growing age-group in Brazil since 1940. In fact, from 1980 up to the year 2000, the over- 60 s will increase 107 % whereas the under 15 s will increase only 14 %. Comparing the rates of growth for the elderly populations in England and Brazil, the tendency is to have a decreasing rate of growth in England (230 % between 1900 - 1960 and 80 % between 1960 - 2025) and an increasing rate of growth in Brazil (497 % and 917 % respectively). Life tables are presented from 1950 to 1982 for the population of S. Paulo (a highly industrialised urban area). Life Expectancy, Survival, and Mortality Rate curves are generated from these life tables. The data show that the expectation of life at birth in S. Paulo State (Brazil) has risen from 57 years in the 50 's, to 70 years in 1982. Interestingly enough, in that year, a woman in the county of S. Paulo, after the age of 45, could already expect to live more than women of the same age in England. In terms of survival chances, 77 % of the cohort of women born in the county of S. Paulo in 1982 are expected to be alive at the age of 65, compared to 85 % in England. Figures for men are 62 % and 75 % respectively. It was concluded that although far from solving the problems related to the very young, the Brazilian authorities are already facing an ageing process comparable to that experienced by the developed countries, with all its implications for the health and social care systems. São apresentados dados mostrando que tanto as taxas de mortalidade quanto as de fecundidade estão decaindo significativamente para a população brasileira, como um todo, desde 1940 e 1960, respectivamente. Pirâmides etárias por sexo são analisadas à luz das mudanças demográficas. Enfatiza-se o fato de que, desde 1940, é o grupo etário com 60 anos ou mais o que proporcionalmente mais cresce na população brasileira. De 1980 ao ano 2000 eles crescerão 107 %, enquanto os menores de 15 anos crescerão apenas 14 %. Comparando-se as taxas de crescimento dos idosos no Brasil e na Inglaterra, a tendência é haver um crescimento cada vez menor na Inglaterra (230 % entre 1900 - 1960 e 80 % entre 1960 - 2025) e um crescimento cada vez maior no Brasil (497 % e 917 % respectivamente). Os dados mostram que a expectativa de vida ao nascimento no Estado de São Paulo passou de 57 anos, em 1950, para 70 anos, em 1982. Já em 1982, uma mulher no Município de São Paulo podia aos 45 anos esperar viver mais do que uma mulher da mesma idade na Inglaterra. Em termos de sobrevida, 77 % da coorte de mulheres nascidas no Município de São Paulo, em 1982 deverão estar vivas aos 65 anos, comparado com 85 % na Inglaterra. Para os homens os dados são de 62 % e 75 %, respectivamente. Conclui-se que o Brasil, embora ainda longe de resolver os problemas relacionados à infância, já está tendo que enfrentar as implicações sociais e de saúde decorrentes de um processo de envelhecimento comparável àquele experimentado pelos países mais desenvolvidos...|$|R
