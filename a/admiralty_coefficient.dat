A Mechanical Engineering department project {{in which the}} VAX/VMS system was utilized to create an interactive menu driven program to solve basic preliminary ship design problems. Enhancement of an existing program was initiated to improve the user interface by adding user friendly help information. Also, routines were written to calculate propulsive power requirements based upon the ship forms coefficients selected and comparisons made using the Method of Silverleaf and Dawson and the <b>Admiralty</b> <b>Coefficient</b> prediction method. Further computational routines were added to predict range and endurance figures for estimated voyage data and selected propulsion plant types, using the U. S. Navy Design Data Sheet DDS 9400 - 1 methodology. Finally, the detailed printed report generated by the system was updated to include reports of these calculations for the users design studyA Mechanical Engineering Department project in which the VAX/VMS system was utilized to create an interactive menu driven program to solve basic preliminary ship design problems.
