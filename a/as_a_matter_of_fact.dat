This matter includes stars, which produce {{nearly all of}} the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media, planets, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.|$|E

25|$|Hieroglyphs are {{ubiquitous}} {{and were}} written on every available surface, including the human body.

25|$|However, in 1884, the {{conflict}} between the Progressives and the Sadaes intensified. When American legation officials, particularly Naval Attaché George C.

The Americans attempted to bring the two groups to peace with each other in order to aid the Queen Consort in a peaceful transformation of Joseon into a modern nation. After all, she liked the ideas and plans of both parties. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> she was in support of many of the Progressive's ideas, except for severing relations with China.|$|E

5000|$|Judgment {{notwithstanding}} the verdict, also called judgment non obstante veredicto, or JNOV, {{is a type}} <b>of</b> judgment <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law (JMOL) that is sometimes rendered {{at the conclusion of}} a jury trial.

25|$|The {{larger context}} in which Wittgenstein's {{philosophy}} is seen to develop considers his uncompromising opposition to essences, mental entities {{and other forms of}} idealism which were accepted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in continental philosophy {{at the turn of the}} preceding century. In his view, the main cause for such errors is language and its uncritical use. In the received view, concepts, categories or classes are taken to rely on necessary features common to all items covered by them. Abstraction is the procedure which acknowledges this necessity and derives essences, but in the absence of a single common feature, it is bound to fail.|$|E
25|$|The {{relatively}} unsophisticated and ad-hoc {{nature of}} sessions {{is due to}} the fact they weren't part of the initial design, and had to be developed, with minimal disruption to the main line, by a third party (Citrix Systems) as a prerequisite for their terminal server product for Windows NT, called WinFrame. Starting with Windows Vista, though, sessions finally became a proper aspect of the Windows architecture. No longer a memory manager construct that creeps into user mode indirectly through Win32, they were expanded into a pervasive abstraction affecting most Executive subsystems. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> regular use of Windows Vista always results in a multi-session environment.|$|E

25|$|Because {{there is}} no {{reference}} in any source prior to this work to this figure named Pharamond, who is placed prior to Chlodio (that is, before ca. 428), scholars consider him a legendary rather than historical figure. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in several sources, for example Gregory of Tours, multiple kings are attested to rule simultaneously in later times. It is thus a dubious matter to assume that, even if Pharamond existed, he was ever recognized as sole king. The first king of the Franks {{who may have been}} close to this position was Clovis I, but after his death his empire was divided again amongst his sons, who ruled again simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|One other {{note about}} ABC {{baseball}} coverage during this period. Despite temporarily losing the Game of the Week package in 1961, ABC still televised several games {{in prime time}} (with Jack Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60. As with all Major League Baseball games in those days, the action was totally blacked out of major league markets. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> as documented in the HBO film 61*, the Maris family was welcomed into ABC's Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KMBC-TV so they could watch the in-house feed of the game, which was blacked out of Kansas City.|$|E
25|$|This was not Cornell University's first {{venture into}} forestry. Almost forty years earlier, under the 1862 Morrill Land Grant Act, the Federal land grant scrip for New York state of 989,920 acres {{was given to}} Cornell to the later chagrin of the {{trustees}} of Syracuse and New York Universities. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> Genesee College, the forerunner of Syracuse University, accepted $25,000 from Ezra Cornell to drop its opposition to the proceeds from the Morrill Land grant going to Cornell University. Ezra Cornell, under advice from lumberman trustee Henry W. Sage, wisely parlayed the grant into ownership of Wisconsin pine lands that he held until the wanton logging was diminished and the price for lumber increased, providing a substantial endowment for the university.|$|E

25|$|The Muslim {{community}} did not lag behind, {{the faith}} spread. The central mosque was built about 1930 and thereafter, {{a number of}} mosques were built in Idemo, Umayo, Isato (Irona), Ogbonado, Okesa, Oke-Ila etc. The Ansar-Ud-Deen emerged in the early 1940s. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> the number of mosques {{and the number of}} Muslims who have performed the Hajj can readily come to hand as indices of expansion. The number of mosques increased substantially with the growing number of well-to-do Muslim who build mosques as annexes to their private homes; by the year 2000, more than forty mosques could be counted in the city. By 1960, only Alhaji Akorede had performed the Hajj but the number of Alhajs increased in the 1970s and steadily increased in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|If the Republic {{had been}} a Monarchy, or if the office of stadtholder had already been {{hereditary}} (as it was to become after the Orangist amendments of 1747) the posthumous child would no doubt have been acclaimed stadtholder automatically, and a Regency would have been put into place, as happened in 1751, when three-year-old William V succeeded his deceased father in office in all seven provinces. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> this was proposed by the Orangist faction in the Republic, and especially by Willem Frederik, who proposed himself {{in the role of}} Lieutenant-Stadtholder in the five provinces in which he was not already stadtholder in his own right, until baby William would come of age. But this proposal elicited little enthusiasm from the Holland regents, who still vividly remembered his role in the recent coup.|$|E
25|$|In the Mediterranean {{a kind of}} {{division}} of labor between the English and Dutch came into being after the war: the English were the main customers for olive oil and currants, and the Navigation Act therefore helped them to monopolize this trade. On the other hand, the Dutch monopolized the trade in spices and fine-cloth (the English being left with the trade in lower-value textiles). The English were the major buyers of Italian raw silk, whereas this trade was for the Dutch marginal in comparison with their Asian and Persian silk trade. Generally, the Dutch had a favorable balance of trade with this area (and the English a negative one), because the Dutch dominated more trades (like that in Baltic naval stores and salt) and more profitable ones. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> {{the total value of}} the Mediterranean and Levant trade to the Dutch was about equal to that of the Far-Eastern trade of the VOC, both bringing in about 20 million guilders annually.|$|E

25|$|I am {{unable to}} state with {{certainty}} what language the Pelasgians spoke, but we could consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia {{in the city of}} Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the office of}} stadtholder was indispensable, the States of the five provinces with a vacancy could and would have {{appointed}} a successor, though not necessarily someone from the Nassau families. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> there were the precedents of Willem IV van den Bergh and Adolf van Nieuwenaar in Gelderland in early Republican times. But the Holland regents did not feel a pressing need to appoint anyone, especially in view of recent events. They acted very quickly to undo the effects of William's coup, freeing the captive regents and reinstating them in their offices. The Gecommitteerde Raden (executive committee) of the States of Holland moved immediately to reassert their authority over the army and convened a plenary session of the States. Next Holland proposed in the States General that a so-called Great Assembly (a kind of constitutional convention) should be convened at short notice, to amend the Union of Utrecht.|$|E
25|$|These {{dates are}} {{important}} as they help to save Chichele from the charge, versified by Shakespeare (Henry V. act 1. sc. 2) from Hall's Chronicle, of having tempted Henry V into {{the conquest of}} France {{for the sake of}} diverting parliament from the disendowment of the Church. There is no contemporary authority for the charge, which seems to appear first in Redman's rhetorical history of Henry V, written in 1540 with an eye to the political situation at that time, <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> the parliament at Leicester, in which the speeches were supposed to have been made, began on 30 April 1414 before Chichele was archbishop. The rolls of parliament show that he was not present in the parliament at all. Moreover, parliament was so far from pressing disendowment that on the petition of the House of Commons it passed a savage act against the heresies commonly called Lollardry which aimed at the destruction of the king and all temporal estates, making Lollards felons and ordering every justice of the peace to hunt down their schools, conventicles, congregations and confederacies.|$|E
