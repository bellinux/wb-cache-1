500|$|Quinn's role as head {{cheerleader}} {{is central}} to understanding her character. Agron {{said that she had}} never had any prior cheer experience before the Pilot. [...] "If I had been , I would've ended up on crutches," [...] she told Emmy magazine. In an interview with HitFix she said, [...] "I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone said {{a number}} of Cartman's {{characteristics}} which have endured throughout the South Park series started in [...] "Damien". Specifically, his voice took on a higher-pitch that was more nasally and whiney than in previous episodes; Stone {{described it as a}} [...] "self-indulgent accent". Some of his regular vocal mannerisms were also developed in the episode, including his use of the sound [...] "Nyah" [...] while saying the word [...] "Here", and the way he says [...] "Hey you guuuuuuys" [...] while talking to his friends. Parker, who provides the voice of Cartman, said the characteristics came about naturally while filming the episode: [...] "This show for some reason, for whatever reason, maybe I just lost interest, but I was trying all these messed up things with him <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> sort of stuck." ...|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique also {{discussed}} using a limited palette of colors, {{an approach that}} started with Aronofsky's Pi and continued with Requiem for a Dream. In The Fountain, the primary colors are gold and white. Gold represents [...] "the Mayans, a sort of fool's gold, a false truth"; Aronofsky explained the choice, [...] "When you see gold, it represents materialism and wealth <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> that distract us from the true journey that we're on." [...] White was chosen to represent mortality and truth. Weisz's characters are white, and wear white or are enveloped in white light to accentuate this presentation. Secondary colors are green, representing the color of life, and red, representing death. The director also used similar geometric constructs in the film to distinguish the three storylines. The 16th century conquistador's tale reflected triangles through pyramids and constellations, the 21st century researcher's period reflected rectangles through doors, windows, and computer screens, and the 26th century contemplative's journey reflected circles and spheres through the spacecraft and stellar bodies.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his defeat, Wallace adopted a hard-line segregationist stance and used this stand to court the white vote in the next gubernatorial {{election}} in 1962. When a supporter asked why he started using racist messages, Wallace replied, [...] "You know, I tried to talk about good roads and good schools <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> that have been part of my career, and nobody listened. And then I began talking about niggers, and they stomped the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Atwater: You {{start out}} in 1954 by saying, [...] "Nigger, nigger, nigger". By 1968 you can't say [...] "nigger"—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights {{and all that}} stuff. You're getting so {{abstract}} now [...] you're talking about cutting taxes, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [...] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe {{that is part of}} it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, [...] "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and {{a hell of a lot}} more abstract than [...] "Nigger, nigger".|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Keith Wallen and bassist Aaron Bruch {{performed}} all of {{the background}} vocals on Dark Before Dawn, unlike previous albums on which Burnley performed his own. Burnley stated that background vocals were worked on the most in regard to producing, elaborating on That Metal Show, [...] "Because, guitars are guitars, you know, I mean, what are you gonna do, you can tune them <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> but singing is a totally different animal so that's where {{we spent a lot}} of time. Because when you're playing guitar you can kinda let your style come through, but if you're singing [...] somebody you kind of have to sound like them for it to really gel, so they really altered, I guess their personality." [...] Bruch added, [...] "It's things like inflection, and vibrato, and making sure you bring it the same." ...|$|E

6000|$|The art of costuming was by {{no means}} so well {{understood}} in those days as it has been since, and mine was out of all correctness.

Hitherto, she had always looked to her cousin for sympathy, for understanding, for loyal support.
