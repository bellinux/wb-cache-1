5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time in}} casual settings <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E

25|$|Kirwan {{was born}} in Brixton, South London, and his guitar skills started {{attracting}} attention at an early age. He was still only 17 {{when he came to}} the attention of established British blues band Fleetwood Mac, while he was playing in London with his first band Boilerhouse, with Trevor Stevens on bass guitar and Dave Terrey on drums. He persuaded Mac's producer Mike Vernon to go and watch Boilerhouse rehearse (in a South London basement boiler-room), and Vernon then informed Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green of his discovery.

25|$|The MCC touring team left Tilbury Docks on the S.S. Stratheden amidst {{calls to}} cancel the Ashes tour because of the {{weakness}} of the team led by Freddie Brown. Such critics were, of course, ignored and the team traveled in first-class luxury on the P liner. Though it took several weeks for them to reach Fremantle in Western Australia this method avoided jet lag and allowed the team to relax <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> each other. The teenager Brian Close had been excused from National Service in the British Army and was particularly active in exploring the whole ship from top to bottom. Apart from the normal deck exercises some of the MCC players formed a short lived band and Godfrey Evans gave his well-known impression of Carmen Miranda in the fancy dress party. They stopped in Ceylon for a one-day game which was drawn, but saw Arthur Macintyre make 104 and Len Hutton damage one of his fingers. They otherwise arrived safely and found that steak and fried eggs were regularly served in Australian hotels (virtually unobtainable in ration-bound Britain) and soon put on weight.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about getting [...] "the rules {{straight}} on a budding relationship: Slow down and don't say you love me until you give me some time <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> me." [...] According to musicologist Jon Mikkel Broch Ålvik, [...] "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] is the [...] "thinking person's teen pop." [...] Ålvik rejects a superficial interpretation that the lyrics are a [...] "moralistic message of abstinence", arguing instead that M2M [...] "signal a stance that sounds considered and assured rather than prudish" [...] and that {{the song is}} a statement of [...] "burgeoning agency." [...] The song {{has been described as}} bubblegum pop music with similar lyrical qualities to songs by girl groups of the 1960s, while also having more influence from rock and singer-songwriter genres than was typical for other teen pop songs of the late 1990s.|$|E

During this time he began writing poems and produced many verse translations. However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in 1727. When Boswell was writing his Life of Samuel Johnson, he was told by Johnson's school friend Edmund Hector Johnson's leaving the Stourbridge school was due in part to a fight Johnson and Wentworth had over Latin grammar. For companionship, Johnson spent time with Hector and John Taylor, two of his schoolfriends, and he soon fell in love with Hector's younger sister, Ann. This first love was not to last, and Johnson later claimed to Boswell, [...] "She was the first woman with whom I was in love.

Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking {{a turning point for}} future development of The Walking Dead. [...] "Dale's character has been {{the heart and soul of}} the show," [...] he iterated. [...] "He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world change you and monitoring what lengths people are going to survive. His loss is going to mean a great deal for all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot." [...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show.

2500|$|While Tyler herself {{does not}} {{like to think of}} her novels in terms of themes, {{numerous}} reviewers and scholars have noted the importance of family and marriage relationships to her characters and stories. Liesl Schillinger summarized: “Taken together, the distinct but overlapping worlds of her novels have formed a Sensurround literary record of the 20th century American family—or, at least, of the proud but troubled archetypal families that…interested her most." [...] Michiko Kakutani, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for The New York Times, has been reviewing Tyler novels for over 25 years. [...] She has frequently noted Tyler’s themes with regard to family and marriage. [...] Reviewing Noah's Compass, Kakutani states that “the central concern of most of this author’s characters has always been their need to define themselves in terms of family — {{the degree to which they}} see themselves as creatures shaped by genetics, childhood memories and parental and spousal expectations, and the degree to which they are driven to embrace independent identities of their own.”.
