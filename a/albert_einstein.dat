5|$|Some critics, however, responded {{favorably to}} Eureka.

40|$|This is a {{contemporary}} {{review of the}} involvement of Mileva Maric, <b>Albert</b> <b>Einsteins</b> first wife, in his theoretical work between the period of 1900 to 1905. Separate biographies are outlined for both Mileva and Einstein, prior to their attendance at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich in 1896. Then, a combined journal is described, detailing significant events. In additional to a biographical sketch, comments by various authors are compared and contrasted concerning two narratives: firstly, {{the sequence of events}} that happened and the couples relationship at particular times. Secondly, the contents of letters from both Einstein and Mileva. Some interpretations of the usage of pronouns in those letters during 1899 and 1905 are re-examined, and a different hypothesis regarding the usage of those pronouns is introduced. Various papers are examined and the content of each subsequent paper is compared to the work that Mileva was performing. With a different take, this treatment further suggests that the couple continued to work together much longer than other authors have indicated. We also evaluate critics and supporters of the hypothesis that Mileva was involved in Einsteins work, and refocus this within a historical context, in terms of women in science in the late 19 th century. Finally, the definition of, collaboration (co-authorship, specifically) is outlined. As a result, recommendations are stated, the first of which is that Mileva should be seriously considered as an honorary co-author of one, possibly two, papers, and secondly, of which it is recommended that a serious inquiry should be made, concerning the extent of Mileva Marićs involvement in <b>Albert</b> <b>Einsteins</b> published works between 1902 and 1905.
