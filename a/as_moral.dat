5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, <b>as</b> <b>moral</b> laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} clarify {{and defend the}} {{proposition}} that moral realism is best elaborated <b>as</b> a <b>moral</b> doctrine. I begin by upholding Ronald Dworkin’s anti-Archimedean critique of the error theory against some strictures by Michael Smith, and I then briefly suggest how a proponent of <b>moral</b> realism <b>as</b> a <b>moral</b> doctrine would respond to Smith’s defense of the Archimedeanism of expressivism. Thereafter, this paper moves to its chief endeavor. By differentiating clearly between expressivism and quasi-realism (or <b>moral</b> realism <b>as</b> a <b>moral</b> doctrine), the paper highlights both their distinctness and their compatibility. In so doing, it underscores the affinities between Blackburnian quasi-realism and <b>moral</b> realism <b>as</b> a <b>moral</b> doctrine. Finally, this paper contends ─ in line with my earlier work on these matters ─ that <b>moral</b> realism <b>as</b> a <b>moral</b> doctrine {{points to the need}} for some reorienting of meta-ethical enquiries rather than for the abandoning of them...|$|R
5|$|BioShock {{is set in}} 1960. The player {{guides the}} protagonist, Jack, after his {{airplane}} crashes in the ocean near the bathysphere terminus {{that leads to the}} underwater city of Rapture. Built by the business magnate Andrew Ryan, the city was intended to be an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a genetic material which can be used to grant superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries {{to find a way to}} escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies, and the iconic, deadly Big Daddies, while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, is able to defeat foes in a number of ways by using weapons, utilizing plasmids that give unique powers, and by turning Rapture's own defenses against them. BioShock includes elements of role-playing games, giving the player different approaches in engaging enemies such as by stealth, as well <b>as</b> <b>moral</b> choices of saving or killing characters; additionally, the game and biopunk theme borrow concepts from the survival horror genre.|$|E
5|$|In 1541 the Congregation elected Vermigli to the {{important}} post of prior of Basilica of San Frediano in Lucca. The prior at San Frediano exercised some episcopal authority {{over half the}} city, as well as control of the Lateran's religious houses. As at his earlier post in Spoleto, the monks of the San Frediano monastery {{as well as the}} clergy of Lucca were known for moral laxity, which led to an openness to the new Lutheran religion there. Vermigli saw his task as one of education as well <b>as</b> <b>moral</b> correction. He set up a college based on humanist principles of education and modeled on the newly founded St John's College, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Instruction was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Among the professors were the humanists Immanuel Tremellius, Paolo Lacizi, Celio Secondo Curione, and Girolamo Zanchi, all of whom would later convert to Protestantism. The Congregation recognized Vermigli's work by appointing him to a disciplinary commission of seven canons in May 1542.|$|E

The moral guardianship gatherings would often use outlandish behavior in the ostracizing of individuals in order to highlight the severity of the offense and to prevent other people from intervening in the punishment. The practices differed in the various communities and are called fombuen or keluh in Kedjom Keku communities, anlu in Kom communities, and ndofoumbgui in the Aghem tribe.|$|E
