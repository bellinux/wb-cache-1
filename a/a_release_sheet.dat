Executives at Enron used accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and misleading financial reporting to hide billions in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Andersen to ignore the issues.

The three-dimensional structure of the S layer was reconstructed from tilted micrographs of the <b>released</b> <b>sheets.</b> Horizontal sections through this reconstruction showed that the <b>released</b> <b>sheets</b> were composed of two identical S layers that were perfectly in register. The reconstructed layer had a lattice constant of 12. 5 nm. At a resolution of 1. 6 nm, the layer consisted of a major tetragon at one fourfold axis of symmetry and a minor tetragon at the second fourfold axis of symmetry. The core, composed of four of the major domains, contained a large depression and was located toward the inside of the layer. The minor tetragon provided connectivity within the layer and was located toward the outer surface of the layer. Projections through the double layer gave a type I (closed) pattern (M. Stewart, T. J. Beveridge, and T. J. Trust, J. Bacteriol. 166 : 120 - 127, 1986), yet projections through the single layer indicated that the type II (open) pattern was present.
