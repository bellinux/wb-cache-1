5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a large}} {{difference}} between {{the numbers of people}} whose native language is Russian and people who adopted Russian as their everyday communication language. <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> keep in mind is that the percentage of Russian-speaking citizens is significantly higher in cities than in rural areas across the whole country.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> mention about Han's {{studies is}} that she uses a rather small number of {{participants}} and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in France or Ho Chi Minh City).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Another</b> {{interesting}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> note is {{that track}} {{one on the}} album- [...] "Manifestation Of The New Armies"- is misspelled as [...] "Mannifestation".|$|R

6000|$|... "But how are {{you going}} to do that?" [...] the prince asked in surprise. [...] "It is one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> slip out of the hands of Alva's minions as you did at Brussels, but <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> {{altogether}} <b>to</b> get two women out of prison." ...|$|R
25|$|In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} {{film version of}} The Lord of the Rings, the Nazgûl hack and slash the Hobbits' beds at The Prancing Pony inn themselves. In the book, the assailants are not precisely identified, but Tolkien implies that the attack {{was carried out by}} agents of the Nazgûl, possibly including one Bill Ferny, rather than the Nazgûl themselves (though they were present in the town). <b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> note is that after the beds are destroyed, the Ringwraths remove their hoods, revealing hideous black masks and the armour they wear beneath their cloaks. They remain unhooded, but masked, throughout the remainder of the film.|$|E
25|$|It is {{one thing}} to impose a tax {{dependent}} upon the conduct of the taxpayers, or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. … It is quite <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say that a tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.|$|E
500|$|Josef Zankowicz, {{who managed}} the firm's {{publicity}} during this period, later commented: [...] "We {{had the feeling}} that we might get sued—actually, we prayed to get sued. Because by suing us, the number one player in the marketplace opened up the door. Anyone can create an interesting product, spend $10 million and create awareness of it. But it's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> create a product and spend one-tenth that amount and create twice as much awareness." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brust {{does not}} have nicknames for collaborations {{out of respect for}} his collaborators, stating [...] "It's one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> not want to take myself seriously, and <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to—I want <b>to</b> take them seriously." ...|$|R
60|$|But a woman {{finds it}} one <b>thing</b> not <b>to</b> desire affection and <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> not <b>to</b> possess it. Day by day the {{atmosphere}} of the fine house in Bloomsbury grows cold and colder about her heart. Guests warm it at times for a few hours, then depart, leaving it chillier than before.|$|R

500|$|To promote Beyond the Sea, Spacey and Phil Ramone {{devised a}} 12-city United States concert tour titled An Evening Celebrating the Music of Bobby Darin, which {{consisted}} of Spacey performing with a 19-piece band. [...] "It's me singing Bobby and talking about Bobby and talking {{a little bit about}} the movie," [...] Spacey explained in June 2004. Spacey dressed in costumes from the movie for the tour, which started in San Francisco and traveled through Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Miami and Atlantic City before ending in the Wayne Newton Theatre at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Spacey's performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004 received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, [...] "It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad is one thing, but it's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> go out and attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin's got a lot of courage. I think he sounds good." [...] The film was shown and promoted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2004.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{influence}} has reached beyond jazz, as musicians of such genres as rock and classical {{have been influenced}} by it, while critics have written about it {{as one of the most}} influential albums of all time. Many improvisatory rock musicians of the 1960s referred to Kind of Blue for inspiration, along with other Davis albums, as well as Coltrane's modal records My Favorite Things (1961) and A Love Supreme (1965). Guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band said his soloing on songs such as [...] "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" [...] "comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue. I've listened to that album so many times that for the past couple of years, I haven't hardly listened to anything else." [...] Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright said that the chord progressions on the album influenced the structure of the introductory chords to the song [...] "Breathe" [...] on their landmark opus The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). In his book Kind of Blue: The Making of a Miles Davis Masterpiece, writer Ashley Kahn wrote [...] "still acknowledged as the height of hip, four decades after it was recorded, Kind of Blue is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapory piano introduction is universally recognized". [...] Producer Quincy Jones, one of Davis' longtime friends, wrote: [...] "That [...] will always be my music, man. I play Kind of Blue every day—it's my orange juice. It still sounds like it was made yesterday". Pianist Chick Corea, one of Miles' acolytes, was also struck by its majesty, later stating [...] "It's one thing to just play a tune, or play a program of music, but it's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> practically create a new language of music, which is what Kind of Blue did." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{notice is}} the sets O(n'c) and O(c'n) are very different. If c {{is greater than}} one, then the latter grows much faster. A {{function}} that grows faster than n'c for any c [...] is called superpolynomial. [...] One that grows more slowly than any exponential function of the form c'n is called subexponential. An algorithm can require time that is both superpolynomial and subexponential; examples of this include the fastest known algorithms for integer factorization and the function nlog n.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to {{the opinion}} of the media, Central Asia is only a tiny source of immigrants; out of 100,000 ethnic Uzbeks who arrived in Russia for work only 489 settled in Russia permanently. 50,000 [...] Russian {{speakers}} from Uzbekistan arrived in the Russian Federation to settle. The largest amount were ethnic Ukrainians – 700,000 people by a far majority. However they came because of the Ukraine crisis (<b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> note is that they were legal when an overwhelming majority come undocumented). 1.4 million ethnic Russians repatriated to their homeland in 2014, more than in previous years.|$|E
2500|$|... "A Visit at Loma Linda. Dear Readers, You have {{no doubt}} read of Loma Linda in some of our papers, but I do not know of any thing ever {{appearing}} in the MESSENGER concerning it. I might say, {{it is one thing}} to read about it, and <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> visit it, and to see for yourself. For three weeks it was my privilege to visit there. Loma Linda is certainly in keeping with what its name implies--Hill Beautiful. It is located in an ideal spot, and, in my opinion, is as pretty as pictured. To receive a training there must be deemed a privilege. The advantages and opportunities are excellent, and come up to one's expectations.|$|E
2500|$|Morrissey {{brought a}} {{political}} stance {{to many of}} his interviews, courting further controversy. Among his targets were the Thatcher government, the British monarchy, and the famine relief project Band Aid. Morrissey famously quipped of the last, [...] "One can have great concern {{for the people of}} Ethiopia, but it's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> inflict daily torture on the people of England" [...] ("torture" [...] being a reference to the music that resulted from the project). The subsequent single-only release [...] "Shakespeare's Sister" [...] reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart, although the only single taken from the album, [...] "That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore", was less successful, barely making the top 50.|$|E

50|$|Creationism (creacionismo) was a {{literary}} movement initiated by Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro around 1912. Creationism {{is based on}} the idea of a poem as a truly new thing, created by the author for the sake of itself - that is, not <b>to</b> praise <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> not <b>to</b> please the reader, not even to be understood by its own author.|$|R

The parents say there is <b>another</b> important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> tell, but they hesitate and do not tell it yet. Soon after this, Alex's parents die of carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} {{is that the}} motion of the Moon is not a perfect circle. [...] Its orbit is distinctly elliptic, so the lunar distance from Earth varies throughout the lunar cycle. This varying distance changes the apparent diameter of the Moon, and therefore influences the chances, duration, and type (partial, annular, total, mixed) of an eclipse. [...] This orbital period is called the anomalistic month, and together with the synodic month causes the so-called [...] "full moon cycle" [...] of about 14 lunations in the timings and appearances of full (and new) Moons. The Moon moves faster when it is closer to the Earth (near perigee) and slower when it is near apogee (furthest distance), thus periodically changing the timing of syzygies by up to ±14 hours (relative to their mean timing), and changing the apparent lunar angular diameter by about ±6%. [...] An eclipse cycle must comprise close to an integer number of anomalistic months in order to perform well in predicting eclipses.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with WWE Magazine, Vince McMahon discussed Benoit's legacy saying [...] "it's not right to pretend he didn't exist. It's {{one thing to}} include him {{as part of a}} historical perspective, which I believe is okay, and it's <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> promote him, which is not okay. The situation is very similar to that of O.J. Simpson despite his controversy, O.J. was still a part of the NFL scene. You can't deny that he existed." [...] In 2015, Benoit's name was mentioned as part of the WWE Network Monday Night Wars series that looks back at the fall of WCW. This marked the first time Benoit was mentioned by name on new WWE programming since 2007. The segment featured the 2000 invasion angle with Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn however when the footage was shown it focused more on the other three and less on Benoit.|$|E
2500|$|Flavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities , chapter 2 {{recorded}} {{the story of}} King Izates of Adiabene who decided to follow the Law of Moses at {{the advice of a}} Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it {{on the grounds that the}} subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such [...] "strange and foreign rites". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision (Robert Eisenman in James the Brother of Jesus claims that Ananias is Paul of Tarsus who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, [...] "a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.|$|E

2500|$|In 1911, {{he set out}} {{to build}} his first {{airplane}}, an airplane he named [...] "Silverwing". His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the [...] "aero special", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of [...] and 1,050rpm. Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a ground loop, which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna got a glimpse of hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, [...] "I'm going to fly this thing, then I'm going to set it afire and never have <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do with aeroplanes!". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a [...] "daring hero" [...] and nicknamed him the [...] "Birdman of Enid". Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly {{over the next several months}} until December 1911, when he made a successful [...] flight and a successful landing at the point of departure. He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland of the United States—between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
