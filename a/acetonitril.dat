Häufig finden sich Methoden eines „General Unknown Screenings“, die zwar einerseits eine gute Basis für Analysen darstellen, jedoch für eine zielführende Detektion vermuteter Substanzen weniger geeignet sind.

RP 105 and Oasis HLB polymeric sorbents were found to be the best of the tested sorbents for separation and preconcentration of phenolic compounds from plant material.

Linear calibration curves (r > 0, 99) with limits of detection (LODs) 0, 1 - 0, 5 ng were obtained for all analytes in the concentration ranges from units to 2600 ng.

To this purpose a spectral database was created to identify determined compounds. The spectral database was established under strictly defined separation conditions (identical mobile phase, column, flow rate and temperature) Long-term pigment and phenolics content changes of Norway spruce needles (Picea abies /L. / Karsten) and short-term pigment changes of content of a Bristlecone pine needles (Pinus aristata Engelman) were observed.

Unlike mammals, however, adaptive immunity in fish is dependent upon temperature, fish age or level of development.

For sample analysis a simple and rapid reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic method with UV detection at 332 nm was developed. The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol, <b>acetonitril</b> and potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (15 : 45 : 40 %v/v) set at flow rate of 1. 3 ml/min. Results: The run time for erlotinib hydrochloride was approximately 6 minutes. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 320 - 20000 ng/ml with acceptable intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 10 % and the accuracies of intra and inter-day assays were within the range of 97. 20 - 104. 83 % and 98. 8 - 102. 2 % respectively. Conclusion: Based on the obtained results, a simple, accurate and precise reversed-phase isocratic HPLC method with UV detection has been optimized and validated for the determination of erlotinib hydrochloride in biological samples...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a simple, rapid and {{sensitive}} reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for quantification of sirolimus (SRL) in pharmaceutical dosage forms. Methods: The chromatographic system employs isocratic elution using a Knauer- C 18, 5 mm, 4. 6 × 150 mm. Mobile phase consisting of <b>acetonitril</b> and ammonium acetate buffer set at flow rate 1. 5 ml/min. The analyte was detected and quantified at 278 nm using ultraviolet detector. The method was validated as per ICH guidelines. Results: The standard curve was found to have a linear relationship (r 2 > 0. 99) over the analytical range of 125 – 2000 ng/ml. For all quality control (QC) standards in intraday and interday assay, accuracy and precision range were - 0. 96 to 6. 30 and 0. 86 to 13. 74 respectively, demonstrating the precision and accuracy over the analytical range. Samples were stable during preparation and analysis procedure. Conclusion: Therefore the rapid and sensitive developed method can be used for the routine analysis of sirolimus such as dissolution and stability assays of pre- and post-marketed dosage forms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA simple, {{sensitive}} and rapid chromatographic method {{was developed and}} validated for the simultaneous quantification of atenolol and chlorthalidone in human plasma using hydrochlorothiazide as internal standard (IS). The method utilized proteins precipitation with <b>acetonitril</b> as the only sample preparation involved prior to reverse phase-HPLC. The analytes were chromatographed on Shim-pack cyanopropyl column with isocratic elution with 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 (pH 6. 0) – methanol (70 : 30, v/v) at ambient temperature with flow rate of 1 mLmin− 1 and UV detection at 225 nm. The chromatographic run time was less than 10 min for the mixture. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 0. 1 – 10 μgmL− 1. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, absolute recovery, freeze–thaw stability, bench-top stability and re-injection reproducibility. The within- and between-day accuracy and precision {{were found to be}} within acceptable limits < 15 %. The analytes were stable after three freeze–thaw cycles (deviation < 15 %). The proposed method was specific for the simultaneous determination of atenolol and chlorthalidone in human plasma where there was no interference from endogenous biological substances...|$|E

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) {{was used for}} determination. During searching several various columns and mobile phases were tested. For validation of separation conditions Ascentis Express F 5 column (100 x 4, 6 mm, 2, 7 μm) was used. Detection was measured at a wavelength of 500 nm and 426 nm. Separation used gradient elution with mobile phase of acetonitrile - water at a flow rate 1 ml/min. Injection volume was set to 5 μl.

40|$|The {{application}} of an optical biosensor (Biacore 3000), with four flow channels (Fcs), {{in combination with}} a mixture of four specific antibodies resulted in a competitive inhibition biosensor immunoassay (BIA) for the simultaneous detection of the five relevant aminoglycosides in reconstituted skimmed milk. Four aminoglycosides (gentamicin, neomycine, kanamycin and a streptomycin derivative) were immobilised onto the sensor surface of a biosensor chip (CM 5) in the four Fcs of the biosensor system by amine coupling. In the Biacore, milk (reconstituted from skimmed milk powder) was 10 times diluted {{with a mixture of}} the four specific antibodies and injected through the four serially connected Fcs (1 min at a flow rate of 20 ¿l min¿ 1). The responses measured just prior to the injection (20 ¿l at a flow rate of 20 ¿l min¿ 1) of the regeneration solution (0. 2 M NaOH + 20 % <b>acetonitril)</b> were indicative for {{the presence or absence of}} the aminoglycosides in reconstituted milk. The limits of detection were between 15 and 60 ng ml¿ 1, which was far below the maximum residue limits (MRLs) (varying from 100 to 500 ng ml¿ 1) and the total run time between samples was 7 min...|$|E

The separation temperature {{was found to}} increase linearly with pressure the value of dTc/dP being 28 mK, 11 mK, 22 mK, and 25 mK respectively. These are in fair agreement with earlier measurements available for two systems. For the methanol + n-heptane system dTc/dP is apparently {{not consistent with the}} value predicted from the specific heat and thermal expansion data.

Es wurde gefunden, daß die kritische Temperatur linear mit dem Druck ansteigt. Die Werte für dTc/dP betragen 28 mK, 11 mK, 22 mK und 25 mK.
