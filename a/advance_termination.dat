We employ the recent advances in contract theory {{to demonstrate that the}} time structure of the trade agreement is related {{to the nature of the}} underlying trade-related investments (or other types of irreversible resource adjustments). If these investments are lumpy and specialized to trade in a single homogeneous good, the agreements with the fixed term of duration are more likely. The fixed-term agreement provides incentives for the initial investment but leaves the parties the flexibility to revisit the need for future investment by resorting to renegotiation. If the agreement covers trade in goods requiring incremental and "leaky" investments, the risk of overinvestment is more diversified due to the spillovers of the investment benefits. Therefore, the parties, which are concerned with the costs of renegotiation, are more likely to conclude an evergreen agreement (with an <b>advance</b> <b>termination</b> notice or an escape clause) ...|$|E

Recently, low-cost GaN-on-Si vertical diodes {{have been}} demonstrated for the first time. This paper presents a systematic study to understand and control the OFF-state leakage current in the GaN-on-Si vertical diodes. Various leakage sources were investigated and separated, including leakage through the bulk drift region, passivation layer, etch sidewall, and transition layers. To suppress the leakage along the etch sidewall, an <b>advanced</b> edge <b>termination</b> technology has been developed by combining plasma treatment, tetramethylammonium hydroxide wet etching, and ion implantation. With this <b>advanced</b> edge <b>termination</b> technology, an OFF-state leakage current similar to Si, SiC, and GaN lateral devices has been achieved in the GaN-on-Si vertical diodes with over 300 V breakdown voltage and 2. 9 -MV/cm peak electric field. The origin of the remaining OFF-state leakage current {{can be explained by}} a combination of electron tunneling at the p-GaN/drift-layer interface and carrier hopping between dislocation traps. The low leakage current achieved in these devices demonstrates the great potential of the GaN-on-Si vertical device as a new low-cost candidate for high-performance power electronics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent <b>advances</b> in <b>termination</b> {{analysis}} {{have yielded}} new methods and tools {{that are highly}} automatic. However, when they fail, even experts have difficulty understanding why and determining how to proceed. In this paper, we {{address the issue of}} building termination analysis engines that are both highly automatic and easy to use in an interactive setting. We consider the problem in the context of ACL 2, which has a first-order, functional programming language. We introduce the notion of a termination core, a simplification of the program under consideration which consists of a single loop that the termination engine cannot handle. We show how to extend the Size Change Termination (SCT) algorithm so that it generates termination cores when it fails to prove termination, with no increase to its complexity. We show how to integrate this into the Calling Context Graph (CCG) termination analysis, a powerful SCT-based automatic termination analysis {{that is part of the}} ACL 2 Sedan. We also present several new, convenient ways of allowing users to interface with the CCG analysis, in order to guide it to a termination proof. ...|$|R
40|$|Analysing if {{programs}} and processes terminate {{is one of}} the central topics of theoretical computer science. Even though to be undecidable in general, the problem has been studied for decades for specific subproblems. Based on the results of this work, many small example programs can be proven terminating automatically now. However, even small real-world systems usually cannot be handled. The focus has thus now turned towards proving termination of programs that are in wide-spread use in common devices and computers. Two different approaches to apply termination analysis to real-world problems have seen considerable activity in the past decade. One idea is to transform programs into formalisms that have been studied in the past, allowing to directly use existing methods and tools. Another trend is to leverage tools for model checking from the related field of safety verification to apply certain selected techniques for termination proving. This thesis makes contributions in both of these areas. First, we discuss how to transform real-world Java Bytecode programs into term rewriting, a simple formalism that has been used to study termination analysis for decades. User-defined data structures are transformed into terms, allowing {{to make use of the}} many methods originally developed for term rewriting. Then, we present techniques to handle term rewrite systems that provide pre-defined support for integers. For this, we show how using suitable transformations, a powerful termination analysis can be implemented by recursing to existing, more specialised method handling either integers or terms. Finally, we present SMT-based techniques to infer non-termination of Java Bytecode and term rewriting with integers. To improve model-checking-based approaches to termination analysis of programs restricted to integers, we present a new cooperative proof framework. Its novel structure allows model checking techniques and <b>advanced</b> <b>termination</b> proving techniques from term rewriting to work together. This work can be seen as a first step towards unifying these two approaches, and allows further cross-fertilisation of ideas. Based on this framework, we show how this approach can be used in alternation with non-termination techniques, further improving the precision of the overall approach. The contributions of this thesis are implemented in the fully automated termination prover AProVE and the model checker and termination prover T 2. In the annual International Termination Competition, AProVE has proven to be the most powerful termination analyser for Java Bytecode programs, whereas T 2 is the most powerful termination analyser for integer programs...|$|R

40|$|Climate change-induced {{shifts in}} {{phenology}} have important demographic consequences, and are frequently {{used to assess}} species’ sensitivity to climate change. Therefore, developing accurate phenological predictions {{is an important step}} in modeling species’ responses to climate change. The ability of such phenological models to predict effects at larger spatial and temporal scales has rarely been assessed. It is also not clear whether the most frequently used phenological index, namely the average date of a phenological event across a population, adequately captures phenological shifts in the distribution of events across the season. We use the long-tailed tit Aegithalos caudatus (Fig. 1) as a case study to explore these issues. We use an intensive 17 -year local study to model mean breeding date and test the capacity of this local model to predict phenology at larger spatial and temporal scales. We assess whether local models of breeding initiation, termination, and renesting reveal phenological shifts and responses to climate not detected by a standard phenological index, that is, population average lay date. These models take predation timing/intensity into account. The locally-derived model performs well at predicting phenology at the national scale over several decades, at both high and low temperatures. In the local model, a trend toward warmer Aprils is associated with a significant <b>advance</b> in <b>termination</b> dates, probably in response to phenological shifts in food supply.

40|$|This Article {{simultaneously}} exposes {{a fundamental}} error in employment termination doctrine and a paradox in contract law jurisprudence. Contemporary employment law has developed {{under the assumption}} that at-will parties may terminate their relationship both without reason and without notice. This Article argues that the second half of this formulation—the idea that parties reserve the procedural right to terminate without notice—is neither historically supported nor legally correct. Employment at will, as originally expressed, was a mere duration presumption reflecting America’s rejection of the predominant British rule favoring one-year employment terms. While subsequent case law expanded the presumption in various ways, a reinterpretation that requires <b>advance</b> notice of <b>termination</b> remains compatible with the way in which most contemporary courts articulate the rule. In fact, an examination of general contract law reveals that in a variety of nonemployment contexts, courts impose on parties to an indefinite relationship the duty to provide reasonable notice while still safeguarding their right to terminate at will. Such an obligation serves not only as a gap filler in the face of contractual silence, but also as a good faith limitation on parties’ exercise of substantive discretion. Absent such a notice requirement, employment is an illusory relationship, one that lacks the modicum of consideration necessary to create a binding contract. While courts have sought to circumvent this problem by theorizing employment as a unilateral contract, that formulation is ill-suited to the reality that both sides generally anticipate an ongoing, dynamic relationship. This Article recasts employment as a bilateral contract terminable at will by either party upon reasonable notice. Establishing a reasonable notice obligation will grant terminated workers paid transition time to seek new employment and develop new skills. At the same time, adopting this rule paves the way for a more unified body of contract law. The case for deviations from general contract principles is strongest where context-specific rules fulfill the reasonable expectations of the weaker party. Employment-specific contract rules, as they currently stand, do precisely the opposite. While ordinary contract law cannot adequately protect workers’ interests in all circumstances, this Article demonstrates that in at least some instances mainstream doctrine, properly understood and applied, can produce results that are both good for workers and in harmony with existing law...|$|R
40|$|The federal circuit {{courts of}} appeals have {{generally}} recognized that a party suffers real hardship when {{the district court}} erroneously orders it to disclose privileged information. Review of the disclosure order after final judgment is usually an insufficient remedy; once the information has been disclosed, it can never again be fully confidential. Consequently, the courts have struggled to provide a mechanism by which such orders can be immediately appealed. However, privilege orders presenting novel questions of law or issues of first impression do not clearly fit within the doctrinal requirements {{of the most common}} methods of interlocutory review. Appellate courts have therefore applied varying exceptions or extensions to those requirements in an effort to encompass such privilege orders within them. This Article proposes a two-tiered system of review to remedy the harm caused by erroneous disclosure orders without stretching the current system of interlocutory review so far that the benefits of the final judgment rule vanish. The Article recommends that review begin in the district court with a motion to certify a discretionary appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b), which requires a district court to certify an order that 2 ̆ 7 involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, 2 ̆ 7 if 2 ̆ 7 an immediate appeal from the order may materially <b>advance</b> the ultimate <b>termination</b> of the litigation. 2 ̆ 7 If a district court refuses to certify an order even though it clearly satisfies the requirements of § 1292 (b), then the appellate court should exercise its mandamus power to review the case. This two-tiered system of review would provide a consistent mechanism by which the most difficult and important privilege orders could be immediately reviewed, but would not impose too heavy a burden on the already-crowded appellate dockets.
