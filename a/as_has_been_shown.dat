Nevertheless, the two fields remain distinct, as the methods of proof are quite different and algebraic geometry includes also geometry in finite characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Food {{problems}} {{may be the}} cause of an observed failure of the birds to even try to breed. The results of the research suggest this is related to a decline in sardines (Sardinops sagax), {{an important part of the}} boobies’ diet. Earlier work on Española Island saw successful breeding in blue-footed boobies that have access to sardines, in which case their diet consists essentially wholly of sardines. However, sardines have been largely absent from the Española area since 1997, <b>as</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> from Nazca boobies there, who also prefer sardines but can breed using other prey. In 2012–13, roughly only half of prey items in the boobies' diet were sardines. No evidence was seen of other possible causes for the decline, such as effects of humans, introduced predators, or disease.|$|E
500|$|Extreme {{variability}} in fruiting body form and color {{has been noted}} for C.stercoreus. Brodie reported discovering a slender-stemmed [...] "twinned" [...] form, with two fruiting bodies originating from the same stalk. <b>As</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> in laboratory-grown specimens, the development and form of the fruiting bodies is at least partially dependent on the intensity of light it receives during development. For example, exposure of the heterokaryotic mycelium to light is required for fruiting to occur, and furthermore, this light needs {{to be at a}} wavelength of less than 530 nm. Lu suggests that certain growing conditions – such as a shortage in available nutrients – shifts the fungus' metabolism to produce a hypothetical [...] "photoreceptive precursor" [...] that enables the growth of the fruiting bodies to be stimulated and affected by light. The fungi is also positively phototrophic, that is, it will orient its fruiting bodies {{in the direction of the}} light source.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{generally}} {{assumed that the}} pattern of the OWL is a manifestation of some deeper physical structure or process (the [...] "ur-OWL"), which might be elucidated by studying the effects it has on other structures. <b>As</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown,</b> study of features that should interact with OWL has yielded very little: a tentative age range (between 45 and 17 million years), suggestions that the ur-OWL arises from deep in the crust, and evidence that the OWL is not (contrary to expectations) itself a boundary between oceanic and continental crust.|$|E
2500|$|To {{facilitate}} a complete ballot, some PR-STV systems provide the voter with {{the option of}} using group voting tickets {{rather than having to}} identify manually a complete list of individual preferences. For example, in elections to the Australian Senate from 1984 until 2013 a voter could either rank the candidates individually [...] "below the line" [...] or place the number 1 in a box [...] "above the line" [...] to vote for a predetermined ordering of candidates drawn up by one of the political parties. This system diminished the emphasis on individual candidates and increases the power of party leaders that submit the predetermined rankings; in practice it may even lead to a system resembling, but not being identical to party-list proportional representation. [...] However it was still possible for independent candidates to be elected <b>as</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> in the 2007 Federal Senate elections where Nick Xenophon was 3rd elected before preferences. In 2016 group tickets were abolished to avoid undue influence of preference deals and [...] a form of optional preferential voting was introduced.|$|E

60|$|Mixed modes, therefore, {{that are}} made up but of a few and obvious simple ideas, have usually names of no very {{uncertain}} signification.
