5|$|In 1839, the City of Galveston {{adopted a}} charter and was {{incorporated}} by the Congress of the Republic of Texas. The city was by then <b>a</b> <b>burgeoning</b> {{port of entry}} and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of German immigrants to Texas, including Jewish merchants. Together with ethnic Mexican residents, these groups tended to oppose slavery, support the Union during the Civil War, and join the Republican Party after the war.|$|E
5|$|This unique {{geography}} {{has greatly}} influenced Ikata's growth. On the one hand, it has presented significant challenges to urban development {{that were not}} overcome until recently in the town's long history.

5|$|The account went viral in 2011 {{and led to}} the reinvigoration of Molyneux's legacy. To many, the two became entwined. Molyneux's {{reputation}} as a dreamer was reclaimed as a positive trait in light of growing opposition to conservative game design, and the parody account became a mouthpiece for that population. The tweets contributed to Molyneux's decision to leave Microsoft Game Studios and pursue riskier game ideas. They also inspired a game jam, in which about 1,000 game developers worldwide created about 300 games based on the tweets {{over the course of a}} weekend. The game jam also brought Molyneux fame within <b>a</b> <b>burgeoning</b> indie game movement. Notable games based on the parody account's ideas include Donut County.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the empire was largely {{dependent}} on agriculture. Sorghum (jowar), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane, rice, and wheat thrived in rainy areas. Betel leaves, areca (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, cardamom, and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included <b>a</b> <b>burgeoning</b> market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} clergyman who {{was also}} a politician, Horne had <b>a</b> <b>burgeoning</b> {{business}} career with Triplex Safety Glass, which was interrupted by service with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. While serving in a barrage balloon unit, he was asked to broadcast as a quizmaster on the BBC radio show Ack-Ack, Beer-Beer. The experience brought him into contact with the more established entertainer Richard Murdoch, and the two wrote and starred in the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. After demobilisation Horne returned to his business career, and kept his broadcasting as a sideline. His career in industry flourished, and he later became the chairman and managing director of toy manufacturers Chad Valley.|$|E
50|$|In India, the {{situation}} is similar to Africa. Monkeys, such as langurs, also enter cities for food, and cause havoc in food markets when they steal fruit from the vendors.

5|$|Franz Burgmeier (born 7 April 1982) is a Liechtenstein footballer, {{who plays}} as a midfielder for Vaduz in the Swiss Super League. Born in Triesen, Burgmeier was <b>a</b> <b>burgeoning</b> footballer and keen skier, until {{he gave up}} the latter sport at 16 {{following}} a serious injury. Having been a youth player for Triesen, he started his professional career with Vaduz. Burgmeier won several Liechtensteiner Cups with Vaduz, who were promoted to the Swiss Challenge League in 2001, and played in the UEFA Cup. After two unsuccessful attempts to win promotion to the Swiss Super League, Burgmeier left for Aarau in 2005. He spent only one season with Aarau before a move to the previous season's runners-up Basel in 2006. His two seasons with Basel were broken up by a loan spell with Thun, before he moved to England with Darlington in August 2008, where he played for one year.|$|E
5|$|Strangeways Brewery {{was founded}} in 1778 by two grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north {{of what is now}} Manchester city centre. Their {{principal}} customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then <b>a</b> <b>burgeoning</b> mill town. Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined the brewery in 1832 as a travelling salesman when the brewery was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the time, it was a modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company went under the name John Harrison & Co. In January 1853, Boddington borrowed money to become its sole owner. Between Boddington's takeover until 1877, the brewery's output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 barrels a year, making it not only Manchester's largest brewery but {{one of the largest in}} the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington & Co. was a limited liability company. Henry Boddington's estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> the <b>burgeoning</b> Gay Liberation {{movement}} {{took off}} and became more closely intertwined with the movements for civil rights of the 1960s and 1970s, ONE Inc., Jim Kepner and a growing group of activists were poised to collect original materials from that critical time period.

40|$|The {{fields of}} {{metamaterials}} and plasmonics are both set {{to benefit from}} the use of superconducting materials. Superconductors - a fascinating family of materials discovered about a century ago that exhibit an electrical resistivity that vanishes at a sufficiently low temperature - are now creating exciting opportunities in photonics. In particular, their use in low-loss plasmonic waveguides and metamaterals, artificial structures patterned on a sub-wavelength scale that have customizable electromagnetic properties, is <b>an</b> exciting <b>burgeoning</b> research avenue...|$|R
5|$|Tea is {{the second}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world, after water. Argo was founded in response to a realization that Americans had so few tea offerings that they generally were unfamiliar with anything but bagged teas. At the time, most tea retailers either supplied bulk tea for home brewing or traditional sit-down service, but Argo focused on premium specialty drinks in paper cups. Meanwhile, a minority of Asian immigrants from countries such as India, Vietnam and China where tea is the national beverage were spreading some of their traditions. Argo endeavored to emphasize the healthy aspects of tea as an alternative to coffee. When it was founded, Argo was part of a field of blossoming tea cafe franchises meeting <b>a</b> <b>burgeoning</b> demand. By 2002, there were 1,100 tearooms with sit-down service. In 2003, retail sales of tea totaled $5.1billion, and in 2005, as the specialty tea market was growing 20percent per year, the total retail tea market was expected to surpass $10 billion by 2010.|$|E

50|$|In {{the vast}} territories of the Kutch, {{on top of}} a forlorn hillock stands the fort of Roha. Once the biggest jaagir in the region, it lies {{neglected}} and forgotten. A close observer in the tragic death of 120 princesses, the seat of brave rulers, home to famous artists, <b>a</b> once <b>burgeoning</b> and rich principality, this is a story of riches to ruins as tempests of fate took charge of Roha and reduced the stone fortress to whispers in the wind.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{said that}} Pope Gregory I (540 - 604) {{authorized}} the consumption of laurices during Lent and other fasts, declaring them to be a marine species, like fish or shellfish. For this reason there was <b>a</b> great <b>burgeoning</b> of cuniculture in monasteries during the early Middle Ages. [...] The demand would have been high, considering that the ecclesiastical calendar of the time specified more than 180 fast days which religionists had to observe. The economics of cuniculture are also thought well suited to the monastic setting.|$|R
