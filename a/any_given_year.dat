5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and {{there will always be}} at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year,</b> there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Blanca was the {{earliest}} recorded tropical cyclone {{to make landfall}} in Baja California in <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year.</b> Forming as a tropical depression on May31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June2–3, becoming a powerful Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145mph (230km/h) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting {{in a period of}} weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category4 status on June6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day.|$|E

In Downingtown, Pennsylvania, over eightinches (203mm) of rain fell in around sixhours, while Doppler Radar estimated that Kennett Square received over 10inches (255mm) in a five-hour period. The heavy rainfall led to record discharge rates along the Red Clay Creek, which also had a record crest peaking at just below 26feet (8m). Parts of the creek saw a 500-year flood, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring in <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year.</b> Numerous rivers in southeastern Pennsylvania also crested above their flood stage.|$|E
