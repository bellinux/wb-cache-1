5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction. Muslims were <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to report this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E

5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|Between 40% and 50% of all {{children}} who develop cerebral palsy were born prematurely. Most of these cases (75-90%) {{are believed to be}} due to issues that occur around the time of birth, often just after birth. Multiple-birth infants are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than single-birth infants to have CP. They are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be born with a low birth weight.|$|E

25|$|About 70 {{percent of}} ECT {{patients}} are women. This {{may be due}} to the fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed with depression. Older and more affluent patients are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to receive ECT. The use of ECT is not as common in ethnic minorities.|$|E

50|$|In {{the rural}} environments {{there are two}} types of crop orientations, {{subsistence}} and export. Female-headed households are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be subsistence orientated, which are often poorer. Export farmers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have substantial land endowments and to be male-headed. After structural adjustments export farmers became more vulnerable to price shocks, and women within this category more so.

25|$|Older {{people have}} {{different}} requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people are <b>also</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to vote, {{and in many}} countries the young are forbidden from voting.

25|$|While {{agreeable}} {{individuals are}} habitually likely to help others, disagreeable {{people may be}} more likely to cause harm.
