40|$|The {{content of}} hippuric <b>acid</b> <b>in</b> raw goat's and sheep's milk {{and the content}} of benzoic <b>acid</b> <b>in</b> model {{fermented}} milk drinks prepared using different cultures of bacteria of milk fermentation were determined. All fermented milk drinks contained benzoic <b>acid</b> <b>in</b> the range 5. 0 - 78 mg kg- 1. Higher quantity of benzoic <b>acid</b> <b>in</b> fermented sheep's milk drinks corresponded also to significantly higher quantity of hippuric <b>acid</b> <b>in</b> raw sheep's milk.

5|$|A C-terminal domain (489-561 amino <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> human EFS) {{is highly}} conserved between family members at both primary amino acid {{sequence}} and predicted fold. All CAS proteins except CASS4 contain a YDYVHL motif within this domain, which is an important binding site for the Src SH2 domain.

5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins whereby the proteins have a changed order of amino <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape.

5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> water, but {{the presence of}} a double bond adjacent to the OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid is an example of this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E

5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the fatty <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty <b>acids.</b> <b>In</b> other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> samples from their environment.|$|E
5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms in that they are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the impact of dietary supplementation with a Bifidobacterium breve strain {{together}} with linoleic acid & α-linolenic acid, for 7 weeks, on colonic sensitivity and fatty <b>acid</b> metabolism <b>in</b> rats.
