5|$|Piłsudski's PPS, {{while not}} {{planning}} for a major uprising then and there, had a policy of supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces. The PPS, {{as well as other}} socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E

25|$|Allied codebreakers read much {{enciphered}} German message traffic, {{especially that}} encrypted with the Enigma machine. The Allies' Ultra programme was initially of limited value, {{as it took}} too long {{to get the information}} to the commanders in the field, and at times provided information that was less than helpful. In terms of anticipating the next move the Germans would make, reliance on Ultra sometimes backfired. Part of the reason the initial German attacks in March 1941 were so successful was that Ultra intercepts had informed Wavell that OKW had clearly directed Rommel not to take any offensive action, but to wait until he was further reinforced with the 15th Panzer Division in May. Rommel received this information, but placed more value on his own assessment of the situation. Trusting that the Germans had no intention of taking major action, the British command did not respond until it was too late. Furthermore, Rommel did not generally provide OKW or the Italian Comando Supremo details of his planned operations, for he thought the Italians too prone to leak the information. Thus on 21 January 1942, when Rommel struck out on his second offensive from El Agheila, Commando Supremo was just <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> to learn of it as the British were. Ultra intercepts provided the British with such information as the name of the new German commander, his time of arrival, and the numbers and condition of the Axis forces, but they might not correctly reveal Rommel's intentions.|$|E

500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, the {{discovery}} of two new Deinocheirus specimens was announced before the annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) conference by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, and colleagues. Housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, these two headless individuals were given the specimen numbers MPC-D 100/127 and MPC-D 100/128. MPC-D 100/128, a subadult specimen, was found by scientists in the Altan Ula IV locality (coordinates: [...] ) of the Nemegt Formation during the Korea-Mongolia International Dinosaur Expedition in 2006, but had already been damaged by fossil poachers. The second specimen, MPC-D 100/127, was found by scientists in the Bugiin Tsav locality (coordinates: [...] ) in 2009. It is slightly larger than the holotype, {{and it could be}} clearly identified as Deinocheirus by its left forelimb, and therefore helped identify the earlier collected specimen as Deinocheirus. The specimen had also been excavated by poachers, who had removed the skull, hands and feet, but left behind a single toe bone. It had probably been looted after 2002, based on money left in the quarry. Currie stated in an interview that it was a policy of their team to investigate quarries after they had been looted and recover anything of significance, and that finding any new Deinocheirus fossils was cause for celebration, even without the poached parts. A virtual model of Deinocheirus revealed at the SVP presentation brought applause from the crowd of attending palaeontologists, and Scottish palaeontologist Stephen L. Brusatte stated he had never been <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> by a SVP talk, though new fossils are routinely presented at the conference.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{skirmish}} {{that followed}} between Gage's soldiers and the French, the French commander, Beaujeu, {{was killed by}} the first volley of musket fire by the grenadiers. Although some 100 French Canadians fled back to the fort and {{the noise of the}} cannon held the Indians off, Beaujeu's death did not {{have a negative effect on}} French morale; Dumas rallied the rest of the French and their Indian allies. The battle, known as the Battle of the Monongahela, or the Battle of the Wilderness, or just Braddock's Defeat, was officially begun. Braddock's force was approximately 1,400 men. The British faced a French and Indian force estimated to number between 300 and 900. The battle, frequently described as an ambush, was actually a meeting engagement, where two forces clash at an unexpected time and place. The quick and effective response of the French and Indians [...] despite the early loss of their commander [...] led many of Braddock's men to believe they had been ambushed. However, French documents reveal that the French and Indian force was too late to prepare an ambush, and had been just <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> as the British.|$|E

2500|$|Johnstone {{at first}} {{made for the}} Cape Verde Islands, {{anchoring}} at Porto Praya to take on fresh water. Assuming there was no danger, despite records from the port office that a French frigate had arrived a month earlier and warned the inhabitants {{to prepare for the}} arrival of a larger French force, Johnstone anchored his fleet so that the warships were moored inshore, and the transports and merchants were outside the defensive lines. He further hampered his ability to fight his ships by sending his best men ashore to collect water, and leaving his decks encumbered with lumber and casks. On 16 April strange sails were seen approaching the harbour. These were the ships of Suffren's squadron, who also intended to take on water and was equally <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> to discover an enemy fleet. Taking advantage of the situation he quickly ran up to HMS Isis with his 74-gun ships Annibal and Héros, and the 64-gun [...] Artésien, fired broadsides into her, and raised the French colours. Moored as he was Johnstone could not easily bring his remaining warships to engage the French, while his smaller ships were useless against the large French warships. In the smoke and confusion several of the transports fired into the East Indiamen.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{scholarship}} remains {{divided on}} Stuart's culpability. Edward G. Longacre argues that Lee deliberately gave Stuart wide discretion in his orders {{and had no}} complaints about Stuart's tardy arrival at Gettysburg because he established no date by which the cavalry was required to link up with Ewell. The 3½ brigades of cavalry left with the main army were adequate for Lee to negotiate enemy territory safely and that his choice not to use these brigades effectively cannot be blamed on Stuart. Edwin B. Coddington refers to the [...] "tragedy" [...] of Stuart in the Gettysburg Campaign and judges that when Fitzhugh Lee {{raised the question of}} [...] "whether Stuart exercised the discretion undoubtedly given to him, judiciously," [...] the answer is no. Nevertheless, replying to historians who maintain that Stuart's absence permitted Lee to be surprised at Gettysburg, Coddington points out that the Union commander, Maj. Gen. George Meade, was just <b>as</b> <b>surprised,</b> and the initial advantage lay with Lee. Eric J. Wittenberg and J. David Petruzzi have concluded that there was [...] "plenty of blame to go around" [...] and the fault should be divided between Stuart, the lack of specificity in Lee's orders, and Richard S. Ewell, who might have tried harder to link up with Stuart northeast of Gettysburg. Jeffry D. Wert acknowledges that Lee, his officers, and fighting by the Army of the Potomac bear the responsibility for the Confederate loss at Gettysburg, but states that [...] "Stuart failed Lee and the army in the reckoning at Gettysburg. ... Lee trusted him and gave him discretion, but Stuart acted injudiciously." ...|$|E

2500|$|Russian policy {{during the}} final battle for Sukhumi in September 1993, immediately, after the breach of the ceasefire by the Abkhaz forces, {{appeared}} to follow several lines. Russian officials condemned the attack, issued calls to Abkhaz forces to cease the offensive and its accompanying human rights violations and reportedly cut off electricity and telephone service to parts of Abkhazia from September to December 1993. Russia also supported resolutions in the Security Council condemning Abkhaz forces for breaching the ceasefire. At the same time, the Russian government criticized the Georgian government for refusing, once the attack was underway, to negotiate. As the Human Rights Watch report notes [...] "it is doubtful, however that Russian forces in or near Abkhazia were <b>as</b> <b>surprised</b> as the Russian government seemed to be. Initiating an offensive {{as large as the}} one undertaken, in three different directions at once, must have required extensive movement of forces and resupply during {{the days leading up to}} it." [...] Russian forces on the Georgian-Abkhaz border, who were supposed to police the ceasefire made no attempt to forestall the attack. The Abkhaz weapons were stored near the front and were returned to the Abkhaz by Russian military mission when hostilities restarted. Ataman Nikolay Pusko, a notable commander of some 1,500 Cossack volunteers fighting against Georgians in Abkhazia, later claimed that his sotnia was the first to enter Sukhumi. Pusko and two other Cossack atamans in Abkhazia, Mikhail Vasiliyev and Valery Goloborodko, all died in unclear circumstances from 1993 to 1994.|$|E
