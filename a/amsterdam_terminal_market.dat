40|$|This {{research}} examines whether mandatory {{price reporting}} (MPR) impacted price relationships among U. S. hog markets. Markets are cointegrated {{before and after}} MPR enactment, but not fully integrated in either period. <b>Terminal</b> <b>markets</b> adjust to shocks in the Iowa-Southern Minnesota market more quickly and Iowa-Southern Minnesota prices adjust to shocks in <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> more slowly following MPR enactment. Granger causality tests indicate a causal flow from <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> to Iowa-Southern Minnesota prices before MPR and a causal reversal after MPR enactment. These results likely reflect decreases in volume of negotiated sales, particularly in <b>terminal</b> <b>markets,</b> and greater reliance on mandatorily reported prices for market information. cointegration, hog markets, mandatory price reporting, market integration, regime shift, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing, Q 13,...|$|R

40|$|Intermodality {{has become}} a major goal in modem {{transport}} policy. The improvement of combined transport within the European Union includes the refinement of the freight terminal services. A freight terminal is a nodal place where goods are transhipped between any two or more transport modes. In this paper we describe and analyse the freight <b>terminal</b> <b>market</b> with the help of Porter's model of five competitive forces. The central question is: who are the stakeholders in the <b>terminal</b> <b>market?</b> We will particularly address the critical decision factors faced by terminal operators in terms of strategic importance, location and network configuration of freight terminals by employing Porter's competitive focus. First, the industry competitors in the freight <b>terminal</b> <b>market</b> will be analysed. Second, the buyers of the freight terminal services will be described, followed by the suppliers of the terminal infrastructure. Other competitive forces are the potential entrants into the <b>terminal</b> <b>market</b> and the substitutes for the use of freight terminals. An additional competitive force is added to our conceptual model {{in the form of the}} terminal environment. After the outline of this analytical framework of the freight <b>terminal</b> <b>market,</b> it is possible to identify where the economic power is located in the <b>terminal</b> <b>market</b> and how the positions of the different players in the market can be enhanced. The analysis will further address (de) regulation competences for different governmental levels involved in terminal activities. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} vertical price relationships {{for fresh}} strawberries. Specifically, {{the focus is}} on three stages of the vertical chain. The first stage is the shipping point. Shipping points represent major strawberry production regions and are the closest price point to the farm. The second stage is the <b>terminal</b> <b>market.</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>markets</b> are wholesale markets in major US cities. The third stage is the retail level. Retail level prices are measured as average supermarket prices in the same cities for which <b>terminal</b> <b>market</b> prices are available. Using weekly data, markup equations are estimated from upstream to downstream levels of the market. Findings indicate that strawberry prices at one level of the market were very responsive to the price at the next level downstream in the marketing channel. A measure of total weekly supply and controls for seasonality were also highly significant in the pricing model. Increases in shipping costs depressed shipping point prices and raised <b>terminal</b> <b>market</b> prices. This means that a portion of the increase in shipping costs is passed back towards the farm level in the form of lower prices and a portion is passed forward to the consumer in the form of higher prices at the retail level. Measures of market structure also impacted strawberry prices but not necessarily in the expected fashion. Retail concentration among brands (typically the labels of major shippers) caused small increases in price at both the shipping point and <b>terminal</b> <b>market</b> levels. Prices in both shipping point and <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> were lower when one specific supply region dominated the market...|$|R

40|$|Tomato {{trade between}} the U. S. and Mexican has grown {{significantly}} during the past decade, and market structure suggests increased market integration. This study examines fresh tomato price relationships between two major North American shipping points (Sinaloa, and Florida) and several major <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> in the U. S. and Mexico to infer whether business strategies vary by supply region or the geography of consumer markets. The results show some evidence of inefficient pricing behavior among some markets, and suggest that Mexican shipping point prices are less integrated with Mexico's own <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> than the closest U. S. market, Los Angeles. Moreover, perfectly competitive price behavior is less likely in a <b>terminal</b> <b>market</b> (Chicago) where Sinaloa and Florida compete during winter months. These results are the basis of discussion {{on the role of}} strategic behavior and trade policy influence in these markets. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} factors {{contributing}} to low liquidity of diamonds. One of the main factors {{is the lack of}} <b>terminal</b> <b>market.</b> Most commodities have <b>terminal</b> <b>markets,</b> and some form of commodities exchange, clearing house, and central storage facilities. Until recently this did not exist for diamonds. Diamonds are also subject to value added tax in the UK and EU, and sales tax in most other developed countries, therefore reducing their effectiveness as an investment medium. Most diamonds are sold through retail stores at very high profit margins.|$|R

Among many possible reasons for spatial concentration, I study here {{the effects of}} the distribution of end users and <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> on acreage allocation. The presence of multiple <b>terminal</b> <b>markets</b> in a growing area may allow for a more flexible marketing plan, along with introducing more idiosyncratic demand uncertainty associated with each consumption point. To take better advantage of future marketing opportunities, growers, depending on their location relative to <b>terminal</b> <b>markets,</b> may adjust the crop mix produced on the farm. I characterize the types of environments that lead to a spatial production concentration of a commodity in a growing area. I also analyze the equilibrium effects of an increase in transportation costs and a shift in acreage available for planting on spatial acreage allocation. commodity prices, location, marketing, production concentration, supermodularity, systematic risk. ...|$|R
