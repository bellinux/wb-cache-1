500|$|Mayo and Minnesota, {{supported}} by amicus briefs {{from a number}} of residency programs and medical organizations, argued that a residency is primarily educational in nature. They asserted that a residency is generally chosen based on <b>academic</b> <b>criteria</b> and that a residency must be completed in order for a physician to be licensed to practice medicine. They also argued that residency training involves not only supervised work, but also an educational curriculum, conferences, and lectures, much like clinical years of medical school. Mayo's attorney, former Bush Administration Solicitor General Theodore Olson, also argued that the rule was [...] "arbitrary", as the tax would apply to a resident working 40 hours per week but not to a resident working only 39 hours per week. The medical schools proposed that the IRS should base their determination on the primary purpose of a program—providing an education versus providing a livelihood.|$|E

A new <b>academic</b> <b>criterion</b> was adopted in 1950-1951: seniors were administered the Graduate Record Examination and sophomores {{a series of tests}} from the American Council on Education. Several campus organizations, including Kappa Gamma Pi, the national Catholic Honor and Activity Society, were also established in 1951. Meanwhile, more students with different backgrounds and cultures enrolled in the College: black students, Vietnamese, Hondurans, Germans, and Colombians. Additionally, the college began in 1951 to assist in students’ preparation as teachers of Saturday classes to involve them in catechetical instruction in the parishes of the Diocese. Edgewood's chorus also formed a broadcast choir to present live programs for the Madison Catholic Hour.|$|R

He first won approval from the Harvard Board of Overseers for a new policy that would, in addition to traditional <b>academic</b> <b>criteria,</b> use letters from teachers and interviews to assess an applicant's [...] "aptitude and character," [...] thus introducing discretion {{in the place of}} the strict top seventh rule. He even persuaded one doubtful Overseer that this would not support discrimination against Jews as a group, but merely [...] "careful discernment of differences among individuals." [...] When Lowell gained final approval of these modifications in 1926 and appointed a compliant Admissions Committee, he had won his way. When Lowell left his position in 1933, Jews made up 10% of the undergraduate population.|$|E
2500|$|Many honor {{societies}} invite {{students to}} become members based on scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or grade point, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement {{would not be an}} appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). These societies recognize past achievement. Pledging is not required, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined <b>academic</b> <b>criteria</b> and paying a one-time membership fee. Some require graduate enrollment. [...] Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership than professional societies. It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student. Some honor societies are invitation only while others allow unsolicited applications. Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field. Governance requires a faculty sponsor and each society remains faculty-guided, usually with alumni input.|$|E

40|$|Journal Impact Factor (JIF) {{has been}} used in {{assessing}} scientific journals. Other indices, h- and g-indices and Article Influence Score (AIS), have been developed to overcome some limitations of JIF. The aims of this study were, first, to critically assess the use of JIF and other parameters related to medical education research, and second, to discuss the capacity of these indices in assessing research productivity as well as their utility in academic promotion. The JIF of 16 medical education journals from 2000 to 2011 was examined together with the research evidence about JIF in assessing research outcomes of medical educators. The findings were discussed in light of the nonnumerical criteria often used in academic promotion. In conclusion, JIF was not designed for assessing individual or group research performance, and it seems unsuitable for such purposes. Although the g- and h-indices have demonstrated promising outcomes, further developments are needed for their use as <b>academic</b> promotion <b>criteria.</b> For top <b>academic</b> positions, additional <b>criteria</b> could include leadership, evidence of international impact, and contributions to the advancement of knowledge with regard to medical education...|$|R
