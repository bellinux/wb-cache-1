25|$|From 1982 until 2012, most Western economies {{experienced}} {{a period of}} low inflation combined with relatively high returns on investments across all asset classes including government bonds.

25|$|After 16 {{months of}} {{comprehensive}} component-based assessment and upgrades on all seven reactors, {{this phase of}} post-earthquake response was almost complete, with reactor 7 fully upgraded {{to cope with the}} seismic environment. On 8 November 2008, fuel loading in reactor unit 7 started, preparatory to a period of system safety tests on that reactor. On 19 February 2009 TEPCO applied to the local governance to restart unit 7 after having obtained approval from the national government <b>and</b> <b>regulators.</b> Local government agreement for restart was granted in May and electrical grid power was supplied from Unit 7 at 20% power on 19 May.

25|$|On 23 November, Qantas {{announced}} that it would begin to partially return its fleet of A380s to service, beginning on 27 November. Initially two of its six A380s were brought back into use {{while the rest of the}} fleet stayed grounded pending inspections and engine changes. The two aircraft entered service on the SydneySingaporeLondon route, where the engines use less than maximum thrust. Qantas initially refrained from using the aircraft on routes between Los Angeles and Australia, the longest routes globally served by the A380, where highest engine performance was required on take-off. After talks with the manufacturers <b>and</b> <b>regulators</b> indicated the aircraft was safe to use, Qantas resumed using the A380 on the Los Angeles routes in January 2011. By the end of January, Qantas operated all but one of its A380s. VH-OQA, the aircraft damaged in the accident, returned to service in April 2012.|$|E

25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) <b>and</b> <b>regulator(s),</b> and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E
