40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} examine {{characteristics}} of neighborhoods with changing older <b>adult</b> <b>populations.</b> Method: We used 30 years (1980 - 2011) {{of data from}} four U. S. cities (n = 392 neighborhoods; Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California) and finite mixture modeling to identify trajectory classes: neighborhoods with “stable,” declining, or increasing older <b>adult</b> <b>populations</b> (≥ 65 years). We then compared mean baseline and change in their characteristics. Results: Neighborhoods with an increasing (vs. “stable”) percentage of older <b>adult</b> <b>populations</b> had lower initial poverty and greater increases in education and income, with lower increases in road connectivity, population density, and housing prices/debt over time. The same was true for neighborhoods with declining older <b>adult</b> <b>populations,</b> {{with the exception of}} having higher increases in housing prices/debt. We observed few significant differences in neighborhood amenities or parks across classes. Conclusion: Our results emphasize the need to consider built and social environments when planning communities for older adults...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Four {{colonies of}} Ropalidia montana {{collected}} in August in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India had <b>adult</b> <b>populations</b> of 32, 000 - 61, 000. Queens represented 0 · 46 – 1 · 40 % of the populations. All colonies contained males, but in widely varying proportions (1 · 47 – 27. 00 %). The large <b>adult</b> <b>populations</b> {{and the fact}} that the nests were largely filled with brood in all stages of development indicate that the colonies were in a stage of active growth in this season. In December, however, colonies have been reported to have smaller <b>adult</b> <b>populations</b> and little brood. Thus brood production appears to be seasonal in southern India. Predation by the hornet Vespa tropica was observed in 4 of 31 active colonies. Ropalidia montana adults were defenseless in the face of these depredations, which appear to continue at a low level for days or weeks on a given nest...|$|R

40|$|Background Dipterocarpus littoralis Blume is a {{critically}} endangered dipterocarp species found only on Nusakambangan Island, Central Java, Indonesia. Patterns of genetic diversity and population genetic structure of adults and saplings in two extant populations (Kali Jati and Solok Besek) were estimated using ten microsatellite markers. Results A total of 39 alleles was found, with two and four alleles being unique in <b>adult</b> and sapling <b>populations,</b> respectively. Allelic richness and heterozygosity was similar between adult (Ar = 3. 00; He = 0. 423) and sapling (Ar = 3. 25; He = 0. 441) populations. Inbreeding coefficientsin saplingswere positive in both populations and statistically significant in Kali Jati, while those in <b>adult</b> <b>populations</b> {{were not significantly}} different from zero, indicating excessive inbreeding and selfing in the sapling populations. Genetic differentiation of the sapling populations (FST = 0. 036) was slightly lower than in the <b>adult</b> <b>populations</b> (0. 050), but only significantly so for saplings. Conclusions This study revealed that D. littoralis has low genetic diversity in both adults and saplings. Similarly low values in allele richness and heterozygosity suggest that reductions of population size have been ongoing for long periods in this species. Significant genetic differentiation between sapling <b>populations</b> but not <b>adult</b> <b>populations</b> indicates that recent fragmentation is further accelerating the isolation process...|$|R
