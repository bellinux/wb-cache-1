5|$|Sonderbehandlung is a German noun meaning special {{treatment}} in English. While it {{can refer to}} any sort of preferential treatment, it is known primarily as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> mass murder used by Nazi functionaries and the SS, who commonly used the abbreviation S.B. in documentation. It first came to prominence during Action T4, where SS doctors killed mentally ill and disabled patients between 1939 and 1941, {{and was one of}} a number of nonspecific words the Nazis used to document mass murder and genocide. Another notable example was Sonderbehandlung 14f13.|$|E
5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E
5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it was by the following year administrated by the SS and regarded as a sister organization of the SD. The Gestapo relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was a}} four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalized violence. The power of the Gestapo included what was called, Schutzhaft ("protective custody"), <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> the power to arrest and imprison people without judicial proceedings.|$|E

5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who favor}} the non-sexual {{interpretation}} argue against a denotation {{of sexual behavior}} in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13–14 times) of those references is it clearly used as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> realizing sexual intimacy. Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.|$|E
25|$|The salsa {{controversy}} is also {{closely tied to}} the decades-long estrangement between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and the United States embargo against Cuba. Radio stations in the United States would get bomb threats (presumably from Cuban exiles) for playing Cuban records over the air. Homegrown salsa on the other hand, was embraced. For a time the Cuban state media officially claimed that the term salsa music was <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> authentic Cuban music stolen by American imperialists, though the media has since abandoned this theory.|$|E
25|$|It was the Spaniards {{who gave}} the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic {{military}} fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process {{for more than five}} hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> being a white man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.|$|E

500|$|The RSDLP, the {{predecessor}} to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, {{was formed in}} 1898. The goal of the RSDLP was to change {{the economic and political}} system in the Russian Empire through a proletarian revolution in accordance with Marxist doctrine. Alongside their political activities, the RSDLP and other revolutionary groups (such as anarchists and Socialist Revolutionaries) practised a range of militant operations, including [...] "expropriations", <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> armed robberies of government or private funds to support revolutionary activities.|$|E

Although many were slaves or metics (and state-run brothels staffed by slaves {{were said to}} have been part of Solon's reforms), Athenian-born women also worked in the sex trade in Athens. Pornai {{apparently}} charged one to six obols for each sexual act; hetairai were more likely to receive gifts and favours from their clients, enabling to them to maintain a fiction that they were not being paid for sex.|$|E
500|$|German {{historian}} Peter Longerich {{notes that}} vague orders couched in terminology {{that had a}} specific meaning {{for members of the}} regime were common, especially when people were being ordered to carry out criminal activities. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be [...] "severe" [...] and [...] "firm"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly. The wording of the Wannsee Protocol—the distributed minutes of the meeting—made it clear to participants that evacuation east was <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> death.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the army's difficulties in dealing with Soviet partisans, Hitler decided in July 1942 to transfer anti-partisan operations to the police. This placed the matter under Himmler's purview. As Hitler had ordered on 8 July 1941 that all Jews were {{to be regarded as}} partisans, the term [...] "anti-partisan operations" [...] was used as <b>a</b> <b>euphemism</b> <b>for</b> the murder of Jews as well as actual combat against resistance elements. In July 1942 Himmler ordered that the term [...] "partisan" [...] should no longer be used; instead resisters to Nazi rule would be described as [...] "bandits".|$|E
