5|$|Potamon fluviatile has a generalist diet, {{feeding on}} {{vegetable}} debris, scraping algae from surfaces, or preying on frogs, tadpoles, and various invertebrates, such as insect larvae, snails or worms. No predator seems to specialise on P.fluviatile, {{but a number}} of animals take it opportunistically, including rats, foxes, weasels, birds of prey and jays. The most significant predator may be mankind, with individual prospectors <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> 3,000 to 10,000 in one season.|$|E
5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E
5|$|In their spare time, {{crews were}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up with work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, {{drawings}} {{and other items}} brought from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard Mir), or {{make use of the}} station's ham radio. Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E
60|$|That halt proved their salvation, for it {{gave them}} time to make one last despairing rush, and gain the brow of the poort. Not that this would have saved them, however, since where they could go the Matabele could follow, {{and there was still}} light by which the pursuers would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> see <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> them. Indeed, the savages, having laid down the wounded man, came on with a yell of rage, fifty or more of them.|$|R
50|$|Tomochika Wakana is {{the only}} player <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{consistently}} <b>catch</b> Aniya's pitches, though he originally was unable to keep his eyes open as the ball came to him. With help from Hiyama, Wakana was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> overcome this obstacle. He {{is considered to be}} the mood maker of the team.|$|R
50|$|Chippenham {{is one of}} many {{stations}} that will be improved as part of the 'Access for All scheme' (AfA). When fully completed in 2016, it will assist disabled and less <b>abled</b> passengers <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> services more easily, with the installation of lifts, new accessible foot bridges and tactile paving.|$|R
5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven {{teams with}} two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Benetton, BAR, Jordan, Arrows, Sauber, Jaguar, Minardi and Prost. Before the race, both the Drivers' Championship and Constructors' Championship were already settled, with Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher having claimed the Drivers' Championship two rounds {{earlier in the}} Hungarian Grand Prix and Ferrari took the Constructors' Championship at the same event, with McLaren too many points behind to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> them.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, Sirius had {{blockaded}} Saint Paul {{after landing}} her soldiers and, on 9 July, observed a ship attempting {{to break out}} of the harbour after hearing news of the surrender. Sirius sent her barge, under the command of Lieutenant George Norman, to pursue the fugitive. In an exhausting twelve-hour chase, Norman was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> and board the ship, revealed to be a privateer named Edward carrying four guns and 30 men. Norman was able to defeat the crew in a brief struggle in which three men were wounded, and discovered that she was carrying despatches from the French government for the authorities on Isle de France, all of which fell into British hands.|$|E
50|$|Berserkers are super strong, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{tear the}} human body apart. Their {{physical}} strength far surpasses that of the average werewolf.

50|$|At first, whale {{catchers}} either {{brought the}} whales they killed to a whaling station or factory ship anchored in a sheltered bay or inlet.

5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the phony letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and {{have been known to}} disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers {{at the end of the}} hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E
5000|$|... 1973 : Numbers now {{assigned}} to drivers. The #1 number is {{assigned to}} the reigning World Champion. Minimum weight increased to 575 kg, crushable structure around fuel tanks mandatory, no chrome plating of suspension parts allowed (to avoid hydrogen embrittlement), drivers required to carry medical card and submit to medical examination before they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> race, <b>catch</b> fencing and rescue equipment mandatory at races, starting grid dimensions standardised, fire service regulations established.|$|R
6000|$|... "To fit me for, {{and to keep}} me {{worthy of}} being one day your wife." [...] As she uttered these words she turned and disappeared, with a rapidity that eluded his {{attempts}} to detain her, behind an angle of the hedge, that was near them. For a moment, Barnstable remained motionless, through surprise, and when he sprang forward in pursuit, he was <b>able</b> only <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> {{a glimpse of her}} light form, in the gloom of the evening, as she again vanished in a little thicket at some distance.|$|R
5000|$|At 6'2" [...] and 207 pounds, Irvin was a big, {{physical}} receiver who manhandled cornerbacks and often was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make tough <b>catches</b> in defensive traffic. In {{part because of}} Irvin's ability to push off the defender with such ease, the NFL eventually changed its rules to adjust to wide receivers who emulated Irvin's physical style.|$|R
5|$|Lookouts on Seahorse spotted Sensible at 16:00 on 26 June and Captain Edward Foote {{immediately}} gave chase, the French frigate fleeing southwards. For 12 {{hours the}} pursuit continued until Foote was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> and defeat his opponent, inflicting heavy casualties on the weaker and overladen French frigate. Among the prisoners captured was General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers {{who had been}} wounded in the storming of Malta, and among the treasure was an ornate seventeenth century cannon once owned by Louis XIV. The captured Sensible was initially fitted out as an active warship, but on arrival in Britain in 1799 the ship was downgraded to a transport. The action provided the British with the first conclusive evidence of the French intention to invade Egypt, but despite an extensive search for Nelson's fleet Foote was unable to relay {{the location of the}} French to his admiral before the Battle of the Nile on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary need to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E
5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a pitch is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E
50|$|If an {{eligible}} receiver on {{the passing}} team legally catches the ball, the pass is completed and the receiver may attempt {{to advance the}} ball. If an opposing player legally catches the ball (all defensive players are eligible receivers) it is an interception. That player's team immediately gains possession of the ball and he may attempt to advance the ball toward his opponent's goal. If no player is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> legally <b>catch</b> the ball it is an incomplete pass and the ball becomes dead the moment it touches the ground. It will then {{be returned to the}} original line of scrimmage for the next down. If any player interferes with an eligible receiver's ability <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the ball it is pass interference which draws a penalty of varying degree (largely depending upon the particular league's rules).|$|R
50|$|The {{first round}} pick was left-handed pitcher Ronnie Walden out of Blanchard High School in Blanchard, Oklahoma. Serious arm {{injuries}} derailed {{his career and}} he only pitched in seven games in the Dodgers farm system, three in 1990 and four in 1993 when he attempted a comeback. He retired for good in 1994 with his arm so bad {{he would never be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> even play <b>catch</b> with his kids.|$|R
5000|$|Catch, {{or having}} a catch, {{is one of the}} most basic {{children}}'s games, often played between children or between a parent and child, wherein the participants throw a ball, beanbag, Flying disc or similar object back and forth to each other. At early stages in a child's life, playing catch is a good way to evaluate and improve the child's physical coordination. Notably, [...] "if a child cannot catch a ball that he or she is bouncing, it is unlikely the child will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play catch". Most children begin <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play <b>catch</b> around the age of four. Many four-year-olds instinctively close their eyes when a ball is heading towards them, and it can take some time to overcome this. Playing catch can help develop dexterity, coordination and confidence.|$|R
5|$|Edwards' next {{fraudulent}} scheme involved forging {{letters to}} cotton brokers in New Orleans, {{and using the}} signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to brokers in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell– Edwards' alias– had {{a large amount of}} cotton on deposit with the New Orleans brokers. Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from brokers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers– Brown Bros. & Co. and Jacob Little– gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans brokers that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell, and this prompted the bankers to offer a reward for information on the forger. The police began to search for the forger of the letters, but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the forger they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell was about to do. Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship would already have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> Powell, who told them that Edwards was their forger.|$|E

50|$|He has {{ambition}} matching his intelligence, {{evidenced by}} his successful {{execution of a}} plan to help Earth towards utopia by ending international hostilities. He is shown to be a ruthless and master strategist, swiftly eliminating anybody who dares {{to get in the way}} of his plans, while maintaining total secrecy. Veidt also possesses a photographic memory. Additionally, Veidt is depicted at the pinnacle of human physical ability, to the point of being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reflexively <b>catch</b> a bullet. He is also an almost superhuman unarmed combatant who easily defeats both Rorschach and Nite Owl. His only defeat came early in his career at the hands of the Comedian, whom he later bested and killed.|$|R

He's the Tasmanian Devil. He played an incredibly reckless game, but he was so gifted that he could make a mistake and recover because he was lapping you, so that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>catch</b> back up and fix his mistake. It's almost like he had his own time machine. I've never seen anyone play with that much energy and juggle that many balls at once, and pull it all off." ...|$|R
5000|$|Juggling {{helps to}} develop quick {{reflexes}}, and in fact, jugglers develop [...] "higher-order reflexes", reflexes not {{typically associated with}} normal human activity. These reflexes are formed through repetition of what are, at first, slowly learned and difficult processes. As the various processes develop into reflexive actions, additional, more difficult or complex skills are 'layered' atop previous, well-developed skills. These new more complex skills eventually become more reflexive, and eventually, various unusual high order reflexes develop. An example is that, while catching a raw chicken's egg may be quite challenging to a novice juggler, a more skilled juggler might be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> easily <b>catch</b> [...] - [...] unbroken [...] - [...] an egg thrown towards him without warning.|$|R
25|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{observation is}} that, unlike typical mutualisms between ants and fungus, these ants {{do not receive}} any nutrition from the fungus.

5|$|At 11:45, Armide {{surrendered}} to Centaur, followed 15 minutes later by Minerve. Both ships had suffered heavy damage and {{casualties in the}} unequal engagement and could not hope to continue their resistance {{with the rest of}} the British squadron rapidly approaching. To the north, Infatigable had failed to outrun Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade. With three ships lost and the other three long disappeared to the south, Soleil determined to flee westwards, hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaurs sails was sufficient to prevent her pursuit. However, Gloire had also been damaged and could not distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars. With his ship undamaged, Lukin was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> easily <b>catch</b> the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14:30, combat continuing for half an hour before Soleil surrendered, his frigate badly damaged. To the south, Windsor Castle had proven far too slow <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the smaller French ships, which had easily outrun the second rate and escaped.|$|R
