50|$|Serco Marine Services is an {{auxiliary}} maritime service provided by Serco Group to Her Majesty's Naval Service (incl.

Marine Services was previously provided by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service until its disbandment in 2008. Thereafter, it was briefly provided by Serco Denholm (a joint venture between Serco Group and Denholm Group) until Denholm's share was bought out in late 2009 by its larger partner, Serco.|$|R

40|$|A {{marine engine}} {{pollution}} abatement system was constructed and tested on a 1. 5 MW <b>auxiliary</b> <b>marine</b> engine. The integrated system, designed to abate {{all of the}} currently legislated emissions from marine engines, consisted of a monolithic Pt/Al 2 O 3 oxidation catalyst and a seawater scrubber, both of suitable dimensions for the engine size. The test results obtained showed the general validity of the approach adopted, as significant abatement of emissions was achieved. However, under the conditions used, the system showed some limitations {{with regard to the}} sulphur content of the fuel. On the basis of the results obtained, the system can be used with fuel sulphur content of up to 0. 4...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} an emission measurement campaign on commercial ships plying {{the east coast}} of Australia. Detailed investigation of engine performance and emissions from main and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>marine</b> diesel engines using heavy fuel were undertaken. Marine diesel engine gaseous (O 2, CO, CO 2, SO 2 and NOx) and particle number and mass emissions were measured using research grade instrumentation. The measurements were performed in October and November 2015 on two large cargo ships at berth, manoeuvring and during travel between the ports of Brisbane, Gladstone and Newcastle. Detailed measurements on an auxiliary engine at berth are analysed in this paper, and include engine power and RPM, fuel oil consumption, exhaust gas temperature and exhaust particle and gaseous emissions. It was found that some ship emissions were up to several orders of magnitude higher than corresponding land-based diesel emission levels. Significant variations in emissions were also related to fuel sulphur content and engine load...|$|R
50|$|While most of {{the species}} in this family are found in a <b>marine</b> <b>setting,</b> some species inhabit {{freshwater}} streams and lakes, {{some of which are}} important to island stream assemblages. Species such as the red-tailed stream goby (Lentipes concolor) are able to use their fused pelvic fins as a suction device which enables them to ascend rock faces alongside waterfalls, allowing them to inhabit waters far from the ocean.|$|R
50|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>setting</b> is rocky in {{the eastern}} side, with steep slopes and ravines, but mainly sandy in the western area. The shallowest part of the coast is colonized by two rare species, the red alga Lithophyllum lichenoides and the {{endangered}} giant limpet Patella ferruginea. The integrity of the ecosystem {{is due to the}} history of its settlement, or rather the lack of it, that is a charactistic of the island.|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the occurrence of}} numerous, nearly intact Me-cochirus rapax populations within Thalassinoides suevicus burrows in the Lower Cretaceous Boca do Chapim Formation. This exceptional preservation allows for unquestionable attribution of a specific pro-ducer to a biogenic structure. Analysis of sedimentological features combined with functional morphology and ichnological inferences suggests that the unique preservation of the fauna resulted from river flood depositional events that buried successive Mecochirus popula-tions in a shallow <b>marine</b> <b>setting...</b>|$|R
