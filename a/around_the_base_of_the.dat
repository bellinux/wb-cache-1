5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally. Bracteoles are small or absent.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is {{sometimes}} experienced by pedestrians {{at ground level}} when walking across a plaza towards a tower block and suddenly encountering a strong wind stream that is flowing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread out <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant for varying distances, {{close to the}} surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these {{come into contact with}} a rooting medium.|$|E

50|$|Azotobacter chroococcum, a nitrogen-fixing bacteria, is {{probably}} concentrated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> petioles. But the bacteria do not fix nitrogen unless {{the plant is}} suffering extreme nitrogen-deficiency.|$|R
50|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Mont Granier {{are many}} {{vineyards}} that produce the Apremont and Abymes appellations. These wines {{are made from}} the white Jacquère grape, seldom used outside Savoie.|$|R
5|$|The volcano {{is formed}} by {{andesite}} and dacite rocks, with fragmentary rocks prevailing over lava flows. The rocks have typical arc-volcano chemistry and composition, with a progression from andesite to dacite in the eruption products with younger age. Potassium-argon dating has indicated an age range from 5,900,000 to 90,000 years. Subsequent erosion has generated a large debris apron <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano and carved rock formations which impressed early explorers; one well-known rock formation is Neza e Sultan.|$|E
5|$|In 1330 Sir John de Mohun {{inherited}} the castle; John, although a notable knight, was childless {{and fell into}} considerable debt. His wife Joan took over the running of their estates, and when John died in 1376 she agreed to sell the castle to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell, the leading member of another major Norman family, for 5,000 marks, with the castle to transfer to Elizabeth on Joan's death. At some point during this period additional stone buildings were constructed along the Lower Ward, {{on the side of}} the current mansion, and records suggest that a ditch, or moat, may have existed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tor in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Many eusauropods, {{including}} Dinheirosaurus {{have been}} found in the Late Jurassic of Europe. The sauropods are from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tithonian as based on the presence of Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. One sauropod, a diplodocid currently based on an unnamed specimen including vertebrae and some bones, is clearly different from Dinheirosaurus and Losillasaurus, confirming the presence of a least two and possibly more diplodocids in the Late Jurassic of Spain and Portugal. This is unique in the variety of diplodocoids in all Europe, with the only other genera possibly non-diplodocoid (Cetiosauriscus), or classified in Rebbachisauridae. This suggests that the biogeography of primitive sauropods is incomplete, with possible primitive eusauropods and diplodocids surviving in the Late Jurassic, potentially until the Berriasian.|$|E
50|$|At {{some point}} between the sculpture’s {{installation}} in 1971 and 1985, {{a line of}} caulking was added <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Large Arch to prevent water pooling and freeze/thaw damage.|$|R

50|$|In the Early Classic, {{settlement}} {{extended to}} Mopan 3-Southeast and Ixkun itself. A few Early Classic ceramic remains were recovered from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Group 38 {{near the site}} core.|$|R
5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of guns in the {{superstructure}} were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all guns in the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward tripod mast. During {{the first year of}} the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house 4 four-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen guns. In addition a pair of three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added.|$|E
5|$|The hairpin banksia's {{infructescence}} is {{a typical}} Banksia cone-like structure, with up to 100 crowded embedded follicles which are 1–2.4centimetres (⅓–1in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire. The nonlignotuberous subspecies cunninghamii is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, while the others regenerate from buds <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lignotuber. Old flower spikes fade to brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually persist for a long time, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. In Central and North Queensland, old cones of both var.spinulosa and var.collina are generally bare.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of shell guns and steam {{ships in the}} 1840s created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. In 1850, with {{the closure of the}} prison, seven 8-inch (22.3 cm) guns were mounted along the walls in brick emplacements, but there were concerns about the defences and two earthwork auxiliary batteries were built just alongside the castle to house additional guns. In 1856, {{at the end of the}} Crimean War, there was a large review of the fleet along the Solent, attended by Queen Victoria and numerous tourists. Naval gunboats launched a mock attack on the castle, which responded by firing a volley of forty 8-inch guns, causing chaos among the crowds watching <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortification.|$|E
50|$|Brachypelma albopilosum is {{native to}} Costa Rica. A {{burrowing}} species, the curlyhair tarantula is found in tropical scrubland, either <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> large trees, near rivers, or in patches of cleared rain forest.|$|R
50|$|For the Soldiers' National Monument in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA {{he helped}} design the five {{larger than life}} statues of History, War, Abundance, Industry, and Victory that are <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> a tall granite column.|$|R

5|$|To evade enemy {{detection}} and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite which were {{operated by the}} air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the bailey are the remains of the Norman chapel, which {{comprised}} a nave, a square tower and an apsidal chancel, 12.7 metres by 6 metres (42ft by 20ft), 4 metres square (13ft square) and 4.6 metres by 4 metres (15ft by 13ft) respectively. It was built from local grey sandstone, and Roman tiles from one of the nearby villas were used to construct its roof and incorporated into the walls. Originally the tower would have had a church bell, and the casting pit for this is buried under the floor of the nave. A stone bench runs <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls, and in the 19th century there was also a stone base for a font in the nave, but this has since been lost. A piece of early medieval graffiti, possibly depicting a Norman soldier, has survived on the south exterior wall. A fireplace was added to the chapel during the Tudor period, although this was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E
50|$|The {{ceremonial}} hall in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II had a tiled wall decorated with glazed columns, lotus buds and palmettes with lions striding <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> example in the Royal Ontario Museum is one.|$|R
50|$|Hilling, {{earthing}} up or ridging is the technique in agriculture and horticulture of piling soil up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> a plant. It {{can be done}} by hand (usually using a hoe), or with powered machinery, typically a tractor attachment.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Morro Rock {{is open to}} visitors, with {{parking lots}} and paths. However, {{climbing}} the rock itself is prohibited except with a permit, both due to risk of injury, {{and because it is}} a peregrine falcon reserve.|$|R
5|$|Though {{the temple}} is a Shaiva shrine, it {{contains}} {{the images of}} numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. These images are located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found {{on the wall of}} the temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Orissa temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.|$|E
