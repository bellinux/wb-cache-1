5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and <b>affected</b> <b>plants</b> should be uprooted and burned. The site {{should not be}} used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, and beans, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in <b>affected</b> <b>plants.</b> They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|White rot of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so <b>affected</b> <b>plants</b> should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
40|$|It is {{suggested}} that global warming <b>affects</b> <b>plant</b> distribution along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients because vegetation changes with thermal conditions.

5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning <b>affected</b> <b>plants.</b> The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E
25|$|The common pests afflicting bonsai include insects both {{above and}} beneath the soil, and infections, usually fungal. A tree grown as a bonsai {{is subject to the}} pests that affect the same species full-grown, and also to pests common to other potted plants. Most pests are species-specific, so a {{detailed}} understanding of the specific bonsai species is necessary for identifying and treating most pests. The same materials and techniques used for other <b>affected</b> <b>plants</b> {{can be applied to the}} bonsai, with some relatively minor variation. Pesticide chemicals are usually diluted more for bonsai than for a larger plant, as a regular-strength application may overwhelm the smaller bonsai's biological processes.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{two days}} of the first {{announcement}} 1,800 jobs have {{been lost in the}} Irish pig industry with a further 6,000 jobs said to be at risk by Ireland's largest trade union SIPTU. Ireland's largest pig meat processor, Rosderra Irish Meats Group Ltd., turned away all of its 850 employees at four plants on 8 December, telling them to sign up for state unemployment benefits. Workers in the pork industry who have been laid off {{in the wake of the}} crisis, including those from <b>affected</b> <b>plants</b> in Edenderry, Waterford and Kilkenny, were to carry out a lunchtime protest at Leinster House (government buildings in Dublin) on 11 December.

2500|$|CBSD is {{characterized}} by severe chlorosis and necrosis on infected leaves, giving them a yellowish, mottled appearance. Chlorosis {{may be associated with}} the veins, spanning from the mid vein, secondary and tertiary veins, or rather in blotches unconnected to veins. [...] Leaf symptoms vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. [...] The growing conditions (i.e. altitude, rainfall quantity), plant age, and the virus species account for these differences. [...] Brown streaks may appear on the stems of the cassava plant. [...] Also, a dry brown-black necrotic rot of the cassava tuber exists, which may progress from a small lesion to the whole root. [...] Finally, the roots can become constricted due to the tuber rot, stunting growth. Typically the <b>affected</b> <b>plants</b> do not possess all of these characteristics, but those that are severely affected may. Farmers may be unaware of their infected cassava crops until they are harvested and see the tuber lesions because leaves are asymptomatic.|$|E
