50|$|Magnetic {{storage in}} the form of wire {{recording}}—audio recording on a wire—was publicized by Oberlin Smith in the Sept 8, 1888 issue of the Electrical World. Smith had previously filed a patent in September, 1878 but found no opportunity to pursue the idea as his business was machine tools. The first publicly demonstrated (Paris Exposition of 1900) <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder</b> was invented by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Poulsen's device recorded a signal on a wire wrapped around a drum. In 1928, Fritz Pfleumer developed the first <b>magnetic</b> tape <b>recorder.</b> Early <b>magnetic</b> storage devices were designed to record analog audio signals.

40|$|La fabbrica illuminata, for {{voice and}} four-track {{magnetic}} tape, was composed by Luigi Nono in 1964. The music on tape, recorded at the Studio di Fonologia Musicale of the RAI in Milan, {{was the result}} of the complex elaboration of audio materials from different sources: parts performed by the RAI choir of Milan, “thematic” improvisations sung by the mezzo-soprano Carla Henius, voices and noises from the Italsider plant in Genoa-Cornigliano, and synthesized sounds. Original audio sources Three versions by the author were identified in the RAI archives in Milan: Milan RAI Q 6, 1964, <b>analogue</b> <b>magnetic</b> tape, 1 inch, 38 cm/s, quadraphonic, created by the author for performance with live voice; Milan RAI Q 7, 1965, <b>analogue</b> <b>magnetic</b> tape, 1 inch, 38 cm/s, quadraphonic.

This restoration is tied to the basic document CLN 0002 in the Archive of Casa Ricordi in Milan, a digital conservative copy of the magnetic tape Q 6 of the Archive of the Studio di Fonologia at the RAI in Milan. The restoration of the sound tracks of the work has been completed at the Audio Laboratories of the University of Udine (Gorizia campus) under the expert supervision of Angelo Orcalli and edited by Angelo Orcalli.

50|$|Poulsen {{obtained}} a Telegraphone Patent in 1898, {{and with his}} assistant, Peder O. Pedersen, later developed other <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorders</b> that recorded on steel wire, tape, or disks. None of these devices had electronic amplification, but the recorded signal was easily strong enough to be heard through a headset or even transmitted on telephone wires. At the 1900 World's Fair in Paris, Poulsen {{had the chance to}} record the voice of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria which {{is believed to be the}} oldest surviving magnetic audio recording today.|$|R
5000|$|Orr's early {{knowledge}} {{allowed him}} to establish Orradio in 1949. When, after some uncertainty, tape became the standard medium for <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorders,</b> and as other uses such as data storage and videotape appeared, Orradio's sales expanded rapidly in the late 1950s. Orradio produced the first commercially available audio tape, video tape, and computer tape in the world. The company was purchased by a larger competitor, the Ampex Corporation, in 1959 when Ampex decided it was cheaper to own the plant than to keep buying all their tape.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of magnetic tape, <b>magnetic</b> wire <b>recorders</b> had successfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never offered audio quality comparable to the other recording and broadcast standards of the time. Some individuals and organizations developed innovative uses for <b>magnetic</b> wire <b>recorders</b> while others investigated variations of the technology. One particularly important variation was the application of an oxide powder to a long strip of paper. This German invention was the start of a long string of innovations that have led to present day magnetic tape recordings.|$|R
50|$|Tigerstedt {{moved to}} Denmark, where he {{continued}} working on film sound recording devices at the Petersen & Poulsen company. He befriended the Danish inventor Valdemar Poulsen (1869-1942), {{who was the}} inventor of the telegraphone steel wire <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder.</b> Tigerstedt, too, had experimented with recording sound on a steel wire. He attempted to transmit speech across the Jutland straits using 30 kHz ultrasound, but the results were not promising. He also experimented with transmitting sound underwater, which was more successful, and he was eventually granted a patent for this process.|$|R

[...] By 1898 Valdemar Poulsen had demonstrated a <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder</b> and proposed <b>magnetic</b> tape.

50|$|In 1946, Jack Mullin {{brought a}} Magnetophon <b>magnetic</b> tape <b>{{recorder}}</b> back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape; the recorder {{was one of}} the <b>magnetic</b> tape <b>recorders</b> that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5 mm tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality analog audio sound; Alexander M. Poniatoff then ordered his Ampex company to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophon for use in radio production. Bing Crosby eventually adopted the technology to pre-record his radio show, which was scheduled for a certain time every week, to avoid having to perform the show live, as well as having to perform it a second time for West Coast audiences.|$|R
5000|$|On September 8, 1888, Smith {{published}} a short note entitled [...] "Some Possible Forms of the Phonograph" [...] in the British journal Electrical World, where he suggested (probably {{for the first}} time) the use of permanent magnetic impressions for the recording of sound. Smith suggested using cotton or silk thread, into which steel dust or short clippings of fine wire could be suspended. These particles were to be magnetized {{in accordance with the}} alternating current from a microphone source. Smith also discussed the possibility of using a hard steel wire, but thought it scarcely possible. A working unit was never built. Many of Smith's ideas were used by Valdemar Poulsen when he developed the first true <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the war, the Allies {{became aware}} of radio {{broadcasts}} {{that seemed to be}} transcriptions (much of this due to the work of Richard H. Ranger), but their audio quality was indistinguishable from that of a live broadcast and their duration was far longer than was possible with 78 rpm discs. At the end of the war, the Allies captured a number of German Magnetophon recorders from Radio Luxembourg that aroused great interest. These recorders incorporated all of the key technological features of <b>analogue</b> <b>magnetic</b> recording, particularly the use of high-frequency bias.|$|R
50|$|Tape hiss is {{the high}} {{frequency}} noise present on <b>analogue</b> <b>magnetic</b> tape recordings caused {{by the size of}} the magnetic particles used to make the tape. Effectively it is the noise floor of the recording medium. It can be reduced by the use of finer magnetic particles or by increasing the amount of tape used per second to record a signal. It can also be reduced by increasing the track width of the recording. A 3 dB reduction in hiss occurs for every doubling of the track width.|$|R
