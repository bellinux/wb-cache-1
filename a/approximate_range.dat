25|$|A 2009 U.S. study {{based on}} 2006 data {{estimated}} {{the prevalence of}} ASD in 8-year-old children to be 9.0 per 1,000 (<b>approximate</b> <b>range</b> 8.6–9.3).

500|$|The {{main battery}} of the Fuji class {{consisted}} of four hydraulically operated Elswick Ordnance Company 40-calibre Type 41 twelve-inch guns mounted in pear-shaped twin-gun barbettes {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. The barbettes had a firing arc of 240° and the guns had a maximum elevation of +15° and could depress to −5°. These barbettes had armoured hoods, or turrets, to protect the guns. The mountings were virtually identical to those used in the first Majestic-class battleships, which could only hoist ammunition from the below-decks magazines in one position. However, 18 shells were stowed in each turret that allowed {{a limited amount of}} firing at any angle before their ammunition supply needed to be replenished. The guns were loaded at a fixed angle of 1° and fired [...] projectiles at a muzzle velocity of [...] This gave them an <b>approximate</b> <b>range</b> of [...]|$|E
500|$|The German minesweepers {{made good}} progress, despite minor damage from shell {{splinters}} and numerous near misses by Slava, Grazhdanin, Bayan, and the Russian shore batteries. During this period Slavas front turret became inoperable when a bronze {{rack and pinion}} gear bent so that the gear wheel could not be moved. Only eleven shots had been fired between the two guns in the turret before the breakdown. Slava and her consorts were ordered north to allow the crews to eat lunch, but returned to the fray and opened fire on the minesweepers again at 10:04 with her rear turret at an <b>approximate</b> <b>range</b> of [...] The minesweepers had cleared a channel to the north while the Russians were eating and the dreadnoughts took advantage of it to engage the Russian pre-dreadnoughts. König opened fire on Slava at 10:14 and hit her with three shells from her third salvo. The first hit Slavas bow, [...] below the waterline, and exploded in the bow dynamo room, flooding that room, the forward 12-inch magazine and other bow compartments, while the second penetrated the capstan flat. The ship took on [...] of water which gave her a list of 8°, later reduced to 4° by counter-flooding. This also increased her forward draft to about [...] The third shell hit the port side armor abreast the engine room, but failed to penetrate. Two more shells struck her at 10:24 in the superstructure near the forward funnel. They damaged a six-inch magazine and the forward stokehold (boiler room) and started a fire which was put out after about fifteen minutes. However, the forward left six-inch magazine was flooded as a precaution. At 10:39 two more shells hit her, killing three men in the boiler room and flooding a coal bunker. Around this time Slava and her compatriots were ordered to retire to the north while Bayan trailed behind to divert fire from the battleships.|$|E
