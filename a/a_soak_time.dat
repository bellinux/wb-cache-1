40|$|Traps {{are used}} by artisanal fishers as fishing gear in places where other fishing {{modalities}} are impeded or limited. The advantage {{of this type of}} fishing modality is the possibility of keeping fish alive {{and in the case of}} capturing species of low commercial value or size below the permitted minimum this fishing gear allows the release of such specimens back to nature, resulting in a sustainability aspect to the use of this fishing gear. This study aims to evaluate the effects of different attractors and times of submersion on the efficiency of the traps used. Sardines, shrimps and trash fish were employed as attractors. To evaluate the soak time, two periods were tested: 24 and 96 hours. The sardines, used as the attractor, resulted in a production of 1, 296. 4 ± 397. 4 g, significantly superior (p < 0. 05) to other attractors.

40|$|Metal {{supported}} SOFCs (m-SOFCs) {{offer the}} advantages of inexpensive metal components {{as compared to the}} more expensive rare earth materials, since the entire ceramic support layer is replaced by ferritic steels, e. g., SS 430 L, AISI 441. However, with sintering conditions for ceramic and metalliclayers being different, it is difficult to sinter all the layers at one temperature to make a fuel cell. In this work, a triple layered structure comprising porous metal support (SS 430 L), NiO + GDC (anode functional layer) and GDC (electrolyte) was co-sintered at 950 oC, with superimposed high pressure (up to 180 bar, so far), with <b>a</b> <b>soak</b> <b>time</b> of 30 minutes at this temperature and pressure, to achieve densification and interlayer bonding.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Synoptic {{surveys of}} fish assemblages {{captured}} using fyke nets typically use <b>a</b> <b>soak</b> <b>time</b> of one night. We questioned whether enough information was gained from maintaining the nets {{for a second}} night to justify both the additional effort and the resulting reduction in sites sampled per field season. We compared fyke net catches from one-night and two-night sets at Great Lakes coastal margin ecosystems. Re-setting nets for a second night increased species richness by an average (± SE) of 12 ± 0. 06 %. This translated {{to an average of}} 2. 5 ± 0. 25 additional species captured. Ordinations of the assemblage data revealed that one-night and two-night catches from the same site (catch pairs) were much more similar to each other than were catches from different sites: the Kendall’s kappa concordance values between one-night catches and their two-night pairs measured along the first three ordination axes were 80 %, 88 %, and 87 %, respectively. Catch pairs plotted more closely, Sorensen’s distances were smaller, and assem-blages were much more concordant than were pairs of catches randomly selected from different sites. Bootstrap analyses of catch species richness indicated that there was little difference between adding effort by increasing soak time versus adding effort by increasing the number of nets. Our data indicate that one- and two-night sets generally produce comparable assemblage data. For synoptic studies, the increase in statistical power gained by increasing the number of sites sampled will typically be more important than the moderate amount of additional information acquired by fishing sites for a second night...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for the commercialization of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is the limited lifetime due to degradation processes of the different fuel cell components. The investigation of the underlying degradation mechanisms and mitigation strategies for fuel cell operation and for material development are key factors for PEMFC research and development. This presentation is focused on reversible and irreversible degradation phenomena in PEMFCs. A new systematic approach {{for the analysis of}} reversible and irreversible degradation rates in an operating fuel cell will be introduced. A detailed description of voltage loss rates and particularly of the discrimination between reversible and irreversible voltage losses will be given. A major motivation of the presented work is the lack of common testing procedures and determination approaches of voltage losses in durability tests of fuel cell. This issue results in severe difficulties in the comparison of results obtained by different testing facilities. This is limiting factor for the development of fuel cell components because the results within different research projects cannot be correlated, especially if only one value for a degradation rate is reported, e. g. for defined current density and defined test operating conditions. In order to systematically analyze voltage losses durability measurements of several hundreds of hours were performed in PEMFC single cells and stacks. Specific test protocols containing regular refresh procedures were used for this purpose. This enables to distinguish between reversible and irreversible voltage losses. To test the refresh procedures and analyze their effect on cell performance, parameters such as the duration of e. g. <b>a</b> <b>soak</b> <b>time</b> step have been varied.

40|$|Electronic {{systems are}} {{required}} to operate under extreme temperatures in NASA planetary exploration and deep space missions. Electronics on-board spacecraft must also tolerate thermal cycling between extreme temperatures. Thermal management means are usually included in today s spacecraft systems to provide adequate temperature for proper operation of the electronics. These measures, which may include heating elements, heat pipes, radiators, etc., however add to the complexity {{in the design of}} the system, increases its cost and weight, and affects its performance and reliability. Electronic parts and circuits capable of withstanding and operating under extreme temperatures would reflect in improvement in system s efficiency, reducing cost, and improving overall reliability. Semiconductor chips based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology are designed mainly for high temperature applications and find extensive use in terrestrial well-logging fields. Their inherent design offers advantages over silicon devices in terms of reduced leakage currents, less power consumption, faster switching speeds, and good radiation tolerance. Little is known, however, about their performance at cryogenic temperatures and under wide thermal swings. Experimental investigation on the operation of SOI, N-channel field effect transistors under wide temperature range was reported earlier [1]. This work examines the performance of P-channel devices of these SOI transistors. The electronic part investigated in this work comprised of a Cissoid s CHT-PMOS 30, high temperature P-channel MOSFET (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) device [2]. This high voltage, medium-power transistor is designed for geothermal well logging applications, aerospace and avionics, and automotive industry, and is specified for operation in the temperature range of - 55 C to + 225 C. Table I shows some specifications of this transistor [2]. The CHT-PMOS 30 device was characterized at various temperatures over the range of - 190 C to + 225 C in terms of its voltage/current characteristic curves. The test temperatures included + 22, - 50, - 100, - 150, - 175, - 190, + 50, + 100, + 150, + 175, + 200, and + 225 C. Limited thermal cycling testing was also performed on the device.

A major motivation of the presented work is the lack of common description procedures and determination approaches of voltage losses in durability tests of fuel cell. This issue results in severe difficulties in the comparison of results obtained by different testing facilities or within different research projects especially if only one value for a degradation rate is reported. In order to systematically analyze voltage losses we have performed single cell durability measurements of several hundreds of hours in 25 cm 2 lab-scale cells.

Ex-situ methods were used to determine the causes for the reversible and irreversible voltage losses.

40|$|Two {{monkfish}} {{species are}} caught {{off the coast}} of Namibia. These are Lophius vomerinus Valenciennes (1837) and L. vaillanti Regan (1903). L. vomerinus is the more abundant of the two and contributes approximately 99 % to the total Namibian monkfish landings. The Namibian monkfish fishery {{is one of the largest}} and most valuable of its kind in the world. Two fishing fleets harvest the resource, viz. the monkfish and sole fleet and the hake directed fleet. In 1998 and 1999, monkfish were also harvested by one gillnet vessel that had an experimental right. In this study, the biology, abundance and exploitation patterns of monkfish were investigated and used as inputs into a stock assessment framework as a contribution towards the development of a management procedure for this species. Ground and sectioned otoliths and sectioned illicia were used to age Lophius vomerinus. The illicia provided more precise estimates of age, and growth was subsequently modelled using these age estimates. Growth in length and weight was best described by the threeparameter specialised von Bertalanffy model as Lt (cm TL) = 72. 29 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁴⁽t⁺°·³°⁾) and Wt (kg) = 3. 96 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁸⁽t⁺°·¹°⁾) ²·⁹⁹ for males, and Lt (cm TL) = 111. 98 (1 -e⁻°·°⁸⁽t⁺°·³⁶⁾) and Wt (kg) = 6. 92 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁸⁽t⁻°·⁶⁴⁾) ³·°³ for females. L. vomerinus is a slow-growing species with a life span in excess of 10 years. Reproductive activity was shown to occur throughout the year, with a slight peak during the winter months. The adult sex ratio of fish > 37 cm TL was biased towards females. Length-at- 50 % sexual maturity was attained at 32. 1 cm TL for females and 23. 7 cm TL for males. The rate of natural mortality was estimated at 0. 15 year⁻¹, while fishing mortality rates during the 1970 s, 1980 s and 1990 s were estimated at 0. 01 year⁻¹, 0. 04 year⁻¹ and 0. 14 year⁻¹, respectively. Gillnetting for monkfish (300 mm stretched mesh) was highly efficient with a moderate bycatch of around 20 % during the two years of operation. The main bycatch species were red crab, spider crab, squalid sharks, rays and Cape and Deep-water hake. The mean length of the monkfish caught in gillnets (67 cm TL) was significantly larger than the monkfish landed by the trawlers (38 cm TL) and less than 1 % of immature fish were landed. Gillnet catch-per-unit-effort for monkfish fluctuated between 0. 03 and 0. 67 kg. day⁻¹. 50 m net panel⁻¹, with <b>a</b> <b>soak</b> <b>time</b> of between one and sixteen days. More than 50 % (by weight) of monkfish landed by monkfish and sole trawlers, consisted of fish below 36 cm TL. There was a significant increase in catches of juvenile monkfish during 1997 and 1998 in comparison to the period 1994 to 1996. Various types of rigid sorting grids were tested to release juvenile monkfish below 32 cm TL. Five grid designs were tested. These included an “Ex-it” grid with horizontal bars spaced at 55 mm, single grids with vertical and horizontal bars spaced at 55 mm and grids with circular openings of 110 and 168 mm in diameter. The most efficient design was the grid with circular openings of 110 cm in diameter, which ensured the escape of 66 % of monkfish smaller than 31 cm TL. However, studies need to be undertaken to quantify the survival of released fish and to test the feasibility of using grid sorters on commercial monkfish and sole trawling gear. The monkfish resource was assessed by means of length cohort analyses, the Thompson and Bell predictive model and by way of a deterministic age-structured production modelling approach. The length cohort analysis models were sensitive to the rate of natural mortality and insensitive to changes in the terminal fishing mortality rate. These biases may, however, not be serious provided that estimates of abundance are used to reflect relative changes. Fish ranging between 26 and 59 cm TL are the most heavily exploited. The Thompson and Bell model predicted that the monkfish resource is exploited above MSY -levels and a reduction of approximately 40 % in fishing effort would provide a higher yield. Yield-per-recruit ranged between 10 000 and 14 000 tonnes. Results should, however, be treated with caution, as the condition of steady state was not satisfied. The age-structured production model was tuned using trends in catch-per-unit-effort data, estimated by Generalised Linear Modeling, as well as relative abundance indices calculated from hake biomass surveys. The model was found to be sensitive to both the ‘steepness’ parameter h and estimates of natural mortality. The ‘depletion’ level of the monkfish resource is currently estimated to be 49 %. Estimated coefficients of variation were high (> 63 %) due to the lack of a consistent trend within the abundance indices to tune the model. Overall productivity of the monkfish resource was estimated to be approximately 16 %, similar to other southern African demersal resources. Results of the risk analyses suggest that catches in excess of 7 000 tonnes may be unsustainable and that catches of 5 000 or 6 000 tonnes would decrease the risk of stock collapse and possibly lead to a recovery in the stock. Monkfish management strategies were reviewed and these were considered in relation to the results of this study. The following management recommendations were made: to follow the precautionary approach and implement a total allowable catch for monkfish; to implement rigid sorting grids as these would be the most appropriate way in which to reduce catches of juvenile monkfish; to restrict soak time, depth of operation and implement means to reduce ‘ghost fishing’ by gillnetting and finally, to develop a management procedure for Namibian monkfish with the main objective being the sustainable exploitation of the resource...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of an upper bound for the separation performance of polymeric membranes has motivated {{the development of new}} membrane materials with improved separation performance. Inorganic porous membranes like carbon molecular sieve (CMS) or zeolites have superior separation performance compared to polymeric membranes, but a challenging and costly manufacturing process have limited the commercialization of these membranes so far. Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) consisting of porous inorganic particle dispersed in a polymer matrix have been suggested as a way to produce a membrane with good mechanical properties and enhanced separation performance compared to polymeric membranes. Increasing amount of research during the last 20 years has revealed several factors that are important in order to produce MMMs with properties exceeding the Robeson upper line for polymer membranes. The most essential and challenging task seems to be to achieve good adhesion of polymer onto the particle surface and avoid formation of defects at the interface. In this study, two alternative methods for production of defect free MMMs were evaluated; in-situ carbonization and in-situ polymerization. In addition, the production of CMSMs from the new precursor material chitosan was evaluated, including pyrolysis at intermediate temperatures to produce CMSMs with reduced brittleness. CMSMs were prepared from the precursor material; chitosan. CMSMs prepared by pyrolysis of chitosan had separation properties exceeding Robeson upper bound for polymer membranes for several gas pairs. The effects of chitosan molecular weight, casting temperature and casting with different solvents were evaluated and based on the results a procedure for preparation of chitosan precursor films was selected. The effects of final pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and pyrolysis atmosphere were also investigated. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that chitosan decomposes between 240 - 400 °C. The permeability results showed that a pore structure was developed already at 300 °C while the highest CO 2 permeability was measured for a CMSM prepared at 650 °C when prepared under vacuum pyrolysis. Increasing the heating rate resulted in an increased permeability of the CMSMs. Pyrolysis in CO 2 atmosphere, a mild oxidizing atmosphere, was expected to increase the permeability of the CMS membrane, but instead the CMSMs produced in CO 2 at 650 or 750 °C showed lower permeability than the membrane prepared with vacuum pyrolysis with the same pyrolysis protocol. In-situ carbonization : Comparison of the thermal stability of chitosan and the polyimide Matrimid® showed that while the main weight loss for chitosan takes place between 240 and 400 °C, Matrimid was thermally stable up to ~ 500 °C. This observation was used to produce a “MMM” by in-situ carbonization of chitosan in a blend of chitosan and Matrimid at a pyrolysis temperature below the thermal decomposition temperature of Matrimid. Blend membranes with 90 : 10. 70 : 30, 60 : 40 : 20 : 80, 10 : 90 chitosan:Matrimid ratio were prepared. The 70 : 30 and 60 : 40 chitosan:Matrimid film showed large degree of phase separation and consequently had lower mechanical strength than the other precursor films. The blend films were pyrolysed at 400 °C with <b>a</b> <b>soak</b> <b>time</b> of 0, 50 or 150 min. The separation performances of the resulting membranes were close to or slightly above the Robeson 1991 upper bound. The only solvent that was found to dissolve both polymers was trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), but this solvent also affected the mechanical and separation properties of Matrimid. The films with 80, 90 and 100 % Matrimid turned out to be non-selective. In-situ polymerization of a monomer with dispersed CMS particles was evaluated as an alternative method to produce MMMs with good polymer-sieve contact. Several liquid monomers were evaluated based on their ability to disperse the CMS particles as well as separation performance of the polymers. Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) prepared from monomers with 9 (EGDMA- 9) or 14 (EGDMA- 14) ethylene oxide units was found to be the most suitable monomer/polymer. CMS particles (M 650) were prepared from Matrimid, since the CMSMs prepared from chitosan had too low permeability to match the high permeability of the PEGDMA matrix. Separation into a polymer rich layer at the top and a CMS rich layer at the bottom during polymerization was found to be a problem. Faster formation of the membranes by increasing the polymerization rate was investigated as a method to fix the particles in the film and improve CMS distribution. Parameters like initiator type, initiator concentration, initiation method and polymerization temperature were evaluated. For UV initiated in-situ polymerization of PEGDMA 9 /M 650, two of the initiators (2, 2 '-Azobisisobutyronitrile (I- 1) and 4 -(dimethylamino) -benzophenone (I- 2)) resulted in a layered structure while (2 -benzyl- 2 -dimethylamino- 4 -morpholinobutyrophenone (I- 3)) resulted in MMMs with the CMS particle concentrated {{in the middle of the}} film. This film had no defects or holes and the permeability tests showed an increase in separation performance compared to the pure PEGDMA- 9 membrane. No significant difference in distribution of CMS particles was observed when different amount of initiator was used (0. 3, 0. 6 to 1. 2 wt%). For thermally initiated polymerization, increasing the amount of initiator from 0. 3 to 0. 6 wt% and polymerization temperature from 80 to 100 °C, resulted in a more uniform distribution of M 650 within the PEGDMA- 9 matrix. MMMs with good distribution of CMS particles were also produced by in-situ polymerization of PEGDMA- 14 under the same conditions. However, all the MMMs prepared by heat initiated in-situ polymerization contained small holes and defects. Changing initiator to from I- 1 to I- 4 (benzoyl peroxide), did not changed the distribution of CMS particles, despite the longer half-time of this initiator, indicating the initiation rate and polymerization rate is fast enough to fix the particles in the polymer and prevent formation of a layered structure. Addition of CMS particles resulted in a higher H 2 permeability and H 2 /CH 4 selectivity for all the MMMs compared to the pure PEGDMA films. However, for the gas pair CO 2 /CH 4, separation performance was more influenced by the preparation conditions and the distribution of CMS particles within the film. While a uniform distribution of particle was expected to give the highest raise in separation performance, the PEGDMA- 9 / 17 vol%M 650 MMM with best distribution of M 650 particles showed only a neglectable change in separation performance for the gas pair CO 2 /CH 4 indicating that other factors are influencing the transport. For MMMs prepared from PEGDMA- 14, the separation performance for the gas pair H 2 /CH 4 agreed very well with the predictions by Maxwell’s model based on the separation properties of the pure phases. The addition of M 650 to PEGDMA- 14 also resulted in a higher CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity that generally increased with increasing loading up to 39 vol%, while the CO 2 permeability was approximately unchanged. Rigidified zones of polymer around the particles with reduced mobility and/or partial blockage of the pores are suggested as reasons for why the permeability was lower than expected for CO 2, assuming that H 2 is too small to be influenced by any of the two phenomena to a large degree. The PEGDMA- 14 /M 650 MMMs had separation properties close to the Robeson 1991 upper bound and the best MMM has separation performance within the zone that is considered industrial applicable. For the best MMM, the H 2 permeability (35 °C, 2 bar) increased with 241 % (from 11 to 39 Barrer) and the H 2 /CH 4 selectivity increased with 416 % (from 3. 1 to 16), while the CO 2 permeability increased with 15 % (from 68 to 78) and the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity increased with 74 % (from 19 to 33) compared to the pure PEGDMA- 14 membrane. The selectivity increased further when the temperature for the permeability test was decreased from 35 to ~ 23 °C.

Silica {{is added to}} the BaTiO 3 -based powder prepared by the solid state method with 0. 075 mol%, 0. 15 mol%, and 0. 3 mol%, respectively. The SiO 2 -doped BaTiO 3 -based ceramic with high density and uniform grain size were obtained, which were sintered in reducing atmosphere. A scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, and electric properties measure were used to determine the microstructure, as well as the dielectric properties. SiO 2 can form a liquid phase belonging to the ternary system BaO-TiO 2 -SiO 2, leading to the formation of BaTiO 3 ceramics with high density at a lower sintering temperature.

The chlorination of the samples was carried out at temperatures between 400 to 500 °C. Effects of three parameters, namely temperature, <b>soaking</b> <b>time,</b> and molar ratio of potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) to hydrochloric acid (HCl) were investigated. The interaction, on the rate of chlorination of TiC were statistically evaluated by using DOE. The weight loss (wt. %) was the main response taken into account in this paper. The results of the experimental design indicated that the main significant factor for chlorination of TiC was higher temperature, <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> and higher molar ratio of KMnO 4 to HCl. DOE results have demonstrated that the highest extent of chlorination obtained at the highest weight loss (wt. %) was about 54. 59 wt. % at 500 °C with <b>a</b> <b>soaking</b> <b>time</b> of 180 minutes and KMnO 4 to HCl molar ratio of 0. 17 respectively.
