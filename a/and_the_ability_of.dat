5|$|Within {{the context}} of the battle itself, the failure of the Red Army to {{properly}} regroup during the prelude to the battle <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> the Germans to effectively collect intelligence on Soviet movements {{played an important role in}} the outcome. Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka and front headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite this poor performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.|$|E
5|$|Zoologists have {{frequently}} mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed {{one after another}} of his more surprising claims, including the active camouflage of the octopus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> elephants to snorkel with their trunks while swimming. The evolutionary zoologist Armand Leroi has taken an interest in Aristotle's biology.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the derivation capability of verbs motivated by substantives with the word-formation meaning ‘to {{work with a}} tool, named by a word-forming noun’ with suffix -ува-/-юва- in the Ukrainian language. The author claims that the typical word-forming paradigm is formed of three word-formation zones: substantive, adjective, and verbal. Within each zone, a continuum of word-forming derivatives is distinguished, a set of word-forming devices for their realizations is determined, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> {{some of them to}} express additional lexical meanings are traced...|$|R
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia {{was never able to}} win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a {{time when}} the British were {{examining}} and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the poor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.|$|E

5|$|On 11 January 2010, {{shortly before}} an {{announcement}} that Red Football's debt had increased to £716.5million ($1.17billion), Manchester United announced {{their intention to}} refinance the debt through a bond issue worth approximately £500million. They managed to raise £504million in just under two weeks, meaning {{that they were able}} to pay off almost all of the £509million owed to international banks. The bonds were issued in two tranches, one with a coupon rate of 8.75% worth £250million, and the other with a coupon rate of 8.375% worth $425million. The annual interest payable on the bond came to approximately £45million per annum, with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017. Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants that would allow the Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015. These include the carving out of £95million in cash, the sale and lease-back of the Trafford Training Centre at Carrington, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> the Glazers to pay themselves 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the club every year.|$|E
5|$|The last-ditched {{effort by}} the Germans {{to win the war}} came to a {{grinding}} halt in mid-July and after that there followed a brief period of lull, during which time the Australians undertook a series of small unit actions aimed at capturing parts of the German line with limited support. These actions became known as Peaceful Penetrations and were essentially a cross between trench raids and patrolling. Their success relied heavily upon the leadership and initiative of junior commanders <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> soldiers to employ principles of fire and manouevre. This lull did not last long, however, as the Allies were soon ready to launch their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which would ultimately bring about an end to the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the {{campaign}} against the Dutch squadron in the East Indies allowed British forces in the Indian Ocean to focus exclusively on the French islands of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France, which proved very difficult to subdue during the ensuing Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811. Freedom of movement for British forces in the East Indies proved invaluable however: on 27 January 1807, Peter Rainier in Caroline had seized a Spanish ship San Raphael carrying over half a million Spanish dollars and an exceptionally valuable cargo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> British commerce raiders to act against French, Spanish and Dutch merchant shipping in the region was assured. When Pellew's successor Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury attempted to eliminate the Dutch East Indies islands {{in a series of}} large scale invasions during 1810 and 1811, British naval movements were completely unopposed, allowing a rapid and successful conclusion to the war in the Pacific.|$|E
