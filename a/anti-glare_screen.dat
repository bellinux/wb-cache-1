5000|$|Since the {{aluminum}} and glass models were launched on October 14, 2008, Apple removed the matte, <b>anti-glare</b> <b>screen</b> panels in its Cinema Display lineup, {{except for the}} 30" [...] Cinema Display. Apple moved away from matte screens in its line of iMac desktop computers on August 7, 2007. Apple no longer offers any equipment with a matte, <b>anti-glare</b> <b>screen</b> after the 15" [...] non-Retina MacBook Pro was discontinued in October 2013. This has caused concern among users who want matte screens for their particular area of work, particularly graphic designers, photographers and users who extensively view their screens. Matte screens, like matte-surface photographs, diffuse reflected light and so cannot provide for as deep blacks as glossy screens.|$|E

This can be mitigated {{by the use of}} materials with optical coatings designed to reduce the visible effects of fingerprint oils, or oleophobic coatings as most of the modern smartphones, which lessen the actual amount of oil residue (which includes alcohol), or by installing a matte-finish <b>anti-glare</b> <b>screen</b> protector, which creates a slightly roughened surface that does not easily retain smudges.|$|E
50|$|All CP/M Eagles had {{the same}} basic design, except for the storage devices. The {{exception}} to this was a portable model, in which the keyboard formed a removable lid that could be snapped to the main unit for traveling. An attractive off-white case held the entire computer. The top section held a green monochrome monitor on the left, {{and one or two}} full-height storage devices, stacked one above the other, on the right. An <b>anti-glare</b> <b>screen</b> was held in place against the front of the monitor, and the front of the top section shut, by a black plastic bezel. This bezel snapped into place. The back of this section held a fan right behind the drive enclosure, and a silver label behind the monitor with the company logo and address, the model number, serial number, voltage, frequency, and current.|$|E

40|$|An {{expedient}} for {{decreasing the}} hindrance of glare {{for the road}} user by oncoming traffic is the installation of <b>anti-glare</b> <b>screens</b> on the central reserve. The efficiency of these screens is studied, just as the driver behaviour to use headlights or dipped headlights when these screens are present. Results of English and American studies are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: With {{increasing}} use {{of computers}} by young adults in educational institutions {{as well as at}} home {{there is a need to}} investigate whether students are adopting ergonomic principles when using computers. Objective: To assess the practice of students on ergonomic principles while working on computers and their association with the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students using pre-tested structured questionnaire on the demographic profile, practice of ergonomic principles and symptoms of CVS experienced while on continuous computer work within the past one month duration. Results: Out of 416 students studied, 50 % of them viewed computer at a distance of 20 to 28 inches, 61 % viewed the computer screen at the same level, 42. 8 % placed the reference material between monitor and key board, 24. 5 % tilted screen backward, 75. 7 % took frequent breaks and 56. 0 % blinked frequently to prevent CVS. Students who viewed the computer at a distance of less than 20 inches, viewed upwards or downwards to see the computer, who did not avoid glare and did not took frequent breaks were at higher risk of developing CVS. Students who did not used adjustable chair, height adjustable keyboard and <b>anti-glare</b> <b>screen</b> were at higher risk of developing CVS. Conclusion: The students who were not practicing ergonomics principle and did not check posture and make ergonomic alteration were at higher risk of developing CVS. Keywords: Ergonomic principles, computer vision syndrome, undergraduate students. [Natl J Med Res 2013; 3 (2. 000) : 111 - 116...|$|E
