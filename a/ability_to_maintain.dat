5|$|Early in his career, Sanchez {{was praised}} for his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> {{composure}} {{in the pocket}} amidst defensive pressure and focus on finding an open receiver to extend the team's offensive series. In his four-year career, Sanchez has had ten fourth quarter comebacks and twelve game winning drives. These characteristics were highlighted by Bill Parcells and Sam Wyche and garnered comparisons to Ben Roethlisberger. Sanchez was also noted for his proficiency in short passing situations and competitive nature; in December 2010, following dismal performances, Rex Ryan threatened to reduce Sanchez's repetitions with the first team offense during practice which infuriated Sanchez.|$|E

Furthermore, studies have revealeddifferences in these characteristics among certain groups (e. g., less-educated and older patients).

Green is one of the Christmas colors as well, possibly dating back to pre-Christian times, when evergreens were worshiped for their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> their color through the winter season. Romans used green holly and evergreen as decorations for their winter solstice celebration called Saturnalia, which eventually evolved into a Christmas celebration.

5|$|Some of the kingdoms paying {{tribute to}} the Tang dynasty {{included}} Kashmir, Nepal, Khotan, Kucha, Kashgar, Korea, Champa, and kingdoms located in Amu Darya and Syr Darya valley. Turkic nomads addressed the Emperor of Tang China as Tian Kehan. After the widespread Göktürk revolt of Shabolüe Khan (d. 658) was put down at Issyk Kul in 657 by Su Dingfang (591–667), Emperor Gaozong established several protectorates governed by a Protectorate General or Grand Protectorate General, which extended the Chinese sphere of influence as far as Herat in Western Afghanistan. Protectorate Generals were given {{a great deal of}} autonomy to handle local crises without waiting for central admission. After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{denominations}} issued in late-2008 {{as well as the}} suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes denominated from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes reused paper for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20000, $50000 and $500000 banknotes.|$|E

Greek politics in this era was based on affiliations with the three Great Powers, and Otto's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> {{the support of the}} powers was key to his remaining in power. To remain strong, Otto had to play the interests of each of the Great Powers' Greek adherents against the others, while not aggravating the Great Powers. When Greece was blockaded by the British Royal Navy in 1850 and again in 1854, to stop Greece from attacking the Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War, Otto's standing amongst Greeks suffered. As a result, there was an assassination attempt on the Queen, and finally in 1862 Otto was deposed while in the countryside. He died in exile in Bavaria in 1867.|$|E

His death {{weakened}} the Abbasid government's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> its independence against the rising {{power of the}} Buyids, who under Ahmad ibn Buya had already consolidated control over Fars and Kerman, and secured {{the cooperation of the}} Barids. Al-Mustakfi's secretary, Ibn Shirzad, tried to confront the Buyids by calling upon Nasir al-Dawla, but Ahmad advanced on Baghdad with his troops, and in January 946 he obtained his appointment as amir al-umara with the honorific Mu'izz al-Dawla ("Strengthener of the State"). To secure their position, the Buyids immediately marched against the Hamdanids. Nasir al-Dawla countered by marching down the eastern bank of the Tigris river and blockading Baghdad. In the end, however, the Buyids defeated the Hamdanids in battle and forced Nasir al-Dawla to retire to Ukbara. From there, Nasir al-Dawla began negotiations with the Buyids, aiming to secure recognition of Hamdanid control over the Jazira, Syria and even Egypt as tributaries of the Caliphate, with the boundary between Buyid and Hamdanid spheres placed at Tikrit. Negotiations were disrupted by a rebellion among the Hamdanids' Turkish troops, but Mu'izz al-Dawla, who for the moment preferred a stable Hamdanid state to anarchy on his northern border, helped Nasir al-Dawla suppress it. The peace was agreed on the terms outlined above, and was affirmed by one of Nasir al-Dawla's sons being taken as a hostage to Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E
