5|$|Saudis and Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans, rapidly spiraling the country into a full-scale war, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North Yemen.|$|E
5|$|When all {{the ballots}} were counted, fewer than 2,000 votes {{separated}} Garfield and Hancock, the closest popular vote of any American presidential election before or since. The voters showed {{their interest in}} the election by turning out in record numbers; 78 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, among largest percentages in American history. Each major party candidate earned just over 48 percent of the vote. Weaver won more than 3 percent, tripling the Greenback total of four years earlier. The other minor party candidates fared far worse, as Dow and Phelps earned 0.1 and 0.01 percent, respectively. The narrow victory carried over into the Congressional vote, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> won the House by a twelve-seat margin and the Senate was evenly divided. Garfield carried the crucial state of New York by 20,000 votes out of 1.1 million cast there. Other states were much closer; Hancock’s margin of victory in California was only 144 votes.|$|E
25|$|Crist {{was elected}} to a two-year term to the Florida Senate in 1992 from the 20th District, which {{encompassed}} parts of St. Petersburg and South Tampa. Crist defeated longtime incumbent Democratic State Senator Helen Gordon Davis of Tampa, 58.3 to 41.7%. Crist was able to unseat Gordon Davis following the 1992 decennial redistricting process, which significantly reconfigured the districts in the Tampa Bay area. His victory was credited with helping to end the 128-year control of the Florida Senate by the Democratic Party, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> netted three Senate seats in 1992, resulting in a 20-20 tie between the two parties.|$|E

25|$|Clinton's {{election}} ended an era {{in which}} the Republican Party had controlled the White House for 12 consecutive years, and for 20 of the previous 24 years. The election also brought the Democrats full control of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government, including both houses of U.S. Congress and the presidency, {{for the first time since}} the administration of the last Democratic president, Jimmy Carter. This would not last for very long, however, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> won control of both the House and Senate in 1994. Reelected in 1996, Clinton would become the first Democratic President since Franklin D. Roosevelt to serve two full terms in the White House.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, delegates of the Five Civilized Tribes {{met at the}} Sequoyah Convention {{to write}} a {{constitution}} for an Indian-controlled state. They wanted to have Indian Territory admitted as the State of Sequoyah. Although they took a thoroughly developed proposal to Washington, DC, seeking approval, eastern states' representatives opposed it, not wanting to have two western states created in the area, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> feared that both would be Democrat-dominated, as the territories had a southern tradition of settlement. President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, ruled that the Oklahoma and Indian territories had to be jointly admitted as one state, Oklahoma. To achieve this, tribal governments had to end and all residents accept state government. Many of the leading Native American representatives from the Sequoyah Convention participated in the new state convention. Its constitution was based on many elements of the one developed for the State of Sequoyah.|$|E
25|$|On {{election}} day, {{there was}} intimidation and fraud on all sides, employed by both parties. Edgefield and Laurens counties had more votes for Democratic candidate Wade Hampton III {{than the total}} number of registered voters in either county. The returns were disputed all the way to Washington, where they {{played a central role in}} the Compromise of 1877. Both parties claimed victory. For a while, two separate state assemblies did business side by side on the floor of the State House (their Speakers shared the Speaker's desk, but each had his own gavel), until the Democrats moved to their own building. There the Democrats continued to pass resolutions and conducted the state's business, just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were doing. The Republican State Assembly tossed out results of the tainted election and reelected Chamberlain as governor. A week later, General Wade Hampton III took the oath of office for the Democrats.|$|E

500|$|While Sam and Bruno are {{concerned}} about the loyalty of a powerful California union official (Sandoval), Toby and Josh are preparing for a meeting with the congressional opposition to re-negotiate the estate tax—or the [...] "death tax" [...] <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> have labeled it—but are then surprised by a last-minute cancellation. It soon becomes clear that the Republicans are planning to repeal the estate tax altogether, and might have the votes to do so. An attempt to win over the black caucus, led by Congressman Mark Richardson (Barry), fails. At a loss over what to do, an initiative comes from unexpected quarters. The previously over-cautious political strategist, Doug Wegland, suggests the president responds by doing something he has never done before: veto the bill.|$|E
500|$|The 1894 {{election}} campaign saw the Democrats divided, and the electorate further split {{by the new}} People's Party (or Populists), which had emerged from the agricultural discontent. There were more demands for McKinley to speak than he could possibly fulfill. Campaigning throughout {{the eastern half of}} the country on behalf of Republican candidates, and venturing even to New Orleans in the Democratic Solid South, McKinley spoke to large, enthusiastic crowds as often as 23 times in a day. According to his biographer Margaret Leech, [...] "McKinley's fervor was irresistible to his audiences. He was better than a spellbinder. He was a vote-getter. The whirlwind campaign of the Governor of Ohio was a sensation of the autumn." [...] The 1894 elections saw the Democrats suffer the greatest losses by a majority party in congressional history, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> again took control of both houses.|$|E
500|$|Democrats, {{ignoring}} the politically damaged incumbent president, Andrew Johnson, who {{had returned to}} the party, nominated Horatio Seymour for the presidency, along with Francis P. Blair as his running magte. Seymour was a wealthy conservative who came under GOP attack for weakness during the war and favoring the anti-war Copperheads. The campaigning was nasty, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> waved the [...] "bloody shirt" [...] of treason against the Democrats-as-Copperheads. Neither candidate actively campaigned, though Grant did issue a public apology to Jewish voters for his 1862 General Order No. 11 that banned Jewish merchants from his zone during the Civil War because of alleged profiteering. Grant won an overwhelming Electoral College victory, receiving 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant also received 52.7 {{percent of the popular vote}} nationwide. His margin of victory was enhanced by the fact that six southern states were controlled by Republicans who kept many ex-Confederates from voting.|$|E

500|$|Borah was {{determined}} {{to see that the}} Republican presidential candidate in 1920 was not pro-League. [...] He supported his fellow Irreconcilable, California Senator Hiram Johnson, who had been Roosevelt's running mate in 1912. Borah alleged bribery {{on the part of the}} leading candidate for the Republican nomination, General Leonard Wood, and was snubbed when he demanded to know the League views of Wood's main rival, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden. When the 1920 Republican National Convention met in Chicago in June, delegates faced a deadlock both as to who should head the ticket, and as to the contents of the League plank of the party platform. The League fight was decided, with Borah's endorsement, by using language proposed by former Secretary of State Elihu Root supporting a league, rather than the League. The presidential stalemate was harder to resolve. A hater both of political intrigue and of tobacco, Borah played no part in the smoke-filled room discussions <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> attempted to break the deadlock. [...] He was initially unenthusiastic about the eventual nominee, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, his colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, as he was disappointed at the failure of Johnson's candidacy and disliked Harding's vague stance on the League. Nevertheless, Borah strongly endorsed Harding and his running mate, Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, who were victorious. Borah later stated he would have left the Senate had Harding lost.|$|E
500|$|It {{was widely}} known that Brown desired {{election}} to the U.S. Senate when his gubernatorial term expired in 1896. The leading Democratic candidates to succeed Brown as governor were his old rivals, Cassius M. Clay, Jr. and Parker Watkins Hardin, and Brown believed he would need his eventual successor's support to secure the Senate seat. Having already alienated Hardin and his free silver allies, Brown threw his support to Clay. Family tragedy would soon remove {{his interest in the}} race, however. On October30, 1894, Brown's teenage daughter Susan died of tuberculosis. A few months later, his son, Archibald Dixon Brown, divorced his wife; it was subsequently discovered that he had been carrying on an extramarital affair. Acting on an anonymous tip, his lover's husband found the couple at a brothel in Louisville; drawing his pistol, he shot his wife and Archibald Brown, killing them both. Of the series of family tragedies, Governor Brown wrote to Clay, [...] "I shall not be a candidate for the Senate. The calamities of my children, which have recently befallen, have utterly unfitted me for the contest. My grief is so severe that, like a black vampire of the night, it seems to have sucked dry the very arteries and veins of my ambition." [...] Clay went on to lose the nomination to Hardin. Brown refused to endorse Hardin, and the fractured Democratic party watched <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> elected William O. Bradley, the party's first-ever governor of Kentucky. Despite Brown's proclaimed lack of interest in the Senate seat, he received one vote during the tumultuous 1896 Senate election to replace Senator J. C. S. Blackburn.|$|E
500|$|The first foreign {{tanks to}} enter service with the Nationalists were five Italian CV-33s, which {{arrived at the}} city of Vigo on 26 August 1936. These arrived with ten crewman, whom would serve as instructors. [...] The tanks were armed with two [...] machine guns and had a maximum of [...] of steel armor. [...] On 10 December 1936, Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini decided to send combat troops to Spain, {{in a bid to}} end the war as early as possible. These men were organized into the Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV; Volunteer Corps), {{and by the end of}} the year their ranks had swelled to an estimated 47,000 men; 20,000 of which came from the Italian Army, and 27,000 of which originated from the Blackshirts. The corps was put under the command of Italian General Mario Roatta. [...] The first major battle for the CTV came in March 1938, when it decided to engage Republican forces during the Battle of Guadalajara. A force of some 35,000 men, including 81 tanks, attacked on 8 March 1937. [...] Failing to take into account the meteorological conditions of the battlefield, by the following day the Italian troops found themselves attacking over ground that had turned into mud due to the heavy rains. [...] The slow speed of the advance allowed the Republican Air Force to persistently raid advancing Italian forces, dispersing entire columns off the main roads and forcing them to stall in the mud. A Republican counterattack on 18 March, led by Pavlov's armored brigade, forced the Italians to withdraw. [...] Nationalist air support failed to provide close air support for Italian troops because runways had become water-logged, while Italian armor proved no match against the heavier and faster T-26 and BT-5 tanks. Officially, the Italians lost an estimated 2,700 soldiers during the campaigning around Guadalajara; the Republican Army lost an estimated 4,000. [...] According to other sources, the CTV lost an estimated 5,000 casualties during the battle. [...] However, armor losses were relatively low, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> lost 7 T-26s and the Italians lost 19 CV-33s. [...] Despite this initial setback, the Italian government continued the supply of personnel and equipment to the CTV in Spain, and by late 1938 the Italian volunteer's corps was equipped with three tank battalions. By the end of the war, a total of 155 CV-33s were delivered to Spain.|$|E
