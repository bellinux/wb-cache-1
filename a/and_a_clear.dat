5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|However, in a {{long term}} war of attrition, the battle was just one more source of losses to the French when they were losing two men to one. Both the French and the Russians {{suffered}} terribly but the Russians had reserve troops, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> advantage in the logistics war. The French Army supplies came over a long road lined with hostile forces. According to Rhien, so long as the Russian Army existed the French continued to lose.|$|E
5|$|Numerous polemicists, such as Irish {{journalist}} Philip Graves in a 1921 {{article in}} The Times, and British academic Norman Cohn in his 1967 book Warrant for Genocide, have proven The Protocols {{to be both}} a hoax <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> case of plagiarism. There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist Matvei Golovinski fabricated the text for Okhrana, the secret police of the Russian Empire, {{as a work of}} counter-revolutionary propaganda prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution, by plagiarizing, almost word for word in some passages, from The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a 19th-century satire against Napoleon III of France written by French political satirist and Legitimist militant Maurice Joly.|$|E

5|$|Oakwood Cemetery is a nonsectarian rural {{cemetery}} in northeastern Troy, New York, United States. It operates {{under the direction}} of the Troy Cemetery Association, a non-profit board of directors that deals strictly with the operation of the cemetery. It was established in 1848 in response to the growing rural cemetery movement in New England and went into service in 1850. The cemetery was designed by architect John C. Sidney and underwent its greatest development in the late 19th century under superintendent John Boetcher, who incorporated rare foliage <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> landscape design strategy. Oakwood was the fourth rural cemetery opened in New York and its governing body was the first rural cemetery association created in the state.|$|E

The city was well defended on a long, narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast, but separated by marshlands. Guiscard brought his army onto the peninsula and pitched camp outside the city walls. However, as Robert's fleet sailed to Dyrrhachium, it {{was hit by a}} storm and lost several ships.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{establishing}} a republic {{instead of a}} monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority thinks that {{there will still be}} a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> majority believes that the monarchy will no longer exist a century after the poll. Public opinion is, however, certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|E

Harun was the nominal leader, but the Caliph took care to send experienced officers to accompany him.|$|E

5|$|Due to land {{interaction}} and its eyewall replacement cycle, Hurricane John weakened to a 105mph (170km/h) hurricane by late on August 31, but restrengthened {{to a major}} hurricane shortly after as its eye became better defined. After completing another eyewall replacement cycle, the hurricane again weakened to Category2 status, and on September 1, it made landfall on Cabo del Este on {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur with winds of 110mph (180km/h). John passed near La Paz as a weakening Category1 hurricane on September 2, and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter over land. John continued to weaken, and late on September 3, the system deteriorated to a tropical depression while still over land. By September 4, most of the convection decoupled from the circulation towards mainland Mexico, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> circulation had not been discernible for 24hours. Based on the disorganization of the system, the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{prediction}} of the comet's return {{proved to be}} correct, {{although it was not}} seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a retardation of 618 days. This effect was computed prior to its return (with a one-month error to 13 April) by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It {{was also one of the}} earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> demonstration of its explanatory power. The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1759.|$|E
