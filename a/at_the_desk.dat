25|$|The person {{called up}} to read from the Torah – the summons is called an aliyah and the person so honored is called an oleh – hastens from his seat to the desk, going {{directly}} to the desk without any interruptions. Although around the world, including North America, many congregations will have a trained scroll reader for the actual recitation, the very considerable honor of the reading is attributed to the oleh. If there was a previous portion read, the previous oleh then steps aside from the desk. The oleh takes his place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> facing the open scroll, the verse where his portion begins is pointed out for him, he may kiss the scroll (usually by kissing {{the corner of his}} prayer shawl or the Torah wrapping and then touching that to the margin – not the writing – of the scroll), and then he may close his eyes, or avert his face, or otherwise indicate that the blessing he is about to recite is not being read from the text of the Torah. While reciting the blessings he holds both handles of the scroll, and if the actual scroll reading is done by someone else, the oleh steps to the side but continues to hold with one hand one of the scroll's handles.|$|E

500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> would say to the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] looking around the room (he was later removed).

Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E

2500|$|After a {{demo version}} of the album was put down in Artane, Dickens {{requested}} to have it re-recorded digitally at a more professional studio as the analogue equipment used at Aigle had created an abundance of tape hiss, causing the music to suffer. Nicky found the quality of Enya's multi-track vocals had also diminished, leaving them the only option of re-recording them, though he later found digital record had lost [...] "warmth in the bottom end". With studio time booked at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London, Enya and Nicky re-recorded and mastered Watermark with Ross Cullum who carried out co-production, engineering, and mixing duties. [...] "Storms in Africa" [...] and [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] were completed on the studio's two Mitsubishi 32-track recording machines.
