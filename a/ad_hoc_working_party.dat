40|$|Master of EducationThis {{study was}} {{commissioned}} as a formative {{evaluation of the}} Austin Hospital's Community Advisory Committee (CAC) and its <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> The CAC was the Hospital's attempt to establish and develop dialogue with its community. Also the structure provided {{a model for other}} Victorian hospitals attempting to establish interaction with their communities. The aim of the study was twofold: to investigate the successes and identify areas for improvement in the operation of the CAC; and to develop a provisional normative theory for the development and operation of a hospital and community advisory structure of this kind. Questionnaires and interviews of key informants were used to gather information. Content analysis was used to organise the data into meaningful categories. Findings from the questionnaire related to four areas: membership and structure of the CAC and its working parties; the terms of reference of the CAC; the mode of operation of the CAC and its working parties; and future directions of the CAC and its <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> Members found that the CAC provided a unique opportunity to discuss, debate and share information with a diverse range of health advisers, planners and providers. But a strong need was expressed for further consumer and community representation on the Committee. Perceptions differed about the success of the Committee and its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> in meeting the terms of reference. Underlying these differences may be the need for stronger communication between the Hospital Board of Management, the Committee and its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> to ensure members are equally informed. Members strongly valued the opportunity to act on issues rather than just discuss areas of concern. The <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> were perceived to be the main strength of the Committee structure due to their action orientation. Suggestions for future directions of the. Committee and its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> ranged from improving service provision to issues such as consumer rights and resource allocation. The interviews gathered important additional information in three main areas: communication; commitment; and the direction of the <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> Analysis of this data flagged the following issues: i) the need for stronger communication between the CAC and the <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> including the vital role of the Chairs of the <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> in providing leadership and communication; ii) concern about the apparently centralised role of the Chair of the CAC; iii) the need for selection criteria for the Chairs and members of the CAC structure; and, iv) the importance of orientation, training and continuing education of members. Significantly, some of the most successful projects of the CAC were linked to the notion of the Hospital responding {{to the needs of the}} community. Following discussion of the findings, several conclusions were drawn. These include the need to: i) adequately resource the CAC and its working parties; ii) strengthen the role of the community in the areas of policy and planning, funding and service provision; iii) improve the consumer and broad community representation on the CAC and working parties; iv) strengthen linkages to the Hospital's Board of Management; v) address the issues of the balance of power on the CAC together with empowering CAC and <b>working</b> <b>party</b> members; vi) undertake annual planning and evaluation sessions, with the emphasis on actionorientation and responding to the needs of the community; vii) ensure the Chairs of the CAC and its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> have adequate leadership skills; and, viii) develop orientation, training and continuing education programs for members. The evaluation provided the opportunity to propose a normative program theory for the development and operation of a successful hospital community advisory structure. The model was based on a concept map using the four levels of principles, structures, mechanisms and outcomes. This map is an overall conceptual framework for the development and operation of a hospital community advisory committee. Further it may be used to improve the function of a community advisory structure that is already operating. It was theorised that the successful development and operation of such a structure is based on the following principles: participation; accountability; equity; and access. The structure consists of a main committee, chaired by a committed, skilled senior hospital person, and relevant standing and <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> chaired by skilled and committed community leaders. Members of the committee and its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> can include: members of the hospital board of management; consumer representatives; hospital and community managers; hospital and community service providers; and local government councillors and health care workers. Members of the committee and its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> can take a range of actions to contribute to the desired outcomes for the hospital and the community. These include: assessing the needs and problems of the community; developing goals and objectives; planning and implementing policies, programs or services; evaluating projects; and participating in orientation, training and continuing education of members. These activities can be undertaken in the key areas of: policy making and planning; funding; and service provision. The activities in the aforementioned areas may be implemented in the fields of: health education and health promotion; patient care; rehabilitation, domiciliary and palliative care; and health care of disadvantaged groups. The desired outcomes can include: less inappropriate hospital admissions; improved discharge planning; enhanced continuity of care; and diminished duplication in service provision. Overall the result can be a more responsive, effective, efficient and higher quality health care for the consumers of health care services. Many of the aspects of this framework remain problematic. For example, the role of the hospital in health education and health promotion and member's level of participation in policy making and planning. Further, issues such as adequate resourcing of the committee structure, the skills and commitment of the key players and issues related to the balance of power on the committee and <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> require discussion and debate. Addressing such issues remains crucial to the successful development and operation of a hospital community advisory structure and ultimately the outcomes for consumers of health care services.

40|$|The term gestational {{diabetes}} (GD) is used {{to define}} the development of abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy in women {{who did not have}} diabetes before they became pregnant. In women with unrecognised or untreated GD there is a higher risk of macrosomia and perinatal foetal death.

Thus, {{there is a need to}} recognise and manage women with GD both for their baby’s health and their own in later life. Unfortunately the criteria for the diagnosis of GD have not been uniform either in Australia or elsewhere.

40|$|Abstract. Thessaloniki, second city of Greece {{with one}} million inhabitants, owes {{its present form}} to an {{extraordinary}} sequence of events-fire and war- which restructured the city. The fire of 1917 burnt the central area and precipitated a vast reconstruction effort. While rebuilding was underway Thessaloniki was inundated by refugees of the Asia Minor war in 1922. This article presents the governmental policies employed to confront these twin dilemmas, and illustrates how through these from a basically preindustrial city with an oriental appearance and a cosmopolitan character, Thessaloniki {{was transformed into a}} modern regional metropolis. The new European plan superimposed over the old traditional city helped to foster the image of greater homogeneity while actually causing greater class stratification; physical remodelling of the city can produce serious social changes while occurring in a specific historical juncture; and even when a plan is in existence, catastrophes sometimes force the adoption of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> solutions.
