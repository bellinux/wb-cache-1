500|$|In {{his last}} years, Bax {{maintained}} a contented retirement {{for much of}} the time. Walton commented, [...] "an important cricket match at Lord's would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, [...] "I ought perhaps to be thinking of an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. [...] He wrote in 1952, [...] "I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and it is of no use to repeat myself." [...] Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 February 1886 Parnell {{declared}} {{to the voters}} of Galway that [...] "If my candidate is defeated, the news will spread round the universe that a disaster has overwhelmed Ireland. The world will say, 'Parnell is beaten. Ireland has no longer a leader.'" [...] Biggar split with Parnell over this, declaring [...] "Mr. Chairman, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is, I can't agree with what you state, and if Mr. Lynch [...] goes to the poll I'll support him!".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the speech}} Obama {{and his wife}} were interviewed by Brian Williams, and when asked about what she thought, Michelle replied, [...] "And <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is, honey, you didn't screw it up, so good job." [...] Obama said that he hoped his two daughters had watched the whole event, as their baby-sitter was {{permitted}} to let them stay up only if they watched the convention. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, called Obama after the speech and told him, [...] "You did well...I just kind of worry about you. I hope you keep your head on straight." [...] She was later quoted by a journalist: [...] "I was a little amazed. It was really quite an exceptional speech, or I'm being prejudiced, I don't know. But, to me, it was really quite exceptional." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 28, 2011, Love, Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Auf der Maur {{appeared}} at the New York screening of Schemel's documentary [...] at the Museum of Modern Art. The appearance {{was the first time}} in thirteen years that all four members appeared together in public. Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating [...] "nothing has been discussed, but I have a feeling." [...] After the screening, the four took part in a Q session where Love stated: [...] "For me, as much as I love playing with Patty – and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage – if it's not moving forward, I don't wanna do it. That's just my thing. There's rumblings; there's always bloody rumblings. But if it's not miserable and it's going forward and I'm happy with it… that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about that question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{release of}} the work, Anger was arrested on {{obscenity}} charges. He was acquitted, after the case went to the Supreme Court of California, which deemed it to be art rather than pornography. Anger made the claim to have been seventeen {{years old when he}} made it, {{despite the fact that he}} was actually twenty, presumably to present himself as more of an enfant terrible. A homoerotic work lasting only 14 minutes, Fireworks revolves around a young man (played by Anger himself) associating with various navy sailors, who eventually turn on him, stripping him naked and beating him to death, ripping open his chest to find a compass inside. Several fireworks then explode, accompanied by a burning Christmas tree and the final shot shows the young man lying in bed next to another topless man. Of this film, Anger would later state in 1966 that [...] "This flick is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about being 17, the United States Navy, American Christmas and the fourth of July." [...] He would continuously alter and adapt the film up until 1980, with it finally being distributed on VHS in 1986.|$|E
