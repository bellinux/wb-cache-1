40|$|Four {{types of}} light weight {{concrete}} (LWC) {{commonly used in}} Hong Kong, namely, <b>autoclave</b> <b>aerated</b> <b>concrete</b> (plus lime), <b>autoclave</b> <b>aerated</b> <b>concrete</b> (plus Pulverized Fuel Ash or PFA), concrete with synthetic aggregate ‘Leca’ and concrete with polystyrene bean as aggregate were measured for their 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K contents using high-resolution gamma spectrometry. All the radionuclide contents except those for the PFA <b>autoclave</b> <b>aerated</b> <b>concrete</b> were below the world averages of building materials. The Ra-equivalents for these four LWC were 49. 6, 249, 122 and 44. 2 Bq kgÿ 1, respectively, and were much smaller than a recommended limit of 370 Bq kgÿ 1 for construction materials for dwellings. The gamma-dose rate for an indoor environment with partition walls built with LWC {{was estimated to be}} about 20 10 ÿ 8 Gy hÿ 1, which corresponded to a reduction in the eective dose of about 0. 25 mSv yÿ 1 when compared to that obtained for an indoor environment built with normal concrete (NC) only. The Rn exhalation rates from the three lowest Ra-equivalent LWC were calculated as 0. 509, 1. 28, and 0. 335 mBq mÿ 2 sÿ 1, respectively, which corresponded to a reduction in the indoor Rn concentration of around 14 Bq mÿ 3 and reduction in the tracheobronchial dose reaching 1 mSv yÿ 1 by using the James lung-dosimetry model, when compared to th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of measurements and developed on their basis sorption isotherms with mathematical description of the graphs obtained. The research was conducted on samples of three kinds of <b>autoclaved</b> <b>aerated</b> <b>concretes</b> with similar bulk density of approximately 600 kg/m 3, but provided by different manufacturers. The tested concretes were also different by composition of raw materials. One of the examined concretes had fly ash in its composition. The moisture sorption studies were conducted at temperature 25 oC and at six relative humidity levels φ ≈ 11, 33, 53, 75, 84, 97 %. The levels of temperature and relative humidity conditions correspond to a typical temperature/humidity conditions in which in practice commonly used <b>autoclaved</b> <b>aerated</b> <b>concretes</b> can be found. The moisture sorption content was obtained after several months of measurements at the equilibrium state. This data was then used to prepare sorption isotherms of the tested materials. The experimentally obtained data were then applied to calculate mathematical description of graphs. For this purpose three commonly known and used equations were applied: equation of Chen Y. and Chen Z., equation of Jovanovič’s for multi-layer adsorption, and Hüttig's equation. Using statistical methods the compliance of the adsorption isotherm equations was compared with experimental data. For that purpose the STATISTICA programme was used. To estimate the coefficients of the equations the authors used one of the programme modules, i. e. the non-linear estimation.

50|$|Originally Ytong <b>autoclaved</b> <b>aerated</b> <b>concrete</b> in Sweden was {{produced}} with alum shale, whose combustible carbon content was beneficial {{in the production}} process. Unfortunately, the slate deposits used for Ytong in Sweden also contain a very low level of natural uranium, which makes the material give off radioactive radon gas in the building. In 1972, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority pointed out the unsuitability of a radon-emitting construction material, {{and the use of}} alum slate in the production of Ytong ceased in 1975. By using new formulations, containing only quartz sand, calcined gypsum, lime (mineral), cement, water and aluminum powder, Ytong produced a new type of aerated concrete which no longer contains alum slate and thus has eliminated the problem of radon exposure from this raw material. The production of this white <b>autoclaved</b> <b>aerated</b> <b>concrete</b> is now state of the art and similar formulations are used by all producers around the world.|$|E

40|$|Applying an {{interior}} insulation often {{is the only}} option for a thermal retrofit, especially when heritage buildings are concerned. In doing so, the original construction becomes colder in winter and interstitial condensation may occur. The common way to avoid harmful condensation beneath the interior insulation of the external wall is the installation of a vapor barrier. Since such a barrier works both ways, it may adversely affect the drying potential of the wall during the warmer seasons. One {{way to avoid the}} problems described is the installation of {{an interior}} insulation system without a vapor barrier to the inside. Here, the effect of capillary transport in porous hydrophilic media is used to conduct condensing moisture away from the wall/insulation interface back to the surface in contact with the indoor air. Following an increasing demand, several water wicking insulation materials (e. g. Calcium-silicate, <b>Autoclave</b> <b>Aerated</b> <b>Concrete</b> based mineral foam, hydrophilic Glass fiber, Cellulose fiber) have appeared on the market. In the past, different methods have been developed to measure and describe the liquid transport properties of hydrophilic porous media. However, the evaluation of the moisture transport mechanisms and their efficiency in this special field of implementation is very complex because of the interacting vapor- and liquid moisture transfer processes. Therefore, there is no consensus yet on its determination and quantification...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a continuation of}} the investigation reported by Tawab et al. (2012). In the present investigation single and double layers of welded wire and X 8 expanded steel meshes are used to reinforce the U-shaped forms. In addition, three types of core material are used to fill the reinforced mortar forms namely; conventional <b>concrete,</b> <b>autoclaved</b> <b>aerated</b> lightweight <b>concrete</b> brick, and recycled concrete. Two types of connections between the precast permanent form and the core material are investigated namely; adhesive bonding layer between the two surfaces, and mechanical shear connectors. Because the volume fraction and specific surface area of the used reinforcing meshes in the present investigation are less than that specified by ACI (2006) and IFS (2001), the U-shaped forms were defined as reinforced mortar rather than Ferrocement forms to be consistent with the ACI and IFS definition. However, for practical application the minimum volume faction and specific area of the meshes should be observed and the U-shaped forms could be defined as ferrocement forms.|$|R

The POFA was used to replace Portland cement and Hydrated Lime at 0 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % by weight and aluminum powder was added at 0. 75 % dry weight in order to form bubbles. The compressive strength, water absorption, porosity and the thermal conductivity test were carried out after the concrete were water cured for 7 days and later being exposed to the air and water until 28 days.
