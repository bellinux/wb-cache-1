50|$|An <b>active</b> <b>window</b> is the {{currently}} focused {{window in the}} current window manager or explorer. Different window managers indicate {{the currently}}-active window in different ways and allow the user to switch between windows in different ways. For example, in Microsoft Windows, if both Notepad and Microsoft Paint are open, clicking in the Notepad window will cause that window to become active. In Windows, the <b>active</b> <b>window</b> is indicated by having a different coloured title bar. Clicking {{is not the only}} way of selecting an <b>active</b> <b>window,</b> however: some window managers (such as FVWM) make the window under the mouse pointer active—simply moving the mouse is sufficient to switch windows; a click is not needed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>active</b> <b>window</b> may {{not always}} lie {{in front of all}} other windows on the screen. The <b>active</b> <b>window</b> is simply the window to which keys typed on the {{keyboard}} are sent; it may be visually obscured by other windows. This is especially true in window managers which do not require a click to change active windows: FVWM, for example, makes active the window under the mouse cursor but does not change its Z-order (the order in which windows appear, measured from background to foreground). Instead, it is necessary to click on the border of the window to bring it to the foreground. There are also situations in click-to-focus window managers such as Microsoft Windows where the <b>active</b> <b>window</b> may be obscured; however, this is much less common.|$|E

25|$|Window {{management}} in Windows 7 has several new features: Snap maximizes a window {{when it is}} dragged {{to the top of}} the screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen, such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts.

Microsoft announced that Windows 8 would see Windows Live apps included right out-of-the-box, and would include built-in synchronization technologies powered by OneDrive (then SkyDrive).
