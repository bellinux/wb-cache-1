500|$|Weinberg {{was still}} living at home when he met Bruce Springsteen on April 7, 1974 when his band, The Jim Marino Band, were Springsteen's support at Seton Hall. Springsteen had parted ways with his drummer, Vini [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Lopez, earlier that year, and the replacement, Ernest [...] "Boom" [...] Carter, lasted only six months before leaving with pianist David Sancious to form Tone. Weinberg {{answered}} a Springsteen Village Voice newspaper ad that famously requested, [...] "no junior Ginger Bakers," [...] in reference to Ginger Baker's reputation for long drum solos. [...] Weinberg auditioned with Springsteen and the core E Street Band in mid-late August of that year at the SIR studios in Midtown Manhattan, bringing a minimalist drum kit with him consisting only of hi-hats, a snare drum and a bass drum. He knew one Springsteen song from the Marino band, [...] "Sandy", and played it. His drumming on the Fats Domino song [...] "Let the Four Winds Blow" [...] sealed the position as his. A week later he was offered the $110 per week job (US$ in [...] dollars) and he quit college immediately, about six <b>academic</b> <b>credits</b> short of a degree. Weinberg's first public performance came on September 19, 1974, at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.|$|E

In 1954, two of the nine women who were enrolled at Tech, Trombonist Teresa Thomas and flutist Paula Stevenson, became the first female members of the band. Also during his term as director, the Music Department was established under Tech's general college and participation in the band and other music programs could be counted as free elective <b>academic</b> <b>credits.</b> The band also found its first permanent home in the Crenshaw Building, which was behind the Varsity Drive-In on 3rd Street. [...] During this time the band would march through the 3rd street tunnel under the Atlanta Downtown Connector to get to the football games at Grant Field. [...] The fans would know the band was on its way because the drum corps would line the sides of the tunnel {{as the rest of the}} band marched through it. The echoing drums could be heard in the stadium. [...] Georgia Tech eventually sold the Crenshaw Building and the land to the Varsity, and the band moved into the former Church of God, on the corner of Ferst Drive and Hemphill Avenue.|$|E
