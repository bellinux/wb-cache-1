5|$|Classically, {{algebraic}} functions <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> an algebraic equation, and transcendental functions (including those discussed above) <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> some {{property that}} holds for them, {{such as a}} differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.|$|E

5|$|Complex {{powers and}} {{logarithms}} are more naturally handled as single valued functions on a Riemann surface. Single valued versions <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> choosing a sheet. The value has a discontinuity along a branch cut. Choosing {{one out of}} many solutions as the principal value leaves us with functions that are not continuous, and the usual rules for manipulating powers can lead us astray.|$|E
50|$|In {{the four}} {{survival}} function graphs shown above, {{the shape of}} the survival function <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> a particular probability distribution: survival function 1 <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> an exponential distribution, 2 <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> a Weibull distribution, 3 <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> a log-logistic distribution, and 4 <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> another Weibull distribution.|$|R

5|$|Integer {{powers of}} nonzero complex numbers <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> {{repeated}} multiplication or division as above. If i is the imaginary unit and n is an integer, then i'n equals 1, i, −1, or −i, {{according to whether}} the integer n is congruent to 0, 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. Because of this, the powers of i are useful for expressing sequences of period 4.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the Proyecto Nacional Tikal {{has defined}} the complex {{as an area}} divided into four plazas. The North, East and West Plazas <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> their {{relationship}} to the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) while the South Plaza is {{on the south side of}} Structures 6C-25 and 6C-25, themselves to the south of the Lost World Pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Perfect graphs <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> the {{properties}} that their clique number equals their chromatic number, {{and that this}} equality holds also in each of their induced subgraphs.

5|$|Enumerative {{problems}} in mathematics often concern {{a class of}} geometric objects called algebraic varieties which <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> the vanishing of polynomials. For example, the Clebsch cubic (see the illustration) is defined using a certain polynomial of degree three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.|$|E
5|$|Generalizing this problem, one can ask {{how many}} lines {{can be drawn}} on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, {{such as the one}} {{illustrated}} above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician Hermann Schubert, who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.|$|E

5000|$|... (D) König's Paradox {{was also}} {{published}} in 1905 by Julius König. All real numbers which can <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> {{a finite number}} of words form a subset of the real numbers. If the real numbers can be well-ordered, then there must be a first real number (according to this order) which cannot <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> {{a finite number of}} words.

5|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Alex George placed B. lemanniana in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles. He made it the type species of B.ser. Tetragonae, the members of which <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> their pendulous inflorescences and tetragonal limbs. He considered it closely related to B.aculeata and B.caleyi, which are smaller, more compact, shrubs with red- or pink-tinged inflorescences.|$|E
5|$|Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve {{release of}} air {{flow through the}} nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along {{both sides of the}} tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E
5|$|Sub-disciplines {{of biology}} <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> the scale at which life is studied, {{the kinds of}} organisms studied, and the methods used to study them: {{biochemistry}} examines the rudimentary chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules; cellular biology examines the basic building-block of all life, the cell; physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems; ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment; and evolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of life.|$|E

5|$|The {{interpreter}} has an object-oriented architecture. All of {{the elements}} of the Perl language—scalars, arrays, hashes, coderefs, file handles—are represented in the interpreter by C structs. Operations on these structs <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> a large collection of macros, typedefs, and functions; these constitute the Perl C API. The Perl API can be bewildering to the uninitiated, but its entry points follow a consistent naming scheme, which provides guidance to those who use it.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} after different treatments varies and {{is based}} on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate. It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.|$|E

5|$|Vector {{spaces are}} the subject of linear algebra and are well {{characterized}} by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 262 species of bird have been {{recorded}} living in the wild {{on the island of}} Tasmania, nearby islands and islands in Bass Strait, 182 of which are regularly recorded, while another 79 are vagrants and one is extinct. Birds of Macquarie Island are not included in this list. Twelve species are unique (endemic) to the island of Tasmania, and most of these are common and widespread. However, the forty-spotted pardalote is rare and restricted, while the island's two breeding endemic species, the world's only migratory parrots, are both threatened. Several species of penguin are late summer visitors to Tasmanian shores. Tasmania's endemic birds have led to it being classified as an Endemic Bird Area (EBA), one of 218 such areas worldwide. Priority regions for habitat-based conservation of birds around the world, they <b>are</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> containing two or more restricted-range (endemic) species.|$|E
