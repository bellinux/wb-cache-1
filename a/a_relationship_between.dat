40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> freshmen {{retention}} and selected student services in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). A review of literature revealed that student 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of student services are related to student 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the academic and social systems of the college, which are closely and strongly linked to student retention. The results from this study will help student services 2 ̆ 7 administrators to effectively lead HBCUs in their retention efforts. This study utilized quantitative methods to determine the <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> freshmen retention and student services. Questionnaires were administered to 2000 students enrolled in freshmen orientation classes at the sampled institutions, 1014 were returned correctly. The dependent and independent variables were analyzed using Pearson Correlation coefficient and Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) statistical tools. The 0. 05 level of significance was used to test the null hypotheses. The following are the findings of this study: 1.
