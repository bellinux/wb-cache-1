This qualitative study seeks to understand low male participation in <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> as a result of negative perceptions caused by the ways in which <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> is marketed to students. I selected male <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> alumni to participate in personal interviews through which I sought to understand the criteria, motivations, and outcomes that men had for their overseas programs. A variety of <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> marketing materials were also collected, with a specific focus on social media.

Additionally, I used normative and dialogic frameworks to understand the ways in which men’s views of their gender inform their <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> experience. This <b>study</b> shows that <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> marketing is not reflective of the practical and pragmatic motivations that men have for <b>studying</b> <b>abroad.</b> Overall, <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> professional in charge of marketing should focus less on “fun” and “cultural” experiences and instead emphasize the practical and pragmatic benefits of <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> in order to attract more men. ...|$|R

This paper proposes and tests a novel theory on {{the cause of}} this gender gap, using primary survey data and secondary sources. The author theorizes that males <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> at lower rates because a perception exists that <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> is an un-masculine, or "un-manly," endeavour. The author hypothesizes that males who believe a high rate of males at their school <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> {{will be more likely to}} <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> than males that believe a low rate of males at their school <b>study</b> <b>abroad.</b> This hypothesis is tested through a survey experiment, which uses a memory game to present respondents with statistics showing varying levels of male participation in <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> at the University of Maryland.

40|$|<b>Study</b> <b>abroad</b> {{participation}} {{has been}} increasing every year across the United States — at Ball State alone, 45 % more students <b>studied</b> <b>abroad</b> in 2003 - 2004 than did in 2001 - 2002, with 563 students <b>studying</b> <b>abroad</b> in the 2003 - 2004 school year. Every year, more students are experiencing the cultural interaction that <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> allows and are gaining the social and career skills that <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> promises. The Ball State Center for International Programs, like other <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> offices at U.

However, without concrete assessment of what students are learning abroad and with universities' focus resting entirely on increasing participation numbers rather than on ensuring the quality of <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> programs, the purpose of <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> may be slipping away from educational concerns and toward tourist interests. Unless universities begin {{paying more attention to}} how they advertise and discuss <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> — by promoting the cultural interactions available in a program, rather than students' opportunities to see famous sites, for example — students may increasingly view <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> as a way to see the world, from a tourist perspective, rather than as a way to interact with unfamiliar cultures and learn about those cultures as well as their own American culture.

40|$|ABSTRACT Undergraduates in the USA {{bring to}} college {{a wide array}} of backgrounds, resources, and {{supports}} that make it more or less likely that they will participate in <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> during their undergraduate career. This study investigates the experiences of undergraduates who have <b>studied</b> <b>abroad,</b> as well as the elements that facilitate the <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> experience. The data suggests that students must overcome a number of constraints in order to <b>study</b> <b>abroad.</b> While the paths to <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> are divergent, a number of common individual and institutional factors affect students’ likelihood for successful participation in a <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> experience while at college. The data indicate that students must have at their disposal the necessary tools to overcome significant hurdles to <b>study</b> <b>abroad.</b> Institutions of higher education {{play a crucial role in}} facilitating not only the <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> process itself, but also the pre-existing mindset, goals, and sense of agency that students possess in order to take advantage of <b>study</b> <b>abroad</b> opportunities.
