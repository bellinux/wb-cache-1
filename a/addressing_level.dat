40|$|Object-oriented {{models are}} a popular basis for sup-porting uniform sharing {{of data and}} {{services}} in op-erating systems, distributed programming systems, and database systems. We term systems that use objects for these purposes object sharing systems. Operating systems in common use have nonuni-form addressing models, making the uniform ob-ject naming required by object sharing systems ex-pensive and difficult to implement. We argue that emerging 64 -bit architectures make it practical to support uniform naming at the virtual <b>addressing</b> <b>level,</b> eliminating a key implementation problem for object sharing systems. We describe facilities for object-based sharing of persistent data and services in Opal, an operating system we are developing for paged 64 -bit architec-tures. The distinctive feature of Opal is that object sharing is supported in a runtime library, a,bove a single virtual address space that maps all primary and secondary storage in a local area network...|$|E

To form the address blocks, the 128-bit key is divided up into digits with each digit being b bits long, yielding a numbering system with base 2b. This partitions the <b>addresses</b> into distinct <b>levels</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} the client, with level 0 representing a zero-digit common prefix between two <b>addresses,</b> <b>level</b> 1 a one-digit common prefix, and so on.

Unfamiliar surroundings, various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, {{and the sight}} and sounds of medical procedures exacerbate pain and anxiety. • To block off the anxiety-inducing {{sights and sounds of}} hospital surroundings and create a pleasing environment, the therapeutic potential of visual stimulation as a nursing intervention was investigated. • In a randomized, controlled, cross-over study, pain was produced by a modified tourniquet technique in 46 healthy volunteers. Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups (Group V and Group B) with subsequent cross-over. Those in Group V watched a soundless video display of natural scenery during tourniquet inflation, whereas in Group B subjects watched a static blank screen. • Pain threshold was defined as the time when subjects reported the first detectable pain, whereas pain tolerance was the time the pain was reported to be intolerable and deflation of the tourniquet was requested. • With the use of visual stimuli, there was a significant increase in pain threshold (P < 0. 05) and pain tolerance (P < 0. 01). Gender and the sequence of visual stimuli did not have any significant effect on pain threshold and pain tolerance. • Further studies specifically <b>addressing</b> <b>level</b> of anxiety and physiological data correlated with pain scores and visual stimuli are needed. • The findings have implications for nurses and other healthcare professionals to use various visual stimuli as positive adjuncts to other methods of pain relief and for different pain conditions in clinical areas.

40|$|Selecting the {{appropriate}} {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) is based on providing an adequate level of employee protection relative to the task-specific conditions and hazards. PPE is categorized into four ensembles, based {{on the degree of}} protection afforded; e. g., Levels A (most restrictive), B, C, and D (least restrictive). What is often overlooked in preparing an ensemble is that the PPE itself can create significant worker hazards; i. e., the greater the level of PPE, the greater the associated risks. Furthermore, there is confusion as to whether a more ''conservative approach'' should always be taken since Level B provides the same level of respiratory protection as Level A but less skin protection. This paper summarizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations <b>addressing</b> <b>Level</b> A versus Level B, and provides justification for selecting Level B over Level A without under-protecting the employee during a particular remediation scenario. The scenario consisted of an entry team performing (1) an initial entry into a room containing concentrated acids (e. g., hydrofluoric acid), bases, and radiological constituents; (2) sampling and characterizing container contents; and (3) retrieving characterized containers. The invasive nature of the hydrofluoric acid sampling and characterization scenario created a high potential for splash, immersion, and exposure to hazardous vapors, requiring additional skin protection. The hazards associated with this scenario and the chemical nature of hydrofluoric acid provided qualitative evidence to justify Level A. Once the hydrofluoric acid was removed from the room, PPE performance was evaluated against the remaining chemical inventory. If chemical breakthrough from direct contact was not expected to occur and instrument readings confirmed the absence of any hazardous vapors, additional skin protection afforded by wearing a vapor-tight, totally-encapsulated suit was not required. Therefore, PPE performance and instrument data provided quantitative evidence to justify Level B...|$|E

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of dengue risk in Malaysia were studied {{both at the}} address and the sub-district level {{in the province of}} Selangor and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. We geocoded laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from the years 2008 to 2010 at the <b>address</b> <b>level</b> and further aggregated the cases in proportion to the population at risk at the sub-district level. Kulldorff’s spatial scan statistic was applied for the investigation that identified changing spatial {{patterns of}} dengue cases at both <b>levels.</b> At the <b>address</b> <b>level,</b> spatio-temporal clusters of dengue cases were concentrated at the central and south-eastern part of the study area {{in the early part of}} the years studied. Analyses at the sub-district level revealed a consistent spatial clustering of a high number of cases proportional to the population at risk. Linking both levels assisted in the identification of differences and confirmed the presence of areas at high risk for dengue infection. Our results suggest that the observed dengue cases had both a spatial and a temporal epidemiological component, which needs to be acknowl- edged and addressed to develop efficient control measures, including spatially explicit vector control. Our findings highlight the importance of detailed geographical analysis of disease cases in heterogeneous environments with a focus on clustered populations at different spatial and temporal scales. We conclude that bringing together information on the spatio-temporal distribution of dengue cases with a deeper insight of linkages between dengue risk, climate factors and land use constitutes an important step towards the development of an effective risk management strategy...|$|R
