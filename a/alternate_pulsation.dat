40|$|Measurements of milking vacuum {{recorded}} on a flow simulator can provide guidelines for optimum design of milking units. • Increasing the bore {{of the short}} milk tube above the recommended diameter or claw volume above 150 ml does not improve milking efficiency. • Increasing the long milk-tube bore from 13. 5 mm to 16 mm increased the level of milking vacuum. • The milking vacuum was highest with wide-bore tapered liners and simultaneous pulsation. • The minimum vacuum was increased with narrow-bore liners and <b>alternate</b> <b>pulsation.</b> • The milk yield with wide-bore tapered liners in heavy 3 -kg clusters and using simultaneous pulsation was 5 % higher than with light clusters (1. 65 kg) with <b>alternate</b> <b>pulsation.</b> • The milk yield depressions obtained with light clusters were similar in {{short and long term}} experiments and increased with the magnitude of the milk yield per milking. • The teat condition scores were not affected by the magnitude of vacuum fluctuations.

40|$|With a mid-level milking {{system the}} milking time was reduced {{significantly}} when the teat end vacuum was increased • Vacuum losses were lower and milking time was shorter with simultaneous pulsation than with <b>alternate</b> <b>pulsation</b> • Milk yield was {{not affected by}} the magnitude of teat end vacuum. • Both the mean flowrate and peak flowrate increased when the teat end vacuum was increased. • New milking plants and conversions should have 16 mm bore long milk tubes (LMT) and 16 mm bore entries in the milk pipeline • The omission of udder washing as a pre-milking preparation procedure did not influence milking characteristics. • TBC and E. coli were significantly reduced with full pre-milking preparation compared to no pre-milking preparation when milk was produced from cows on pasture • Counts for individual bacterial species were well below maximum numbers permitted in EU Council Directive (Anon. 1992) when no pre-milking preparation was carried out.

40|$|The vacuum {{variations}} at {{the apex}} of an artificial teat during simulated milking were measured in a factorial-design laboratory test involving six cluster types, two internal diameters (13. 5 mm and 16 mm) of long milk tube (LMT), three water flow rates (4, 6 and 8 l/min), simultaneous (4 × 0) and alternate (2 × 2) pulsation patterns and three pulsator ratios (60, 64, and 68 %). Four of the six clusters were fitted with wide-bore tapered liners and represented all combinations of two claw volumes (150 or 420 ml) and two short-milk-tube bores (8. 5 mm and 13. 5 mm). Two clusters were fitted with narrow-bore liners (22 and 25 mm) that had large-bore short milk tubes and large claw volumes. The vacuum variations were expressed as mean vacuum at the teat-end during the b-phase of pulsation (TVB), mean vacuum at the teat end measured over complete pulsation cycles (TV), minimum vacuum measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVM) and amplitude of vacuum fluctuation measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVF). The highest level of TVB was recorded with wide-bore tapered liners. For a milking unit fitted with a wide-bore tapered liner TVF was reduced and TVM increased by increasing either the bore of the short milk tube or the volume of the claw. When the bore of the LMT was increased TVB, TV and TVF increased. Simultaneous pulsation gave higher TVB (P < 0. 001) and higher TVF (P < 0. 001) than <b>alternate</b> <b>pulsation</b> for all cluster types. The overall effects of altering pulsator ratio were significant but small in practical terms. There were significant interactions between cluster type and water flow rate and pulsation pattern for TVB, TV, TVM and TVF. peer-reviewedEuropean Unio...|$|E

40|$|The Blazhko {{effect is}} a long term, {{generally}} irregular modulation of the light curves that occurs in a sizeable number of RR Lyrae stars. The physical origin of the effect has been a puzzle ever since its discovery {{over a hundred years}} ago. We build here upon the recent observational and theoretical work of Szabo et al. on RRab stars who found with hydrodynamical simulations that the fundamental pulsation mode can get destabilized by a 9 : 2 resonant interaction with the 9 th overtone. <b>Alternating</b> <b>pulsation</b> cycles arise, although these remain periodic, i. e. not modulated as in the observations. Here we use the amplitude equation formalism to study this nonlinear, resonant interaction between the two modes. We show that not only does the fundamental pulsation mode break up into a period two cycle through the nonlinear, resonant interaction with the overtone, but that the amplitudes are modulated, and that in a broad range of parameters the modulations are irregular as in the observations. This irregular behavior is in fact chaotic and arises from a strange attractor in the dynamics. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} a new quarter-individual milking system called MultiLactor ® (Siliconform GmbH, Türkheim, Germany). The MultiLactor enables milking on quarter level basis with low vacuum (37 kPa), sequential pulsation and periodic air inlet. Within the same dairy farm, the influence of this quarter-individual milking system (MULTI) on milkability traits was compared with a conventional milking system (CON). CON was equipped with a conventional milking cluster and used <b>alternating</b> <b>pulsation.</b> Vacuum level was adjusted to 40 kPa. For the study, 84 Holstein Friesian cows were randomly selected and uniformly divided into two herds. During the 30 -week survey, the milk flow curves were recorded every other week by using a LactoCorder (WMB, Balgach, Switzerland). Significant differences (P< 0. 05) between both milking systems were found for all milk flow traits, except for milk yield and decline phase. Concerning the incline (tAN) and plateau (tPL) phase, large differences existed between MULTI and CON. The estimated value of tAN calculated for MULTI (29. 4 s) took {{only half of the}} time when calculated for CON (56. 4 s). The estimated value of tPL at CON was reduced by 1. 43 min (35 %) compared to MULTI. Milking process at MULTI (8. 49 min) took longer time than for CON (7. 43 min). From the study, it was concluded that the effect of shorter tAN in the quarter-individual milked cows may be related to additional prestimulation by an actuator. In contrast, the longer milking time in MULTI is possibly caused by lower vacuum level and periodic air inlet...|$|R
40|$|Friesian-type {{dairy cows}} were milked with {{different}} machine settings {{to determine the}} effect of these settings on teat tissue reaction and on milking characteristics. Three teat-cup liner designs were used with varying upper barrel dimensions (wide-bore WB = 31. 6 mm; narrow-bore NB = 21. 0 mm; narrow-bore NB 1 = 25. 0 mm). These liners were tested with <b>alternate</b> and simultaneous <b>pulsation</b> patterns, pulsator ratios (60 : 40 and 67 : 33) and three system vacuum levels (40, 44 and 50 kPa). Teat tissue was measured using ultrasonography, before milking and directly after milking. The measurements recorded were teat canal length (TCL), teat diameter (TD), cistern diameter (CD) and teat wall thickness (TWT). Teat tissue changes were similar with a system vacuum level of either 50 kPa (mid-level) or 40 kPa (low-level). Widening the liner upper barrel bore dimension from 21. 0 mm (P < 0. 01) or 25. 0 mm (P < 0. 001) to 31. 6 mm increased the magnitude of changes in TD and TWT after machine milking. Milk yield per cow was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher and cluster-on time was reduced (P < 0. 01) with the WB cluster as compared to the NB 1 cluster. Minimum changes in teat tissue parameters were achieved with system vacuum level of 40 kPa and 50 kPa using NB and WB clusters, respectively. Similar changes in teat tissue and milk yield per cow were observed with <b>alternate</b> and simultaneous <b>pulsation</b> patterns. Widening pulsator ratio from 60 : 40 to 67 : 33 did not have negative effects on changes in teat tissue and had a positive effect on milk yield and milking time. Milk liner design had a bigger effect on teat tissue changes and milking characteristics than pulsation settings. </p...|$|R
