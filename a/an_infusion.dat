5|$|The castle's {{original}} appearance {{differed significantly}} {{from that of}} today. The arrow-shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the main block behind it {{were part of the}} original design. There were also towers {{at either end of the}} water frontage, though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design. The gatehouse and moat were later additions. A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle, Aylesford, and Bopley were pulled down to provide stone for the castle. The main structure had been completed by 1564, but it took another three years and <b>an</b> <b>infusion</b> of extra funds to finish the project. The total cost came to £4,349.|$|E
5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. <b>An</b> <b>infusion</b> of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E

5|$|With {{help from}} a peasant named Ratpouch, Diermot manages {{to escape from the}} dungeon and visits Luthern, the blacksmith. Luthern reveals that a girl named Goewin who runs a herb shop has {{recently}} disappeared. Diermot discovers that she had been arrested by the Skorl. With help from Ratpouch, Diermot breaks into the house of Taidgh, the magician, where he creates a potion which disguises him as Selena. He enters the mansion where Goewin is being held and orders the Skorl to free her. Not long after, a man named Mallin gives Diermot a book wrapped in cloth to take to a man named Morkus. In the process of delivering the book, Diermot sees a notice stating that whoever returns the book to its rightful owner will be rewarded. Diermot delivers the book to a man named Toby, who rewards him with a statuette. Toby reveals that the dragon can help Diermot defeat Selena, but that he will need <b>an</b> <b>infusion</b> made of three herbs to wake the dragon up, which Goewin then makes for Diermot.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, the French Republic, {{under the rule of}} the National Convention, was at war with all its neighbours. With famine imminent, the French Committee of Public Safety looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide <b>an</b> <b>infusion</b> of grain; this was to be convoyed across the Atlantic during April, May and June, {{accompanied}} by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the Bay of Biscay. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the French Navy's ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by Lord Howe, knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with {{the main body of the}} Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the weather gage from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Aminophylline and {{ceftazidime}} {{are sometimes}} used concurrently {{in patients with}} respiratory disorders. Parenteral aminophylline usually is administered as <b>a</b> constant <b>infusion,</b> and ceftazidime is given intermittently or less commonly as <b>a</b> constant <b>infusion.</b> We evaluated the stability and compatibility of the two drugs when aminophylline is given as <b>a</b> constant intravenous <b>infusion</b> and ceftazidime is administered simultaneously either through a y-site (piggyback method) or as <b>a</b> continuous <b>infusion</b> (constant infusion method). DESIGN: The chemical stability of intravenous aminophylline and ceftazidime in dextrose 5 % and NaCI 0. 9 % for both methods was studied. Three different formulations of ceftazidime from the same manufacturer were studied (minibag using reconstituted ceftazidime, premixed minibag, and ceftazidime arginine). For the piggyback and constant infusion methods, samples were collected at 0, I, and...|$|R

30|$|Anesthesia was induced with {{propofol}} (1.5 – 2.0  mg/kg body weight), fentanyl (1 – 3  μg/kg), and <b>a</b> bolus <b>infusion</b> of rocuronium (1  mg/kg).

After the initial dose of fentanyl, <b>a</b> bolus <b>infusion</b> of fentanyl (25, 50, or 100  μg/bolus) was adjusted by the participating anesthesiologist {{to meet the}} clinical need in each situation.

In addition, infusion for blood loss was administered with one to two volumes of 6 % hydroxyethyl starch (70 / 0.5).
