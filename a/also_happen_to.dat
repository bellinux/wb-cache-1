5|$|Like many boletes, Imperator torosus causes {{gastrointestinal}} {{symptoms such as}} abdominal pain, diarrhoea {{and vomiting}} when eaten raw. These reactions can <b>also</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> some people when the mushroom is eaten cooked, though others have consumed it with no ill effects. In a 1994 study, researchers Ulrich Kiwitt and Hartmut Laatsch looked for the antabuse-like compound coprine in Suillellus luridus and similar species that had been suspected of inducing antabuse-like reactions with alcohol. Coprine ingestion results in heat and flushing in the face, tingling in arms and legs, nausea and vomiting, and increased heart rate within five to ten minutes of consuming alcohol. They found none in the suspect species, but did find indications for it in Imperator torosus. They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical poisoning incidents was a misidentification of I.torosus with Suillellus luridus, though they could {{not rule out the}} latter species containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol-related reactions. No clinical cases of alcohol-related sensitivity have been recorded for I.torosus.|$|E

25|$|One {{means of}} {{studying}} reionization uses the spectra of distant quasars. Quasars release an {{extraordinary amount of}} energy, meaning they are among the brightest objects in the universe. As a result, some quasars are detectable from {{as far back as the}} epoch of reionization. Quasars <b>also</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> have relatively uniform spectral features, regardless of their position in the sky or distance from the Earth. Thus it can be inferred that any major differences between quasar spectra will be caused by the interaction of their emission with atoms along the line of sight. For wavelengths of light at the energies of one of the Lyman transitions of hydrogen, the scattering cross-section is large, meaning that even for low levels of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM), absorption at those wavelengths is highly likely.|$|E
25|$|The anatomist Gary D.Richards {{introduced}} a new skeptical hypothesis in June 2006: that the skeletons from Flores might be the remains of people who suffered from Laron syndrome, a genetic disorder first reported in 1966. This IGF-I deficiency is commonly caused by an exon deletion, and produces two distinct phenotypic changes in the skeleton: short stature and a small skull, which <b>also</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> define the phenotype of H. floresiensis. The next year, a team including Laron himself published a paper arguing that the morphological features of H.floresiensis are essentially indistinguishable from those of Laron syndrome. They compared the cranial and postcranial skeleton of LB1 with those of 64 Laron syndrome patients. The cohort of Laron syndrome patients exhibited statures ranging from 95 to 136cm in adult females, and 116 to 142cm in adult males. The estimated height for the LB1 remains places it at the lowest end of the female range. The extremely small endocranial volume of LB1 is actually smaller than anything exhibited in Laron syndrome patients. Despite this inconsistency in brain size, Hershkovitz et al. still assert there are enough characteristics shared between LB1 and the Laron syndrome patients to suggest this pathology explains the skeletal appearance.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer is {{generally}} considered to be among the most talented actresses in Hollywood, and one of the greatest actresses of her generation. Despite acknowledging that she lacks the film credits of Anjelica Huston and Meryl Streep, Bastién wrote that [...] "of her generation, she’s the actress with the most fascinating thematic through line." [...] Coined one of the industry's [...] "most interesting" [...] actresses by The Daily Beast, Pfeiffer is known for her versatility, boasting a diverse filmography that includes period, romance, fantasy and comedy genres. During the 1980s, Pfeiffer typically played smart, funny and strong female characters who <b>also</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "more than a little sexy." [...] New Woman observed that Pfeiffer's characters tend to [...] "play the world at a distance, mostly, and are often wise beyond their years. They get romanced, but are not overtly romantic. They may be trashy ... but they all retain an air of invulnerability, a certain classical poise." [...] Comparing Pfeiffer's resume to that of actress Barbara Stanwyck, Elizabeth Kaye of The Daily Beast wrote that Pfeiffer's vulnerable characters share a common theme: [...] "the only reasonable expectation is to not expect much". Apart from The Witches of Eastwick, few of the actress' films during this period had been box office successes, an observation Pfeiffer never mentioned to studio heads in fear that they would stop hiring her altogether. However, her performances continued to garner consistently positive reviews despite lackluster ticket sales and several films that critics dismissed as [...] "forgettable". Pfeiffer has managed to establish herself as a [...] "major star" [...] despite having yet to receive top-billing in a blockbuster film.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relatively}} recent increased consumption of sugar {{has been linked}} to the rise of some afflictions such as diabetes, obesity, and more recently heart disease.

[...] Obesity and diet <b>also</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be high risk factors for diabetes. [...] In the same time span that obesity doubled, diabetes numbers quadrupled in America.
