40|$|Objectives To {{describe}} {{changes over}} time in extent of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) at multidetec-tor computed tomography (MDCT) assessed by semi-quantitative visual scores (VSs) and fully automatic histogram-based quantitative evaluation and to test {{the relationship between these}} two methods of quantification. Methods Forty IPF patients (median age: 70 y, interquartile: 62 - 75 years; M:F, 33 : 7) that underwent 2 MDCT at different time points with a median interval of 13 months (interquartile: 10 - 17 months) were retrospectively evaluated. In-house software YACTA quantified automatically lung density histogram (10 th- 90 th percentile in 5 th percentile steps). Longitudinal changes in VSs and in the percentiles of <b>attenuation</b> <b>histogram</b> were obtained in 20 untreated patients and 20 patients treated with pirfenidone. Pearson correlation analysis was used to test th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — An ideal binary masking, which {{specifies}} {{regions in}} the time-frequency domain whose concerned signal energy {{is greater than the}} interference signals is analyzed. The performance of the signal separation when these ideal binary masks are applied is evaluated. In the tests, these ideal masks remove almost all the interference from the other source of convolutive mixtures using simulated room impulses. A method for blind signal separation in the time-frequency domain using only the relative amplitude information of each time-frequency cluster cells is proposed. In reverberant environment the proposed method can not identify the clusters, but we may find out that the referring attenuation values of each source are concentrated in the extremities of the curve of relative <b>attenuation</b> <b>histogram.</b> Experimental results show that our proposed method can separate signals with little interference from the other source even in a real reverberant environment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of combined CT parameters in distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal masses in cancer patients. The study included 33 patients with 39 adrenal masses. CT protocol included pre-contrast scan, dynamic and delayed contrast-enhanced scans assessing the mass size, pre-contrast <b>attenuation,</b> <b>histogram</b> & post-contrast absolute percentage washout (APW). Sensitivities, specificities, accuracies & P-values were calculated for individual and combined parameters. Adrenal masses included 13 lipid rich, nine lipid poor adenomas, one carcinoma and 16 metastases. Size was accurate in the differentiation of 26 of the total 39 masses (66. 7 %). Accuracy (82. 05 %) & specificity (68. 18 %) for the 10 % negative pixels threshold on histogram were higher as compared to 76. 9 % & 59 % for the 10 HU mean attenuation threshold. Using APW of 55 % at 10 min delay, a sensitivity of 88. 23 %, a specificity of 86. 36 % & an accuracy of 87. 17 % were calculated. The combination of pre-contrast attenuation & histogram values and the APW were highly significant for the differentiation of benign & malignant adrenal masses (P-value is < 0. 001). Combining the CT parameters including the pre-contrast attenuation values, histogram & the post-contrast washout analysis yielded a powerful diagnostic protocol with 74. 3 % accuracy, excluding the size parameter...|$|E
40|$|Background: Quantitative {{computed}} tomography (CT) analysis {{has been proposed}} {{as a means of}} objectively assessing fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (IP) including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We investigated whether percentages of high-attenuation areas (HAA%) and cystic areas (CA%) quantified from CT images were useful as indices of fibrotic IP. Methods: CT images of 74 patients with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IPF, 36; non-specific interstitial pneumonia, 9; unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, 29) were analyzed via in-house computer software, which automatically calculated HAA%, CA%, mean lung density (MLD), standard deviation of lung density (SD-LD), kurtosis, and skewness from CT <b>attenuation</b> <b>histograms.</b> These indices were compared in each instance with physiologic measures, visual fibrosis score, clinical diagnosis, radiologic CT pattern, and prognosis. Results: HAA% correlated significantly with physiologic measures and visual fibrosis score to a moderate extent (%forced vital capacity, r s = - 0. 59; % carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, r s = - 0. 43; fibrosis score, r s = 0. 23). Densitometric parameters (MLD, SD-LD, kurtosis, and skewness) correlated significantly with physiologic measures and fibrosis score (|r s | = 0. 28 - 0. 59). CA% showed no association with pulmonary functions but differed significantly between IPF and other interstitial pneumonias (IPs) (1. 50 ± 2. 41 % vs. 0. 41 ± 0. 80 %; P < 0. 01) and between the definite usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern and other patterns (1. 48 ± 2. 38 % vs. 0. 55 ± 1. 19 %; P < 0. 01). On univariate analysis, HAA%, MLD, SD-LD, kurtosis, skewness, fibrosis score, and definite UIP pattern all correlated with survival, with kurtosis alone identified as a significant predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio = 0. 67; 95 % CI, 0. 44 - 0. 96; P = 0. 03). Conclusion: CA% and HAA% are novel quantitative CT indices with differing properties in fibrotic IP evaluations. HAA% largely reflects physiologic impairments, whereas CA% corresponds with diagnosis and HRCT pattern. Of the CT indices examined, kurtosis constituted the strongest predictor of mortality...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for PETtransmission data {{processing}} {{was developed and}} found to reduce transmission noise in 18 F-FDG cardiac emis sion images. This method {{is based on a}} model that describes the measured <b>attenuation</b> image <b>histogram</b> as some unknown true underlying histogram, blurred by noise. Methods: Emission data from an elliptical phantom (cardiac insert) and three humans were reconstructed using transmission data of varying duration with varying levels of smoothing. Biases and noise levels (cardiac sector analysis) were evaluated for the phantom (simulated replicates) and human emission images. Results: The estimated attenuation histo grams typically displayed three distinct peaks corresponding to air, lung and soft tissue without a priori assumptions of the underlying /j, values. This method effectively sharpened the histogram peaks and performed well for the phantom and human data. For intermediate transmission noise levels, biases in the phantom sector values were < 4 %. The human sector results were more variable but consistent with the phantom results. Noise reduction (- 30 %) was demon strated across all smooth levels for the phantom data. Conclusion: This histogram sharpening method introduces only small bias in the cardiac sector values while achieving an increase in effective trans mission scan time of 50 - 100 %. Alternatively, histogram sharpening permits less transmission data smoothing without increased noise. Key Words: PET transmission noise; noise reduction; attenuation histogram; fluorine- 18 -FD...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) on lung fluid clearance in response to normobaric hypoxia, 20 healthy subjects were exposed to 15 hours of hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO 2][*]=[*] 12. 5 %) on two randomized occasions: (1) inhaled amiloride (A) (1. 5 [*]mg/ 5 [*]mL saline); and (2) inhaled saline placebo (P). Changes in lung fluid were assessed through chest computed tomography (CT) for lung tissue volume (TV), and the diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and nitric oxide (DLNO) for pulmonary capillary blood volume (VC). Extravascular lung water (EVLW) was derived as TV-VC {{and changes in the}} CT <b>attenuation</b> distribution <b>histograms</b> were reviewed. RESULTS: Normobaric hypoxia caused (1) a reduction in EVLW (change from baseline for A vs. P, - 8. 5 %[*]±[*] 3. 8 % vs. - 7. 9 %[*]±[*] 5. 2 %, p[*] [*] 0. 05), and (4) CT attenuation distribution became more negative, leftward skewed, and kurtotic (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Acute normobaric hypoxia caused a reduction in lung fluid that was unaffected by ENaC inhibition through inhaled amiloride. Although possible amiloride-sensitive ENaC may not be necessary to maintain lung fluid balance in response to hypoxia, it is more probable that normobaric hypoxia promotes lung fluid clearance rather than accumulation for the majority of healthy individuals. The observed reduction in interstitial lung fluid means alveolar fluid clearance may not have been challenged...|$|R
40|$|A good problem {{representation}} {{is important for}} a pattern re ognition system to be su essful. The traditional approa h to statisti al pattern re ognition is feature representation. More spe i ally, obje ts are represented {{by a number of}} features in a feature ve tor spa e, and lassiers are built in this representation. This is also the general trend in lung paren hyma lassi ation in omputed tomography (CT) images, where the features often are measures on feature histograms. Instead, we propose to build normal density based lassiers in dissimilarity representations for lung paren hyma lassi ation. This allows for the lassiers to work on dissimilarities be-tween obje ts, whi h might be a more natural way of representing lung paren hyma. In this ontext, dissimilarity is dened between CT regions of interest (ROI) s. ROIs are represented by their CT <b>attenuation</b> <b>histogram</b> and ROI dissimilarity is dened as a histogram dissimilarity measure between the attenuation histograms. In this setting, the full histograms are utilized a ording to the hosen histogram dissimilarity measure. We apply this idea to lassi ation of dierent emphysema patterns as well as normal, healthy tissue. Two dissimilarity representation approa hes as well as dierent histogram dissimilarity measures are onsidered. The approa hes are evaluated on a set of 168 CT ROIs using normal density based lassiers all showing good performan e. Compared to using histogram dissimilarity dire tly as distan e in a k nearest neighbor lassier, whi h a hieves a lassi ation a ura y of 92. 9 %, the best dissimilarity representation based lassier is signi antly better with a lassi ation a ura y of 97. 0 % (p = 0. 046) ...|$|E

In-house software YACTA quantified automatically lung density histogram (10 th- 90 th percentile in 5 th percentile steps). Longitudinal changes in VSs and in the percentiles of <b>attenuation</b> <b>histogram</b> were obtained in 20 untreated patients and 20 patients treated with pirfenidone. Pearson correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between VSs and selected percentiles. In follow-up MDCT, visual overall extent of parenchymal abnormalities (OE) increased in median by 5 %/year (interquartile: 0 %/y; + 11 %/y). Substantial difference was found between treated and untreated patients in HU changes of the 40 th and of the 80 th percentiles of density histogram. Correlation analysis between VSs and selected percentiles showed higher correlation between the changes (Δ) in OE and Δ 40 th percentile (r= 0. 69; p< 0. 001) as compared to Δ 80 th percentile (r= 0. 58; p< 0. 001); closer correlation was found between Δ ground-glass extent and Δ 40 th percentile (r= 0. 66, p< 0. 001) as compared to Δ 80 th percentile (r= 0. 47, p= 0. 002), while the Δ reticulations correlated better with the Δ 80 th percentile (r= 0. 56, p< 0. 001) in comparison to Δ 40 th percentile (r= 0. 43, p= 0. 003). There is a relevant and fully automatically measurable difference at MDCT in VSs and in histogram analysis at one year follow-up of IPF patients, whether treated or untreated: Δ 40 th percentile might reflect the change in overall extent of lung abnormalities, notably of ground-glass pattern; furthermore Δ 80 th percentile might reveal the course of reticular opacities...|$|E
