40|$|Primary {{idiopathic}} osteolysis (Gorham’s disease) is rare. It is characterised by {{the spontaneous}} onset of bone resorp-tion without a known cause. Bones which previously appeared normal begin to resorb, partially or completely. Sometimes only a thin shell of cortical bone remains, {{and there is}} usually little replacement by fibrous tissue (Cannon 1986). This process can continue for years {{but in some cases}} stops spontaneously. The result of this osteolysis is deformity and impaired function (Hardegger, Simpson and Segmueller 1985). Cannon (1986) discusses the aetiopath-ology of Gorham’s disease, but the exact mechanism of the osteolysis is still unknown. Spontaneous idiopathic osteolysis was first reported by Jackson in 1838, and since then a number of cases have been published under a wide variety of names which include <b>acute</b> spontaneous <b>absorption</b> of bone (Branch 1945), massive osteolysis (Gorham et al 1954), phantom bone (Gorham and Stout 1955) and disappearing or vanish-ing bones (Milner and Baker 1958).

Contamination is caused by arsenic from natural geological sources leaching into aquifers, contaminating drinking water and may also occur from mining and other industrial processes. Arsenic is present as a contaminant in many traditional remedies. Arsenic trioxide is now used to treat <b>acute</b> promyelocytic leukaemia. <b>Absorption</b> occurs predominantly from ingestion from the small intestine, though minimal absorption occurs from skin contact and inhalation. Arsenic exerts its toxicity by inactivating up to 200 enzymes, especially those involved in cellular energy pathways and DNA synthesis and repair. Acute arsenic poisoning is associated initially with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and severe diarrhoea. Encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy are reported. Chronic arsenic toxicity results in multisystem disease. Arsenic is a well documented human carcinogen affecting numerous organs. There are no evidence based treatment regimens to treat chronic arsenic poisoning but antioxidants have been advocated, though benefit is not proven.

40|$|In {{recent years}} many {{efforts have been}} made to replace dermal {{toxicity}} testing of chemicals in the animal by in vitro assays. As a member of a German research consortium, we have previously contributed to the validation of an in vitro test protocol for percutaneous absorption studies on the basis of reconstructed human epidermis and both human and pig skin ex vivo. Aiming to assess the barrier properties of a newly developed reconstructed skin model, this protocol has now been transferred to the Phenion (R) Full-Thickness Skin Model (FT model). The permeation of testosterone and caffeine was quantified in parallel to that of pig skin using Franz-type diffusion cells. In addition, the permeation of benzoic acid and nicotine was studied. As expected, the FT model is more permeable than pig skin, yet its barrier properties are well in accordance with those of reconstructed human epidermis when compared to previous data. In fact, the FT model most efficiently retards testosterone as the compound of highest lipophilicity, which can be explained by an additional uptake by a reservoir formed by the dermis equivalent. Thus, the structure closely parallels human skin. In consequence, the Phenion FT model appears to be suitable for percutaneous <b>absorption</b> studies in <b>hazard</b> analysis and should be subjected to a catch-up validation study.

Although {{previous studies have}} shown that Ca inhibits <b>acute</b> Fe <b>absorption,</b> {{there is no evidence of}} the possible long- or medium-term effects of Ca supplementation on Fe bioavailability. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 34 d of Ca supplementation on heme Fe and non-heme Fe bioavailability in non-pregnant women of ages 33 to 47 y. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-six healthy women (40 5 y) were randomly assigned to receive either 600 mg of elemental Ca/d as CaCO 3 (Ca group, n ¼ 13) or a placebo (P group, n ¼ 13) for 34 d. Heme Fe and non-heme Fe bioavailability were determined before and after treatment using 55 Fe and 59 Fe radioisotopes. A two-factor, repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess differences by treatment and timing. Results: The geometric mean (range 1 SD) of heme Fe bioavailability before and after treatment was 16. 5 % (8. 3 – 32. 8) and 26 % (15. 5 – 43. 6) for the Ca group and 21. 8 % (13. 0 – 36. 6) and 25. 1 % (16. 5 – 38. 3) for the P group. Non-heme Fe bioavailability before and after treatment was 39. 5 % (19. 9 – 78. 7) and 34. 1 % (19. 1 – 60. 6) for the Ca group, and 44. 6 % (24. 9 – 79. 7) and 39. 3 % (24. 3 – 63. 4) for the P group. There were no differences in either heme Fe or non-heme Fe bioavailability either at baseline or after treatment. Conclusion: The administration of calcium supplements for 34 d does not affect iron bioavailability. This trial is registered with Controlled-trials. gov, number ISRCTN 89888123.

Faecal SCFA concentrations were low {{on the first day}} of diarrhoea (mean (SEM) 9. 9 (5. 8) mmol/kg) and increased to 94. 8 (16. 4) mmol/kg by the fifth day. Faecal output of SCFA corresponded to these figures. Net water absorption, in the absence of luminal SCFA, was stopped in patients with acute diarrhoea (- 59 (81) nl/cm 2 /min) compared with healthy controls (+ 322 (63) nl/cm 2 /min) (p < 0. 01). Luminal SCFA restored net water absorption to + 184 (67) nl/cm 2 /min in patients with acute diarrhoea (p < 0. 01). Net absorption of sodium decreased in patients with acute diarrhoea in the absence of luminal SCFA, but returned to normal with luminal SCFA. Net secretion of potassium increased in acute diarrhoea, and did not change in the presence of SCFA. Defective absorption from the rectum in acute diarrhoea is reversed by luminal SCFA. The reduction of luminal SCFA in acute diarrhoea treated conventionally may be a factor contributing to colonic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a serious}} threat to public health. The {{quantity}} and quality of dietary calcium intake play important roles in osteoporosis prevention. Functional foods containing active components promoting calcium absorption or high-quality calcium are useful sources to maximize calcium utilization through dietary modification. In the first study, the acute and chronic effects of whey proteins on calcium and bone metabolism were evaluated in growing rats. In acute studies, whey protein concentrates significantly enhanced calcium absorption. However, in a subsequent chronic feeding study, the <b>acute</b> calcium <b>absorption</b> enhancing effect disappeared, likely through an adaptation. In the second study, calcium (Ca) bioavailability from Ca carbonate fortified soymilk and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) fortified soymilk was compared with cow 2 ̆ 7 s milk in young healthy women using the dual stable isotope technique. Fractional Ca absorption determined from 24 -h urine samples showed that Ca carbonate fortified soymilk had similar Ca bioavailability as that of cow 2 ̆ 7 s milk, but both were significantly higher than that of TCP fortified soymilk. In addition to the direct measurement of calcium metabolism, treatments can be evaluated by bone markers including tracers and biomarkers specific to bone. In the third study, we tested two tracers, 45 Ca and 3 H-tetracycline, for their utility as bone resorption markers. Bone resorption rates determined from urinary 45 Ca and 3 H-tetracycline using kinetic modeling were similar. 45 Ca and 3 H labeling efficiencies were significantly higher in trabecular-rich bones than cortical-rich bones. In the fourth study, serum proteomics was used to discover novel bone biomarkers with hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats. Bisphosphonate plus HU (HUA) was used to separate bone biomarkers from non-specific changes to bone. Unloading significantly decreased femur BMD and BNIC and increased bone resorption rate (urinary 3 H-tetracycline) compared to control. Two-dimensional gels were performed on serum samples and analyzed by PDQuest for spot matching. A total of 53 spots were differentially expressed among the 3 groups. Thirty protein spots that had significantly different quantities in the HU group than either the control and the HUA groups followed the changes observed from bone and urine results. However, cross-examination of potential biomarkers on other established bone models is essential to confirm the findings. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of a simulated altitude exposure (~ 2, 900 m above sea level) for a 3 h recovery period following intense interval running on post-exercise inflammation, serum iron, ferritin, erythropoietin, and hepcidin response. METHODS: In a cross-over design, ten well-trained male endurance athletes completed two 8 x 3 min interval running sessions at 85 % of their maximal aerobic velocity on a motorized treadmill, before being randomly assigned to either a hypoxic (HYP: F IO 2 ~ 0. 1513) or a normoxic (NORM: F IO 2 0. 2093) 3 h recovery period. Venous blood was collected pre- and immediately post-exercise, and after 3 and 24 h of recovery. Blood was analyzed for interleukin- 6, serum iron, ferritin, erythropoietin, and hepcidin. RESULTS: Interleukin- 6 was significantly elevated (p < 0. 01) immediately post-exercise compared to baseline (NORM: 1. 08 +/- 0. 061 to 3. 12 +/- 1. 80) (HYP: 1. 32 +/- 0. 86 to 2. 99 +/- 2. 02), but was not different between conditions. Hepcidin levels were significantly elevated (p < 0. 01) at 3 h post-exercise for both conditions when compared to baseline (NORM: 3. 25 +/- 1. 23 to 7. 40 +/- 4. 00) (HYP: 3. 24 +/- 1. 94 to 5. 42 +/- 3. 20), but were significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in the HYP trial compared to NORM. No significant differences existed between HYP and NORM for erythropoietin, serum iron, or ferritin. CONCLUSION: Simulated altitude exposure (~ 2, 900 m) for 3 h following intense interval running attenuates the peak hepcidin levels recorded at 3 h post-exercise. Consequently, a hypoxic recovery after exercise may be useful for athletes with compromised iron status to potentially increase <b>acute</b> dietary iron <b>absorption...</b>|$|R
40|$|Electrolyte Transport in the Mammalian Colon: Mechanisms and Implications for Disease. Physiol. Rev. 82 : 245 - 289, 2002. The colonic {{epithelium}} {{has both}} absorptive and secretory functions. The transport {{is characterized by}} a net absorption of NaCl, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and water, allowing extrusion of a feces with very little water and salt content. In addition, the epithelium does secret mucus, bicarbonate, and KCl. Polarized distribution of transport proteins in both luminal and basolateral membranes enables efficient salt transport in both directions, probably even within an individual cell. Meanwhile, most of the participating transport proteins have been identified, and their function has been studied in detail. Absorption of NaCl is a rather steady process that is controlled by steroid hormones regulating the expression of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC), the Na+-K+-ATPase, and additional modulating factors such as the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase SGK. <b>Acute</b> regulation of <b>absorption</b> may occur by a Na+ feedback mechanism and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Cl- secretion in the adult colon relies on luminal CFTR, which is a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel and a regulator of other transport proteins. As a consequence, mutations in CFTR result in both impaired Cl- secretion and enhanced Na+ absorption in the colon of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Ca 2 +- and cAMP-activated basolateral K+ channels support both secretion and absorption of electrolytes and work in concert with additional regulatory proteins, which determine their functional and pharmacological profile.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the hazards accompanying the aerial application of toxic pest-control chemicals is presented. The nature of the chemicals, the symptoms of toxicity, recommended treatment, and suggestions for safe-handling, are discussed. The introduction of the chlorinated, cyclic hydrocarbons for large-scale use as agricultural insecticides somewhat less than two decades ago, {{marked the beginning of}} a new era in agricultural pest control. In the intervening years, new chemicals, many of them engineered for specific agricultural purposes, have appeared in rapid succession. The large number and wide variety of these compounds, and their new and unfamiliar chemical and toxicological properties, have brought a host of medical problems. The insecticides which were the farmer 2 ̆ 7 s first line of defense prior to the 19402 ̆ 7 s, presented no great toxicological threat. The compounds of arsenic, for instance, are dangerously toxic only when inhaled or taken by mouth, and these are routes of entry into the body which are relatively easy to protect. Mixtures of sulfur and lime are comparatively innocuous. Nicotine, derris, the pyrethrins and mercurials were never used for large-scale agricultural purposes as we now understand the term. There were no effective defoliants or weed-control chemicals. Therefore, when the chlorinated compounds appeared in the 19402 ̆ 7 s and the organophosphates shortly thereafter in the 19502 ̆ 7 s, neither farmers nor pest control operators were prepared for the higher intrinsic toxicity of these substances. Nor were they prepared for the appearance of symptoms without warning, due to a strange new <b>hazard,</b> <b>absorption</b> of the toxic agent through the skin. It is not surprising therefore, that a familiar pattern has emerged. Many poisonings have occurred in the first months or years following the introduction of the more potent pesticides into a region where they were previously unknown. This is the pattern which enabled two Japanese scientists to accumulate the histories of 6000 cases of parathion poisoning within the first 5 years following the introduction of this chemical into Japan for use in the rice fields (1). Ultimately, instruction, training, and experience reduce the incidence of such poisonings...|$|R

Furthermore {{there may be}} greater sensitivity to the hepatic effects of ingested phytoestrogens, and other phytochemicals, given the vastly greater concentration of ingested phytoestrogens in the portal circulation, reported by Axelson & Setchell in rodent studies in 1981 (Axelson and Setchell 1981). This discussion underscores the potentially complex mechanisms of actions of phytochemicals particularly when consumed as whole foods. In response to public enquiry, and in collaboration with Industry and colleagues at Victoria University, studies comparing the absorption of calcium from commercial soy milk, with that from cows’ milk, were undertaken. As well as researching the methodology, designing and oversighting the clinical aspects of these studies, I proposed, in addition, investigating the effect of fermentation of soy milk on calcium absorption. This {{was because of the}} acute effects of fermentation on the hydrolysis of phytate (a known inhibitor of calcium bioavailability) as well as the potentially positive longer-term role of isoflavones on bone health. There {{was no significant difference in}} <b>acute</b> calcium <b>absorption</b> between the commercial soy protein isolate based soy milk, which was demonstrated to be low in phytate, and cows’ milk (Tang AL et al APJCN 2010 /Chapter 9), nor was there a significant effect of fermentation in enhancing calcium absorption acutely with this preparation (Tang et al BJN 2011 /Chapter 10) despite improved calcium solubility and reduced pH (Tang AL et al, J Food Sci 2007 /Chapter 11). However, demonstration of phytase activity in lactobacillus species (Tang AL et al JFS 2010 /Chapter 12), has potential to improve the bioavailability of calcium, as well as zinc and iron, in whole soy bean preparations and other wholegrain products, where the phytochemical phytate is known to be an inhibitory factor (Schlemmer, et al. 2009). Oestrogenic activity and/or oestrogenically active compounds have been identified in over half the plants consumed by humans. Many of these plants have had traditional uses relating to their reputed effects on endocrine and/or reproductive systems (Farnsworth, et al. 1975). Lepidium Meyenii (Maca), an edible plant in the radish family growing at very high altitude in the Andes, has traditional uses as a general tonic, aphrodisiac and fertility agent (Gonzales 2012). Based on anecdotal experience, and in collaboration with colleagues at Victoria University, I designed a randomized double-blind cross-over trial of Maca, including biochemical analyses, which was conducted in postmenopausal women. Whilst the extract used failed to show any oestrogenic or androgenic activity in vitro, a significant effect on psychological symptoms on the Greene Scale was noted, particularly with respect to symptoms associated with depression and anxiety. Phytochemicals such as flavonoids with monoamine oxidase activity have been isolated in Maca, as one possible mechanism (Brooks et al 2008 /Chapter 13) Most studies looking at oestrogenic effects of isoflavones in postmenopausal women have failed to show significant effects on psychological symptoms. It is known that with genistein, for example, only ten percent of the free compound crosses the blood brain barrier (Tsai 2005). The finding of such beneficial effects of Maca on psychological symptoms is therefore of significance. Much work in this field has concentrated on the role of these compounds in normal physiology across the lifecycle and in chronic common disease states, such as osteoporosis, breast cancer and cardiovascular risk factors (Chapter 5). However there are emerging developments with respect to less common conditions. Biotransformation of diet-derived compounds by intestinal microflora, exemplified by the conversion of daidzein to equol and consequent systemic endocrine effects, is a model for the treatment of diseases such as inherited metabolic disorders where, conceptually, the microbiome may supplement the human genome in the presence of genetic metabolic enzyme deficiency.

Phytochemicals may be biologically active in humans with potentially beneficial as well as adverse effects on health 2. Phytochemicals may be modified in their properties by intestinal and/or probiotic microflora 3. Individual phytochemicals may have multiple mechanisms of action and individual foods may contain multiple phytochemicals. Therefore observed effects of phytochemical-rich food supplementation may be complex and not predictable by a single mechanism. The initial studies seeking to delineate the significance of phytoestrogens in human health, using postmenopausal women as a model, have set the scene as a ‘proof of concept’ for the significance of phytochemicals in the broader context of human health and nutrition. This is supported by the respective sequential expansion of the literature containing the key words ‘phytoestrogen or plant oestrogen’ and ‘phytochemical’. Biotransformation of dietary components by intestinal flora and/or probiotic bacteria, elegantly demonstrated with respect to isoflavones and lignans, is now part of an emerging field in human nutrition and metabolism, where intestinal flora are likely to be a key mediator of diet-disease relationships. The final paper (Chapter 14) brings together a number of concepts and future possible directions for this field, particularly as it may relate to rare metabolic disorders. Other recent publications by others have explored further the potential for phytochemicals, consumed as intact plant foods, to influence the breadth of human health and disease states. Phytochemicals are now considered to be a significant contributor to cross cultural diet-disease relationships such as those reported for the Mediterranean Diet (Widmer RJ 2015), and for Asian diets for example. Differences in intestinal flora between different populations have been attributed to divergent risks for chronic disease, with potential for therapeutic interventions by means of probiotic organisms (Flint HJ 2012). Equol-producing status is suggested as, both, a mediator, as well as a correlate, of more favourable health outcomes (Majee 2011), an intriguing development given its early notoriety in ovine ‘Clover Disease’. The variable and at times conflicting findings in the literature regarding phytoestrogens in menopausal women likely reflect the complex interactions with baseline hormonal status, background diet, gut flora, antibiotic exposure and effects of the entero-hepatic circulation, as well as nature of supplement used and effects of other phytochemicals present when food sources rather than isolated compounds are used. Currently I am working as consultant in metabolic medicine, in a large specialist centre for the care of adults with inherited metabolic disorders, in Manchester, United Kingdom. Interestingly phytochemicals, including flavonoids such as the isoflavone genistein, are currently under investigation as potential therapeutic agents in a group of rare inherited metabolic disorders known as the mucopolysaccaridoses (MPS) {{including the}} devastating neurologically manifest disorder MPS III, otherwise known as San Filippo disease. Promising results of pharmacological dosing with genistein in a rodent model of the condition have led to the commencement of clinical trials of genistein either as the pure aglycone (Kim, et al. 2013) or ion the form of soy extract, in humans, specifically children and young adults, with the condition (Wegrzyn G 2010). Pharmacological dosing is being used to compensate for the 1 : 10 transfer across the blood brain barrier. The contribution of the studies on the bioavailability, metabolism and effects of isoflavone phytoestrogens in humans, as included in this body of work, may help inform future clinical trials in these patients, as well as others. This thesis has therefore, contributed to the understanding and treatment of a wide spectrum of human diseases as well as to human health.   Bibliography: Adlercreutz H, Höckerstedt K, Bannwart C, Bloigu S, Hämäläinen E, Fotsis T, Ollus A. “Effect of dietary components, including lignans and phytoestrogens, on enterohepatic circulation and liver metabolism of estrogens and on sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). ” J Steroid Biochem 27, no. 4 - 6 (1987) : 1135 - 44.
