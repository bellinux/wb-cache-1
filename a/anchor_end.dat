40|$|<b>End</b> <b>anchors</b> {{have been}} shown to {{significantly}} reduce premature plate end debonding failure of plate bonded strengthened reinforced concrete (r. c.) beams. One of the main interest in designing <b>end</b> <b>anchors</b> is to determine the minimum or optimal length of <b>end</b> <b>anchors</b> for a given thickness and height of the <b>end</b> <b>anchor.</b> This paper presents experimental and numerical studies in determining those optimum lengths for steel plate and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminate flexurally strengthened r. c. beams. In the experimental programme, seven r. c. beams were cast. One beam was tested in the un-strengthened condition to act as the control beam. Three beams were strengthened with steel plates and another three beams were strengthened with CFRP laminates. From each group of the strengthened beams, one beam was strengthened without any <b>end</b> <b>anchor,</b> one was <b>end</b> <b>anchored</b> using the optimum anchorage length and the last one was <b>end</b> <b>anchored</b> using an arbitrarily 200 mm anchorage length. The optimum length for the <b>end</b> <b>anchor</b> used in this study was derived from analyzing the interfacial stress diagram of the strengthened beams and was found to be approximately 100 mm. The beams were also modelled using FEM (LUSAS). The results indicate that the optimized 100 mm anchorage length plates were able to prevent premature plate end debonding failure of steel plate and CFRP laminate strengthened beams satisfactorily. It could also be seen from the results that beams with <b>end</b> <b>anchors</b> had a higher failure loads and had more ductile behaviour than the un-anchored strengthened beams. Results also show that the optimized <b>end</b> <b>anchored</b> strengthened beams had identical structural behaviour to that of the longer <b>end</b> <b>anchored</b> strengthened beams. The numerical results are able to predict the behaviour of the beams satisfactorily...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{adaptive}} control algorithm of a fast electromagnetic actuator {{has been developed}} without using position, velocity, or acceleration sensors. The algorithm {{is based on the}} fluctuation rate of the current in the electromagnet coil, which is measured during anchor movement. The proposed method and control algorithm compensate for external mechanical factors and are based on the interconnection of electric processes in the electromagnetic actuator coil, with mechanical processes relating to the movement of the movable element of the magnetic system. A structural diagram of a hardware device and an algorithm that implement the proposed control method are presented for a resonance type electromagnetic actuator, where there is a current change in the coil of the electromagnetic actuator. At each switching of the drive, parameters are controlled, and the length of pulse-width-modulated pulses is adjusted to ensure reliable switching and regulation of the <b>anchor</b> <b>end.</b> The control system responds to the disturbance in the current switching cycle. To test the adequacy of the proposed algorithm, an experimental model of an actuator with the proposed control system has been constructed, and its characteristics have been studied. It has been found out that the proposed algorithm ensures the required performance in terms of the operation speed and the lowest speed of the anchor landing without using position, velocity or acceleration sensors under external mechanical effects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Effects of stiffness, {{carrying}} {{efficiency and}} fatigue of the <b>end</b> <b>anchor</b> cable on the mechanical behavior of long span cable-stayed bridge, were discussed respectively. Firstly, {{the concept of}} the effective stiffness and the stress ratio were introduced to discuss the effects of the dead load stress level and the stress ratio on the effective stiffness of the <b>end</b> <b>anchor</b> cable. Secondly, the effect of the cable material on the vertical carrying efficiency of the structure was analyzed. Finally, the main influential factors on the fatigue performance of the <b>end</b> <b>anchor</b> cable were analyzed in detail. It is shown that improving the dead load stress level and keeping the low stress ratio would increase the effective stiffness of the <b>end</b> <b>anchor</b> cable. The section of the <b>end</b> <b>anchor</b> cable effects on stiffness of the structure under high stress level. It can be drawn that as a novel material, The CFRP <b>end</b> <b>anchor</b> cable will increase the load carrying level of the long span cable-stayed bridges. It can also be concluded that the length of side span and main span, the height of pylon, the area of the cable section and the live load collection degree are all the main effective factors to the stress amplitude of the <b>end</b> <b>anchor</b> cable. It is suggested that in the practical design of large span cable-stayed bridge, all the effective factors together with the global state of the structure should be taken into account comprehensively...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the behaviour of beams shearstrengthened with FRP sheets. The studies show that FRP materials can produce good performance when used to carry some portion of shear force in the shear-strengthened beam. However, the performance of FRP sheets is found limited by bond capacity between FRP sheets and concrete surface. In certain case, anchorage system can be introduced to the FRP strengthening scheme to improve the bond performance. This paper presents experimental and analytical studies conducted to evaluate the contribution and behaviour of FRP sheets with <b>anchored</b> <b>ends</b> in strengthening the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete beams. In the study, nine reinforced concrete beam specimens were fabricated and tested. Test parameters of the study include thickness of FRP sheet used, types of wrap applied, type of anchors and diameter of anchor head used. Two types of anchorage system were proposed in the study, i. e. insert anchor system and C-embedded anchor system. The results from this study show that the proposed anchorage system can improve the contribution of FRP in carrying the shear force in beams. In addition, the Cembedded anchor system exhibits better performance than the insert anchor system. Lastly, the behaviour of beams strengthened using FRP stirrups with <b>anchored</b> <b>end</b> can be better predicted by the ACI 440 design equations for full-wrap scheme...|$|R

40|$|Flexural {{strengthening}} of reinforced concrete (r. c.) beam is now {{becoming more and}} more important in the field of structural maintenance and retrofitting. Plate bonding methods using steel plates are very widely used in this field. However, premature debonding at plate ends i. e. end peelings have been a major concern in using these methods. Researchers in general concluded that shear and normal stress concentrations at the plate cut-off point are the main reasons causing end peeling. For minimizing these stresses to prevent <b>end</b> peeling, <b>end</b> <b>anchoring</b> using U and L shape metal plates is proposed in this paper. This paper presents the results of experimental studies carried out to investigate the effect of U and L shaped <b>end</b> <b>anchors</b> on steel plate strengthened reinforced concrete beams. A total of four beam were cast. One beam was left un-strengthened as the control; the remainder three beams were strengthened with steel plates. From the strengthened beams, one was simply strengthened without <b>end</b> <b>anchors</b> and two were <b>end</b> <b>anchored</b> using U and L shaped anchor plates respectively. The results indicate that, all strengthened beams exhibited higher failure and cracking loads with less strain, deflection and crack width and better crack patterns than the control beam. It is also indicate that the strengthened beams with <b>end</b> <b>anchors</b> recorded the highest failure loads and their modes of failure were seen to be more ductile compared to the un-anchored strengthened beam. Results also shows that premature end peeling was completely prevented by U and L shaped anchor plates. In comparison, the L shaped end-anchor gave better performance compared to the U shape <b>end</b> <b>anchor...</b>|$|R
