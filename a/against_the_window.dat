5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{was shot}} {{four or five}} times and was {{severely}} injured, but survived. It has been popularly believed that his pocket watch stopped one shot. The watch is displayed in the LDS Church History Museum in Salt Lake City; the watch was broken and was used to help identify the time of the attack. In 2010, forensic research by J. Lynn Lyon of the University of Utah and Mormon historian Glen M. Leonard suggested that Taylor's watch was not struck by a ball, but rather broke <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> ledge. Columbia University historian Richard Bushman, the author of , also supports this view.|$|E

25|$|On July 9, 1993, the {{prominent}} Toronto attorney Garry Hoy fell {{from a window}} in a playful attempt to demonstrate {{to a group of}} new legal interns that the windows of the city's Toronto-Dominion Centre were effectively unbreakable.

The accident was later commemorated for its unusual nature by a 1996 Darwin Award and has been re-enacted in several films and television shows.|$|E

2500|$|The tagged man chases a group into {{a subway}} station, where they cram {{themselves}} into a departing train.

He frustratedly pulls his arm {{out of the door}} and, after glancing to his left, begins strolling nonchalantly past the train, its occupants jammed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> watching him. The camera cuts ahead to reveal a lone straggler who failed to make it onto the train. As he spots the tagged man, he turns to flee and the commercial ends with the pair continuing the chase outside of the view of the camera, a superimposed swoosh accompanying the campaign tagline, [...] "Play".|$|E

She discloses that immediately after the crash, {{she thought she had}} fallen out of the airplane by pressing her forehead too hard <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and that her motherwho she believed had landed safely without herwould scold her for not wearing her seat belt. Then, floating on debris {{in the midst of a}} jet fuel slick released from the aircraft's burst fuel tanks, she recalls having [...] "...this taste of fuel in my mouth, mixed with salt, which burned my throat, my lungs and my stomach." [...] Bakari writes that she only realized her plane had crashed and that she was the sole survivor when she was in the hospital, believing until then that she had simply fallen out into the ocean.
