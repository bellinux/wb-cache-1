25|$|The {{number of}} sexual {{partners}} people have had in their lifetimes varies widely within a population. A 2007 nationwide survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean significantly higher than the median, or all of the above (see Pareto principle). About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes. Studies of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases consistently demonstrate {{a small percentage of the}} studied population has more partners than the <b>average</b> <b>man</b> or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random (with sexual partners from throughout a population) or within their social groups (assortative mixing).|$|E

Using the concept of intersectionality, Moody's rhetorical analysis combined feminist and critical cultural theories to explore the meanings of the 'independent woman' in the lyrics and respective videos of male and female rappers. She concluded that songs by various artists, corresponding music videos, and viewer comments contained four main messages: wealth equals independence, beauty and independence are connected, <b>average</b> <b>men</b> deserve perfect women, and sexual prowess equals independence. Male rappers were more likely to include messages of beautiful, overachieving women paired with <b>average</b> <b>men,</b> while female rappers focus on their own sexual prowess.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether picture presentation influenced men’s experienced body shame or Muscle Dysmorphia symptomatology, and whether there was a relationship between body shame and Muscle Dysmorphia. Participants were 112 men attending Western Kentucky University. Participants completed the Body Shame Questionnaire and Muscle Dysmorphia Inventory. Participants were randomly assigned to either view eight photographs of <b>average</b> <b>men</b> or eight photographs of muscular men. After viewing the photographs, the participants completed the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale and the Muscle Appearance Satisfaction Scale. Although there was a trend, results indicate that men who view photographs of muscular men do not experience more body shame than those who view photographs of <b>average</b> <b>men.</b> In the sample, 63. 5 % reported that they were dissatisfied with their bodies, 69 % with their chest size, 69 % with their own body build, 65 % with their arms, and 63 % were dissatisfied with their own abdomen.

In Order of the Phoenix, when Umbridge and some other wizards come to remove him from Hogwarts he fights back. They try to jinx and stun him, but the spells just bounce off him because of giant-inherited resistance to magic. Hagrid also shows this resilience at the end of Half-Blood Prince, during the chapter Flight of the Prince, withstanding a Death Eater’s powerful curses. Some potions are also ineffective with him, such as Polyjuice Potion, which is designed for human-only use.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745–1812), {{founded the}} Chabad {{movement}} {{in the town of}} Liozna. He later moved the movement's center to the town of Liadi. Rabbi Shneur Zalman was the youngest disciple of Rabbi Dovber of Mezritch, the principal disciple and successor of Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism. The Chabad movement began as a separate school of thought within the Hasidic movement, focusing of the spread of Hasidic mystical teachings using logical reasoning (creating a kind of Jewish [...] "rational-mysticism"). Shneur Zalman's main work is the Tanya (or Sefer Shel Beinonim, Book of the <b>Average</b> <b>Man).</b> The Tanya is the central book of Chabad thought and is studied daily by followers of the Chabad movement. Shneur Zalman's other works include a collection of writings on Hasidic thought, and the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, a revised version of the code of Jewish law, both of which are studied regularly by followers of Chabad. Shneur Zalman's successors went by last names such as [...] "Schneuri" [...] and [...] "Schneersohn" [...] (later [...] "Schneerson"), signifying their descent from the movement's founder. He is commonly referred to as the Alter Rebbe (Yiddish: אַלטער רבי) or Admur Hazoken (Hebrew: אדמו״ר הזקן) ("Old Rebbe").|$|E
