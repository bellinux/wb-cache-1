Fuel cell voltage current characteristic and heat release characteristic {{are represented by}} models which take effect of cooling water temperature into considered. Fuel cell stack performance models are validated against experimental data. Cooperated with experimental based models of water pump and heat exchanger, thermal management system performance is analyzed while fuel cell stack fresh cooling water outlet temperature is set {{to be at a}} certain value. The results show that inlet seawater temperature variation has little effect on opening of regulating valve, but engine power output variation results in notably regulating valve opening fluctuation. Modeling results would be employed in design of a underwater vehicle 300 kW fuel cell engine system. ...|$|R

Despite the demonstrated applicability for spatial predictions, the applicability of distributed <b>lumped</b> <b>models</b> for historic reconstructions or future projections needs validation. Here, as a first evaluation, predictions of a published distributed lumped HCO 3 - flux model will be compared to observed HCO 3 - flux time series of individual catchments and additionally to models which were calibrated using those time series. The distributed <b>lumped</b> <b>model,</b> which was calibrated by regional data, predicts the time-series of single catchments well. Additionally, the results and parameters of models calibrated on time series of the single catchments are within the range that is covered by the distributed <b>lumped</b> <b>model.</b> The evaluation hints at the applicability of distributed <b>lumped</b> <b>models,</b> calibrated by annual flux data of {{a large number of}} catchments, for historic reconstructions and future projections of fluvial HCO 3 - flux at the regional scale.

40|$|International audienceDevelopment {{of models}} for {{industrial}} hydrocrackers {{has received a}} great amount of attention by the scientific community over the past decades. Two fundamentally different modelling approaches are compared in this paper: a continuous <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> with three families (paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) and a single events microkinetic model. The aim is to demonstrate the differences in the capabilities of the two modelling frameworks. Both models are capable of simulating experimental data from hydrocracking of a pre-treated Vacuum Gas Oil in a pilot plant at industrial conditions. The continuous <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> provides better results of the macroscopic effluent characteristics, such as yield structure and PNA (Paraffin, Naphthene, Aromatic) distribution in the middle distillate cut. It requires only the feed SIMDIS (Simulated Distillation) and PNA composition to be known. The single events model, on the other hand, provides information which is not available in a simple continuous <b>lumping</b> <b>model.</b> An analysis of the reaction kinetics of paraffins and mono-naphthenes is performed to demonstrate this aspect.

40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} a comprehensive study {{to develop and}} assess the predictive capabilities of a <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> for the kinetics of complex reaction mixtures containing {{a large number of}} reacting components. Two types of <b>lumping</b> <b>models</b> were developed {{to reduce the number of}} reaction kinetics, namely a discrete and a continuum <b>lumping</b> <b>model.</b> These models were applied on three different problems. In the first case study, a continuum model was developed for a mixture of n-paraffins (waxes) produced from the Fischer-Tropsch process; the paraffins range from C 5 to C 70 and undergoing catalytic hydrocracking. The model was run with two types of the reactant-type distribution functions to describe the yield of products from the isomerisation and cracking reactions. The model was used to study the effect of the operating conditions on the model parameters and the yield composition. Experimental data were used to optimise the model parameters. The optimal parameters were used to predict the product distribution of n-paraffins hydrocracking and their conversion. The new in this case study was used the carbon number as label in the continuum <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> and to study how the effect of D(k) on the yield distribution. Good agreements have been obtained when running the model with D(k) employed a gamma function but it needs more time to solve the model than when employing a power law relation for D(k). In the second case study, both primary and secondary reaction kinetics of the pyrolysis of lignin were investigated by using the discrete lumping methodology. Two mathematical models were developed which consider the product as three lumps whilst the lignin was assumed to be an additional <b>lump.</b> The <b>model’s</b> results were validated against experimental data. In addition, a continuum <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> was developed for the cracking of the tar to obtain lighter components. The novelty in this case study is to develop a kinetic model including primary and secondary reaction kinetics for the pyrolysis of lignin in a fluid bed pyrolyser and to study how the continuum <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> for tar can be linked to the discrete <b>lumping</b> <b>model.</b> In the third case study, a model based on the continuum lumping approach was proposed to predict the molecular weight distribution of polymers during batch polymerisation. The result obtained from a continuum model was assessed, at this stage, only qualitatively; nevertheless, by analysing the weight distribution and the average of such distribution, conclusions were reached to assess the predictive capability of the lumping methodology. It is the first time that the continuum model with a yield distribution function is used to predict the molecular weight distribution of the polymerisation at various times...|$|R

Finally, we propose a <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> approach as an alternative to the individual <b>models.</b> In the <b>lumped</b> <b>model,</b> the portfolio is seen as baseline consumption superimposed with an ideal storage of limited power and energy capacity.

40|$|The {{degrees of}} freedom of multi-compartment {{mathematical}} models for energy metabolism of a neuron-astrocyte complex may offer a key to understand the {{different ways in which}} the energetic needs of the brain are met. In this paper we address the problem within a steady state framework and we use the techniques of linear algebra to identify the {{degrees of freedom}} first in a <b>lumped</b> <b>model,</b> then in its extension to a spatially distributed case. The interpretation of the degrees of freedom in metabolic terms, more specifically in terms of glucose and oxygen partitioning, is then leveraged to derive constraints on the free parameters needed to guarantee that the model is energetically feasible. We also demonstrate how the model can be used to estimate the stoichiometric energy needs of the cells as well as the household energy based on observed oxidative cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) of glucose, and the glutamate cycling. Moreover, our analysis shows that in the <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> the direction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the cells can be deduced from the glucose partitioning between the compartments. The extension of the <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> into a spatially distributed multi-compartment setting that includes diffusion fluxes from capillary to tissue increases the number of degrees of freedom, requiring the use of statistical sampling techniques.
