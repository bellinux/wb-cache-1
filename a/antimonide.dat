5|$|Three {{neptunium}} arsenide compounds {{have been}} prepared, NpAs, NpAs2, and Np3As4. The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum-sealed tube {{for about a}} week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The neptunium <b>antimonide</b> compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional <b>antimonide</b> compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{semiconductor}} nanoparticles both in colloidal form (CdSe nanoparticles) and {{in powder form}} (nanoscale <b>antimonides)</b> have been synthesized for two types of applications and their properties have been investigated. In {{the first part of}} the present work nanoscale <b>antimonides</b> were investigated. The main subject of this part was the development of a novel and optimization of the known synthetic route for nanoscale <b>antimonides</b> as well as the investigation of the dependence of thermoelectric properties on the synthetic and compacting treatment. The nanoscale <b>antimonides</b> were prepared according to a novel developed organometallic route using Tris(trimethylsilyl) stibine and the respective metal chlorides, and from solvochemically activated element particles. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. Using the organometallic route different phase purities, particle sizes and crystallinity of the nanoscale <b>antimonides</b> were obtained depending on the chosen solvent. The application of diglyme as solvent led to improved crystallinity and decreased particle sizes of nanoscale zinc <b>antimonides.</b> A possible reason could be the formation of chelate complexes with metal ions, which slow down the particle growth. The organometallic route yields an amorphous product. The crystallization of nanoscale zinc <b>antimonides</b> is quite similar to the analogous bulk materials. Their crystallization significantly depends on the used annealing conditions (temperature, reaction time, cooling rate). The formation of nanoscale ZnSb was achieved by slow cooling, while fast cooling led to the formation of nanoscale Zn 4 Sb 3. The crystallization of the amorphous product proceeds via nanoscale Zn 4 Sb 3, which decomposes into nc-ZnSb and Zn by increased reaction temperature or prolonged annealing. The synthesis of antimony rich phases CoSb 2 and CoSb 3 by the organometallic route could not be achieved in the present work. The synthesis of nanoscale well crystalline CdSb by the direct reaction of CdCl 2 with Sb(SiMe 3) 3 in diglyme without additional annealing was successful. The novel developed organometallic route is an interesting field of further research. At the beginning of annealing of the amorphous products the formation of an unknown phase in the temperature range of 200 - 226 °C was observed. This might be an intermediate product or a product of its decomposition. The analytic characterization of that intermediate phase could not be accomplished in the present work. The subject of future work is the crystal structure determination of this intermediate product. It might be helpful for the understanding of its further transformation into ZnSb or Zn 4 Sb 3. The formation of ZnSb and Zn 4 Sb 3 from activated element particles was found to be different from the formation of zinc <b>antimonides</b> synthesized according to the organometallic route. The nanoscale ZnSb was not exclusively obtained as a decomposition product of Zn 4 Sb 3. The formation of nanoscale ZnSb during the synthesis of Zn 4 Sb 3 was not influenced by the cooling rate. The nanoscale Zn 4 Sb 3 was synthesized from ZnSb and activated Zn in analogy to a synthetic procedure for bulk-Zn 4 Sb 3. 92 Due to the thermal lability of Zn 4 Sb 3 the synthesis of pure Zn 4 Sb 3 was not successful. The pure ZnSb was prepared at high reaction temperatures above 310 °C. The Kirkendall effect was observed in nanoscale ZnSb. This effect was already observed in the bulk-ZnSb synthesized at high pressures. 137 The synthesis from activated element particles led to nanoscale well crystalline pure CdSb and nearly pure CoSb 3. It was shown that CoSb 3 formed in a two-step reaction from Co and Sb powders via the intermediate phase CoSb and not via CoSb 2 in contrast to results published in the literature. Both available methods, SPS and HUP, were used to compact the nanoscale <b>antimonides.</b> Independent from the synthetic route an increased sensibility to the prolonged heating treatment compared to the analogous bulk materials was observed for the nanoscale <b>antimonides.</b> The prolonged heating treatment led to the decomposition of nanoscale samples during further compacting. Therefore the thermal sensibility could limit possible future applications of these nanoscale <b>antimonides.</b> The compacting of zinc <b>antimonides</b> synthesized from activated element nanoparticles led to intact samples. A significant improvement of the figure of merit at room temperature for nanoscale ZnSb synthesized from activated element particles and compacted by HUP was obtained. This fact indicates that nanostructuring is an effective way for improving the TE properties of zinc <b>antimonides.</b> The ZT improvement was the result of the very high Seebeck coefficient, low thermal conductivity and enhanced electric conductivity. The observed improvement of the TE transport properties (,,) showed a possibility to optimize them independently from each other as already has been shown for nc-Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3. 47 The associated mechanisms are not understood yet. The influence of different compacting methods for nanoscale ZnSb synthesized from activated element particles was studied. None of the two methods (HUP and SPS) was able to provide samples with the desired thermoelectrical properties. Nevertheless a low thermal conductivity was obtained for the nanoscale ZnSb compacted by SPS. Future work might deal with the variation of SPS and HUP conditions to obtain materials with the desired thermoelectric properties. It was shown that thermal conductivity of CoSb 3 could be lowered by nanostructuring due to the increased phonon scattering by grain boundaries. The compacting temperature exhibited a significant influence on the composition and TE properties of CoSb 3. Low compacting temperatures as well as impurities such as Sb and CoSb led to a considerable decrease in Seebeck coefficients. Thus, the compacting conditions must be optimized in order to prevent the decomposition of CoSb 3 afterwards. In the second part of the present work ligand exchange reactions between TOPO-capped CdSe nanoparticles and mono- and bivalent 4 -substituted pyridines were investigated. CdSe nanoparticles stabilized by pyridine, MP, DMAP and 2 DMAP were synthesized and examined by means of NMR-spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The degree of ligand exchange reactions was evaluated by means of 1 H-, 31 P-NMR and TEM. The binding of the 4 -substituted pyridines to CdSe nanoparticles was investigated. Enhanced binding was achieved for the CdSe nanoparticles stabilized by MP compared to the other monovalent pyridine ligands. The reason for that might be the coordination of MP via the π-system of the aromatic ring and the free electron pairs of the methoxy group. The coordination of DMAP to CdSe nanoparticles proceeds via the nitrogen atom of the pyridin ring quite similar to the coordination to gold and palladium nanoparticles. 171, 247 - 249 It was shown that pyridine could displace the weakly coordinated DMAP from the nanoparticle surface. The reason for this effect is not clear yet. The influence of multivalent pyridine (2 DMAP) on the coordinating strength was investigated. The ligand exchange between TOPO-capped CdSe nanoparticles and monovalent DMAP as well as its bivalent analogue 2 DMAP showed similar reaction behaviour. Due to ligand exchange an increased degree of aggregation as well as a fast primary displacement of TOPO for CdSe nanoparticles stabilized by 2 DMAP compared to DMAP-capped CdSe nanoparticles were observed. It is not clear how DMAP coordinates to the nanoparticle surface. Due to its high flexibility 2 DMAP is able to coordinate to more than one nanoparticle. Further investigations on this topic are currently under way. An oscillating behaviour of TOPO concentration was observed during the ligand exchange for both pyridine ligands. To contribute to a better understanding of the ligand exchange process a possible model was suggested. This model is based on the formation of a “pyridine ligand/TOPO” complex. In the present work the existence of such complexes was not confirmed. The goal of future work on this topic is to better understand the interaction between 4 -substituted pyridine ligands and CdSe nanoparticles and to optimize these interactions in order to improve the coordinating properties of nanoparticles to pyridine ligands. Both, the addition of pyridine ligands during the ligand exchange and the influence of the temperature on the observed oscillation as well as the ligand exchange behaviour have to be studied. The 15 N-NMR investigation to follow a possible oscillation of the concentration of pyridine ligands is currently under way. The obtained information might be helpful for a better understanding of the oscillation and ligand exchange mechanisms...|$|R
