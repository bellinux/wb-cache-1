5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 2.5–3.4μm in diameter. They are {{thick-walled}} {{with a short}} pedicel (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented with tiny spines (verrucae) that are roughly equidistant from each other. Capillitial threads are long, hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4–4μm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, thick-walled hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> those in the surrounding subcortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and icy lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> 250300km. Failing an ocean, the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E
5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual was covered with fur <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> that of a snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested {{that it could be}} a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years ago}} the {{government}} built sluice gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which {{he says that he}} once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and sluice gates {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, more {{products}} and techniques {{have been developed}} to make lip augmentation more effective and patient friendly. The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> a dozen human hairs) needles that are used to inject the very sensitive lips.

25|$|Plastic {{reinforcement}} {{often is}} stronger, {{or at least}} has a better strength to weight ratio than reinforcing steels. Also, because it resists corrosion, it does not need a protective concrete cover <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> steel reinforcement does (typically 30 to 50mm or more). FRP-reinforced structures therefore can be lighter and last longer. Accordingly, for some applications the whole-life cost will be price-competitive with steel-reinforced concrete.|$|E
25|$|The {{nervous system}} is {{composed}} of the typical ganglia. The pedal ganglia are placed beneath the radula sac and joined together by an anterior and a posterior commissure. The abdominal ganglion lies {{a little to the}} right of the median line. The visceral ganglia occupy the angle between the lingual sheath and the oesophagus and the buccal ganglia are widely separated but joined together by a commissure nearly <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> the ganglia themselves.|$|E

A cat's whiskers are more than twice <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> ordinary cat hairs, and their roots are three times deeper in a cat's tissue than other hairs. They have numerous nerve endings at their base, which give cats extraordinarily detailed information about nearby air movements and objects with which they make physical contact. They enable a cat {{to know that it}} is near obstacles without it needing to see them.|$|E

25|$|The {{round bow}} of Murtaja was modeled after Eisbrecher I, a German {{icebreaker}} designed by engineer Ferdinand Steinhaus from Hamburg and built in 1871, even though Robert Runeberg, an experienced Finnish naval architect {{and son of}} the national poet of Finland, had recommended a sharper ice-cutting bow instead of the spoon-shaped one. The angle of the stem, {{the first part of}} the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 33 degrees. The hull was extremely strong for its size and the shell plating thickness at the ice belt, , was twice <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> in the strongest winter ships at that time.|$|E
25|$|By 1800 BC, Indians were {{cultivating}} {{several different}} plants. The Riverton Site in the Wabash River valley of Illinois, near {{the present day}} village of Palestine, {{is one of the}} best known early sites of cultivation. Ten house sites have been discovered at Riverton, indicating a population of 50 to 100 people in the community. Among the hearths and storage pits associated with the houses, archaeologists found a large number of plant remains, including a large number of seeds of chenopods (goosefoot or lamb's quarters) which are likely cultivated plants. Some of the chenopod (Chenopodium berlandieri) seeds had husks only one third <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> wild seeds. Riverton farmers had bred them selectively to produce a seed easier to access than wild varieties of the same plant.|$|E
25|$|The wing {{included}} three clawed fingers; however, unlike in some more primitive theropods, the longest two fingers were not separate, but were bound {{together by the}} skin and other tissue forming the wing, so Anchiornis was functionally two-fingered. These bound fingers were incorporated into a post-patagium, or flap of skin and other tissues that helped support the bases of the main wing feathers. Like the toes, the skin around {{the bottom of the}} fingers was covered in tiny, rounded scales. Unlike the toes, the flesh around the underside of the finger bones was twice <b>as</b> <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> the bones themselves and lacked distinct pads; instead, the fingers were straight and smooth without any major creases at the joints. Scales and skin around the fingers is very rarely preserved in fossils of early pennaraptorans, the only notable exceptions being Anchiornis and Caudipteryx, which had similar thick, scaly fingers associated with its wings.|$|E
