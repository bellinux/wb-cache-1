25|$|This video {{features}} Björk morphing into a {{polar bear}} - and proves that she's {{willing to do}} anything to push herself artistically. And the beauty of Hunter is its utter simplicity.

25|$|Timothy Hutton plays Archie Goodwin, and I can't see {{how anyone}} could do a better job.

I can no longer read a Stout novel without seeing him, or hearing his voice.|$|E

25|$|Singapore's Bilingual Policy {{has been}} commended on {{contributing}} to the country's economic success. The social and political stability that Singapore has enjoyed <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> has also been attributed to the Bilingual policy. There are however, a lot existing issues and potential problems underlying the bilingual policy, while the English language was useful in attaining national cohesion within the Multi-racial Country, Mandarin Chinese, Malay Language, Tamil Language have lost their prestige in the society. To rectify these issues, the government, the policy makers and the teaching professions should co-operate with one another. As front-line practitioners, local teachers have direct experience on the needs and difficulties of students. Parents and peers are invisible planners who have power to determine {{the success of the}} government's language policy. The collective collaboration of the government, policy makers, local teachers, parents and peers more effective and indigenised language policy can be designed.|$|E

25|$|The {{reign of}} Queen Elizabeth II saw a {{departure}} from the normal practice in issuing gold coinage. A small number of gold £5 pieces were struck in 1953 in order to provide continuity of the series, and again in 1957, but neither of these strikings were released to the public, with the result that they are now valued in the £250,000–£500,000 range. No further £5 gold pieces were struck until 1980, nine years after decimalisation, since when they have been issued somewhat haphazardly in most years. Coins from 1980 to 1984 use the Arnold Machin effigy of the Queen, while the 1985–1990 coins use the Raphael Maklouf effigy. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> use the Pistrucci reverse. In 1989 a completely new design was used to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the first issue of the sovereign coin – the obverse shows the Queen seated on the coronation throne holding the orb and sceptre, with the legend ELIZABETH II DEI GRA REG FID DEF, while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a double rose and the legend ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOLD SOVEREIGN 1489–1989.|$|E
