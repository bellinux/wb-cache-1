5|$|Brenton came up {{with the}} idea to show an episode dealing with a Muslim hero set out to stop a group of Islamic terrorists.

Although much of the episode was set in Birmingham, it was filmed entirely in London. The episode sees the introduction of regular character Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), and the return of Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who first appeared in the first episode and returned so that the character's role can be expanded.|$|E

Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E
