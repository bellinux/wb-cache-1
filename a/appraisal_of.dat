McCreary appointed a tax commission to study the revenue system, and the Board of Assessments and Valuation made a more realistic <b>appraisal</b> <b>of</b> corporate property. McCreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways, and a bipartisan vote in the General Assembly established the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Near the close of the session, McCreary County was created and named in the governor's honor. It was the last of Kentucky's 120 counties to be constituted.|$|E
40|$|A recent {{integrative}} {{cognitive model}} proposed that multiple, extreme, personalized, {{positive and negative}} <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> internal states predispose to maintain and exacerbate bipolar symptoms. This study aimed to directly assess conviction {{in a range of}} positive and negative <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> internal states suggested by the model, by using a laboratory-based computerized task. In a student sample (n = 68), a history of hypomania was associated with more positive and less negative <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> internal states, and a history of depression was associated with more negative appraisals and less positive <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> internal states. The sample was then split into three groups for comparison: bipolar risk (n = 18), depression risk (n = 20) and controls (n = 30). Relative to controls, the bipolar risk group made more extreme ratings <b>of</b> catastrophic <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> low activation states and tended to make more extreme ratings <b>of</b> <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> high activation states. The depression risk group scored higher on a range <b>of</b> negative <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> low activation states. These findings provide tentative support for the role of both positive and negative, extreme, personalized <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> internal states in hypomania and depression...|$|R

The first {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate if athletes differentiated the reflected <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> three significant others: coaches, parents and teammates. The second {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relation between reflected <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> those three significant others and athletes' self-perceptions in terms of competence and future progress. Participants were 368 young adult athletes (Mage = 21. 13). Preliminary analyses indicated that reflected <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> coaches and teammates were strongly related, supporting the existence of a "generalized sport-other" (Amorose, 2003). Multiple regression analyses revealed that athletes' self-perceptions of competence were positively predicted by reflected <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> sport-others and parents about competence. Moreover, athletes' self-perceptions of future progress were positively predicted by reflected <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> sport-others and parents about future progress and by reflected <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> parents about competence, but negatively predicted by reflected <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> sport-others about competence.

5|$|Howe cabled Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} <b>appraisal</b> <b>of</b> {{the cost of the}} proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{eventually}} {{resumed his}} naval career, first {{as an assistant}} to the Director of Naval Intelligence and then, in August 1906, as Flag-captain to Rear-Admiral George Egerton on HMS Victorious. He had by this time become a national hero, despite his aversion to the limelight, and the expedition was being presented to the public as a triumph. This euphoria was not conducive to objective analysis, or to thoughtful <b>appraisal</b> <b>of</b> the expedition's strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the glorification by Scott of man-hauling as something intrinsically more noble than other ice travel techniques led to a general distrust of methods involving ski and dogs, a mindset that was carried forward into later expeditions. This mystified seasoned ice travellers such as Fridtjof Nansen, whose advice on such matters was usually sought, but often set aside.|$|E
40|$|Objective Cognitive {{models have}} {{suggested}} that extreme <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> affective states and maladaptive affect regulation strategies are important {{in the development of}} bipolar symptomatology. Little is known about the pathway by which these appraisals and behaviours interact in the formation of activated and depressed affective states. This study tested the predictions that (1) ascent behaviours mediate the relationship between positive <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> activated mood and activation; and (2) descent behaviours mediate the relationship between negative <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> activated mood and depression. Method A total of 52 individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder (confirmed by structured interview) completed biweekly assessments of affect regulation behaviours and mood for 4 weeks. Positive and negative <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> affective states were assessed at baseline through the Hypomanic Attitudes and Positive Prediction Inventory. Multilevel mediation analysis was used to explore the data. Results Ascent behaviours partially mediated the relationship between positive <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> activated mood and activation. Descent behaviours, but not negative <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> activated mood, predicted levels of depression indicating the absence of a mediation effect. Conclusion The results suggest that positive <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> activated mood can escalate activation in individuals with bipolar disorder. Such appraisals may be inherently rewarding and reinforcing directly elevating levels of activation, whilst increasing individuals' use of ascent behaviours. The results are consistent with the view that appraisals and behaviours should be targeted during cognitive behavioural therapy for bipolar disorder. Practitioner points It may be beneficial to target positive <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> activated mood in cognitive behavioural therapy for mania. Cognitive behavioural therapists may also wish to focus on identifying and targeting individuals' use of ascent behaviours to reduce highly activated states...|$|R

30|$|Study 2 again {{found that}} the {{cultural}} influences on appraisals tended to extend to trauma memories. Specifically, Asian trauma survivors {{reported higher levels of}} pleasantness and legitimacy appraisals and lower levels of anticipated effort, goal/need conduciveness and attentional activity than the British group. This supports previous research that suggests Western cultures generally emphasize <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> anticipated effort and Asian cultures tend to appraise situations to be more legitimate when compared to Western cultures (Mauro et al. 1992; Mesquita and Walker 2003). Given the role <b>of</b> <b>appraisals</b> in PTSD, Study 2 was also interested in appraisals that differentiated between those with and without PTSD. Those with and without PTSD did not differ in their <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> attentional activity, certainty and coping associated with the negative memory. However, for the trauma memory those with PTSD reported fewer <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> attentional activity, certainty and coping than those without PTSD. Furthermore, those without PTSD appraised less personal responsibility for the trauma event. These differences between those with and without PTSD were evident regardless of one’s cultural background suggesting cultural similarities in the dysfunction <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> those with PTSD. The only appraisal type that differed cross-culturally was control; <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> control only differentiated between British trauma survivors with and without PTSD for the trauma memory. This aligns with Western cultures valuing control and violations of cultural expectations resulting in psychological distress (e.g. Jobson and O’Kearney 2009; Mesquita and Walker 2003).|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the factors that {{influence}} satisfactory divorce settlements. We assumed that feelings of guilt toward the former partner might – directly or indirectly – be one of these factors. Feelings of guilt, which often occur in divorce, elicit cooperative negotiation behaviour. We hypothesised that guilt, mediated by cooperative negotiation behaviour, would be related to participants’ subjective <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> their divorce settlements. Furthermore, we predicted that this relation would be moderated by the divorce procedure (i. e., litigated divorce or consensual divorce) followed by the participants. We used survey data of 166 participants who {{were in the process of}} divorcing. Guilt was assessed at outset, as was negotiation behaviour at one year, and <b>appraisals</b> <b>of</b> divorce settlements at two years.
