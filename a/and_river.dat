5|$|The {{portion of}} NY254 along Lower Warren Street <b>and</b> <b>River</b> Street has had several designations over the years. From 1924 to 1930, {{it was part}} of the {{original}} NY30. In 1927, it also became part of US4, which initially overlapped NY30 from Glens Falls to Whitehall. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY30 was reassigned elsewhere while US4 was rerouted to bypass Glens Falls to the east. As a result, Lower Warren Street <b>and</b> <b>River</b> Street became part of NY32B.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean <b>and</b> <b>river</b> fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer <b>and</b> <b>river</b> fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called inunnguaq.|$|E
