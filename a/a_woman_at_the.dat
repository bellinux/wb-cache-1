5|$|In 1961 Harold Knight died at Colwall; {{the couple}} had been married fifty-eight years. Knight's second autobiography, The Magic of a Line was {{published}} in 1965, to coincide with a major retrospective of her work at the Royal Academy. The exhibition, the first such for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Academy, contained over 250 works, and was followed in 1968 and 1969 by further retrospective exhibitions at the Upper Grosvenor Galleries.|$|E
5|$|Sayers {{was educated}} {{at home and}} then at the University of Oxford. This was unusual for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, as they were not {{admitted}} as full members of the university until 1920 – five years after Sayers had completed her first class degree in medieval French. In 1916, a year after her graduation, Sayer published her first book, a collection of poems entitled Op. I, which she followed two years later with a second, a slim volume titled Catholic Tales and Christian Songs. The same year she was invited to edit and contribute to the annual editions of Oxford Poetry, which she did for the next three years. In 1923 she published Whose Body?, a murder mystery novel featuring the fictional Lord Peter Wimsey, and went on to write eleven novels and five collections of short stories about the character. The Wimsey stories were popular, and successful enough for Sayers to leave the advertising agency where she was working.|$|E
5|$|The diverse {{elements}} of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously {{referred to as a}} film noir, a horror film, a Künstlerroman, and a buddy film. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events – most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner, of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film's narrative, particularly an image of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film. Despite disagreement over certain details of the work, Barton Fink continues to be positively received, with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman among its admirers.|$|E

25|$|She {{had become}} an artist against the norms for French women in her day and became a well-regarded artist. She made still life, landscape, figure {{pictures}} and, very rare for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, a number of nude paintings of women. Charmy's initial works were Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. As her career evolved she was influenced by Fauvism and the School of Paris movements. She was a recipient of the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.|$|E

25|$|The {{skeletal}} remains of five people were unearthed within a corresponding tomb, {{in the lower}} levels of the third chamber in November 2014. The dead of the burial are: <b>A</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 60, two men aged 35–45, a newborn infant and a fifth person represented by minimum fragments.

25|$|Furundžija was a {{commander}} of the Jokers- {{a unit of the}} Bosnian Croatian Militia, which allegedly attacked villages of Bosnian Muslims through imprisonment, murder, sexual abuse, and other forms of violence- he was accused of participating in the torture involving forced sexual intercourse of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Jokers' headquarters. The prosecution depended on the testimony of the woman, and this drew debate over the credibility of the victim's memory. The case led to the concern for the survivors of traumatic events in addition to the victims.|$|E

25|$|For <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of the seventeenth century, Artemisia being a painter represented an uncommon and difficult choice, but not an exceptional one. Before Artemisia, {{between the end of}} the 1500 and the {{beginning of}} 1600, other women painters had successful careers, including Sofonisba Anguissola (Born in Cremona around 1530, Palermo around 1625), was called into Spain by King Philip II and Lavinia Fontana (Bologna, 1552, Rome 1614) departed for Rome by invitation of Pope Clement VIII. Later Fede Galizia (Milano or Trento, 1578, Milano 1630) painted still lifes and a Judith with the head of Holofernes.|$|E
25|$|Igor Volk {{was planned}} to be the {{commander}} of the first manned Buran flight. There were two purposes of the Soyuz T-12 mission, one of which was to give Volk spaceflight experience. The other purpose, seen as the more important factor, was to beat the United States and have the first spacewalk by <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time of the Soyuz T-12 mission the Buran programme was still a state secret. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including the British Interplanetary Society magazine Spaceflight, to ask why a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This law {{extended}} {{the statute of}} limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of her career found that she had been making less money than men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.|$|E

25|$|The cycle {{began at}} the {{entrance}} wall, featuring images of Marie's childhood years and her marriage to Henry IV. Four of the images are devoted to the marriage, possibly because marriage at Marie's relatively advanced age of twenty-seven was quite rare for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. This half ends with a depiction of Marie's coronation. The wall opposite the gallery's entrance presents {{an image of the}} assassination and assumption of Henry IV, as well as the proclamation of the widowed Marie's regency. From there, the second half of Rubens' cycle begins addressing the more controversial issues from Marie's reign. For example, both the altercation and reconciliation with her son Louis XIII are subjects Marie de' Medici commissioned Rubens to paint for this gallery.|$|E
25|$|Most pottery {{found at}} the Nodena sites is of the Mississippian Bell Plain variety. It was buff colored, {{contains}} large fragments of ground mussel shell as a tempering agent, and is not as smooth and polished as other varieties. Other examples found there are much finer, with a finer ground shell as a temper, some instances being so finely ground as to look untempered. Shapes and decoration were varied in the mortuary pottery, from brighly colored abstract spiral designs, to elaborate effigy vessels depicting human heads, animals, and hunters and their prey. Pottery made by the Nodena people was built up from strips of clay, and then smoothed out by the potter, much like other pottery in the Eastern America area where the potters wheel was unknown. Slips using galena for white, hematite for red, and sometimes graphite for black were used to paint the pottery, with a red on white swastika design being particularly popular. Sometimes incising was used (an example is the incised raptor image on the effigy head pot pictured), although it is rare in Nodena pottery. Women were probably the makers of pottery, as in most other Native American cultures. The grave of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Nodena Site contained 11 polishing pebbles and a mushroom shaped pottery anvil.|$|E
25|$|Williams rebounded {{by winning}} 19 {{out of her}} next 20 matches (losing only to sister Venus in the semifinals of the Rogers Cup). This streak include titles at the Bank of the West Classic {{as well as her}} first Western & Southern Open title and her third {{consecutive}} and sixth overall US Open singles title which she won without having dropped a set. With this victory Serena tied Chris Evert for most singles titles won by <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> US Open in the Open Era. Williams also tied Evert and Martina Navratilova's 18 Grand Slam singles titles won in the Open Era. By virtue of having won both the US Open and the US Open Series, Williams collected $4,000,000 – the biggest payday in tennis history. At the Wuhan Open a viral illness forced her to retire while up a break in the first set against Alizé Cornet. Cornet thus became the first woman since Justine Henin in 2007 to record three victories over Williams in one year. At the China Open Williams retired prior to her quarterfinal match versus Samantha Stosur. At the 2014 WTA Finals in Singapore Serena advanced to the final for the third consecutive year despite having equaled her career worst loss in her second round robin match versus Simona Halep. Williams won her fifth WTA Finals title by avenging her loss to Halep in the championship match for her seventh title of the year. Serena finished the year ranked world No. 1 for the fourth time in her career. She held the No. 1 ranking for the entire calendar year, a feat not accomplished since Steffi Graf in 1996. She was also voted WTA Player of the Year and ITF World Champion for a third consecutive year (sixth overall).|$|E

But its director is one of very few who actually did." ...|$|E
