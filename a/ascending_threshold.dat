40|$|Road traffic {{accidents}} are a serious burden {{to the health}} systems of many countries especially in South Africa. Research aimed at reducing traffic related accidents is of importance as traffic crashes are rated as the second leading cause of fatalities in South Africa and ninth in the world. Despite the extensive efforts into {{research and development of}} new technology, driver fatigue still remains a cause of vehicle accidents worldwide. Fatigue plays a role in up to 20 % of vehicle accidents with many being serious or fatal. Numerous coping behaviours are employed by drivers to counteract the negative effects of fatigue. The most common coping behaviours include taking short naps, talking to passengers, listening to the radio, opening windows and drinking stimulants. Driving breaks have long been identified as an effective countermeasure against fatigue. Most research done in driving breaks has investigated the duration of the breaks, activity undertaken during the break and the frequency of the breaks taken outside the vehicle. However limited literature is available on the effectiveness of breaks in counteracting the effects of fatigue. The objective of the current study was aimed at assessing whether short duration breaks are an effective countermeasure against fatigue. Physiological, neurophysiological, subjective and performance measures were used as indicators for fatigue. Additional focus of the research was determining whether breaks were more or less effective at counteracting the effects of fatigue at different times of day. Twelve participants were recruited for the study, six males and six females. The participants were required to perform a driving task on a simulator for 90 minutes. The study consisted of four independent conditions, namely driving during the day with breaks, driving during the day without breaks, driving during the night with breaks and driving during the night without breaks. The without breaks conditions were similar except that they occurred at different times of the day, one session at night and the other session during day time, as was the case for the conditions with breaks. The driving task used in the current study was a low fidelity simulator tracking task. The participants were required to follow a centre line displayed on a tracking path as accurately as possible. The measurements that were recorded in this study included physiological, performance, subjective and neurophysiological. Physiological measures included heart rate and heart rate variability (frequency domain) and core body temperature. The <b>ascending</b> <b>threshold</b> of the critical flicker fusion frequency was the only neurophysiological measurement included in the current investigation. Performance was quantified by mean deviation from a centre line participants were meant to track. Two rating scales were used: Karolinska sleepiness scale and the Wits sleepiness scale were used for the measurement of subjective sleepiness. Heart rate, heart rate variability and mean deviation were measured continuously throughout the 90 minute driving task. Critical flicker fusion frequency, temperature and the subjective scales were measured before and after the 90 minute driving task. The results indicated that the short duration breaks during day time had a positive effect on driving performance; however the breaks at night had a negative effect on driving performance. Heart rate was higher during the day compared to night time and the heart rate variability high frequency spectrum values were lower during the day condition, to show the activation of the sympathetic nervous system which is characteristic of day time. The night conditions had lower heart rate values and higher heart rate variability high frequency values, which show the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system which is dominant during periods of fatigue and night time. Subjective sleepiness levels were also higher at night compared to day time...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{issues related to}} the method of limits. First is anticipation, which is caused by the subject's {{awareness}} that the turn-points determine a change in response. Anticipation produces better <b>ascending</b> <b>thresholds</b> and worse descending thresholds.|$|R
40|$|Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold (CFFT) is a psychophysical {{threshold}} and, {{in psychological}} terms, it {{is regarded as}} a measure of information processing capacity. CFFT has previously been shown to be a valid and reliable measure in young healthy volunteers and it also {{has a long history of}} use as a psychopharmacological measure in this group. Furthermore, the test satisfies many of the requirements of an ideal measure for monitoring change, especially in a psychopharmacological context. Despite this, CFFT has been neglected as a research tool in elderly and Alzheimer's disease (AD) populations and was therefore investigated further in this regard. CFFT in community-based healthy elderly subjects was normally distributed, but CFFT and <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>thresholds</b> were not significantly correlated with age. The difference between <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>thresholds</b> was, however, significantly correlated with age and this relationship appeared to be due almost entirely to a change in the descending threshold. In addition, descending thresholds were found to be significantly greater than <b>ascending</b> <b>thresholds</b> in healthy elderly subjects. In contrast, patients with AD were found to have significantly lower CFFT and descending scores compared with healthy elderly subjects. Interestingly, descending thresholds were significantly lower than <b>ascending</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the patient group, a feature that may be a characteristic of AD. Mean CFFT and <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>thresholds</b> were found to have a high test-retest, split-half and inter-rater reliability, in addition to being significantly correlated with a number of psychometric measures, clinical scales and neuropsychological instruments commonly used to assess patients with AD. CFFT is a quick and simple measure to administer and patients had no difficulty completing the test. Because the measure is a psychophysical threshold, it is free from educational and cultural bias and there are no floor or ceiling effects. From the results of this work, CFFT appears to be a useful research tool in AD. It may be a suitable measure for monitoring cognitive change over time, either in community studies of AD or a clinical trial context, but further work is required. The technique might also contribute to the early detection of AD. This application would be particularly important because it would enable effective pharmacotherapies to be started early during the course of the illness before neuronal damage is too advanced and this would have significant benefits for patient...|$|R

40|$|Gelfand's {{hypothesis}} {{stating that}} pain threshold and pain tolerance have differ-ent loadings of physiological and psychological components was investigated. Specifically it was postulated that nonpermissive instructions (suggestion) should significantly increase pain tolerance compared to permissive instructions (no suggestion), {{but that there}} should be no significant changes in pain thresh-old. 34 healthy Ss were divided randomly into 2 equal groups. 1 started with permissive and the other with nonpermissive instructions using electrical stimulation, and after 5 trials instructions were reversed in both groups. The results supported the hypothesis for <b>ascending</b> pain <b>threshold</b> and pain tolerance, but not for descending pain threshold. The latter was explained by suggesting that pain relief is an emotional state interfering with sensory discrimination. Gelfand, Ullmann, and Krasner (1963) have suggested that experimental pain thresh-old and pain tolerance might have differen...|$|R
30|$|From the {{accuracy}} of the Tree-CNN, we can know the following points. When the threshold T is greater than the superior value or less than the inferior value, {{the accuracy}} of the Tree-CNN is close to the original CNN. Because when the threshold T is greater than the superior value or less than the inferior value, the number of coarse categories is close to 1 or to the number of fine categories. Between the superior and inferior value, the Tree-CNN is equivalent to the original CNN. When the threshold T is greater than the inferior value and less than superior value, the Tree-CNN outperforms the original CNN. And between the superior and inferior value, {{the accuracy of}} the Tree-CNN shows a general trend from rise to decline. The accuracy of the Tree-CNN based on CaffeNet rises from threshold 0.05 and starts to decline from threshold 0.2. The accuracy of the Tree-CNN based on VGG 16 <b>ascends</b> from <b>threshold</b> 0.05 and begins to descend from threshold 0.15. The accuracy of the Tree-CNN based on GoogLeNet goes up from threshold 0.07 and begins to descend from threshold 0.10.|$|R
30|$|All scans will be {{performed}} on a high-end third-generation dual-source CT scanner (Somatom Force, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). The scans will be standard, not electrocardiographically gated, ultra-high pitch chest CT acquisitions. A 2 × 192 × 0.6 mm slice collimation and gantry rotation time of 0.25 s will be used. A dynamically adapted pitch value of 2.65 to 3.00 {{will be used to}} increase the scan field of view where needed (354 – 391 mm). The tube voltage will be set by automated tube voltage selection software (automated tube voltage selection, CAREkV, Siemens Healthineers), with a quality reference tube voltage of 110 kVpqual.ref and reference tube current of 40 mAsqual.ref (CareDose 4 D™, Siemens Healthineers). Scan delay will be determined with the bolus tracking technique, wherein a circular region of interest will be placed in the <b>ascending</b> aorta; a <b>threshold</b> of 50 Hounsfield units and an additional delay of 6 s (table movement and breath hold command) will be used to start scanning.|$|R
40|$|We give {{a simple}} {{stochastic}} {{model for the}} optimal size of staff of a large (especially, but not only, research) corporation {{as a function of}} its wealth and provide a quantitative theory with explicit prescriptions for increasing, decreasing or leaving constant the number of personnel in order to maximize total profit, discounted with fixed interest rate. Features of the optimal policy seem in at least qualitative agreement with observed practice in that, for example, there are occasional large scale down-sizings similar to large layoffs or incentive retirement plans observed in real corporations. In the optimal plan, this type of firing occurs only on an upswing, i. e. when the company's fortune <b>ascends</b> to a <b>threshold</b> relative to staff size. Small scale or "attrition" firing also occurs under the optimal policy, but this type of firing occurs only on a downswing, when the company's fortune descends to a threshold relative to staff size.

40|$|The {{threshold}} current evoking self-stimulation or multiples of this current {{was used to}} investigate the effect of ACTH 4 – 10 on response performance for brain stimulation reward in the medial septum (MS) and the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). ACTH 4 – 10 in a dose of 50 μg administered SC enhanced bar-pressing for low intensity stimulation but failed to change self-stimulation rates when the base-line rate exceeded 100 responses per 6 min. The peptide lowered the threshold for producing self-stimulation {{but only in the}} MS. When an <b>ascending</b> sequence of <b>threshold</b> multiples was used within a session, ACTH 4 – 10 treatment resulted in an increase in response rate at 1. 2 and 1. 5 threshold multiples and a decrease at 3. 0 times the threshold but only in the MS. The results indicate that ACTH 4 – 10 facilitated response performance at a low response rate by enhancing the rewarding effect of brain stimulation. Furthermore, the peptide changed the response pattern which normally followed reinforcement shift in the MS...|$|R
6000|$|After taking {{leave of}} the cathedral, I found {{my way out}} of another of the city gates, and soon turned aside into a green lane. [...] . Soon the lane passed through a hamlet {{consisting}} of a few farm-houses, the shabbiest and dreariest that can be conceived, ancient, and ugly, and dilapidated, with iron-grated windows below, and heavy wooden shutters on the windows above,--high, ruinous walls shutting in the courts, and ponderous gates, one of which was off its hinges. The farm-yards were perfect pictures of disarray and slovenly administration of home affairs. Only one of these houses had a door opening on the road, and that was the meanest in the hamlet. A flight of narrow stone stairs <b>ascended</b> from the <b>threshold</b> to the second story. All these houses were specimens of a rude antiquity, built of brick and stone, with the marks of arched doors and windows where a subsequent generation had shut up the lights, or the accesses which the original builders had opened. Humble as these dwellings are,--though large and high compared with rural residences in other countries,--they may very probably date back to the times when Siena was a warlike republic, and when every house in its neighborhood had need to be a fortress. I suppose, however, prowling banditti were the only enemies against whom a defence would be attempted. What lives must now be lived there,--in beastly ignorance, mental sluggishness, hard toil for little profit, filth, and a horrible discomfort of fleas; for if the palaces of Italy are overrun with these pests, what must the country hovels be!

40|$|AVM and Low Speed Maneuvers: Human Factors Issues ProjectThis {{experiment}} {{examined how}} close to objects (such as a wall or another vehicle) people would drive when parking. The findings will {{to be used as}} a basis for visual and/or auditory warnings provided by parking assistance systems. A total of 16 people (8 ages 18 - 30, 8 over age 65) served as subjects. Data were collected both for the subjects sitting in the driver’s seat of a 2004 Infinity Q 45 and standing outside the vehicle (as if directing someone else to park). Data were collected for the desired clearance distance between the test vehicle and a wall (for safety concerns, the wall was moved instead of the vehicle) in <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>thresholds,</b> for 8 cardinal clock positions. The overall mean distance was 20. 4 in for the 640 data points collected, with a range of 2. 5 to 48. 5 in. As an example of the specific results, when the wall was moved towards the driver and the subject was an observer (outside the car), the desired distances were 17. 0, 18. 9, 19. 1, 20. 3, 17. 4, 18. 7, 14. 7, and 15. 8 in for 1 : 30, 3 : 00, 4 : 30, 6 : 00, 7 : 30, 9 : 00, 10 : 30 and 12 : 00 clock positions. Using the regression method, 1 of the 2 methods developed, desired distance in inches was equal to 9. 5 + 1. 6 (if the position was to the side or rear) + 6. 7 (if a door was to be opened) + 5. 7 (if the object was approaching the car) + 4. 9 (if the driver’s clearance was estimated) +. 07 times the driver’s age...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the smooth pursuit reflex {{and the ability to}} suppress the vestibulo-ocular reflex were assessed in 10 normal subjects and in patients with a variety of diseases of the central nervous system. Pursuit was measured as the maximum velocity of slow phase eye movement in response to a laser target moving sinusoidally at various frequencies up to 1 Hz and with amplitudes stepped up to 35 ° peak. Suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex was assessed with subjects seated in a Barany chair rotating sinusoidally in yaw at matching frequencies. The breakpoint of vestibulo-ocular reflex supression was defined as the peak velocity of oscillation at which nystagmus appeared on electro-oculographic recording as determined by the method of <b>ascending</b> and descending <b>thresholds.</b> For normal subjects, at all frequencies, the breakpoint of suppression corresponded closely with the peak velocity of pursuit at the corresponding frequency of target oscillation. In some patients pursuit and suppression were comparably impaired. In others either pursuit or suppression could be selectively impaired with the other function left intact. The results demonstrate that the mechanisms of pursuit and visual suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex have similar dynamics and share a common pathway at least {{to the level of the}} cerebellum. Thereafter, there is presumably an anatomical and functional dissociation of the signals mediating the two functions. The key area involved appears to be the flocculus for lesions of this structure alone cause impairment of both functions. The findings also indicate that the appropriate way to test smooth pursuit in relationship to suppression is to increase the amplitude of target oscillation until the peak slow eye movement velocity is determined for each frequency. The finding that increasing excursion increases maximum pursuit velocity supports the view that pursuit has an acceleration limit which is more critical in determining performance than velocity limitations. The results establish the assessment of vestibulo-ocular reflex suppression as a powerful test of the integrity of CNS function independent of its previous association with disordered pursuit...|$|R
