40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} whether an accreditation program facilitates healthcare organizations (HCOs) to evolve and maintain high-performance {{human resource management}} (HRM) systems. Design. Cross-sectional multimethod study. Setting and participants. Healthcare organizations participating in the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards Evaluation and Quality Improvement Program (EQuIP 4) between 2007 and 2011. Main outcome measures. Ratings across the EQuIP 4 HRM criteria, a clinical performance measure, surveyor reports (HRM information) and interview data (opinions and experiences regarding HRM and accreditation). Results. Healthcare organizations identified as high performing on <b>accreditation</b> HRM <b>criteria</b> seek excellence primarily because of internal motivations linked to best practice. Participation in an accreditation program is a secondary and less significant influence. Notwithstanding, the accreditation program provides the HCO opportunity for internal and external review and assessment of their performance; the accreditation activities are reflective learning and feedback events. Conclusions. This study reveals that HCOs that pursue highly performing HRM systems use participation in an accreditation program as an opportunity. Their organizational mindset {{is to use the}} program as a tool by which to reflect and obtain feedback on their performance so to maintain or improve their management of staff and delivery of care. 6 page(s...|$|R

Whereas in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland palliative medicine together with pain treatment was recognized as a specialized branch already in 1987, in the Czech environment it was officially constituted as late as 2004. The core part of the WHO definition of palliative care says that "palliative care is an approach that improves {{the quality of life}} of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual. " Palliative care thus inseparably includes attending to patients' existential, spiritual and religious needs.
