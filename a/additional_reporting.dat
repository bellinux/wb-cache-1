2500|$|On March 26, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit {{ruled in}} SpeechNow.org. v. FEC that the {{contribution}} limits of 2 U.S.C. §441a were unconstitutional {{as applied to}} individuals' contributions to SpeechNow. The court also ruled that the reporting requirements of 2 U.S.C. §§432, 433 and 434(a) and the organizational requirements of 2 U.S.C. §431(4) and §431(8) can be constitutionally applied to SpeechNow. A unanimous nine-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals struck down the federal limits on contributions to federal political committees that make only independent expenditures and do not contribute to candidates or political parties. This type of [...] "independent expenditure committee" [...] is inherently non-corruptive, the Court reasoned, and therefore contributions to such a committee can not be limited based on the government's interest in preventing political corruption. In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC, in which the Supreme Court held {{that the government has}} no anti-corruption interest in limiting independent expenditures, the appeals court ruled that [...] "contributions to groups that make only independent expenditures cannot corrupt or create the appearance of corruption." [...] As a result, the court of appeals held that the government has no anti-corruption interest in limiting contributions to an independent group such as SpeechNow. Contribution limits as applied to SpeechNow [...] "violate the First Amendment by preventing [...] from donating to SpeechNow in excess of the limits and by prohibiting SpeechNow from accepting donations in excess of the limits." [...] The court noted that its holding does not affect direct contributions to candidates, but rather contributions to a group that makes only independent expenditures. The appeals court held that, while disclosure and reporting requirements do impose a burden on First Amendment interests, they [...] "'impose no ceiling on campaign related activities'" [...] and [...] "'do not prevent anyone from speaking.'" [...] Furthermore, the court held that the <b>additional</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements that the Commission would impose on SpeechNow if it were organized as a political committee are minimal, [...] "given the relative simplicity with which SpeechNow intends to operate." [...] Since SpeechNow already had a number of [...] "planned contributions" [...] from individuals, the court ruled that SpeechNow could not compare itself to [...] "ad hoc groups that want to create themselves {{on the spur of the}} moment." [...] Since the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate and who is funding that speech, the court held that requiring such disclosure and organization as a political committee are sufficiently important governmental interests to justify the <b>additional</b> <b>reporting</b> and registration burdens on SpeechNow.|$|E
