5000|$|An Arrangement {{concerning}} certain Dairy Products (Geneva, 12 January 1970), {{a treaty}} entered into {{by a number}} of nations, was established initially to set a minimum price of skimmed milk powder to $20 per 100 kilograms. The intention was to expand the arrangement to other dairy products. It also established a management committee within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade framework to oversee the arrangement. Three years later, a Protocol relating to Milk Fat (Geneva, 2 April 1973) was agreed to, extending the skimmed milk powder controls to other internationally transportable milk products, such as Ghee, anhydrous milk fat, anhydrous butteroil and <b>anhydrous</b> <b>butterfat,</b> butteroil and butterfat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} started by Virgil Odell. Virgil Odell owned several theatres in Idaho in the 1960s. At the time theatres were using creamery butter, or stick butter {{as we know it}} today, to put on top of popcorn. The problem with creamery butter is that it needs to be {{refrigerated}} and when melted it separates into water, milk solids and butterfat so it had to be constantly stirred before being put on the popcorn. Virgil discovered a process used by the military to remove water and milk solids from butter. This process enabled butter to be shipped overseas without refrigeration or special handling. This process led to the introduction of Odell’s <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>Butterfat</b> for the use on theatre popcorn, it was an immediate success with theatres. On January 31, 1961, Odell Concession Specialty Co., Inc., was formed.On October 27, 1979, Virgil Odell died. Arthur R. Anderson assumed the duties of the President with 51% ownership in Odell Concession Specialty Co., Inc., the other 49% was split between three other individuals. At the time Odell Concession Specialty Co., Inc., consisted of five theatres and what is commonly referred to as ‘the Butter Company’. Within five years of Virgil’s death the company was split up and the three share holders chose to own and operate the theatres and Art Anderson became sole proprietor of what is now called Odell’s, ‘the Butter Company.’In 2001 Art Anderson sold Odell’s to his son Arthur M. Anderson and his wife Vikki B. Anderson ...|$|E
40|$|Lipases {{have become}} {{powerful}} {{tools in the}} manufacture of structured fats either via randomization of their glyceride composition or incorporation of externally supplied fatty acid residues in such glycerides. The present communication reports on changes that occurred in the fatty acid pool of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>butterfat</b> subject to interesterification and to acidolysis with oleic acid catalyzed by a commercial lipase immobilized by plain physical adsorption onto hydrophobic hollow fibers at 40 °C under controlled water activity. The main goal of this research effort was to engineer butterfat so as to increase its level of unsaturated fatty acid residues and concomitantly decrease its level of medium- and long-chain saturated fatty acid residues (viz. lauric and myristic acids). Although a certain degree of net hydrolysis of butterfat was observed, the triacylglycerols of butterfat subject to acidolysis were found to possess more (approximately 30 % w/w) oleic acid and significantly less (8 % w/w) lauric acid and less (2 % w/w) myristic acid than those of the original butterfat...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{increased}} interest in reactions catalyzed by lipases from various microbial sources has prompted attempts to rationally design lipases and lipase-catalyzed processes aiming at modification of functional properties of oils and fats. The present communication reports experimental work on the chemical modification of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>butterfat</b> via interesterification reactions with oleic acid catalyzed by a commercial lipase immobilized by plain physical adsorption on a bundle of hydrophobic hollow fibers. The main goal of this research effort was to engineer butterfat so as to increase its level of unsaturated fatty acid residues (viz. oleic acid) and concomitantly decrease its level of medium-to-long chain saturated fatty acid residues (viz. myristic and palmitic acids). All reactions were carried out at 40 °C {{in the absence of}} any solvent but under controlled water activity, and their extent was monitored via Chromatographic assays for free fatty acids.

40|$|The {{modification}} of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>butterfat</b> via interesterification reactions with oleic acid catalyzed by a lipase from Mucor circinelloides immobilized by adsorption onto hydrophobic hollow fibers is described. A reasonable degree of incorporation of free (externally added) oleic acid into the triacylglycerols of butterfat {{has been achieved}} while short-chain fatty acid residues remained virtually unaffected. Total saturated triacylglycerols decreased by 27 %, and triacylglycerols with 32 – 44 acyl carbons (which contained two or three lauric, myristic, or palmitic acid residues) decreased by 33 %. Total monoene and polyene triacylglycerols increased by 21 % and 17 %, respectively. The triacylglycerols (TAG) of interesterified butterfat had approximately 27 % more oleic acid residues and approximately 8 % less lauric, 6 % less myristic, and 6 % less palmitic acid residues {{than those of the}} original butterfat; the fraction of low-melting TAG peak increased by 19 % whereas that of high-melting TAG decreased by 83 %. Although a certain degree of butterfat hydrolysis was observed, enzymatic acidolysis was technically feasible and able to produce a modified butterfat with a stronger nutraceutical character...|$|E
40|$|The present {{communication}} {{describes the}} chemical modification of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>butterfat</b> by interesterification with oleic acid catalyzed by a lipase of Mucor javanicus. Two reactor configurations were tested, a batch-stirred tank reactor containing suspended lipase and a batch-stirred tank reactor {{in combination with}} a hollow-fiber membrane module containing adsorbed lipase. The goal {{of this research was}} to assess the advantage of using a (hydrophobic) porous support to immobilize the lipase in attempts to engineer butterfat with increased levels of unsaturated fatty acid residues (oleic acid) at the expense of medium-to-long chain saturated fatty acids (myristic and palmitic acids). Reactions were carried out at 40 °C in the absence of solvent under controlled water activity, and were monitored by chromatographic assays for free fatty acids. The results obtained indicate that the rate of interesterification using the proposed reactor configuration is enhanced by a factor above 100 relative to that using suspended lipase, for the same protein mass basis. Although hydrolysis of butterfat occurred to some degree, the enzymatic process that uses the hollow-fiber reactor was technically superior to the stirred tank system...|$|E
40|$|Many {{workers have}} {{observed}} that under standardized conditions {{only part of the}} fat present in spray-dried milk can be extracted by fat solvents. This fat is usually called 'free fat' and has been related to other powder properties which are of practical importance. Contradictory results obtained by different workers have raised doubts concerning the practical significance of free fat. Moreover the explanation generally accepted in the literature, that free fat is 'unprotected fat' mainly situated on the particle surface, is not altogether satisfactory. An experimental study of the properties of free fat and its relation to powder properties of practical significance was carried out. The results of this study were described in a series of papers in Netherlands Milk and Dairy Journal and are collected in this thesis. In Chapter 1 a general outline of the problem and a brief review of the literature are given. It seemed desirable to investigate the influence of the experimental conditions during the determination of the free-fat content because earlier authors used widely varying conditions. In Chapter 2 it is shown that the extraction time and temperature influence considerably the amount of fat which is extracted but its influence may depend strongly on the powder under investigation. Because it was not clear which experimental conditions yielded free-fat contents relevant to other powder properties, two methods were usually applied, differing widely in contact time and extraction temperature. Particle size is of major importance for the physical properties of most powders. In Chapter 3 two methods are described to determine the mean particle size and the particle size distribution of spray powders, viz gas permeametry and microscopic counting, respectively. With these methods the influence of certain process parameters on particle size and the influence of particle size on the free-fat content of spray-dried whole milk were studied. It is shown that the mean particle size increases inversely with Vp, p being the spray pressure. Orifice diameters appeared to be of minor importance. Increasing the dry-solids content of the concentrated milk in the range of 30 - 45 % resulted in a reduction of the number of small particles. No influence of the particle size on the fat content and the moisture content was observed, but both the mean particle density and the free-fat content strongly increase with decreasing particle size. It is suggested that the influence of some processing parameters on the free-fat content of spray-dried whole milk may be attributed to their influence on particle size. With 20 powders, widely differing in free-fat content, the possible relationship between free fat and other powder properties of practical importance is investigated (Chapter 4). From the results the following conclusions were drawn: 1. There is no influence of the free fat on the development of oxidation flavour during 6 months' storage at 30 °C in the presence of air; 2. The solubility of spray-dried whole milk is usually better if its free-fat content is higher, but probably there is no causal relationship between the two quantities; 3. Below a free-fat content of 20 % (of the fat) there is a tendency for the dispersibility to increase with decreasing amount of free fat. This is not the case above 20 % free fat. Because both particle size and homogenization may effect dispersibility as well as free-fat content, no causal influence of free fat on dispersibility could be observed; 4. Neither cream rising nor foam formation during reconstitution is materially influenced by the amount of free fat in the powder. Churning of the butterfat by vigorously stirring during reconstitution was observed only with powders containing much free fat, prepared from unhomogenized concentrated milk. No quantitative correlation was observed between the amount of churned butterfat and the free-fat content of the powder. Chapter 5 treats the stickiness of spray-dried whole milk and a simple test to determine the cohesion of such powders is described. Good agreement between this cohesion and the visual observation of stickiness was found. It is shown that the cohesion of spray-dried whole milk increases with decreasing particle size as expected. Unexpected, however, was that the cohesion is independent of fat content in the range of 20 - 45 % fat, and of free-fat content. In spite of this, experiments at different temperatures showed that the milk fat {{is an important factor in}} the cohesion, and it is suggested that only a small amount of surface fat on the particles is already sufficient to give cohesion to whole milk powders. Probably fat contents higher than 20 % result in more surface fat, but this does not increase the cohesion. It is shown that an increase of moisture content decreases the cohesion in the range of 2 - 4 %, but a strong rise of cohesion occurs in the range of 4 - 7 %, probably due to increased plasticity of the powder particles and to lactose crystallization. In Chapter 6 it is shown that the free-fat content decreases considerably when the moisture content of spray-dried whole milk is increased in the range of 2 - 8 %. The effect appeared to be reversible. It is suggested that part of the fat is extracted from the milk powder particles via capillary pores or cracks, which close when the powder absorbs water. With a scanning electron microscope photographs were taken of dried milk particles without water being used, this to avoid artefacts. The method is described in Chapter 7 and a few photographs are shown. From measurement of the penetration speed of nitrogen into the powder particle porosity factor was calculated (Chapter 8). There appeared to be a strong correlation (r = 0. 94) between the free-fat content and this particle porosity. From this observation it is concluded that the particle porosity is of major importance for the extraction of fat from milk powders. Photographs taken with a scanning electron microscope show cracks and pores in particles with high porosity, whereas in less porous powder particles only surface folds and occasional cracks could be observed. Possible explanations of particle porosity are discussed. Chapter 9 contains the fat globule size distributions in concentrated milk and in milk reconstituted from whole milk spray powders with various free-fat contents as determined with a Coulter counter. It is concluded that the spraying of concentrated milk causes a considerable size reduction of the fat globules. Some coalescence of fat globules takes place during drying or during reconstitution of milk from the powders. A rather good relationship is obtained between the free-fat content of the powders and the percentage of fat present as fat globules> 2 μm in milk reconstituted from the same powders. The phenomenon that only part of the fat in spray-dried whole milk can be extracted by fat solvents is usually explained by the assumption that this 'free fat' is unprotected surface fat. In Chapter 10 it is shown that surface fat in such powders is dissolved in a few seconds by organic solvents. The amount of fat extracted by the majority of the extraction methods with much longer contact times applied until now, consists for only a minor part of surface fat in many cases. Experiments with spray powders consisting only of lactose and <b>anhydrous</b> <b>butterfat</b> show that fat globules without protein membranes can be protected by the amorphous lactose against fat solvents. A new model for the occurrence of free fat in spray-dried whole milk, based on the accessibility of the fat in the powder particles, is proposed. The relationship between fat content and free-fat content of spray-dried whole milk is investigated, and the curves which were obtained are explained with the new model. Finally the practical consequences of the model are discussed and compared with the results of earlier experiments. The conclusion is that only the surface fat is relevant because of its possible influence on dispersibility and the cohesion of spray-dried whole milk. This fat can be determined approximately with a very short extraction (e. g. 10 seconds) at room temperature...|$|E
