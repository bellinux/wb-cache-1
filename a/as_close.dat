5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes <b>as</b> <b>close</b> {{as possible to the}} trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (<b>as</b> <b>close</b> as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E
