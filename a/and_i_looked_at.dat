500|$|McQueen and MacGraw {{began an}} affair during production. She would {{eventually}} leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster {{was worried that}} their relationship could have a potentially {{negative impact on the}} film by causing a [...] scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> what I had done in it, I hated my own performance. I liked the picture, but I despised my own work." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} pilot, Rodat {{dedicated}} a five-page montage to the alien invasion, but {{decided not to}} go through with it as it had been done before in films such as War of the Worlds. [...] "I wrote a few drafts of it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and say, 'Ay-yay-yay, I’ve seen this before. There’s no emotion to this. It feels like one of those montages,'" [...] he said. Rodat {{came up with the idea}} of having the children in the series [...] "harnessed by aliens". [...] "When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [...] was the idea that adults are killed if they’re a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered. The harness was a logical outgrowth of that. Then what we’ll explore is what the harnessing does to the kid over the course of the show but that also is something that’s going to have to unveil itself gradually," [...] he stated. Spielberg previously explored the idea of enslaved children in the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.|$|E
2500|$|Ellison {{graduated}} in 1981 from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy, {{where he was}} active in sports and a senator in the student government. At the age of 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: [...] "I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [...] I had begun to really look around and ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. When I looked at my spiritual life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> what might inform social change, justice in society... I found Islam." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 15, 2012, Korine {{contacted}} rapper Riff Raff about {{appearing in}} an upcoming film of his which {{would turn out to}} be Spring Breakers. Once the trailer was released there was speculation that the character Alien was based around Riff Raff. According to Franco, his character is based on the underground rap artist Dangeruss, who has a cameo in the film. [...] "Of course Harmony <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> some of Riff Raff's videos as inspiration, but he was one of a number of people we looked at. I would say the biggest influence on the role was this local Florida rapper named Dangeruss. He's fairly unknown, but he was down there in the place, living the life, and he became the biggest model for me, and he's in the movie." [...] After much back and forth between both camps about the issue, during July 2013 Riff Raff announced he was suing the creators of Spring Breakers for $10 million for [...] "sampling" [...] his life without his permission or a proper producer credit.|$|E
