5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of <b>advection</b> <b>fog</b> during breezy conditions.|$|E

40|$|A {{major concern}} to the National Weather Service marine {{operations}} {{is the problem of}} forecasting <b>advection</b> <b>fogs</b> at sea. Currently fog forecasts are issued using statistical methods only over the open ocean domain but no such system is available for coastal and offshore areas. We propose to use a partially diagnostic model, designed specifically for this problem, which relies on output fields from the global operational Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model. The boundary and initial conditions of moisture and temperature, as well as the MRF's horizontal wind predictions are interpolated to the fog model grid over an arbitrarily selected coastal and offshore ocean region. The moisture fields are used to prescribe a droplet size distribution and compute liquid water content, neither of which is accounted for in the global model. Fog development is governed by the droplet size distribution and advection and exchange of heat and moisture.

40|$|Fog {{frequency}} at Kushiro, Hokkaido Island, Japan, during midsummer depends strongly on the <b>advection</b> of sea <b>fog</b> {{from the}} ocean onto the land, which itself depends {{on the behavior of}} the North Pacific High (NPH). This study investigates the relationship between unusually high fog frequency at Kushiro during early autumn in 2012 and the NPH extension. The total fog frequency during mid-August through mid-September in 2012 was the highest over the past 32 years. A northwestward expansion of the NPH caused anomalous southerly winds, that transported warm moist air onto the southeast coast of Hokkaido Island. This warm moist southerly flow favors the onshore <b>advection</b> of sea <b>fog,</b> as it does during midsummer.

2500|$|The <b>advection</b> of <b>fog</b> {{along the}} California {{coastline}} is propelled onto land {{by one of}} several processes. A cold front can push the marine layer coast-ward, an occurrence most typical in the spring or late fall. During the summer months, a low pressure trough produced by intense heating inland creates a strong pressure gradient, drawing in the dense marine layer. Also during the summer, strong high pressure aloft over the desert southwest, usually {{in connection with the}} summer monsoon, produces a south to southeasterly flow which can drive the offshore marine layer up the coastline; a phenomenon known as a [...] "southerly surge", typically following a coastal heat spell. However, if the monsoonal flow is sufficiently turbulent, it might instead break up the marine layer and any fog it may contain. Moderate turbulence will typically transform a fog bank, lifting it and breaking it up into shallow convective clouds called stratocumulus.|$|R
40|$|In this PhD Thesis {{the main}} types of the {{atmospheric}} circulation {{evolution in the}} lower and middle troposphere are being defined, that favor 5 kinds of extreme weather episodes in Greece (warm episodes, cold episodes, episodes of extreme rainfall, snowfall episodes and fog episodes). For this purpose two data sets are used a) daily values of meteorological parameters at 16 meteorological stations in Greece, for the period 1 / 9 / 1957 to 31 / 8 / 2002. b) values of meteorological parameters describing the atmospheric circulation in the lower and middle troposphere in Europe and the Mediterranean one day before the initiation, {{the day of the}} initiation and one day {{after the end of the}} episodes. For each of the 5 kinds of episodes, from the first data set the episodes dates are located. On the second data set a methodology scheme is applied that comprises of the multivariate methods of Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis in order to define the main types of the atmospheric circulation, favoring each kind of episodes. For the warm episodes, the cold episodes, the extreme rain episodes, the snow episodes and the fog episodes, 7, 6, 16, 13 and 10 main types of the atmospheric circulation are defined, respectively. The main cause of warm episodes in Greece is the anticyclonic circulation over Greece, due to the expansion of the Azores Anticyclone. Cold episodes are favored by the combination of an anticyclone in Europe and cyclonic circulation in the eastern Mediterranean. The main cause of extreme rain episodes is a depression in the Mediterranean and a trough in the 500 hPa level west of Greece. Snow episodes are favored mainly by the combination of anticyclonic circulation in Europe and a deep depression in the Mediterranean, which contribute to the advection of cold air masses and to an intense baroclinicity over Greece. The formation of radiation fogs is being favored by anticyclonic circulation and a constant pressure value over Greece. A weak southerly flow of humid air masses can cause <b>advection</b> <b>fogs</b> mainly in the coastal regions and in the islands. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the central}} Namib Desert, dune-free {{surfaces}} are separated abruptly from {{a sea of}} yellow and red sand dunes at the Kuiseb River canyon. The off-white hues of the dune-free area result from anomalously high surficial gypsum enrichment.

One of various sources of sulfate for the gypsum bodies is oceanic H 2 S, supplied to desert land-surfaces by regular fog incursions. Since fog events are widespread along the coast, the question of anomalous gypsum accumulations north of the dune sea arises. Satellite imagery, in conjunction with more detailed handheld photography from the space shuttle, indicates that the penetration of fog inland is significantly greater over the gypsum surfaces than it is over the dunes. It is postulated that the thermal gradient between these surfaces generates a heat low centered over the northern part of dune sea and that this enhances fog and H 2 S advection on its north side onto the nearby dune-free zone.

It has the largest supratidal (143  ha) and floodplain (797. 1  ha) salt marshes in the country. Intertidal salt marsh covers 91. 94  ha, reeds and sedges 60. 05  ha and the submerged macrophyte Zostera capensis 47. 72  ha. Correspondence analysis revealed intertidal, supratidal, floodplain and terrestrial plant community types within the studied estuary.

The environmental variables that had the greatest influence on the distribution of the dominant salt marsh species, S. pillansii, included soil moisture, distance from the estuary, elevation above mean sea level, and depth to the water table. The most important ecological driver for salt marsh vegetation, especially along the arid West Coast of southern Africa, is moisture.

The few studies that separate fog from other clouds report {{a slight increase in}} sea fog and slight decrease in land fog over the past decades, but regional and pan-Arctic patterns are equivocal. No studies have focussed on the coast-to-inland transition zone, where many ice sheet outlets and glaciers terminate and where it is suggested that fog and related temperature inversions suppress glacier melt. In this study, we investigate whether melt season fog frequency and timing has changed in coastal regions around the Greenland Sea over the past 50 - 70 years. Fog occurrence and characteristics were analysed using synoptic weather data from East Greenland, Jan Mayen, Svalbard and Iceland national and research stations, supplemented with Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive and International Arctic Buoy Programme data. A multivariate fog detection model was developed on the basis weather stations with direct (visibility) and indirect (temperature, relative humidity, wind) fog data.
