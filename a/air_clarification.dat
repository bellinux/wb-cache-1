40|$|Porous {{material}} with photocatalytic characteristics {{was developed and}} tested for <b>air</b> <b>clarification</b> and water purification application by using the spark plasma sintering process. In this paper. the aggregate type porous material is made by using titanium oxide which also has photocatalyst function. The sintered material has porous structure with the volumetric porosity of about 56 ï½ž 70 %. The titanium oxide crystal structure of the sintered material changes from the anatase type to the rutile type according to the temperature range from 1173 to 1223 K, respectively. Also, the decolorization test for the methylene blue solution is performed by using the sintered porous material. It has been confirmed that in the anatase type new material photocatalyst functioning is better accomplished than the rutile type...|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{also offered}} another {{showcase}} for actress Becki Newton who was interviewed in TV Guide the week this episode <b>aired.</b> Another <b>clarification</b> {{would be her}} character's last name. Originally {{thought to have been}} 'Tanner', Amanda's last name is revealed to be 'Tanen', as shown on the computer screen during her acting reel that she shows Marc. In addition, The Middle Ages restaurant commercial is also a reference to Newton appearing in an Olive Garden commercial, which she did before joining [...] "Ugly Betty." [...] The Middle Ages is also a spoof of the Medieval Times chain.|$|R

[...] After one day of fermentation, the thick foam that formed {{on the top of}} the fermentation vat was skimmed off and discarded. After 60 hours, up to 50% of the available sugars would have been fermented by the yeast, and thick clumps of yeast were skimmed off of the surface and harvested for reuse. [...] The beer was then pumped with sterile <b>air</b> into <b>clarification</b> tanks. [...] Isinglass was added to clarify the beverage, and then it was bottled.|$|R
