5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and <b>aromatic</b> <b>wine</b> which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E
25|$|Chardonnay {{has served}} as parent to several French-American hybrid grapes, as well as {{crossings}} with other V. vinifera varieties. Examples include the hybrid Chardonel, which was a Chardonnay and Seyval blanc cross produced in 1953 at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station. Mutations of the Chardonnay grape include the rare pink-berried 'Chardonnay Rose'; also 'Chardonnay Blanc Musqué', which produces an intensely <b>aromatic</b> <b>wine.</b> Chardonnay Blanc Musqué is mostly found around the Mâconnais village of Clessé and sometimes confused with the 'Dijon-166' clone planted in South Africa, which yields Muscat-like aromas.|$|E

50|$|Palm sap begins fermenting {{immediately}} after collection, due to natural yeasts {{in the air}} (often spurred by residual yeast left in the collecting container). Within two hours, fermentation yields an <b>aromatic</b> <b>wine</b> of up to 4% alcohol content, mildly intoxicating and sweet. The wine may be allowed to ferment longer, up to a day, to yield a stronger, more sour and acidic taste, which some people prefer. Longer fermentation produces vinegar instead of stronger wine.|$|E

50|$|Timorasso {{is a white}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety grown {{primarily}} in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. There {{it is used to}} make <b>aromatic</b> <b>wine</b> with some aging potential as well as the pomace brandy specialty of grappa. Timorasso owes its modern-day existence to Walter Massa, as the thick-skinned native variety was almost extinct in the early 1980s in the area of Tortona. Thanks to Massa pioneering efforts, by the late 1990s, other local producers began planting the grape variety themselves and there are now more than 20 firms growing and producing Timorasso.|$|E
5000|$|The grape {{is mostly}} {{used to make}} mildly acidic and young white wines mostly {{suitable}} for early consumption or blending with other varieties, both red and white. It is often the main grape of white Rioja and is sometimes blended in small amounts with Tempranillo and red Garnacha, both in unoaked and oaked versions. It was introduced in Rioja after the phylloxera epidemic, where it largely replaced Malvasia and Garnacha blanca, partially because of the ability of its wines to better withstand oxidation. [...] Some producers of white Rioja make superior wines (Reserva and Gran Reserva) subjected to extended ageing that can span decades, resulting in a highly distinctive and <b>aromatic</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Gewürztraminer (...) is an <b>aromatic</b> <b>wine</b> grape variety, used {{in white}} wines, and {{performs}} best in cooler climates. In English, {{it is sometimes}} referred to colloquially as Gewürz (this is never the case in German, because [...] "Gewürz" [...] means [...] "herb" [...] or [...] "spice"), and in French it is written [...] (without the umlaut). Gewürztraminer is a variety with a pink to red skin colour, {{which makes it a}} [...] "white wine grape" [...] as opposed to the blue to black-skinned varieties commonly referred to as [...] "red wine grapes". The variety has high natural sugar and the wines are white and usually off-dry, with a flamboyant bouquet of lychees. Indeed, Gewürztraminer and lychees share the same aroma compounds. Dry Gewürztraminers may also have aromas of roses, passion fruit and floral notes. It is not uncommon to notice some spritz (fine bubbles {{on the inside of the}} glass).|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} analysis undertaken for Peters' 1994 study of wines aboard William Salthouse acted in juxtaposition to the 1983 study which occurred directly after the wines had been excavated. Evidence had arisen in between tests suggested {{there were three}} wines aboard the vessel, as mentioned above. The oenological interpretation of the {{chemical analysis}} used contemporary samples of the desert wines as a referential parameter. The levels of acids, sugars and ethanol would therefore be compared with these modern day wines. The results of the chemical analysis found that William Salthouse wines all fell within the parameters of contemporary Sauternes. However, while Muscat today is a fortified, <b>aromatic</b> <b>wine</b> with high sugar levels, it was traditionally an unfotified wine that did not require additional spirits. Therefore, the presumption that the wine styles of Sauternes and Muscat had gone unchanged for the last 150 years was incorrect, and influenced the resulting conclusions of the oenological analysis.|$|E
