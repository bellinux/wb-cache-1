5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> moment.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{confirmed}} his presidential ambitions on his October 16, 2007 show, stating {{his intention to}} run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms, but only as a favorite son in his native South Carolina. In an interview with Larry King he revealed that, as his running mate, he would consider Mike Huckabee (who himself jokingly offered Colbert the vice presidential position). He also speculated {{on the possibility of}} a Colbert-Putin or Colbert-Colbert ticket. Colbert abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary. On November 1, 2007, it was announced that he would not appear on the Democratic primary ballot either, after being deemed ineligible by the South Carolina Democratic Party executive committee. Several days later he announced that he was withdrawing from the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> Supreme Court battle.|$|E

25|$|After <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> wait, Mr. Wickham {{is somehow}} persuaded to marry Lydia. With {{some degree of}} decency restored, Lydia visits her family and tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding.

25|$|The outside world, at {{the time}} focused on the wars of the former Yugoslavia, turned its {{attention}} away from the happenings of central Africa. The exception was the international humanitarian aid community and the United Nations, for whom the Great Lakes crisis was <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> dilemma that has been the topic of extensive analysis and ethical arguments. As a result, UNHCR reworked its procedures to try to ensure greater international commitment in its interventions.|$|E

25|$|Women in {{polygamous}} relationships at {{the time}} described the experience as a great trial that taught them self-denial. Many were protestant converts and believed that their suffering helped to purify them. Even when the practice was established, {{it was not always}} accepted. Mothers discouraged their daughters from entering into plural relationships. For many, the decision to accept polygamy and practice it was <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> and difficult process that brought them closer to God. Some women did not accept polygamy at first and had to pray about, study, and question the practice before receiving an answer from God and accepting it. Elizabeth Graham MacDonald saw polygamy as a form of discipline that taught her subordination to God and her family.|$|E
25|$|Yamada {{eventually}} becomes {{affiliated with}} Ryu, and updates the latter {{on how the}} world has reacted to the events in Neo-Tokyo; they later learn that an American naval fleet lingers nearby. Tetsuo becomes heavily dependent on government-issued pills to quell his headaches. Seeking answers, he visits Lady Miyako at her temple and is given a comprehensive history of the government project that unleashed Akira. Miyako advises Tetsuo to quit the pills {{in order to become}} more powerful; Tetsuo begins <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> withdrawal. Meanwhile, Tetsuo's aide, the Captain, stages an unsuccessful Empire assault on Miyako's temple. After the Colonel uses SOL to attack the Empire's army, a mysterious event opens a rift in the sky dumping massive debris from Akira's second explosion... as well as Kaneda.|$|E
25|$|As a {{small child}} she was {{considered}} delicate and for her health spent {{much time in the}} country. She travelled with her mother and other family to Italy, where she made <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> recovery from an illness caused by worms that nearly ended her life. After returning with her mother to England, she rejoined a lively menage of children who lived at Devonshire House and Roehampton, including her cousins: Lord Hartington (later the 6th Duke of Devonshire), Lady Georgiana, and Lady Harriet Cavendish; and two children of Lady Elizabeth Foster and the Duke of Devonshire. With these children she was educated at Devonshire House, at a Dame School in Knightsbridge, and at her overindulgent mother's and grandmother Lady Spencer's knees, although they found her behaviour increasingly troublesome, and experimented with sedatives like laudanum and a special governess to control her. During childhood she became particularly close to Lady Harriet Cavendish, who was only three months older.|$|E

25|$|As the {{defending}} champions, Santos qualified automatically to the semifinal {{stage of the}} 1963 Copa Libertadores. The ballet blanco managed to retain the title in spectacular fashion after impressive victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors. Pelé helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that contained legends such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> last-minute goal in {{the first leg of}} the semifinals and bring the match to 1-1. In the second leg, Pelé produced one of his best performances as a footballer with a hat-trick in the Estádio do Maracanã as Santos crushed Botafogo 0-4 in the second leg. Appearing in their second consecutive final, Santos started the series by winning 3-2 in the first leg thanks to a brace by Coutinho and defeating the Boca Juniors of José Sanfilippo and Antonio Rattín 1-2 in La Bombonera, with another goal from Pelé and Coutinho each, becoming the first (and so far only) Brazilian team to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pelé finished the tournament as the scorer runner-up with 5 goals, while Coutinho finished third with 3 goals.|$|E
500|$|Until 30 October, he {{was still}} capable of {{speaking}} unhindered. His doctors performed several surgeries to no avail, and the cancer spread to his throat. One night, he suffered <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> attack of meningitis. In a fever-induced delirium, Rio Branco said: [...] "Do not disturb Slavery's march [...]" [...] His last warning went unheeded, for rather than simply allowing slavery to slowly die out, the last remnants of slavery would be aggressively extinguished in 1888 by Princess Isabel and his former minister João Alfredo (by then President of the Council). At 7:05am on 1 November 1880, Rio Branco died. His last words were: [...] "I will confirm before God everything I have affirmed to men." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party {{executive}} council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. [...] "The {{general sense of}} the council was that he wasn't a serious candidate {{and that was why}} he wasn't selected to be on the ballot", stated John Werner, the party's director. In addition, he was declared [...] "not viable", as he was running in only one state. Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> Supreme Court battle. CNN has reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot. One anonymous member of the council told CNN that former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum had placed pressure on them to refuse Colbert's application despite his steady rise in polls.|$|E

500|$|While Butcher contributed about a {{third of}} the album's lyrics, most of the music on Loveless was written and {{performed}} by Shields. Shields stated, [...] "I'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [...]" [...] Shields assumed Butcher's guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she [...] "was never a great guitarist". Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit on the album sleeve. Googe said, [...] "At the beginning I used to go down [...] most days but after a while I began to feel pretty superfluous so I went down less." [...] Butcher explained, [...] "for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had in his head and play it right would have been <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> process." [...] "It wasn't collaborative at all", Alan Moulder said of the album's recording. [...] "Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted, but he never explained it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{collapse}} of the January 1863 Uprising prompted <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> reappraisal of Poland's situation. [...] Poles gave up their earlier practice of [...] "measuring their resources by their aspirations," [...] and buckled down to hard work and study.

2500|$|Yet, upon {{arriving}} on the Groves, the King was suddenly overcome with worry and doubt. The hairs {{on his body}} even stood up as he felt <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> fear. He asked his physician nervously and suspiciously, [...] "Are you not deceiving me, Jivaka? Do you not betray me and hand my life to the enemies? How come it happens {{that there is not}} a single sound heard at all, not even coughs or sneezes in the huge group of 1,250 Sangha monks?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The team {{suffered}} badly {{after their}} big sweep of Cincinnati (Aug. 9–11) with a season-high five-game losing streak that dropped them to 4½ games behind the Reds for the NL Central title, and three games behind the Phillies in the wild-card race. [...] On August 26, Albert Pujols hit his 400th career {{home run in}} Washington, becoming the third-youngest player to reach that milestone. [...] Unfortunately, it came as part of <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> 11-10 extra inning defeat to the Nationals, one in which St. Louis blew a 5-3 lead, scored four in the ninth to go ahead 10-8, then blew that lead when closer Ryan Franklin gave up a two-run homer {{in the bottom of}} the 9th. [...] The Cardinals slipped to a ghastly 5-12 after the sweep of Cincinnati for the remainder of the month, with 11 of those losses coming to teams with losing records (the Cubs, Brewers, Pirates, Nationals, and Astros).|$|E
2500|$|In early 2007, Kendall is elated {{to learn}} that she is {{pregnant}} with Zach's child. The two become centered in a peaceful place [...] until Kendall's former best friend, Greenlee, returns to Pine Valley and soon attempts to kidnap Kendall's son, Spike, feeling that the little boy should have been hers in the first place. While attempting to kidnap Spike, Greenlee changes her mind and feels that it is wrong; however, {{she is in a}} car accident, as Spike is with her, which contributes significantly to Kendall going into premature labor once she finds out what Greenlee has done. Zach and Kendall endure <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> time of worrying about the health of two sons. Kendall gives birth to a baby boy named Ian Slater, born July 26, 2007, premature. On August 6, 2007, it is revealed that Spike is deaf due to the car accident with Greenlee. Kendall bans Greenlee from her life, but later pretends to be her friend in an elaborate scheme of revenge against her.|$|E
2500|$|Torello and Abrams {{finally get}} enough proof of skimmed profits and rigged games to rescind Luca's gaming license and bar him from {{entering}} {{any and all}} casinos. [...] Infuriated, he impulsively goes after Goldman, whose wife he had been sleeping with (among other women); he then sends Holman to try and kill Goldman with a car bomb, but Goldman survives. [...] When Luca (still seething from being banned from his own casino) brutally rapes Pauli Taglia's girlfriend, a distraught Taglia turns against his boss and implicates Luca in the union leader's killing to Torello's Strike Force, just as Luca gets the ban on his license lifted. [...] Luca goes on trial for multiple murders, but cleverly orchestrates a mistrial by having Holman tamper with the jury and making sure the judge learns of it. [...] Luca is then released on bail pending a new trial. He apologizes to Pauli, who forgives him out of loyalty, though it is <b>an</b> <b>agonizing</b> decision since it means abandoning {{the one person who}} was genuinely decent towards him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilks {{cleared his}} throat and turned <b>an</b> <b>agonized</b> eye on Mr. Nugent. He {{would have liked to have}} asked why Mrs. Silk should think it {{necessary}} to inform him, but the fear of precipitating a crisis stayed his tongue.|$|R
