5|$|Any second-order <b>automaton</b> may be {{transformed}} into a conventional cellular <b>automaton,</b> in which the transition function depends only on the single previous time step, by combining pairs of states from consecutive time steps of the second-order <b>automaton</b> into single states of a conventional cellular <b>automaton.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} reversible cellular <b>automaton</b> {{is equivalent}} to an <b>automaton</b> in rectangular form, in which the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and in which both the forward and reverse evolution of the <b>automaton</b> have neighborhoods with just two cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a reversible <b>automaton</b> has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a reversible <b>automaton</b> with smaller neighborhoods and more states per cell, in which each cell of the simulating <b>automaton</b> simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated <b>automaton.</b> The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid are exactly the conditions required on the forward and reverse transition functions of these two-cell neighborhoods to be the reverses of each other. That is, every semicentral bigroupoid defines a reversible cellular <b>automaton</b> in rectangular form, in which the transition function of the <b>automaton</b> uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and in which the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the <b>automaton.</b> Every one-dimensional reversible cellular <b>automaton</b> {{is equivalent to}} one in this form.|$|E
5|$|For a block {{cellular}} <b>automaton,</b> testing reversibility is also easy: the <b>automaton</b> is reversible if {{and only}} if the transition function on the blocks of the <b>automaton</b> is invertible, and in this case the reverse <b>automaton</b> has the same block structure with the inverse transition function.|$|E

5|$|A {{reversible}} cellular <b>automaton</b> is {{a cellular}} <b>automaton</b> {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular <b>automaton</b> can always be described by another cellular <b>automaton</b> rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Cellular <b>automaton</b> {{models of}} this system divide the square lattice into two {{alternating}} subsets, and perform updates {{on one of the}} two subsets at a time. In each update, every cell that can flip does so. This defines a reversible cellular <b>automaton</b> which can be used to investigate the Ising model.|$|E
5|$|Designing {{reversible}} {{rules for}} block cellular automata, and {{determining whether a}} given rule is reversible, is easy: for a block cellular <b>automaton</b> to be reversible it is necessary and sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} <b>automaton</b> is itself reversible. When a block cellular <b>automaton</b> is reversible, the time-reversed version of its dynamics can also be described as a block cellular <b>automaton</b> with the same block structure, using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E

They are communicating with each other by videophone; their conversation is intercut with dance sequences from black-and-white movies of the 1920s and 1930s, as well as color snippets of O-Jay and Petersen performing. The <b>automatons</b> are also able to view each other directly, the male with a binocular headset and the female with a telescope. As the song progresses, the stiff movements of the <b>automatons</b> become more fluid and dance-like. At {{the end of the}} video, the two <b>automatons</b> meet, dance, and walk away together, arm in arm.|$|R

5|$|Several {{methods are}} known for {{defining}} cellular automata rules that are reversible; these include the block cellular <b>automaton</b> method, in which each update partitions the cells into blocks and applies an invertible function separately to each block, and the second-order cellular <b>automaton</b> method, in which the update rule combines states from two previous steps of the <b>automaton.</b> When an <b>automaton</b> is not defined by one of these methods, but is instead given as a rule table, the problem of testing whether it is reversible is solvable for block cellular automata and for one-dimensional cellular automata, but is undecidable for other types of cellular automata.|$|E
5|$|The Critters rule is a block {{cellular}} <b>automaton</b> in which, at each step, {{the cells}} of the <b>automaton</b> are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function flips the state of every cell in a block that does not have exactly two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with exactly three live cells. Because this function is invertible, the <b>automaton</b> defined by these rules is a reversible cellular <b>automaton.</b>|$|E
5|$|The time-reversed {{dynamics}} of the <b>automaton</b> can be described by another cellular <b>automaton.</b> Clearly, {{for this to be}} possible, the update rule must be bijective. In the other direction, if the update rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function that is also bijective. This inverse function must be a cellular <b>automaton</b> rule. The proof of this fact uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous with respect to the Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E

5|$|A {{cellular}} <b>automaton</b> {{consists of}} an array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a cellular <b>automaton</b> is an assignment of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular <b>automaton</b> forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|A lattice gas <b>automaton</b> is a {{cellular}} <b>automaton</b> designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E
5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular <b>automaton</b> has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the <b>automaton</b> on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the <b>automaton</b> {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given <b>automaton.</b> Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E

5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible cellular <b>automaton</b> may {{be placed}} into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the <b>automaton</b> rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall <b>automaton</b> are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E
