40|$|This paper studies a new {{automated}} {{container terminal}} (ACT) system which utilizes multistory frame bridges and rail-mounted trolleys to transport containers between the quay and the yard. Beside typical ACT systems use trucks or <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> vehicles for <b>transporting</b> containers between quay cranes and yard cranes, {{the new design}} uses three types of handling machines, namely, ground trolleys (GTs), transfer platforms (TPs), and frame trolleys (FTs). These three types of handling machines collaborate with one another to transport containers. This study decomposes the system into several subsystems. Each subsystem has one TP and several FTs and GTs dedicated to this TP. Then, a Markov chain model is developed to analyze the throughput of TPs. At last, {{the performance of the}} new ACT system is estimated. Sensitivity analyzes the numbers, and the processing rates of trolleys are conducted through the numeric experiments...|$|R

40|$|As {{industry}} {{moves toward}} {{an era of}} complete automation and mass customisation, <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> vehicles (AGVs) are used as material handling systems.

40|$|In this paper, a {{study on}} {{landmark}} tracking using unrectified omnidirectional image for <b>automated</b> <b>guided</b> vehicle is presented. Omnidirectional image from a catadioptric camera may appear distorted against the height of an object.

The barcode is modified to suit the detection process where the barcode adopted cyan instead of white background and bears a red strip on top for orientation. The image processing can directly begin tracking landmarks when no distortion rectification in the image was required.
