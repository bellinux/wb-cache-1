Trawling was conducted in two experimental lines, and bottom morphol-ogy, sediment texture, and water turbidity were analyzed before trawling and at different time intervals afterward. The tracks of the trawl gears were still observed in sonographs of the bottom 1 yr after the first experiment. The vertical grain size distribution of bottom deposits indicated that the thickness of the sediment removed by the net between the gears was about 2 – 3 cm on average, though the erosion produced by the gears was deeper. Resuspended aggregates with a high silt content settled during the first hour after trawling, generating a temporary increase in the silt content of the surface sediment. One day after trawling, the surface sediment was mixed and already had a similar grain size distribution to that before trawling.

He underwent cardiac defibrillation and was prescribed amiodarone, but the arrhythmia recurred easily. Therefore, percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) was performed to prevent AF.

CAVB is a well-known complication of PTSMA, but fatal ventricular asystole several days after the procedure is rare. Intensive care is required after PTSMA implementation...|$|R
