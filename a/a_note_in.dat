5|$|The resort's {{staff had}} left <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> a message book at the swimming-pool {{reception}} area, asking {{that the same}} table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening {{for the last four}} evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.|$|E
5|$|Akash {{attends the}} bank {{settlement}} and reconciles with several friends {{with whom he}} had fallen out, as well as with his estranged father. Meanwhile, Kiara cannot stop thinking about Akash, and on the 31st she realises that she has fallen for him. Kunal discovers this and drops Kiara off at the airport. She reaches the bridge, but finds herself alone, believing she will never see Akash again. Just then he arrives. The pair go out to sea to die. Akash throws a beer bottle with <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> it, which Kiara gets and reads before he proposes to her. Surprised, she accepts, and the couple share a kiss while the Coast Guard rescues them. As the credits roll, Akash and Kiara are shown two years later, married with their baby boy.|$|E
5|$|George Hall and {{his family}} arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had {{established}} two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. <b>A</b> <b>note,</b> <b>in</b> his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub.|$|E

5|$|Graham {{travels to}} the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama, where he is {{contacted}} by Crawford, who tells him of Lounds' tabloid story on the case. Crawford also patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton, Lecktor's warden, who has found <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize {{it is from the}} Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor—and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor has removed. It is found to be an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper.|$|E
5|$|On his person, {{they find}} <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> his wallet that {{eventually}} leads Scully and Mulder {{to conclude that}} it was Tessa, not Ruby, who was pregnant. Under interrogation, Tessa confesses to killing Greg but denies Ruby was at Lake Okobogee that night. Mulder and Scully return to the Morris' house, and, finding it deserted, discover the binary-covered pieces of paper laid out {{across the living room}} floor, forming an image of Ruby's face. The agents return to Lake Okobogee, where they find Darlene and Kevin in the nearby woods. A motorcycle gang appears, and as Mulder hurries to rescue Kevin from their wake, Scully discovers Ruby nearby.|$|E
5|$|Viv wakes to find Bond gone, leaving <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> {{which he}} {{promises}} {{to send her}} police assistance and which he concludes by telling her not to dwell {{too much on the}} ugly events through which she has just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer in charge of the detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that all men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on—including Bond himself—are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off {{at the end of the}} book, continuing her tour of America, but despite the officer's warning still devoted to the memory of the spy who loved her.|$|E

5|$|Wallenberg started {{sleeping}} in a different house each night, to guard against being captured or killed by Arrow Cross Party members or by Adolf Eichmann's men. Two days before the Soviet Army occupied Budapest, Wallenberg negotiated with Eichmann and with Major-General Gerhard Schmidthuber, the supreme commander of German forces in Hungary. Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member Pál Szalai to deliver <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> which Wallenberg persuaded the occupying Germans to prevent a Fascist plan {{to blow up the}} Budapest ghetto and kill an estimated 70,000 Jews. The note also persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a death march of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting that {{the investigation}} is not an X-file, but simply a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder that they found <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the note was written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe they did it. Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from a missing person case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Viscount Walden {{recognized}} his contributions and welcomed the geologist Stoliczka {{to a high}} place among scientific ornithologists but disagreed with Stoliczka's idea of adding new species due to small differences in plumage.

It was sent to Belgrade to be printed, but this did not happen for an unknown reason, and it had to be printed in Thessaloniki nine years later, in 1840, by Theodosius of Sinaia. During the printing Theodosius substituted Peychinovich's original introduction with his own one, but still preserved the text that referred to the language of the work as the 'common Bulgarian language of Lower Moesia, of Skopje and Tetovo' (простїй Ѧзыкъ болгарский долнїѦ Мүссїи Скопсский и Тетовский).|$|E

After four days of impasse, the parties came to an agreement and the material proceeded to the URA in Caetité.|$|E
25|$|In the 2L year, {{students}} {{focus on}} advanced coursework.

The writing requirement can be satisfied through a seminar course, through an independent writing project, or <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> one of the law journals. All other courses in the 2L year are electives and commonly include corporate law and tax law as well as many other classes and seminars. Since establishing the practice-based curriculum, W incorporated its experiential curricular offerings, such as practicum courses, into the second-year in addition to casebook-oriented electives.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June 2013, a man {{who works}} for INB as a night {{watchman}} at Caetité’s Uranium Concentrate Unit fell into a pool filled with 20,000 m³ of radioactive fluids.

After the event made the news, INB released <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> which the company affirmed it had granted medical assistance to the worker.

25|$|Númenor – Númenor {{is one of}} {{the smaller}} good armies related to Gondor, {{representing}} also the Númenórean Realms in Exile (i.e. the Arnor and Gondor of the Second Age). Whilst it could be considered part of Gondor, it is only really used in Scenarios set in the Second Age (although sometimes its warriors can be used to represent Wardens of Pelargir). Númenor has a relatively limited range of warriors, but they are amongst the best warriors in the game, having access to the mighty heroes Isildur and Elendil. However, <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> the rulebook bans Númenórean armies to be used outside Second Age scenarios, so they are rarely seen in battle. Númenor is most frequently used with Elves, in Last Alliance-themed armies.|$|E
25|$|Especially in fansubs, the {{subtitle}} translator may translate both form and meaning. The subtitle translator may also choose to display <b>a</b> <b>note</b> <b>in</b> {{the subtitle}}s, usually in parentheses (“” and “”), or {{as a separate}} block of on-screen text—this allows the subtitle translator to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, the subtitle translator may leave {{a note on the}} screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see Japanese pronouns) and each pronoun is associated with a different degree of politeness. In order to compensate during the English translation process, the subtitle translator may reformulate the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.|$|E
25|$|For Surrey, Diver's {{best season}} was 1885 when he scored 941 runs in {{first-class}} matches {{and made his}} only century for the team, an innings of 143 against Oxford University. For the 1886 season, however, Diver {{went on to the}} Surrey staff as a professional cricketer: he was less successful as a batsman that season, though he did appear for the Players in the Gentlemen v Players fixture, an unusual distinction having played for the Gentlemen in 1884. He scored 25 runs in his only innings, {{the final day of the}} match being lost to rain.
