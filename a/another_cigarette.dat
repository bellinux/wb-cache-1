While waiting to bat he would watch the play or prowl the dressing room with a cigarette and would reflect with <b>another</b> <b>cigarette</b> after his dismissal. He rarely drank and preferred to retire early, especially on nights preceded match days. He was brought into cricket when social class and the hierarchy between amateur and professional was still the norm and retained some degree of politeness to his superiors, even {{at the end of}} his career. At home he could ill afford to hire mechanics or decorators and as a result become an accomplished car-repairman for his friends and colleagues, his own car was always kept spotless and in perfect working order, and was a keen DIY man. He was always careful with his money and frequently called up the management of a hotel if the room was not up to standard and argued if they charged too much. Barrington was a well known sayer of malapropisms such as; [...] "If you pitch it there you put the batsman in two-mans land", [...] "That was good bowling in anyone's cup of tea", [...] "The press went through the food like a swarm of lotuses" [...] and [...] "high-philosophy bullets".|$|E

50|$|Another common {{practice}} during botellón is cigarette smoking.

5000|$|There is an {{important}} conceptual distinction between a demerit good and a negative externality. A negative externality occurs when the consumption of a good has measurable negative consequences on others who do not consume the good themselves. [...] Pollution (due, for example, to automobile use) is the canonical example of a negative externality. <b>Another</b> example is <b>cigarettes.</b> It not only affects a deliberate or addicted smoker through damage to health, but also indirect smokers exposed to the smoke (second hand smoking). By contrast, a demerit good is viewed as undesirable because its consumption has negative effects upon the consumer.|$|R
50|$|A {{visit from}} a native woman {{interrupts}} the proceedings, {{and in a}} subsequent passage Bolte, enraged with his wife, is about to flog her with a whip when Karl comes to the rescue. All this happens {{just prior to the}} World War, and in the closing chapters word is received by both the Germans and the British that hostilities have been declared. Bolte, the snake, believes that money can buy his freedom from military service, but soon he learns otherwise. He is compelled to don a uniform and then decides to run away. His end is sudden, for he fires at one group of natives without knowing that others are behind him. They know something about Bolte and his pleas for his life fall on deaf ears. There follow episodes in which Karl goes to the rescue of Helen and others, who are in danger of an attack by the natives. These are pictured with due attention for red blood on the hero's shirt. It seems that the Britishers might have been more solicitous about Karl's wounds, but all the British commandant says when he comes up to Karl is to ask him whether he will have <b>another</b> Piccadilly <b>cigarette.</b>|$|R
60|$|All {{the while}} this ceaseless {{activity}} {{was going on}} there was a strange uproar--bawl and bellow, the shock of heavy bodies meeting and falling, the shrill jabbering of the vaqueros, and the shouts and banterings of the cowboys. They took sharp orders and replied in jest. They went about this stern toil {{as if it were}} a game to be played in good humor. One sang a rollicking song, another whistled, <b>another</b> smoked a <b>cigarette.</b> The sun was hot, and they, like their horses, were dripping with sweat. The characteristic red faces had taken on so much dust that cowboys could not be distinguished from vaqueros except by the difference in dress. Blood was not wanting on tireless hands. The air was thick, oppressive, rank with the smell of cattle and of burning hide.|$|R

50|$|In 1881, {{the first}} {{cigarette}} making machine was patented in the United States by James Bonsack and by 1883 {{one of the}} British manufacturers, W. D. & H. O. Wills, had pioneered {{the use of the}} Bonsack in England. Wills joined with twelve other companies to form the Imperial Tobacco Group, from which both Rothmans and Carreras chose to remain independent, and by 1901 the Bonsack machine, making 200 cigarettes a minute, was exclusively available only to members of this Group. However, <b>another</b> of the <b>cigarette</b> machine makers, Bernhard Baron, had returned to London from the United States in 1896 with a patent for a new machine which could make 450 cigarettes a minute, and his progress was watched with interest by Mr Yapp who was by then running the Carreras business but who was keen to make cigarettes a paying venture.|$|R
5000|$|Aside from <b>cigarettes,</b> <b>another</b> common tobacco {{product used}} in Finland, Sweden and Norway is snus, {{which is made}} from air dried tobacco. It is {{consumed}} by placing it under the lip for extended periods of time. The European Union banned the sale of snus in 1992, after a 1985 WHO study concluded that [...] "oral use of snuffs of the types used in North America and western Europe is carcinogenic to humans", but a WHO committee on tobacco has also acknowledged that evidence is inconclusive regarding health consequences for snus consumers.http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2009/0421/1224245059341.html Only Sweden and EFTA-member Norway are exempt from this ban. A popular movement during {{the run-up to the}} 1994 referendum for Sweden's EU membership made exemption from the EU sale ban of snus a condition of the membership treaty. Finnish people purchase snus commonly from cruise ships that have a regular traffic between Finland and Sweden.|$|R
50|$|Popov's father indulged his sons, {{building}} a spacious villa {{by the sea}} for their exclusive use where they could entertain their friends and host expensive parties. He was also insistent that they receive a quality education. Apart from his native Serbian, Popov was fluent in Italian, German and French by his teenage years. Between the ages of 12 and 16, he attended a lycée in Paris. In 1929, Popov's father enrolled him into Ewell Castle, a prestigious preparatory school in Surrey. Popov's stint at the school proved to be short lived. After only four months, he was expelled following an altercation with a teacher. He had previously endured a caning at the teacher's hands after being caught smoking a <b>cigarette.</b> <b>Another</b> caning was adjudicated after Popov missed a detention, and so as to evade further corporal punishment, Popov grabbed the teacher's cane and snapped it in two before his classmates. Popov's father subsequently enrolled in him Lycée Hoche, a secondary institution in Versailles, which he attended for the following two years.|$|R

40|$|Our risk of {{experiencing}} a particular health effect {{is the result}} of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Nurture vs. nature? This question is often asked regarding the causes of specific health effects. In most cases, the answer is “both. ” That is, many diseases are caused by a combination of genetic (nature) and environmental (nurture) factors. This phenomenon is known as a gene-environment interaction. The genetic factors that affect disease include alterations in genes themselves and biological factors that influence the role genes or gene products play in normal biological processes. In the environment, one usually thinks of chemical, biological, and physical agents in water, air, or soil. While exposure to these agents may affect many diseases, the environment also includes other factors such as food, smoking, lifestyle, behavior, stress, and temperature. All of these environmental factors may play a role in disease processes, and their role can often depend on one’s genetic makeup. For example, while one person can develop cancer from smoking <b>cigarettes,</b> <b>another</b> may smoke two packs a day for 60 years and remain cancer free. That is, two individuals can be exposed to the same environmental factors, but differences in their genetic makeup have the potential to either preclude or initiate the onset of a particular disease. continued on pg. ...|$|R
5000|$|American director, screenwriter, and {{producer}} Paul Thomas Anderson has directed seven feature-length films, five short films, twelve music videos, one documentary, one television episode {{as a guest}} segment director, and one theatrical play. He made his directorial debut with the mockumentary short film The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), {{at the age of}} 18, about a pornographic actor in the 1970s. Anderson followed it five years later with <b>another</b> short film, <b>Cigarettes</b> & Coffee in 1993. In 1996, Anderson wrote and directed the neo-noir crime thriller Hard Eight, starring Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Samuel L. Jackson. The film was well received, with film critic Roger Ebert saying of it in his review, [...] "Movies like Hard Eight remind me of what original, compelling characters the movies can sometimes give us." [...] Using the basis of The Dirk Diggler Story, Anderson wrote and directed an expansion of the film entitled Boogie Nights in 1997. The film starred Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams/"Dirk Diggler" [...] during the Golden Age of Porn in the 1970s and his eventual downfall in the 1980s. Boogie Nights received acclaim from critics and was a commercial success; at the 70th Academy Awards ceremony, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including for Best Supporting Actor (Burt Reynolds), Best Supporting Actress (Julianne Moore) and Best Original Screenplay.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{financial}} choices that UAWs make {{are considered to be}} “million dollar choices” because if the choice hadn’t been made, the UAW would have in excess of a million dollars. One example of a million dollar choice is to smoke. Smokers and drinkers tend to be UAWs because instead of building net worth, they spend their income to purchase alcohol or <b>cigarettes.</b> <b>Another</b> hypothetical example given in The Millionaire Next Door explains how a small purchase of cigarettes {{over a long period of}} time can accumulate a large sum of money. Mr. Friend’s poor parents were smokers and drinkers. They smoked at least three packs of cigarettes a day during the week. Three packs a day over 46 years translated into a sum of money that exceeded the value of their home by $33,000. Even more extraordinary, if the Friends had invested and reinvested that money over a 46-year period, the portfolio would have exceeded $2 million. The value of a small amount of money over a long period of time is amazing. A UAW makes choices that, although financially insignificant at the present value, have a very significant future value. Choices such as drinking two cases of beer a week, smoking several packs of cigarettes a day, and buying large amounts of unnecessary food and objects are some examples of typical UAW choices. These choices are not necessarily large financial purchases right now, but over a long period of time, the opportunity cost of that money is very expensive.|$|R
