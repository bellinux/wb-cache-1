40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{deadline}} aware scheduling for input queued (IQ) switches. While most research on scheduler design for IQ switches has focused on maximizing throughput and optimizing switch performance for non-realtime traffic, packet deadlines are a key consideration {{in the context of}} real-time applications like multimedia streaming and video telephony. In this paper, we introduce the notion of "soft deadlines" and study the scheduling problem within a dynamic programming (DP) framework. We demonstrate that by partitioning the set of switch configurations into "orthogonal" and "complete" subsets, the scheduling problem for an IQ switch can be transformed into one of scheduling parallel queues on a single server. We establish key structural properties of the optimal policy for the latter problem. We show that operating the switch using a single configuration subset is good enough to support any uniform <b>admissible</b> <b>load.</b> Further, we show that a scheduling policy which combines subset based operation with a randomized subset selection rule can support any <b>admissible</b> <b>load.</b> The randomized policy requires a Birkhoffvon Neumann (BV) decomposition of the input load vector. To eliminate this dependence, we propose two classes of heuristic scheduling policies, namely pMWM(#) -LLF and pMWM(#) - MaxProj, which select the operational subset based on periodic maximum weight matching (pMWM). We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed policies via simulations. The proposed policies have a computational complexity of only) per time-slot, and outperform MWM under many scenarios...|$|E

As a matter of fact, a coordinated attack on all control areas with the same attack signal is equally difficult to detect either by a residual-based estimator or by a set-theoretic anomaly detector.|$|E

For small volume fractions, the optimal configuration of material is described by a measure which concentrates on 2 -rectifiable sets. For some choices of the external charging, the concentration phenomena {{turn out to be}} related to some new variants of the Cheeger problem of the cross section of the rod.

However, masonry arches under fire are not taken into consideration by Part 1 - 2 of Eurocode 6, where only rules on vertical walls are reported. In addition, neither theoretical nor experimental research activities on these structures are reported in the current literature. For this reason, an advanced calculation method, capable of predicting the nonlinear behaviour of masonry arches subjected to elevated temperatures, is herein presented.

So such reducers can be widely used in drives of difficult technical mechanisms, for example, in mechatronics, robotics and in drives of exact positioning.

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for freight volume on rail and road, traffic has {{increased}} significantly in the past years leading to {{an increasing number of}} heavy vehicles in the traffic flows and greater exploitation of their loading capacities. Because of environmental considerations there is also a tendency to further enhance the <b>admissible</b> <b>loads</b> in the design of new heavy vehicles (e. g. by increasing axle loads or using road trains). This all may affect the safety, serviceability and durability of existing bridges. Bridge authorities are therefore interested in agreed methods to assess the safety and durability of existing bridges and to make appropriate provisions for more refined maintenance methods, possible restriction of traffic, bridge-rehabilitation or substitution of old bridges by new ones where necessary. For steel bridges including the old riveted ones there are numerous approaches to such assessments, partly standardized by national codes or recommendations. In the light of the development of the European single market for construction works and engineering services there is thus a need to harmonize them and to develop agreed European technical recommendations for the safety and durability assessment of existing structures.

40|$|Abstract — Aggregate traffic {{loads and}} {{topology}} in multi-hop wireless networks may vary slowly, permitting MAC protocols to ‘learn ’ how to spatially coordinate and adapt contention patterns. Such an approach could reduce contention, leading to better throughput and energy consumption. To that end we propose {{a new family}} of distributed MAC scheduling algorithms combining synchronous two-level priority RTS/CTS handshaking with randomized time slot selection. We prove that for any fixed <b>admissible</b> <b>load</b> such algorithms converge to a feasible schedule (i. e., throughput-optimal). Furthermore, by adaptively biasing time-slot selection probabilities based on past history, one can develop variations that are also provably throughput-optimal and exhibit better convergence rates. Additionally under moderate loads local changes in load would lead to only local changes in contention patterns leading once again to fast convergence. This makes the case for adopting such protocols in wireless multihop networks, where aggregate loads and network topology are slowly varying. I...|$|E
