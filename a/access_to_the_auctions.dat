40|$|We {{provide an}} {{empirical}} investigation of cost overruns in small public procurement projects, using a panel dataset of <b>auctions</b> held in <b>the</b> Italian Veneto region between 2004 and 2006. We use this sample <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> effect on cost overruns of auction formats (average bid {{as opposed to}} first price rule) conditional on the entry mechanisms (free as opposed <b>to</b> limited <b>access).</b> It is commonly believed that cost overruns are lower under average bid auctions relative to first price auctions. We find support to this belief only when <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> is limited. We interpret this finding as evidence that winner's adverse selection is an important problem in auctions for small size public works, {{and the lack of}} a significant effect of the average bid format in free entry auctions may reflect collusion. cost overrun, average bid, first price; free entry; work delays. ...|$|R

40|$|Based {{in part on}} {{previously}} neglected sales records, {{this article}} offers the first detailed analysis of slave sales by the method known as the scramble. In eighteenth-century South Carolina, the scramble was the preferred sales mechanism for newly arrived Africans, with auction sales generally reserved for slaves already in the colony. Analysis of the sales and other records suggest that the scramble was an economically rational way to sell imported slaves, but that it fell out of favor after the American Revolution as problems of currency and credit rendered it too cumbersome. The article concludes by proposing that <b>the</b> scramble helped <b>to</b> shape colonial slave society by allowing poorer whites greater <b>access</b> <b>to</b> slaves than <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> method.
