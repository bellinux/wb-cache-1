5|$|After a {{tentative}} start to his Monaco career, Henry {{was named the}} French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996, and in the 1996–97 season, his solid performances helped the club win the Ligue 1 title. During the 1997–98 season, he was instrumental in leading his club to the UEFA Champions League semi-final, setting a French record by scoring seven goals in the competition. By his third season, he had received his first cap for the national team, and {{was part of the}} winning team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

5|$|After {{the heavy}} 4–1 {{defeat in the}} {{previous}} Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian Jack Ryder was omitted altogether from the 1930 Ashes tour, and Woodfull appointed captain. Ryder {{was one of the}} three selectors and advocated his own retention, but his two colleagues had voted him off. At first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring, Woodfull only agreed after a ballot was organised. He was unanimously selected by the board. Woodfull had limited leadership experience <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> brief captaincy duties had been the first captain to declare his team's second innings in Shield history.|$|E
5|$|After {{writing his}} senior thesis on Kenyan {{education}} under British colonial rule and graduating with a bachelor's degree in history, Johnson declined the postgraduate scholarship {{that he was}} awarded and played five years in Italy followed by two in Spain. Johnson played professional basketball in the Lega Basket Serie A and Legadue Basket in Italy and Liga Española de Baloncesto in Spain, one season each for Gorizia Pallacanestro A2, Viola Reggio Calabria, Adecco Milano/Ducato Siena, Casademont Girona and Montepaschi Siena. He played two seasons with the Avellino in Italy from 2000–2002. He had a seven-year professional career before becoming a coach.

5|$|Alexander Karelin {{was awarded}} for his {{recognition}} {{as the greatest}} wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 times. His losses are controversial because commentators believe they were caused by trivial rule changes, not a bona fide athletic defeat.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had {{attended}} Georgia Tech and after graduating as valedictorian {{of his class}} in 1912, taught mathematics at Tech and served as Heisman's assistant coach.

5|$|As the {{university}} president, Middleton was constantly involved in personnel decisions, {{some of them}} making national news. One such ordeal occurred in February 1955 when the Board of Supervisors {{decided that it was}} time for the head football coach, Gaynell Tinsley, to be relieved following a break-even record in seven years. His successor, Paul Dietzel, was a 29-year-old assistant coach at the United States Military Academy. Dietzel had a rough beginning at LSU with three losing seasons, and calls for his removal became louder. Middleton supported Dietzel, however, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> fourth season as coach the LSU Tigers not only had an undefeated season, but also won the Sugar Bowl and were declared the national champions.|$|E
5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, {{he said that}} his favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah had asked him to join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> usual jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war.

5|$|At Everton, Johnson {{was part}} of a forward line spearheaded by record-breaking goalscorer Dixie Dean. In Johnson's first full season Everton won the Second Division Championship, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> second the club won the First Division, {{becoming}} the English champions. The following season Everton reached the 1933 FA Cup Final, where Johnson faced his former club Manchester City. Everton were comfortable victors, winning 3–0, and seven years after suffering defeat in an FA Cup final Johnson gained a winners medal. Accounts of the match suggest Johnson had a quiet game, with reports focusing on the play of Dixie Dean and Cliff Britton. The final was the first to use shirt numbers to identify the players, Johnson becoming the competition's first number 10. During his Everton career Johnson won a further three England caps. Johnson scored twice in a 7–1 victory over Spain in 1931. John William Smith and Sammy Crooks also scored braces while Dixie Dean scored the other goal.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his junior}} college career, two {{universities}} offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University. Johnson chose the latter, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> only year in college, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him. NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues, and Johnson was known to be a troublemaker.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|Barrett had a {{trial with}} Major League Soccer team the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, and {{claimed he was}} offered a two-year contract, {{although}} this claim was denied by an organisation spokesman.

He made his debut two days later in a 4–1 defeat to Hearts, during which he conceded a penalty kick. He made 11 appearances for Livingston, with his last coming in December 2005. Conference National club Exeter City handed him a one-week trial in September 2006, and after training with them for six weeks he was offered a contract until January 2007.|$|E

However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially when there was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{returned}} to the cinema in 1937, cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> largest role to that point, the critically panned Live, Love and Learn. A short that Benchley completed for MGM, A Night at the Movies, was Benchley's greatest success since How to Sleep, and won him a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while How to Sleep needed two days, the later short How to Vote needed less than twelve hours), and took their toll on Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one day (one of which was The Courtship of the Newt), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.|$|E

The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E

He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development.
