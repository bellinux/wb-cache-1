50|$|<b>A</b> <b>sales</b> {{order is}} <b>an</b> {{internal}} document of the company, meaning it {{is generated by}} the company itself. <b>A</b> <b>sales</b> order should record the customer's originating purchase order which is an external document. Rather than using the customer's purchase order document, <b>an</b> internal <b>sales</b> order form allows the internal audit control of completeness to be monitored as <b>a</b> sequential <b>sales</b> order number {{can be used by}} the company for its sales order documents. The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the <b>sales</b> order. <b>A</b> <b>sales</b> order, being <b>an</b> internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, <b>a</b> <b>sales</b> order can be converted into a work order to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.|$|R

5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at <b>a</b> <b>sale</b> and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E

Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{airlines}} {{interested in a}} takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with <b>a</b> <b>sale.</b> Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most interested companies to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group. In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day's closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion. Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, {{they would have been}} contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.|$|E
5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if <b>a</b> <b>sale</b> was not made. The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
