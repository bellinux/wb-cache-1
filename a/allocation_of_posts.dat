Salim Aliyow Ibrow served as Interim Prime Minister between {{the tenure of}} Gedi and Hussein. Hussein was approved by Transitional Federal Parliament in Baidoa on November 24, receiving 211 out of 212 votes, and he was sworn in immediately afterwards. Hussein's government, which he described as [...] "all-inclusive", was appointed on December 2, with 73 members; included in the government were 31 ministers, 11 state ministers and 31 assistant ministers. Hussein received some criticism for the exceptionally large size of the Somali government; according to Hussein, in naming the government he followed the [...] "4.5" [...] formula or quota required by the 2004 Transitional Federal Charter, which provides for the division of posts between four main clans and a grouping of smaller clans. Four of the ministers—Hasan Muhammad Nur Shatigadud (who had been appointed Minister of Home Security), Abdikafi Hassan, Sheikh Aden Maden, and Ibrahim Mohamed Isaq—promptly resigned on December 3, complaining that their clan, the Rahanwein (one {{of the four major}} clans), was inadequately represented in the government and that they had not been consulted on their appointments beforehand. On December 4, Deputy Minister for Religious Affairs Sheikh Jama Haji Hussein also resigned, complaining of unfair <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> in the government for his clan, the Jarerweyne, {{which is one of the}} smaller clans.|$|E

Moreover, we find that the size of the surges is related to the catastrophic nature of the event itself and the lack of other resources available to the affected countries.

40|$|British {{presence}} has had {{a profound}} influence on economic development in British and independent India, and {{the debate on the}} nature of this influence has been raging for decades. At one end is the imperialist view that India benefitted from British rule and at the other is the nationalist view that India is still struggling from the burden of misrule. This debate has been enriched by in-depth research on the railways, among other topics; yet the closely related postal network has received no attention. Since part of the disagreement in this debate stems from different perceptions of intention, I approach the question by asking what effects the British intended the post to have. I use economic theory to propose, a priori, three motives for a state establishing postal communication - political, commercial and welfare, and some postal characteristics that serve as evidence for each. The railway literature too attributes the construction of railway lines to these three motives. Using newly collected and digitised data on post office locations and policy, I show that the British did indeed have these three motives for establishing and expanding postal communication in India. Presentation of evidence is divided in two - Poona district in Bombay province, and the whole Indian subcontinent. I compare the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> offices in Poona in 1881 with a hypothetical benevolent social planner's network, which ensures that post offices are as near as possible to as many people as possible. Differences that emerge are easily explained by the three motives. A probit model shows what village characteristics are strongest predictors of the presence <b>of</b> <b>post</b> offices. A detailed qualitative discussion of the evidence for the subcontinent permits an evaluation of the relative importance of the three motives. Since the British engaged in trade with India and also governed India, the political and commercial motives were important and linked. The welfare role <b>of</b> the <b>post,</b> though genuine, came later as a by-product of the network already established for political and commercial reasons. The service-for-the-people role <b>of</b> the <b>post</b> was secondary to its tool-for-governance role, both temporally, and in terms of importance...|$|R
40|$|Aims. To {{describe}} <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> {{of trained}} family doctors geographically; {{to assess the}} patients ’ consultation rate and family doctors ’ workload geographically; and to evaluate comprehensiveness {{of the work of}} family doctors. Methods. Data for the description of training in family medicine and the system of primary health care in Estonia were drawn from the health statistics of the Ministry of Social Affairs of Estonia and from data of the Estonian Health Insur-ance Fund. The comprehensiveness of work was expressed as the percentage of newborn babies on the practice lists of family doctors out of the total births in Estonia during 1999 - 2002. Results. Altogether 979 doctors became family medicine specialists during 1991 - 2004, which corresponds to Estonia’s need – one family doctor per 1, 600 ± 400 inhabitants. The rate of visits to family doctors has increased during recent years and in 2002 one inhabitant made 2. 7 visits per year on average. Family doctors received an average of 22 visits per day throughout 2002. The number of home visits increased: in 2002 every fifth person and almost every second child in Estonia was visited by a doctor. According to the registration of newborns on family doctors lists, the compre-hensiveness of family practice rose: in 2002, 83 % of all newborns were registered with family doctors. Conclusion. The allocation of family doctors geographically according to population density ensures access to medical services in their localities. The registration of newborns with family doctors shows the comprehensiveness of the work of family doctors.

In this way, the present study aims to contribute to better education of the student teachers who will exert great influence on the quality of future generations. The data of the study were collected from 3869 student teachers attending 42 different state universities in Turkey. The data were analyzed through SPSS 14. 0 program package. It was found that some variables in the teacher education system such as the perceived inequality in the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the teaching <b>posts,</b> inadequate teaching posts and KPSS exam lead to stress. Significant correlations were found between the organizational stressors and gender and students’ being whether day-time or night-time students, but no significant correlation was found between the organizational stressors and the faculty attended.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine about {{managing}} conflict in the BN (Barisan Nasional). The core of the study focuses on the conflict ethnic during the seat allocation process in elections and the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> cabinet <b>posts</b> at federal government level. To elaborate on these two focal points, five main objectives aimed at uncovering the contributing factors to the BN’s stability and solidarity to continue ruling a multiethnic society. A total of 28 political figures in the BN and two from opponent parties were identified as interviewees. Results of this study revealed that the BN employed its own, unique approach in handling conflicts. Firstly, Power- sharing shows that the BN applies a formula for seat allocation using three stringent processes to ensure that each of its components receives a fair <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> seats commensurate with the performance and strength of the party. For the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> cabinet and Exco posts, each party is provided with the opportunity and position to hold the post, so that each component party would have an avenue of participation in the development of policies and direction of the national administration. Secondly, the principles practised within the BN, which includes decision-making procedures, the representativeness and confidentiality of discussions on seat allocation and Cabinet post allocation, are confined only to the main elite groups of the component parties. The involvement and knowledge of other party members, especially those at branch and divisional levels, are extremely limited and restricted in these areas. Thirdly, in the process of allocating seats and Cabinet posts, some bargaining inevitably takes place, usually by two parties, namely a component party of the BN and an NGO. There are four factors contributing to this bargaining. The scope of this bargaining also involves four areas. Fourthly, the management of conflict in seat and Cabinet post allocations demonstrates that the BN continuously faces various challenges from time to time. Seven different challenges are outlined, and these often pose as elements that threaten the strength and stability of the BN. The control of these elements is important in ensuring that the BN continues to be sound and stable, whilst failure would put the BN in a quagmire of difficulties in continuing to defend its power. Finally to manage the conflict on seat and Cabinet post allocations, the BN also practises five approaches in managing these conflicts. The study findings provide a comprehensive documentation of the techniques applied by the BN in managing conflicts, and it is hoped that it would describe to the public how each party played its role in maintaining political stability whilst serving as guidelines to countries facing interethnic conflict...|$|R

40|$|Background: Rapid risk {{stratification}} is a core task in emergency medicine. Identifying patients at {{high and low}} risk shortly after admission could help clinical decision-making regarding treatment, level <b>of</b> observation, <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> resources and <b>post</b> discharge follow-up. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine short-, mid- and long-term mortality by plasma measurement of copeptin in unselected admitted patients. Method: Consecutive patients> 40 -years-old admitted to an inner-city hospital were included. Within the first 24 hours after admission, a structured medical interview was conducted and self-reported medical history was recorded. All patients underwent a clinical examination, an echocardiographic evaluation and collection of blood for later measurement of risk markers. Results: Plasma for copeptin measurement was available from 1, 320 patients (average age 70. 5 years, 59. 4 % women). Median follow-up time was 11. 5 years (range 11. 0 to 12. 0 years). Copeptin was elevated (that is, above the 97. 5 percentile in healthy individuals). Mortality within the first week was 2. 7 % (17 / 627) for patients with elevated copeptin (above the 97. 5 percentile, that is,> 11. 3 pmol/L) compared to 0. 1 % (1 / 693) for patients with normal copeptin concentrations (that is, ≤ 11. 3 pmol/L) (P < 0. 01). Three-month mortality was 14. 5 % (91 / 627) for patients with elevated copeptin compared to 3. 2 % (22 / 693) for patients with normal copeptin.
