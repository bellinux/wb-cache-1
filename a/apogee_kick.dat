25|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was designed}} and manufactured by Hughes on the HS-376 satellite bus. This spin-stabilized platform had two main sections. One, the spinning section, was kept rotating at 50 rpm to maintain attitude, and a despun section that {{was used by the}} payload to maintain radio coverage. The spinning section included the Star-30BP <b>Apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor, most of the attitude control, the power subsystem and the command and telemetry subsystems. The despun section contained the communications payload, including the antennas and transponders.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} fuel carried {{on board a}} {{satellite}} directly affects its lifetime, therefore it is desirable to make the <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> maneuver as efficient as possible. The mass of most geostationary satellites {{at the beginning of}} its operational life in geostationary orbit is roughly half that when it separated from its vehicle in geostationary transfer orbit, with the other half having been fuel expended in the <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> maneuver.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of micro-spacecrafts {{in the space}} industry {{has led to the}} development of various micro-propulsion techniques. Microthrusters are micropropulsion devices used in a microspacecraft for precise station keeping, orbit adjustment, attitude control, drag compensation and <b>apogee</b> <b>kicking.</b> The principle of operation of a solid propellant thruster is based on the combustion of a solid energetic material stored in a microfabricated chamber. In the current work, Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology has been used for the realization of a solid propellant based microthruster structure. Hydroxyl Terminated Poly-Butadiene/Ammonium Perchlorate (HTPB/AP) is used as the propellant. It is shown that geometric and dimensional variations in design, depending on the application requirements, can be easily implemented. Preliminary testing for micro-combustion has been done to verify the basic operation of the microthruster. A thrust value of 19. 5 mN has been measured. ...|$|R

50|$|It is a {{satellite}} platform manufactured by Orbital Sciences Corporation with an <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor {{to place a}} communications satellite into geostationary orbit, a thruster to provide the satellite with orbital station-keeping for a 15-year mission, and solar arrays to provide the satellite payload with 5 kW of electrical power.|$|E
5000|$|STAR-1 (originally STARBus): small {{commercial}} satellite platform. Originally {{developed by}} CTA, bought by Orbital Sciences Corporation. Could handle payloads {{with a mass}} of up to 200 kg and requiring up to 555 W of power. It used a solid Star 30CBP <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor for orbital circularization and had a 10 year design life.|$|E
50|$|Even though Landsat 6 {{separated}} from the rocket {{at the appropriate time}} and place, the satellite failed to reach orbit. Since fuel could not reach the reaction engines, the satellite could not maintain attitude control during the <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor (AKM) burn. This caused the satellite to tumble during the burn, resulting in a failure to orbit due to the wasted energy.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor is used, for example, for {{satellites}} {{launched into}} a geostationary orbit. As {{the vast majority of}} geostationary satellite launches are carried out from spaceports at a significant distance away from Earth's equator, the carrier rocket often only launches the satellite into an orbit with a non-zero inclination approximately equal to the latitude of the launch site. This orbit is commonly known as a [...] "geostationary transfer orbit" [...] or a [...] "geosynchronous transfer orbit". The satellite must then provide thrust to bring forth the needed delta v to reach a geostationary orbit. This is typically done with a fixed onboard <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor.) When the satellite reaches its orbit's apogee position, the AKM is ignited, transforming the elliptical orbit into a circular orbit, {{while at the same time}} bringing the inclination to around zero degrees, thereby accomplishing the insertion into a geostationary orbit. This process is called an [...] "apogee kick".|$|E
50|$|BSAT-2a was {{designed}} and manufactured by Orbital Sciences Corporation on the STAR-1 satellite bus for B-SAT. It had a launch mass of 1317 kg, a dry mass of 535 kg, and a 10-year design life. As all four STAR-1 satellites, it had a solid rocket Star 30CBP <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor for orbit raising, plus 200 kg of propellant for its liquid propellant station keeping thrusters.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor (AKM) {{refers to}} a rocket motor that is {{regularly}} employed on artificial satellites to provide the final impulse to change the trajectory from the transfer orbit into its final (most commonly circular) orbit. For a satellite launched from the Earth, the rocket firing is done at the highest point of the transfer orbit, known as the apogee, thus giving the engine its name.|$|E
50|$|Ekspress MD1 was a {{geostationary}} {{communications satellite}} developed by Khrunichev on the Yakhta platform. It is a small, three axis stabilized, platform designed for direct geostationary orbit orbit {{and as such}} it lacked an <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor. It was designed to support a bigger, heavier satellite {{on top of it}} and serve as its rocket adapter. For its companion, Ekspress AM4, it was specially reinforced to carry the 2560 kg on top.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} Skynet 1 {{satellites}} (A and B); Skynet 1A was launched on a Delta M on 22 November 1969, but the satellite failed {{after less than}} a year of operation. Skynet 1B was launched on a Delta M on 19 August 1970. Skynet 1B was placed in a geostationary transfer orbit and was abandoned in transfer orbit (270 x 36058 km) due to a failure of the Thiokol Star 37D <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor.|$|E
50|$|Because the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles {{are more}} {{powerful}} than the Delta II, which was used to orbit earlier Block II GPS satellites, they can place the satellites directly into their operational orbits. As a result, Block IIF satellites do not carry <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motors. The original contract for Block IIF, signed in 1996, called for 33 spacecraft. This was later reduced to 12, and program delays and technical problems pushed the first launch from 2006 to 2010.|$|E
50|$|In {{some parts}} of the space {{industry}} an LAE is also referred to as a liquid apogee motor (LAM), a liquid apogee thruster (LAT) and, depending on the propellant, a dual-mode liquid apogee thruster (DMLAT). Despite the ambiguity with respect to the use of engine and motor in these names, all use liquid propellant. An <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor (AKM) or apogee boost motor (ABM) such as the Waxwing, however, uses solid propellant. These solid-propellant versions are not used on new-generation satellites.|$|E

5000|$|Syncom 1 was {{intended}} to be the first geosynchronous communications satellite. It was launched on February 14, 1963 with the Delta B #16 launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral, but was lost on the way to geosynchronous orbit due to an electronics failure. [...] Seconds after the <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor for circularizing the orbit was fired, the spacecraft fell silent. Later telescopic observations verified the satellite was in an orbit with a period of almost 24 hours at a 33° inclination.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} would {{consist of}} four parts: An <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> engine to provide orbital injection for a cruise vehicle that carries the Northern Light lander and the Beaver Rover to a direct rendezvous with Mars using a Hohmann transfer orbit. Atmospheric entry would be achieved by a heat shield, parachute and airbag deployment system. The lander would transfer the rover to the Martian surface. Once deployed on the Martian surface, the lander contacts Earth directly utilizing the 46m parabolic antenna located at the Algonquin Radio Observatory.|$|E
50|$|The Star 27 {{is a solid}} <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor. It burns HTPB fuel with {{an average}} erosion rate of 0.0011 inches per second. When used on the Pegasus air-launch rocket {{payloads}} are capable of leaving Earth orbit. A modified version, designated Star 27H, {{was used in the}} launch of the IBEX spacecraft. The spacecraft had a mass of 105 kg by itself and together with its Star 27 motor, 462 kg. The Star 27H helped it get to a higher orbit, beyond Earth's magnetosphere.|$|E
50|$|BSAT-2b was {{launched}} aboard an Ariane 5G at 23:58 UTC, July 12, 2001 from Guiana Space Center ELA-3. It rode {{on the lower}} berth below Artemis. But the EPS upper stage had an anomaly and left the satellites on a 17,528km × 592km × 2.9° orbit, short of the planned 35,853km × 858km × 2.0°. While Artemis used its electric propulsion {{to make up for}} the difference. But BSAT-2b Star 30CBP <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor could not make up for the orbital energy short fall and was written off.|$|E
50|$|It has a total {{nominal mass}} of 729 kg, of which 650 kg is {{propellant}} load and its burn out mass is 79 kg. It has an average thrust of 44 kN {{with a specific}} impulse of 289 seconds burning for 43 seconds, with a total impulse of 1.842 MN. While it was designed as an <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor and as such it flew in spin stabilized mode, it was also adapted to the Long March 1D third stage. It was paired with a RCS in a similar solution to the CTS.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} was an Extended Long Tank Thor, re-engined with the Rocketdyne RS-27 {{replacing}} the earlier MB-3-III engine. The RS-27 engine was a rebranded H-1 engine {{used in the}} Saturn 1B with minor changes. Three or nine Castor-2 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off. The Delta-P second stage used the TRW TR-201 engine. The TR-201 engine was a Lunar Module Descent Engine reconfigured for fixed thrust output. Launches which required a three-stage configuration {{in order to reach}} higher orbits used the Thiokol Star-37D or 37E upper stage as an <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor.|$|E
50|$|The Star 37FM {{rocket motor}} was {{developed}} and qualified for use as an <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor on FLTSATCOM. The motor is a replacement for the Star 37E Delta, which has been discontinued. The Nozzle assembly uses a 3D carbon-carbon throat and a carbon-phenolic exit cone. Maximum propellant weight is 2350 pounds, while the motor has been qualified for propellant off-loading to 2257 pounds. The Star 37XFP rocket motor has been qualified as the orbit insertion motor for Rockwell International's (now Boeing) Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), and as the apogee motor for the RCA SATCOM Ku-Band satellite. The Star 37XFP motor {{can be used as}} a replacement for the Star 37F motor, which has been discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Primary mission {{objectives}} were {{deployment of the}} Laser Geodynamics Satellite II (LAGEOS-II) and operation of the U.S. Microgravity Payload-1 (USMP-1). LAGEOS-II, a joint effort between NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ASI), was deployed on day 2 and boosted into an initial elliptical orbit by ASI's Italian Research Interim Stage (IRIS). The spacecraft's <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor later circularized LAGEOS orbit at its operational altitude of 3,666 miles. The USMP-1, activated on day one, included three experiments mounted on two connected Mission Peculiar Equipment Support Structures (MPESS) mounted in the orbiter's cargo bay. USMP-1 experiments were: Lambda Point Experiment; Matériel Pour L'Etude Des Phénomènes Intéressant La Solidification Sur Et En Orbite (MEPHISTO), sponsored by the French agency Centre National d'Études Spatiales; and Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS).|$|E
5000|$|The Yuanzheng-1 (YZ-1) (...) is a restartable rocket {{upper stage}} {{developed}} by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) used as a fourth stage to enable the Long March 3B and Long March 3C launch vehicles to deploy payloads directly to high energy orbits like medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary orbit (GSO). Since the Long March third stage cannot restart, it cannot circularize a GSO orbit from a geostationary transfer orbit. The YZ-1 was designed for restart capability, and to remain operational for more than 6 hours required to reach the transfer orbit apogee for the circularization burn. The YZ-1 enabled the deployment of satellite pairs for the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and communications satellites directly to their orbits. This {{eliminates the need for}} the spacecraft to include a Liquid Apogee Engine or <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the bush}} war period, South Africa {{manufactured}} six air-deliverable {{tactical nuclear weapons}} of the [...] "gun-type" [...] design between 1978 and 1993. Each of the devices contained 55 kilograms of HEU with an estimated yield of 10-18 kilotons designed for delivery by Buccaneer or Canberra aircraft. In parallel, South Africa initiated a ballistic missile programme to develop an improved delivery system. The RSA-2 was developed as a prototype intermediate range delivery system very similar to, or a licensed copy of the Israeli Jericho-2 missile, the RSA-1 being a modified Jericho II second stage used alone for mobile application. A third stage <b>apogee</b> <b>kick</b> motor was added to produce the RSA-3 space launcher with a 1,900 km range and 1,500 kg payload. The RSA-4 ICBM / satellite launcher was a planned follow-on to the RSA-3 and with an optimised first stage {{was supposed to have}} double the payload capacity of the RSA-3. It is not known if the RSA-4 was ever tested. Work on the RSA-4 was cancelled in 1994.|$|E
