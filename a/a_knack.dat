5|$|Talented slaves with <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for {{business}} might accumulate {{a large enough}} peculium to justify their freedom, or be manumitted for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law (Lex Fufia Caninia) limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.|$|E
5|$|Having {{grown up}} in a hospital, Meredith shows immense natural talent. She {{possesses}} a steadfast, calm ease during medical procedures and emergencies, and is a natural observer of people. She exhibits <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for catching subtle hints and accurately determining difficult-to-catch diagnoses. Her placid, non-judgmental bedside manner often causes people to open up and trust her. Her surgical skills are solidly impressive and she shows a talent and patience for medical research trials and dealing with psychologically damaged patients.|$|E
5|$|Browning {{supervised}} {{the newly formed}} division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades raised and assigned to the division, and new equipment tested. Though not considered an airborne warfare visionary, he proved adept at dealing with an apathetic War Office and an obstructionist Air Ministry, and demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for overcoming bureaucratic obstacles. As the airborne forces expanded in size, the major difficulty in getting the 1st Airborne Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft. The Royal Air Force had neglected air transport before the war, and the only available aircraft for airborne troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris in particular felt that the 1st Airborne Division was not worth the drain on Bomber Command's resources.|$|E

He has also {{played in the}} Indian Premier League (IPL) for Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Daredevils.He {{is one of the}} most explosive young batsmen in the world with <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for always scoring quick runs.|$|E
25|$|He has a {{relatively}} short figure as compared to his other fast bowling counterparts. But he could still bowl at speeds more than 85mph (~145–150km/hr) owing to his athletic body and a good run up speed. He has had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> to bowl conventional swing {{at the start of}} the innings and reverse swing deliveries late in the game.|$|E

25|$|She had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> {{for being}} at {{the right place at}} the right time: she interviewed and photographed Mohandas K. Gandhi just a few hours before his {{assassination}} in 1948. Alfred Eisenstaedt, her friend and colleague, said one of her strengths was that there was no assignment and no picture that was unimportant to her. She also started the first photography laboratory at Life magazine.|$|E
25|$|Rayburn {{also had}} <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for {{dressing}} to suit his occasion. While in Washington, D.C., he would sport expensive suits, starched shirts, and perfectly shined shoes. However, while {{back in his}} poorer district in Texas, Rayburn would wear simple shirts, blue jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. Several politicians have imitated this pattern, including Ronald Reagan's famous example of clearing brush when at home in California, while wearing fine suits in Washington.|$|E
25|$|Bullock {{took his}} job seriously, deputizing several {{residents}} and tackling {{the job of}} civilizing the camp. Despite (or perhaps because of) a reputation for fearlessness and an uncompromising nature, Bullock managed the task without killing anyone. Bullock had several 'run ins' with Al Swearengen, proprietor of the notorious Gem Theater, Deadwood's most notable brothel. Swearengen had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for making money from vice and shrewdly invested some of his profits in cultivating alliances with the camp's wealthy and powerful.|$|E

25|$|The two admirals were a {{contrast}} in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating and cautious. Notwithstanding their different personalities, Spruance and Halsey were close friends. In fact, Spruance had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for {{getting along with}} difficult people, including his friend Admiral Kelly Turner, the hotheaded commander of 5th Fleet's amphibious force. One exception was Admiral John Towers, a constant critic of Spruance, whom Spruance came to despise for his naked ambition.|$|E

As of Season 3, {{they are}} aware of the clones, but think they are simply Alison's sisters. Gemma has <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for showing up at awkward moments, such as when Sarah (dressed as Alison) was trying to keep Paul from killing Vic, when her parents were burying Dr. Leekie's body, and when Alison and Donnie were having some time to themselves.|$|E
25|$|Urban Meyer left Bowling Green {{and joined}} Utah for the 2003 season. In his inaugural season, the Utes showed <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for winning close games. He {{implemented}} the spread offense and with quarterback Alex Smith led Utah to a 10–2 record, an outright MWC championship, and a 17–0 {{victory in the}} Liberty Bowl over Southern Miss. They finished the season ranked #21 in both major polls. He also earned honors as The Sporting News National Coach of the Year, the first Utes' coach to do so.|$|E

25|$|If past {{records and}} current {{conditions}} indicate {{anything about the}} area, they show the area breeds entrepreneurship; whether numbering 286 currently or 1,348 in 1929, residents seem to have <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for being industrious, always looking to expand a new building purchased, or a new business started. From the first Métis in the area, looking for better hunting grounds in 1871, to a thriving museum, housed in a building nearly 100 years old, stories of growth and expansion abound in this quaint town’s history.|$|E
25|$|Founder Paul Brown {{coached the}} team for its first eight seasons. One of Brown's college draft {{strategies}} was to draft players with above-average intelligence. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players were highly articulate {{and went on to}} have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variations}} of the story are also found in Greek mythology as well. The story is attested in the legend of Zeus slaying the hundred-headed Typhon from Hesiod's Theogony, {{but it is also}} in the myths of the slaying of the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra by Heracles and the slaying of Python by Apollo. The story of Heracles's theft of the cattle of Geryon is probably also related. Although Heracles is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional sense, he bears many attributes held by other Indo-European storm deities, including physical strength and <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for violence and gluttony.|$|E

50|$|Upon release, Knack was {{met with}} a mixed {{critical}} response; reviewers praised the game's original concept and ideas, but criticized the gameplay and story. <b>A</b> sequel, <b>Knack</b> II, was announced at the 2016 PlayStation Experience.|$|R
25|$|The {{height of}} Nimzowitsch's career was the late 1920s and early 1930s. Chessmetrics places {{him as the}} third {{best player in the}} world from 1927 to 1931, behind Alexander Alekhine and José Capablanca. His most notable successes were first-place {{finishes}} at Copenhagen 1923, Marienbad 1925, Dresden 1926, Hanover 1926, the Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament, and second place behind Alekhine at the San Remo 1930 chess tournament. Nimzowitsch never developed <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for match play, though; his best match success was a draw with Alekhine, but the match consisted of only two games and took place in 1914, thirteen years before Alekhine became world champion.|$|E
25|$|Along with Williams, the Outlaws roster {{included}} rookie Oklahoma State star RB Ernest Anderson. Former Pittsburgh Steelers {{defensive coordinator}} Woody Widenhofer coached the team. Williams {{had been one}} of the biggest NFL stars to bolt to the USFL. He left the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after they offered him a contract that would have still made him among the lowest-paid starters in the league, even though it would have been triple his previous salary. Williams was not a very refined, efficient, or consistent passer at that point in addition to being a little rusty, but had a big arm and <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for making plays.|$|E
25|$|Barks {{initially}} {{worked as}} an inbetweener. This involved being teamed and supervised {{by one of the}} head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement. While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department. His first story sale was the climax of Modern Inventions, for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his bottom.|$|E
