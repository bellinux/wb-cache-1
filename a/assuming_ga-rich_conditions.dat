To this end, nominally undoped GaSb/Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xSb heterostructures were subjected to thermal treatment under both Sb-rich and <b>Ga-rich</b> <b>conditions</b> in the temperature range of 600 C to 700 C. For characterisation of the heterostructures, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction were applied.

It is shown that interdiffusion in the GaSb-AlSb system can be described by a concentration-dependent interdiffusion coefficient. Interdiffusion is retarded with increasing aluminium concentration x of the Al_xGa_ 1 _-_xSb alloy. Under Sb-rich conditions, interdiffusion is significantly faster than under <b>Ga-rich</b> <b>conditions.</b> The present study shows that the mechanism of interdiffusion of the group-III atoms in the GaSb-AlSb system can be described in terms of vacancies on the group-III sublattice.
