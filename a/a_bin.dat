Two {{of the hijackers}} were known to have travelled with <b>a</b> <b>bin</b> Laden associate to Malaysia in 2000 and hijacker Mohammed Atta had previously gone to Afghanistan.

5|$|Black and the FBI {{investigate}} the crime scene; Black not only realises the bomber's proficiency with explosives, but {{is able to}} work out that he viewed the bombing from the parking garage. In <b>a</b> <b>bin</b> in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E

An unnamed Pakistani security official was quoted as saying one of bin Laden's daughters told Pakistani investigators that bin Laden had been captured alive, then in front of family members was shot dead by American forces and dragged to a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into <b>a</b> <b>bin.</b> This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not have to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into <b>a</b> <b>bin.</b> Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid getting in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E

40|$|An {{intention}} of MapReduce Sets for Binning expressions analysis has to suggest criteria how Binning expressions in Binning {{data can be}} defined {{in a meaningful way}} and how they should be compared. Similitude based MapReduce Sets for Binning Expression Analysis and MapReduce Sets for Assignment is expected to adhere to fundamental principles of the scientific Binning process that are expressiveness of Binning models and reproducibility of their Binning inference. Binning expressions are assumed to be elements of <b>a</b> <b>Binning</b> expression space or Conjecture class and Binning data provide “information ” which of these Binning expressions should be used to interpret the Binning data. An inference Binning algorithm constructs the mapping between Binning data and Binning expressions, in particular by <b>a</b> <b>Binning</b> cost minimization process. Fluctuations in the Binning data often limit the Binning precision, which we can achieve to uniquely identify <b>a</b> single <b>Binning</b> expression as interpretation of the Binning data. We advocate an information theoretic perspective on Binning expression analysis to resolve this dilemma where the tradeoff between Binning informativeness of statistical inference Binning and their Binning stability is mirrored in the information-theoretic Binning optimum of high Binning information rate and zero communication expression error. The inference Binning algorithm is considered as <b>an</b> outlier object <b>Binning</b> path, which naturally limits the resolution of the Binning expression space given the uncertainty of the Binning data...|$|R

The band showed up late having been in hospital earlier that day, and only 30 minutes were available for a shoot. Unable to get a satisfactory photo in the studio, Franks took the band round to his flat, grabbed a polystyrene mannequin head from <b>a</b> <b>bin,</b> put a 1,000 watt bulb in the kitchen light fitting, and improvised the shot. Franks credited the sleeve designer, Rolling Stone art director Jon Goodchild, for making the cover a success.

500|$|During {{his first}} year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as <b>a</b> <b>bin</b> man on the Liverpool Corporation's waste {{collection}} trucks. Lennon was introduced to Sutcliffe by Bill Harry, a mutual friend, when all three were studying at the Liverpool College of Art. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a [...] "marvellous art portfolio" [...] and was a very talented painter {{who was one of the}} [...] "stars" [...] of the school. He helped Lennon to improve his artistic skills, and with others, worked with him when Lennon had to submit work for exams. Sutcliffe shared a flat with Murray at 9 Percy Street, Liverpool, before being evicted and moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, where another art student lived, Margaret Chapman, who competed with Sutcliffe to be the best painter in class. The flat was opposite the new Anglican cathedral in the rundown area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a mattress on the floor in the corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960. (Paul McCartney later admitted that he was jealous of Sutcliffe's relationship with Lennon, as he had to take a [...] "back seat" [...] to Sutcliffe). Sutcliffe and his flatmates painted the rooms yellow and black, which their landlady did not appreciate. On another occasion the tenants, needing to keep warm, burned the flat's furniture.|$|E
500|$|In April 1999, Victoria Climbié (born 2 November 1991 in Abobo, Côte d'Ivoire, died 25 February 2000 at St. Mary's Hospital, London) and {{her great}} aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao arrived in London, sent {{by her parents}} for a chance of an education. A few months later, Kouao met Carl Manning on a bus which he was driving, and she and Victoria moved into his flat. It was here that she was abused, {{including}} being beaten with hammers, bike chains, and wires; being forced to sleep in <b>a</b> <b>bin</b> liner in the bath; and being tied up for periods of over 24 hours. In the period leading up to her death, the police, the social services of many local authorities, the NHS, the NSPCC, and local churches all had contact with her, and noted the signs of abuse. However, in what {{the judge in the}} trial following Victoria's death described as [...] "blinding incompetence", all failed to properly investigate the abuse and little action was taken. On 24 February 2000, Victoria was admitted into an accident-and-emergency department, semi-unconscious and suffering from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition. She died the next day, aged eight. On 20 November 2000, her guardians, Marie Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning, were charged with child cruelty and murder; on 12 January 2001, both were found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
