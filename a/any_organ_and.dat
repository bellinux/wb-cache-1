50|$|The first {{cases of}} NSF were {{identified}} in 1997, but NSF was first described as an independent disease entity in 2000. While skin involvement is on the foreground, the process may involve <b>any</b> <b>organ</b> <b>and</b> resembles diffuse scleroderma or systemic sclerosis. In 2006, the link between NSF and gadolinium-containing contrast agents was made. As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is now considered contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (a measure of renal function) under 60 and especially under 30 ml/mn. One retrospective study of the Veterans Affairs Electronic Medical Record found no cases of NSF among 141 patients receiving hemodialysis for chronic kidney disease who received gadoteridol.|$|E

Therefore, the prompt identification of patients at higher risk of extra-glandular manifestations is necessary to start a thorough follow up and an aggressive treatment.
