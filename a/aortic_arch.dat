40|$|Mechanisms {{of blood}} vessels {{development}} in the branchial archem region Thesis - Mgr. Hana Kolesová Supervisor: Prof. MUDr. Miloš Grim, DrSc. Institute of Anatomy, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague Abstract <b>Aortic</b> <b>arches</b> development {{in the course of}} Pelobates fuscus metamorphosis Larval development of Spade-foot Toad Pelobates fuscus (Amphibia, Anura) is modified compared to tetrapod ancestors. However, it is still possible from its metamorphosis to reconstruct changes, which have occurred during the transition of vertebrates onto the dry land. Transformations of <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> during the metamorphosis have been studied by the corrosion casting of the vascular systém with Mercox. Corrosion casts were subsequently studied with a scanning electron microscope. Aim {{of this study is to}} compare development of <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> of Pelobates fuscus with other anuran species and contribute to the findings about the transformation of the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> during the transition of the vertebrates onto the dry land. <b>Aortic</b> <b>arches,</b> which in larval period supply the gills, are considerably transformed due to the reduction of the gills and transition on the breathing of atmospheric oxygen. <b>Aortic</b> <b>arches</b> are in Pelobates suddenly transformed after a long period of gradual preparation and reduction of gill blood [...] ...|$|R
40|$|PósterThe <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> are {{embryonic}} vascular {{structures that}} {{play an important}} role in the formation of some definitive arteries in the adult. The <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> and their resulting structures arise from the migration and reorganization of the cells of the cardiac neural crest (CNC), therefore, variations in the migration or remodelling of the CNC’s cells could result in congenital malformations of the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches.</b> These anomalies are uncommon pathologies and affect much more dogs than cats. In spite of their relative poor incidence, some of them represent an important part of the cardiovascular alterations in dogs under one year...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{insights}} into how the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> changed during the transition of vertebrates to land, transformations of the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> during the metamorphosis of Pelobates fuscus were investigated and compared with data from the early development of a recent ganoid fish Amia calva and a primitive caudate amphibian Salamandrella keyserlingi. Although in larval Pelobates, as in other non-pipid anurans, the gill arches serve partly as a filter-feeding device, their <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> maintain the original piscine-like arrangement, except for the mandibular and hyoid <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> which were lost. As important pre-adaptations for breathing of atmospheric oxygen occur in larval Pelobates (which have well-developed, though non-respiratory lungs and pulmonary artery), transformation of <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> during metamorphosis is fast. The transformation involves disappearance of the ductus Botalli, which results in a complete shunting of blood into the lungs and skin, disappearance of the ductus caroticus, which results in shunting of blood into the head through the arteria carotis interna, and disappearance of arch V, which results in shunting blood to the body through arch IV (systemic arch). It is supposed that the branching pattern of the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> of permanently water-dwelling piscine ancestors, of intermediate forms which occasionally left the water and of primitive tetrapods capable of spending {{longer periods of time}} on land had been the same as in the prematamorphic anuran larvae or in some metamorphosed caudates in which the ductus caroticus and ductus Botalli were not interrupted, and arch V was still complete...|$|R
5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the <b>aortic</b> <b>arch</b> be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the <b>aortic</b> <b>arch,</b> and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the <b>aortic</b> <b>arch,</b> and the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior laryngeal nerve.|$|E
50|$|The {{abnormalities}} seen in {{the great}} arteries of mice deficient of Tbx1 are a consequence of abnormal formation and remodelling of the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> during early development. The role of Tbx1 for correct formation and remodelling of the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> has been extensively studied in various mouse models suggesting the key role of Tbx1 for cardiovascular development and the phenotypes seen in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome patients.|$|R

5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries branching off from the hindmost (6th) <b>aortic</b> <b>arch.</b> The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E

25|$|During {{development}} of the <b>aortic</b> <b>arch</b> and the <b>aortic</b> <b>arch</b> arteries, the Notch receptors, ligands, and target genes display a unique expression pattern. When the Notch pathway was blocked, the induction of vascular smooth muscle cell marker expression failed to occur, suggesting that Notch {{is involved in the}} differentiation of cardiac neural crest cells into vascular cells during outflow tract development.|$|E

40|$|This deposit is {{composed}} {{by the main}} article plus the supplementary materials of the publication. Connection of the heart to the systemic circulation is a critical developmental event that requires selective preservation of embryonic vessels (<b>aortic</b> <b>arches).</b> However, why some <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> regress while others are incorporated into the mature aortic tree remains unclear. By microdissection and deep sequencing in mouse, we find that neural crest (NC) only differentiates into vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) around those <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> destined for survival and reorganization, and identify the transcription factor Gata 6 as a crucial regulator of this process. Gata 6 is expressed in SMCs and its target genes activation control SMC differentiation. Furthermore, Gata 6 is sufficient to promote SMCs differentiation in vivo, and drive preservation of <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> that ought to regress. These findings identify Gata 6 -directed differentiation of NC to SMCs as an essential mechanism that specifies the aortic tree, and provide a new framework for how mutations in GATA 6 lead to congenital heart disorders in humans.

25|$|The human {{arterial}} system originates {{from the}} aortic arches {{and from the}} dorsal aortae starting from week 4 of embryonic life.

50|$|In {{the human}} embryo, the arches are first seen {{during the fourth}} week of development. They appear {{as a series of}} outpouchings of {{mesoderm}} {{on both sides of the}} developing pharynx. The vasculature of the pharyngeal arches is known as the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{ascending}} aorta develops from the outflow tract which initially starts {{as a single}} tube connecting the heart with the <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> (which will form the great arteries) in early development, but then is separated into the aorta and the pulmonary trunk.|$|R
50|$|The <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> or {{pharyngeal}} arch arteries (previously {{referred to}} as branchial arches in human embryos) {{are a series of}} six paired embryological vascular structures which give rise to the great arteries of the neck and head.

25|$|The common carotid arteries {{are present}} {{on the left and}} right sides of the body. These arteries {{originate}} from different arteries, but follow symmetrical courses. The right common carotid originates in the neck from the brachiocephalic trunk; the left from the <b>aortic</b> <b>arch</b> in the thorax. These split into the external and internal carotid arteries at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, at around the level of the fourth cervical vertebra.|$|E
25|$|Crocodiles {{have the}} most acidic stomach of any vertebrate. They can easily digest bones, hooves and horns. The BBC TV {{reported}} that a Nile crocodile that has lurked a long time underwater to catch prey builds up a large oxygen debt. When it has caught and eaten that prey, it closes its right <b>aortic</b> <b>arch</b> and uses its left <b>aortic</b> <b>arch</b> to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from its muscles directly to its stomach; the resulting excess acidity in its blood supply makes it much easier for the stomach lining to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulks of swallowed prey flesh and bone. Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach stones), which may act as ballast to balance their bodies or assist in crushing food, similar to grit ingested by birds. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles had a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the Egyptian plover, which enter the crocodile's mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile's blood; with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species, it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction.|$|E
25|$|Baroreceptor reflex: Baroreceptors in {{the high}} {{pressure}} receptor zones detect changes in arterial pressure. These baroreceptors send signals ultimately to the medulla of the brain stem, specifically to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The medulla, {{by way of the}} autonomic nervous system, adjusts the mean arterial pressure by altering both the force and speed of the heart's contractions, as well as the systemic vascular resistance. The most important arterial baroreceptors are located in the left and right carotid sinuses and in the <b>aortic</b> <b>arch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The aortic sac or aortic bulb is a dilated {{structure}} in mammalian embryos, lined by endothelial cells located just above (superior to) the truncus arteriosus.

40|$|Neural crest {{cells are}} {{essential}} for proper development {{of a variety of}} tissues and structures, including peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, facial skeleton, <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> and pharyngeal glands like the thymus and parathyroids. Previous work has shown that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling is required for the production of migratory neural crest cells that contribute to the neurogenic and skeletogenic lineages. We show here that BMP-dependent neural crest cells are also required for development of the embryonic <b>aortic</b> <b>arches</b> and pharynx-derived glands. Blocking formation or migration of this crest cell population from the caudal hindbrain resulted in strong phenotypes in the cardiac outflow tract and the thymus. Thymic aplasia or hypoplasia occurs despite uncompromised gene induction in the pharyngeal endoderm. In addition, when hypoplastic thymic tissue is found, it is ectopically located, but functional in thymopoiesis. Our data indicate that thymic phenotypes produced by neural crest deficits result from aberrant formation of pharyngeal pouches and impaired migration of thymic primordia because the mesenchymal content in the branchial arches is below a threshold level.
