40|$|ABSTRACT. Turkey is {{not only}} the main <b>apricot</b> (Prunus armeniaca) {{producer}} and exporter in the world, but it also has a wide variety of <b>apricot</b> germplasms, owing to its close proximity to the centers of <b>apricot</b> origin. However, {{there is little or no}} genetic information on many <b>apricot</b> cultivars that are extensively cultivated in Turkey. We examined the genetic relatedness of 25 Turkish and four exotic <b>apricot</b> cultivars using SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers that were either previously developed for <b>apricot,</b> or for peach (P. persica), a close relative of <b>apricot.</b> Allele diversity (with an average allele number of 6. 37) at the SSR loci and the heterozygosity rates (with an average Ho value of 0. 648) of these cultivars were found to be higher than in previous studies that used the same loci for <b>apricot.</b> This fact might be attributed to the analysis of different numbers of accessions in the different studies. No correlations were found between the genetic relatedness and the geographical distributions of these cultivars. The data reported here will assist in the prevention of confusions in the <b>apricot</b> propagation and breeding in Turkey. The findings can also be directly compared with other studies that used the same SSR markers on <b>apricot...</b>|$|R

5|$|Breaking the day's fasting {{traditionally}} {{begins with}} the brief consumption of dates and a chilled beverage. Palestinians make a variety of fruit-based beverages, including the flavors, tamar Hindi or tamarind, sous or licorice, kharroub or carob and Qamar Eddine. Tamar Hindi is made by soaking tamarinds in water for many hours, then straining, sweetening and mixing it with rose water and lemon juice. Kharroub is made similarly except instead of tamarind, carob is used. Qamar Eddine is made of dried <b>apricots</b> boiled into a liquid and chilled.|$|E
5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with {{couscous}} is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried <b>apricots</b> and raisins.|$|E
5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} {{different from those of}} the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, <b>apricots</b> and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E

50|$|Prunus armeniaca ("Armenian plum"), {{the most}} {{commonly}} cultivated <b>apricot</b> species, also called ansu <b>apricot,</b> Siberian <b>apricot,</b> Tibetan <b>apricot,</b> is a species of Prunus, classified with the plum in the subgenus Prunus. The native range is somewhat uncertain due to its extensive prehistoric cultivation, though almost certainly somewhere in Asia. It is extensively cultivated in many countries and has escaped into the wild in many places.|$|R
5|$|Homemade {{fruit juices}} {{are also a}} common {{household}} drink during warm days and during Ramadan, the holy month for fasting by Muslims. In the Palestinian culture, coffee and tea is traditionally served to adults during a visit or gathering, while juice is served to everyone. Drinks such as tamar hind or qamar deen are served during special occasions to everyone. Tamar hind, originally from Africa is a liquorice drink made by soaking or infusing liquorice sticks, and adding lemon juice. Qamar deen is traditionally served to break the Ramadan fast (as is water), and is an iced drink made from a dry sheet of <b>apricots</b> soaked in water, and mixed with lemon juice or syrup.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the primary}} {{agricultural}} product from Rancho Camulos was wine. Ninety acres (360,000 m²) of vineyards were planted in the 1860s and Camulos wines and brandies were known throughout Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) of brandy. In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, <b>apricots,</b> wheat, corn and barley. Flower petals from roses grown at Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume.|$|E
5|$|In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines. Vegetable matter eaten by jackals {{in these areas}} includes fruits, such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood, and the cones of common medlars. The jackal is implicated {{in the destruction of}} grape, watermelon, muskmelon, and nut crops. Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild stony olives. Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild stony olives, mulberry, dried <b>apricots,</b> watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E

Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E

Souk Ableuh contains stalls which specialize in lemons, chilis, capers, pickles, green, red, and black olives, and mint, a common ingredient of Moroccan cuisine and tea. Similarly, Souk Kchacha specializes in dried fruit and nuts, including dates, figs, walnuts, cashews and <b>apricots.</b> Rahba Qedima contains stalls selling hand-woven baskets, natural perfumes, knitted hats, scarves, tee shirts, Ramadan tea, ginseng, and alligator and iguana skins.

5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish. Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, <b>apricots,</b> pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E
40|$|Bitter <b>apricot</b> kernels have {{increasingly}} been offered {{for direct consumption}} for some time now, especially through Internet channels. In some cases, advertisements claim that <b>apricot</b> kernels offer protection against cancer. However, {{there is no scientific}} evidence of any such benefits. In fact, consumption of bitter <b>apricot</b> kernels can lead to severe poisoning which can be fatal if larger quantities are ingested. The toxic effect of bitter <b>apricot</b> kernels is due to the food ingredient amygdalin. From amygdalin, cyanide is released during ingestion and digestion. The body can break down small amounts of cyanide through metabolic processes. For adults, a quantity of two large bitter <b>apricot</b> kernels can be regarded as safe in terms of acute poisoning symptoms. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) therefore recommends that consumers limit their intake of bitter <b>apricot</b> kernels to no more than two a day or that no <b>apricot</b> kernels are eaten at all. In the opinion of the BfR, packaging of bitter <b>apricot</b> kernels intended for direct consumption should carry warnings of potential health risks and state the recommended maximum daily intake. To protect children against ingestion of large quantities of bitter <b>apricot</b> kernels, they should only be offered in small packs.
