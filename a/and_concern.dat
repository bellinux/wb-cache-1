5|$|A third bore of the tunnel, {{replacing}} the old Victorian northbound bore, was proposed by Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson in 1989, but {{had yet to}} see any progress towards construction over a decade later. This option is not currently favoured by TfL due to technical problems with construction and engineering, difficulty tying in with the existing road network, <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> about increased traffic on the A12.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E
40|$|This paper compares and {{discusses}} {{some of the}} main findings of two surveys to determine expectations <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> of library staff before and after a merger. The findings showed that expectations <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> that library staff members have before a merger do not necessarily disappear away after the merger has taken place. If left alone, expectations <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> may change over time or it may even increase. In the light of the findings the author gives possible explanations to why some of the expectations <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> changed over time {{in the absence of any}} deliberate intervention from library managers...|$|R

ReportCompleted questionnaires about symptoms <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> {{were brought to}} clinic by 62 % (203 / 329) patients referred with uncomplicated primary varicose veins. ‘Concerns, worries or fears’ about their veins were reported by 79 %. These were seldom mentioned in referral letters, and included fears about thrombosis (31 %), trauma (16 %), ulcers (15 %) <b>and</b> general <b>concerns</b> about the future (57 %). DiscussionMany patients have unrecognised fears <b>and</b> <b>concerns</b> about their varicose veins. Specific enquiry and reassurance about these is part of good management and may avoid unnecessary treatment...|$|R

5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{enjoyed a}} good {{relationship}} with Pope Clement V, despite the King's repeated intervention in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> for their own protection.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{charges against}} the group were {{presented}} on June 4, the indictment running to 2,800 pages. By late June 2012, disquiet over the trio's detention without setting a trial date <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> over what was regarded as excessive and arbitrary treatment, led to the writing of an open letter. It was signed by leading opposition figures, {{as well as by}} director Fyodor Bondarchuk, a supporter of Putin, and actors Chulpan Khamatova and Yevgeny Mironov, both of whom had appeared in campaign videos supporting Putin's re-election. Singer Alla Pugachyova appealed on the women's behalf, stating that they should be ordered to perform community service rather than imprisoned. Meanwhile, Nikita Mikhalkov, head of the Russian Cinematographers' Union, stated that he would gladly sign an open letter against them.|$|E

He recruited his longtime friend and guitarist David Kennedy of Box Car Racer, as well as drummer Atom Willard and bassist Ryan Sinn to form Angels & Airwaves, who were primarily inspired by arena rock groups such as U2 and The Police.

5|$|Many long-time {{employees}} of Olympus Corp were shocked and angry, and felt {{betrayed by the}} executives who were responsible for bringing public humiliation onto the company. Former director Koji Miyata started a web site, called Olympus Grassroots, demanding clean-up at the company they say they love. Miyata also circulated a petition targeted at employees calling on the reinstatement of Woodford. As Olympus has a 70-percent market share in endoscopy, the scandal caused anxiety <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> among the medical profession, which sees Olympus endoscopes as irreplaceable.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{damaged or}} wrecked numerous vessels. Six ships were wrecked or {{grounded in the}} Bahamas, and the crews of at least two, the John Stanley and the Linea, had to be rescued. The steamship Santiago de Cuba left port on August 4, and began to encounter squally conditions later that afternoon. Heavy seas and a strong gale inflicted some damage on the vessel. Several ships along the eastern coast of Cuba were wrecked during the storm, leading to great uncertainty <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> regarding {{the fate of the}} Santiago. At least three vessels were lost or grounded along the Florida Keys.|$|E
5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.|$|E
5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons.

Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, {{and he may have}} wanted to be sure he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E

5|$|Although {{short fiction}} had been popular {{as far back}} as the Tang dynasty (618–907), and the works of {{contemporaneous}} authors such as Xu Guangqi, Xu Xiake, and Song Yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic, the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel. While the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of Classical Chinese, those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families, merchants, and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed Vernacular Chinese. Literati scholars edited or developed major Chinese novels into mature form in this period, such as Water Margin and Journey to the West. Jin Ping Mei, published in 1610, although incorporating earlier material, marks the trend toward independent composition <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> with psychology. In the later years of the dynasty, Feng Menglong and Ling Mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction. Theater scripts were equally imaginative. The most famous, The Peony Pavilion, was written by Tang Xianzu (1550–1616), with its first performance at the Pavilion of Prince Teng in 1598.|$|E
5|$|By 2012 {{the scandal}} had {{developed}} {{into one of}} the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan; it had wiped 75–80% off the company's stock market valuation, led to the resignation of much of the board, investigations across Japan, the UK and US, the arrest of 11 past or present Japanese directors, senior managers, auditors and bankers of Olympus for alleged criminal activities or cover-up, and raised considerable turmoil <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> over Japan's prevailing corporate governance and transparency and the Japanese financial markets. Woodford received a reported £10 million ($16 m) in damages from Olympus for defamation and wrongful dismissal in 2012; around the same time, Olympus also announced it would shed 2,700 jobs (7% of its workforce) and around 40 percent of its 30 manufacturing plants by 2015 to reduce its cost base.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval <b>and</b> <b>concern,</b> his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|The family sought {{compensation}} {{from the}} National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), {{but in order}} to qualify they were required to prove that it was more likely than not that their children's autism was caused by their vaccines. The scientific community had concluded that vaccines did not cause autism years before the first cases were heard, <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> was therefore expressed that the relatively lax evidentiary standards of the NVICP could lead to compensation being awarded in spite of the compelling scientific evidence to the contrary. This, some vaccine supporters argued, might have serious adverse public health effects by discouraging vaccine manufacturers from producing more childhood vaccines. Though the NVICP had existed since 1988, it was not designed to handle the thousands of cases it received from 1999 to 2007, which led to the establishment of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2002.|$|E
5|$|There {{was intense}} public {{interest}} <b>and</b> <b>concern</b> at the stalemate, and Fraser and his Liberals acted {{to shore up}} support. Liberal frontbenchers worked to build unity for the tactic in state organisations. The former longtime Premier of South Australia Sir Thomas Playford was speaking out against the blocking of supply, causing South Australia Senator Don Jessop to waver in {{his support for the}} tactic. Fraser was able to co-ordinate a wave of communications from party members which served to neutralise both men. Fraser sought the backing of the retired longtime Liberal Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, and went to see Menzies in person, taking with him a 1947 statement by Menzies supporting the blocking of supply in the upper house of the Victorian Parliament. He did not have to use the paper; Menzies stated that he found the tactic distasteful, but in this case necessary. The former Prime Minister issued a statement in support of Fraser's tactics.|$|E
