40|$|The River Kennet in {{southern}} England has exhibited excessive benthic algal growth and associated ecological problems, such as loss of macrophytes and invertebrates, since the 1980 s. These ecological problems {{were attributed to}} regular peaks in phosphorus concentration, which were widely attributed to intermittent failures of the Marlborough sewage treatment works (STW). This study deployed highfrequency phosphorus <b>auto-analysers</b> to monitor the total reactive phosphorus (TRP) concentrations of Marlborough STW final effluent and the downstream River Kennet at hourly and 30 minute resolution respectively, between 2008 and 2009. This monitoring confirmed that the Marlborough STW was operating well within its 1000 mg l-� 1 annual mean total phosphorus consent limit, with mean total P and soluble reactive P concentrations of 675 and 345 mg l-� 1 respectively. There were two occasions where effluent TRP concentration exceeded 1000 mg l-� 1, and {{only one of these}} resulted in a peak in TRP concentration of over 100 mg l-� 1 in the River Kennet at Mildenhall. The other nine peaks of over 100 mg l-� 1 in the River Kennet during the monitoring period were associated with storm events, indicating that diffuse-source inputs and remobilisation of stored within-channel phosphorus were the cause of the peaks in river concentration, rather than Marlborough STW. The value of high-frequency environmental monitoring and the problems associated with using nutrient <b>auto-analysers</b> in the field are discussed. Seasonal phosphorus consents for STWs could provide a useful and cost effective means to improve both water quality and river ecology in the upper River Kennet...|$|R
40|$|High {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) fluxes from upstream agriculture threaten aquatic ecosystems in surface waters and estuaries, especially in areas characterized by high agricultural N and P inputs and densely drained catchments like the Netherlands. Controlled drainage {{has been recognized}} as an effective option to optimize soil moisture conditions for agriculture and to reduce unnecessary losses of fresh water and nutrients. We designed a small scale (1 ha) field experiment to investigate the hydrological and chemical changes after introducing controlled drainage. Precipitation rates and the response of water tables and drain fluxes were measured in the periods before the introduction of controlled drainage (2007 – 2008) and after (2009 – 2011). For the N and P concentration measurements, we combined <b>auto-analysers</b> for continuous records with passive samplers for time-average concentrations at individual drain outlets. Our experimental setup yielded continuous time series for all relevant hydrological and chemical parameters, which enabled us to quantify changes in the field water and solute balance after introducing controlled drainage. We concluded that controlled drainage reduced the drain discharge and increased the groundwater storage in the field. The introduction of controlled drainage did not have clear positive effects on nutrient losses to surface water...|$|R
40|$|Solvent {{polymeric}} membrane electrodes incorporating p-t-butyl hexaethyl ester and hexaethyl ester calix[6]arene as neutral carriers {{have been constructed}} for use in caesium selective electrodes. The potentiometric sensing electrodes including 2 -nitrophenyloctyl ether as solvent mediator exhibit near-Nernstian behaviour in the range 1 x 10 M to 1 x 10 M CsCl. The pattern of selectivity encountered {{for a range of}} common interferents is not modified by the inclusion of potassium tetrakis(p-ch!orophenyl) borate as ion-exchanger {{in the case of the}} hexaethyl ester although some improvement in sensitivity is obtained in the case of the hexaethyl ester. The hexaethyl ester is superior with respect to rubidium and potassium selectivities, with the coefficients being of the order of 3 x 10 and 2. 7 x 10 respectively. Both electrodes are relatively stable and responses are essentially complete within seconds. Different types of sodium electrodes have also been constructed using twomeric calixarene ionophores, namely methyl p-t-butylcalix[4]aryl acetate and the methyl tetraketone derivative of p-t-butylcalix[4]arene. The selectivity of both electrodes is similar although discrimination against ammonium ions is improved by a factor of ten in the case of the methyl tetraketone based electrode. The selectivities against lithium, potassium and hydrogen ions are improved in comparison to other commercially available ionophores. Response times, stability, reproducibility and life time characteristics agree well with the requirements made of these devices for clinical applications. On the assessment of a large number of blood plasma samples, the methyl ester tetrameric based electrode exhibits excellent correlation when compared to two hospital based <b>auto-analysers</b> and to flame photometry. The residual standard deviation is typically within 1 to 3 mmol/ 1 and highly influenced by the dipping method employed for the determination. Optimisation of the selective membrane in the case of methyl tetraketone based electrodes also give excellent results for the analysis of sodium in plasma samples, although in this case correlation with the above mentioned reference methods is higher and the residual standard deviation is lower. The incorporation of the methyl ester calix[4]arene electrode in a flow injection system has proven advantageous in improving both precision and accuracy in comparison to the dipping technique. Solid-state monomeric and polymeric calixarene based electrodes have been constructed and found to exhibit promising features to varying degrees. Thus, platinum coated electrodes based on the methyl tetraketone calix[4]arene gave similar performance to the conventional sort in terms of Nernstian response, selectivity and response time, although the electrodes are less stable. Another chemically modified tetrameric calixarene (monomer VI) has been found to be responsive to potassium ions. Copolymerisation of two monomeric calixarenes with methyl methacrylate carried out have led to non-responsive electrodes while other polymers exhibited sub-Nernstian slopes to sodium and caesium. Amperometric studies have been also carried out to assess the voltammetric behaviour of pipemidic acid. The drug has been investigated by linear sweep, differential pulse and square wave voltammetry at a hanging mercury drop electrode. Two reduction processes were observed in Britton-Robinson buffer in acidic solutions, whereas only one or two processes were observed in alkaline solutions, depending on the pH of the b u ffer employed. Adsorptive effects have been used to accumulate the drug onto the electrode and linear calibration graphs were obtained in the range 2. 5 x 10 to 1 x 10 " M.

A low nitrogen mineralisation potential and high leaching hazard complicate {{the management of the}} nitrogen supply to the plant. This study investigated the viability of a rapid field measurement of plant nitrate content as a decision support tool in three field trials. In the first two trials the standard practice of weekly N and K fertigation was used at four different N-levels on two cultivars. The nitrate levels were monitored in petioles during two seasons, using two different techniques. The procedure in which dried petioles were used for nitrate extraction and laboratory readings taken with an <b>auto-analyser</b> was less accurate than that where petiole sap was squeezed from petioles and indicator paper strips used for nitrate determination. The highest petiole nitrate levels in these trials corresponded with the highest tuber yields for both cultivars and were found at an application of 400 kg N ha- 1. Increasing N levels (100 - 400 kg N ha- 1) significantly reduced the specific gravity (SG) of Hertha but had no effect on the SG of Up-to-Date. With three irrigation treatments and three fertigation frequencies in another trial, the petiole nitrate concentrations were the highest when no leaching occured. The highest petiole nitrate concentration was obtained with two fertigations per week. The petiole nitrate levels differed between cultivars and peaked at five to six weeks after planting. These factors should be kept in mind when petiole nitrate readings are used as an aid for fertiliser programs.

40|$|The {{production}} of farmed fish has increased globally almost 12 -fold since the 1980 s. And in 2010, aquaculture production food fish reached {{an all-time high}} at 60 million tonnes. This activity releases large amounts of ammonium (NH 4) and phosphate (PO 4) in marine waters, {{to the extent that}} it could be endangering the surrounding environment. The increase in the supply of macronutrients to the system could lead to eutrophication and changes in nutrient ratios. This could in turn cause a shift in phytoplankton composition and changes in the food web structure. However, at present, the understanding of how nutrients and organic waste from aquaculture systems are distributed and influence the ecosystems is still poor. The aim of this work has been to gain a better understanding of the distribution of macronutrients around aquaculture cages, by comparing the concentration of NH 4, PO 4, NO 3 and SiO 3 measured at stations located near aquaculture with reference concentrations measured at stations where no or very little aquaculture activities are present. Samples were collected in Trondheimsfjorden during late winter (February) and early spring (April), to compare seasonal variations in macronutrient concentrations. The samples were analysed with an <b>Auto-Analyser</b> for NH 4, PO 4 and NO 3 concentrations, and manually for SiO 3 concentration. Results show a considerable increase in NH 4 concentration in spring. PO 4, NO 3 and SiO 3 concentrations decreases as expected, due to a measurable increase in phytoplankton concentration. During the second cruise (spring season), ammonium concentrations up to 18 &# 956;g L- 1 were measured, which is a significant increase compared to the first cruise (winter season) when all ammonium concentrations measured were lower than 10 &# 956;g L- 1. The ammonium concentrations in these waters can thus be regarded as considerable, and a potential source of the ammonium could be emissions from aquaculture. However, at this stage in the project, it is not possible to make any conclusions as to whether or not these ammonium concentrations are a result of aquaculture activities. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a {{potentially}} curable disease that cause hypertension (HT). The {{first step in}} diagnosing PA consists in {{the determination of the}} aldosterone-renin-ratio (ARR). Recently, new methods with superior analytical performance for the measurement of both, aldosterone and renin, have been introduced in clinical practice. While aldosterone can be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or automated immunoassays, renin is predominantly measured by direct immunoassays. ARR is strongly method dependent. Insufficient data exists on ARR in healthy subjects and PA patients when aldosterone and renin are measured with one of these new methods. Aim of study The present study evaluated the analytical performance a commercial LC-MS/MS method from Perkin Elmer (CHS ™ MSMS Steroids) for the measurement of aldosterone. In addition, we established a reference range for ARR when aldosterone is measured with the before mentioned LC-MS/MS method and renin is measured by a direct immunoassay from DiaSorin on a Liaison XL <b>auto-analyser.</b> Materials and methods The Perkin Elmer CHS ™ MSMS Steroids method is a multiplex assays. Analyses were performed on a Shimadzu 8050 LC-MS/MS. The analytical performance of aldosterone measurement was evaluated determining the following performance indices: LoD, LoQ, recovery, carryover, linearity and precision. For the establishment of the ARR reference range serum aldosterone and plasma renin were measured in samples from 128 normotensive blood donors. Results LOD and LOQ were respectively 12. 9 pg/mL and 26 pg/mL. Intraassay precision at different concentrations was 7 % (at 79. 9 pg/mL.), 7. 6 % (at 161. 8 pg/mL.) and 1. 5 % (at 3506. 08 pg/mL). Interassay precision was 8. 5 %, 9. 6 % e 5. 1 % respectively. Recovery ranged between 80. 5 and 104. 4 %. Between x and y the method was linear. ARR in healthy blood donors varied between 0. 6 - 62. 4 pg/µU with a median of 5. 7 pg/µU. The 2. 5 th and 97. 5 th percentiles (without outlier) were 1. 0 and 16. 4, respectively.

40|$|Introduction: A tendon is {{a tissue}} {{which does not}} heal easily. For example, {{tendinopathy}} is a condition which often becomes chronic {{in the case of}} bad or overdue management. Several studies, essentially in vitro and, more recently, a few in clinical practice, have demonstrated the positive effects of platelets on the healing process of tendons. A local injection of platelet–rich plasma (PRP), which releases many growth factors, has the potentiality to enhance the tendon healing process. The aim of our experiment was to ascertain whether the use of PRP could accelerate the healing process of an Achilles tendon after a surgically induced lesion. Methods (*) : PRP was obtained from the blood of 12 Sprague Dawley rats by cardiac puncture under general anaesthesia until the heart stopped beating. Quantities of 1 mL of anticoagulant, adenosine-citrate-dextrose-acid (ACD-A), were added immediately to each 4, 5 mL of blood. The blood was then centrifuged at 180 g for 10 minutes. To improve platelet concentration of the PRP, the supernatant was centrifuged for a second time at 1000 g for 10 minutes. The platelets were then collected using a gauge pipette. Cell and platelet counts were made by an <b>auto-analyser.</b> Platelet concentration was around 2. 2 to 2. 9 x 106 /mm³. A 5 mm defect was surgically induced in the Achilles tendon of 60 rats. Rats were divided into 2 groups of 30 : A: a control group (no injection) and B: with a PRP injection. The rats of group B received a PRP injection in situ 1 hour after the surgery {{on the site of the}} lesion of the Achilles tendon. Fifty micro-litres of PRP were injected in each rat of the PRP group. Platelets were activated by the local presence of collagen in the wound. Afterwards, the rats of both groups were placed in their cages without immobilization. After 5, 15 and 30 days, 10 rats of each group were euthanized. The traumatized Achilles tendon of each rat was dissected and removed. Immediately after sampling, tendons were submitted to a biomechanical tensile test up to rupture, using a tensile machine with a “Cryo-jaw”. Results: We demonstrated that the force necessary to induce tendon rupture during biomechanical tensile testing was greater for tendons which had been submitted to an injection of PRP. These results were observed and significant (p< 0. 05) from day 5 onwards. Discussion: This experimentation showed that PRP injections could accelerate the tendon healing process and increase the force needed to break tendons in their healing process. This “accelerating” process can be observed and is significant (p< 0. 05) as early as day 5. Conclusion: PRP, by the local release of growth factors, would be a new therapeutic tool to accelerate tendon healing.
