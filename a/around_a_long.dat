This came in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith grew very popular; the first hit of this field was Mamie Smith's [...] "Crazy Blues". [...] These urban blues singers changed the idea of popular music from being simple songs that could be easily performed by anyone to works primarily associated with an individual singer.

The pier is an obvious place to visit and is sometimes used to hold events, such as the international birdman competition held annually, although cancelled in 2005 due to lack of competitors. An annual raft competition takes place where competitors, usually local businesses, circumnavigate the pier in a raft made by themselves, while being attacked by a water-cannon.

2500|$|Metaphorically {{centered}} around the title1, Orrery is a single story told from the inclusion of well over 70 poems written in different styles and divided into three main sections: 'Hours' (time), 'Apples' (memory), and 'Physics.' A prelude of sorts to The Invention of the Zero, Orrery poses {{the belief that the}} world is now being mechanically driven, but it presents the view in a different fashion. The book centers <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> poem based on his experience at an apple cider farm in Vermont; 'Apples.' To Kenney, the cider mill represents [...] "a relic of that pre-electrical world...A comprehensible world, in many ways...None of it seems to have left this farm, at any rate--...crippled dance steps, disassembled stories, half-hummed tunes, all common property--disintegration projects...with the confusion of common sense, as it sometimes seems, from the decay of the clockwork universe" [...] (Orrery ix, Kenney).

2500|$|The C6N {{originated}} from a 1942 Imperial Japanese Navy specification for a carrier-based reconnaissance plane {{with a top}} speed of 350 knots (650km/h) at 6,000 m and range of 2,500 Nautical miles (4,960km). Nakajima's initial proposal, designated N-50, was for a craft with two 1,000hp engines housed in tandem in the fuselage, driving two propellers mounted on the wings. With the development of the 2,000hp class Nakajima Homare engine though, this configuration was abandoned and Nakajima decided on a more conventional single-engine layout. However, the Homare's output turned out to be less than initially expected, so the design had to be optimized in other areas. The resulting aircraft was designed <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and extremely narrow cylindrical fuselage, just large enough in diameter to accommodate the engine. The crew of three sat in tandem under a single canopy, while equipment was similarly arranged in a line along the fuselage. The C6N's low mounted laminar flow wing housed fuel tanks and was fitted with both Fowler and slit flaps and leading edge slats to lower the aircraft's landing speed to ease use aboard aircraft carriers. Like Nakajima's earlier B6N [...] "Tenzan" [...] torpedo bomber, the rudder was angled slightly forward to enable tighter packing on aircraft carriers.|$|E

2500|$|Through Chrétien had {{supported}} Martin in {{his plans for}} cuts, he did not allow Martin {{to go as far}} as he would have liked with cutting various social programs and to devolve spending powers to the provinces as a way of cutting federal government expenditure. As a [...] "hard federalist", Chrétien fiercely objected to what he saw as the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Martin's attempts to weaken the power of the federal government under the guise of cutting the deficit. One senior Liberal later recalled about the Chrétien-Martin debate about reforming Old Age Security that: [...] "Martin had been told [...] "no" [...] by the prime minister three times and still he persisted...his insubordination was unprecedented. It got the point where Chrétien had to draw {{a line in the sand}} and say [...] "I'm the prime minister and you're the finance minister and I'm saying no!"". Much of the Liberal caucus was deeply unhappy with the 1995 budget, arguing that this was not what they had been elected for in 1993, only to be informed by the Prime Minister that there was no alternative. Chrétien himself expressed his unhappiness with his budget in a radio interview with Peter Gzowski in March 1995, saying about the budget: [...] "It is not our pleasure sir, I have to tell you that. I've been <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. It's no pleasure at all. I'm not doctrinaire, a right-winger. I'm a Liberal, and I feel like a Liberal, and it is painful. But it is needed".|$|E
2500|$|Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he {{said the}} three-finger style {{was the most common}} way to play the five-string banjo in his {{hometown}} in western North Carolina. An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt [...] "Snuffy" [...] Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, [...] "Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it". At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called [...] "Reuben" [...] and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two. [...] "That excited me to no end", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling [...] "I've got it". From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style. Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins. Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it [...] "a syncopated roll that was quite different." [...] On the subject, John Hartford said, [...] "Here's the way I feel about it. Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time— maybe since 1840. But it's my feeling that if it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't be worried about who invented it." ...|$|E
