500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Evelyn Shrifte, {{president}} of the Vanguard Press, met Oates soon after Oates received her master's degree. [...] "She was fresh out of school, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was a genius," [...] Shrifte said. Vanguard published Oates' first book, the short-story collection By the North Gate, in 1963.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not speak}} for a moment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was resenting the question.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me long <b>and</b> earnestly <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> was {{softening}} toward me.|$|R
60|$|He started. I confess I started too. He <b>thought,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> that <b>she</b> {{was about}} to divulge {{the mystery of the}} Moonstone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, papa. She {{told me that}} Frederic Aylmer was to {{have all}} her property. She {{explained}} to me everything that she meant to do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> was right." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (TO {{himself again}} and again.) Little Featherweight's a woman--a woman! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{was a little}} girl.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘She is {{a strikingly}} {{handsome}} girl, sir, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{might have been}} described to you, or presented to you perhaps?’ ...|$|E
60|$|My {{father died}} when he was sixty-six, and I succeeded him. I married my cousin, whom I loved tenderly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> loved me too.|$|E
2500|$|... "She told {{me things}} {{that there is}} no way she could have known. And the first part of the reading was that this was the path that I was {{supposed}} to be on <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> was supposed to be a teacher and help people <b>and</b> – <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was nuts." [...] Speaking of the same encounter in a 2002 interview, Edward said, [...] "She told me I would one day become internationally known for my psychic abilities through lectures, books, radio <b>and</b> TV. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was full of it until she started to tell me things no one in my life knew about... The details were unbelievable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou dog!" [...] she said, in her terrible whisper, which {{sounded like}} the hiss of a snake, [...] "why didst thou hide this from me?" [...] And she {{stretched}} out her arm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> was about to slay me.|$|R
60|$|She was {{abreast of}} it now <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> would stop again; but no! She swerved rigidly--at the moment {{there was no one}} near her; she had that bit of {{pavement}} to herself--with inanimate slowness as if moved by something outside herself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! Miss Pearson {{has taken}} to saying, [...] "My dear, your {{brothers}} are quite grown into young men," [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{did not like the}} play.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] I {{said in an}} apologetic tone, [...] "she {{was going}} eleven knots very nicely, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would do for another half-hour or so." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was walking}} ever the faster, and looking fair {{in front of}} her; but at this she made a little noise in her head, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would have run.|$|E
60|$|I cannot repeat {{half the}} exclamations of delight which escaped the fair Eudosia, when I first burst on her entranced eye. She turned {{me over and}} over, {{examined}} me with palpitating bosom, <b>and</b> once <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was about to kiss me; then, in a trembling voice, she demanded the price.|$|R
5000|$|According to Edward, {{when he was}} 15 and [...] "a huge doubter" [...] (in psychic abilities), he was [...] "read" [...] by a New Jersey {{woman who}} {{convinced}} {{him that he could}} become a medium."She told me things {{that there is no way}} she could have known. And the first part of the reading was that this was the path that I was supposed to be on <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> was supposed to be a teacher and help people <b>and</b> - <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was nuts."

6000|$|Quilla made no answer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> {{was angry}} and would go away. But she did not; indeed, she sat herself {{down upon the}} stone at my side and covered {{her face with her}} hands as <b>I</b> had done <b>and</b> began to weep as I had done. Now in my turn I asked her: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How insulting!--Intellectual, and so on; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{would be}} just fit {{to live in a}} place where {{everybody}} is literary and intellectual. That is, I thought that, if I thought anything." ...|$|E
60|$|BLY. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was goin' to be {{a success}} here. Fact is, you can't see {{anything}} till it 'appens. There's winders all round, but you can't see. Follow your instincts--it's the only way.|$|E
6000|$|She {{would not}} {{help him with}} a question, and after waiting for it he proceeded. [...] "If you just kent wha she is! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was dead! What a start it gave me when I {{found out it was}} her!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went over}} the plans I had made for communicating, <b>and</b> the things <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might do. <b>I</b> had given her the address of a {{solicitor}} she might put some trust in.|$|R
5000|$|Allen {{admits the}} role of Hannah was based on Farrow being [...] "a romanticised {{perception}} of Mia. She's very stable, she has eight children now, and she's able to run her career and have good relationships with her sister and her mother. I'm very impressed with those qualities <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>she</b> had two unstable sisters it would be interesting." ...|$|R
50|$|When I {{came out}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was the premier war {{correspondent}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she,</b> being the Tokyo correspondent, {{ought to be}} back in Toyko. But she didn't see things that way. She was a very brave person, foolishly brave. As a result, I felt as though I had {{to go out and get}} shot at occasionally myself. So I resented that.|$|R
6000|$|Gillian {{followed}} Maura, who was {{no sooner}} out of hearing than she began: 'It is too bad {{of him to}} be so cross. Kally really is so upset! She did not sleep all night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would have fainted quite away this morning!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better," [...] {{answered}} Spike. [...] "I never {{had such a}} whirl in her before in my life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{was going to stop}} and pass the night there. That's the very spot on which `The Hussar' frigate was wrecked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ethel, what {{on earth}} can you mean? I saw the two {{children}} dragging on her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would see nothing that was going on, and {{would be glad to}} be released; and I wanted them to go with me and see Meta's gold pheasants." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Polly Bradfield’s solo playing {{was quite}} {{different}} -- harder, less lyrical and treading a tightrope between controlled <b>and</b> contrived. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> {{had a lot of}} bottle actually, because she’s chosen a difficult path; her playing is austere and uncompromising, a little stiff; she takes chances; her use of silence is similar to John Zorn’s, though her humour’s dryer (it’s there though). After she’d played I felt mentally excited but earthbound." [...] http://www.wnur.org/jazz/artists/frith.fred/zu.html ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she doesn't think that I {{care much about}} it. When I told her, I did it all of a heap, you see; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fancy <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was just mad at the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|She read it, and {{the number}} of size to which she gave vint, and the tears which she shed, beggar digscription. She wep <b>and</b> sighed until <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would bust. She even claspt my hand in her's, and said, [...] "O Charles! is he very, very miserable?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{closed her}} eyes for a moment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was going to faint. I was a little {{impatient}} with her; I had not suspected that she was so neurotic a woman. Then I heard Stroeve's voice again. It seemed to break oddly on the silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] {{repeated}} Isabel, absently. [...] "Oh, a {{woman does}} n't judge a man by what he does, but by what he is! I knew that if she dismissed him {{it was because she}} never really had trusted or could trust his love; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had better not make another trial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was an accident," [...] groaned the Colonel. [...] "Your {{wife was}} looking at my new gun. I {{told her it was}} loaded, and that she must be careful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had put it down. The next thing that I heard was the report. It is all my cursed fault for leaving the {{cartridges}} in." ...|$|E
60|$|So she put {{up pretty}} {{curtains}} at the girl's window, {{and with a}} box that she stood on end, and some old muslin {{and a lot of}} tacks, she made a toilet-table so neat <b>and</b> convenient that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> ought to take it into our room and give the servant our wash-stand.|$|R
6000|$|Frank had a {{long and}} {{animated}} account from Maude of the extraordinary visitor whom she had entertained. 'It's such a pity, dear, that you don't know her well, for I should really like to hear every detail about her. At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was mad, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> was odious, <b>and</b> then finally {{she seemed to be}} the very wisest and kindest woman that I had ever known. She made me angry, and frightened, and grieved, and grateful, and affectionate, one after the other, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never in my life was so taken out of myself by any one. She IS so sensible!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} nothing, your highness. All day {{yesterday}} {{she lay in}} a torpor, as I told you in the evening when you inquired about her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> then <b>she</b> {{was going to be}} ill. I have watched her all night. She has been restless <b>and</b> disturbed, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it better not to go nearer lest I should wake her, and it was not until this morning, when the day broke, that I perceived this terrible change. What shall we do with her? If the disease is contagious, everyone in the palace may catch it." ...|$|R
