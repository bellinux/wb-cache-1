The Martin family themselves {{are in the process}} of becoming vampires. The following events that take place and the ending vary widely depending on which characters the player is able to save from the Augers.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a wide}} {{variation}} in reported epidemiologic data for bruxism, and this {{is largely due to}} differences in the definition, diagnosis and research methodologies of these studies. E.g. several studies use self-reported bruxism as a measure of bruxism, and since many people with bruxism <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their habit, self-reported tooth grinding and clenching habits may be a poor measure of the true prevalence.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{who make}} their own bullets usually <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{available}} manual specialized equipment and dies required for swaging bullets, and thus choose to make cast bullets. To get high precision results, {{it is common to}} cast the bullets slightly oversized, then swage the resulting castings through a die to do the final forming. Since the amount of pressure required to size the bullet is far less than that required to form a bullet, a simple mechanical press can be used, often the same press used for handloading ammunition.|$|E
25|$|A {{new trend}} in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the {{individual}} for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban Álvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban Álvarez Cobos, would become Esteban Álvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.|$|E
25|$|It is {{stated that}} if a student is {{successful}} in awakening consciousness, {{he or she will}} eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Aun Weor states that those who have a sleeping consciousness <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their postmortem condition, just as they are not aware when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless of their physical state.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, the U.S. Senate {{designated}} 11 January as a National Day of Human Trafficking Awareness in {{an effort}} to raise consciousness about this global, national and local issue. In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, President Barack Obama proclaimed January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. Along with these initiatives libraries across the United States are beginning to contribute to human trafficking awareness. Slowly, libraries are turning into educational centers for those who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this issue. They are collaborating with other organizations to train staff members to spot human trafficking victims and find ways to help them.|$|E
25|$|The Epistle to a Friend {{concerning}} Poetry {{is neither}} startling nor contemptible; it has, in fact, {{much more to}} say than the rhymed treatises on verse by Roscommon and Buckinghamshire. Its remarks on Genius are fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns with both neatness and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace—but such was {{the tradition of the}} poetical treatise on verse.

25|$|Due to {{the chaos}} caused in the Jewish world, the Rabbinic {{prohibition}} against studying Kabbalah established itself firmly within the Jewish religion. One {{of the conditions}} allowing a man to study and engage himself in the Kabbalah was {{to be at least}} forty years old. This age requirement came about during this period and is not Talmudic in origin but Rabbinic. Many Jews are familiar with this ruling, but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> its origins. Moreover, the prohibition is not halakhic in nature. According to Moses Cordovero, halakhically, one must be of age twenty to engage in the Kabbalah. Many famous kabbalists, including the ARI, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, Yehuda Ashlag, were younger than twenty when they began.|$|E
25|$|During this process, {{the role}} of the referees is advisory. The {{publisher}} is typically under no obligation to accept the opinions of the referees, though she will most often do so. Furthermore, the referees in scientific publication do not act as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> each other's identities or evaluations. Proponents argue that if the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the publisher can more easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. There is usually no requirement that the referees achieve consensus, with the decision instead often made by the publisher based on her best judgement of the arguments. The group dynamics are thus substantially different from that of a jury.|$|E
25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion.

Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose.

The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E

25|$|Discontinuing benzodiazepines or {{antidepressants}} abruptly due {{to concerns}} of teratogenic {{effects of the}} medications has {{a high risk of}} causing serious complications, so is not recommended. For example, abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepines or antidepressants has a high risk of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms, including suicidal ideation and a severe rebound effect of the return of the underlying disorder if present. This can lead to hospitalisation and potentially, suicide. One study reported one-third of mothers who suddenly discontinued or very rapidly tapered their medications became acutely suicidal due to 'unbearable symptoms'. One woman had a medical abortion, as she felt she could no longer cope, and another woman used alcohol in a bid to combat the withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines. The study reported physicians generally <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the severe consequences of abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants.|$|E

500|$|Iron uptake is tightly {{regulated}} by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people {{as a result of}} a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin, a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, known medically as hemochromatosis. Many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload, and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> a family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8% of all metabolic diseases of Caucasians.|$|E
