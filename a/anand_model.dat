The Anand parameters of the constitutive equations for the SnAgCu and SnAgCuCe solders were determined from separated constitutive relations and experimental results. Non-linear least-squares fitting was selected to determine the model constants. Comparisons were then made with experimental measurements of the stress-inelastic strain curves: excellent agreement was found. The model accurately predicted the overall trend of steady-state stress-strain behavior of SnAgCu and SnAgCuCe solders for the temperature ranges from - 55 to 125 °C and for the strain rate range from 1 % s- 1 to 0. 01 % s- 1. It is concluded that the <b>Anand</b> <b>model</b> {{can be applied to}} represent the inelastic deformation behavior of solders at high homologous temperatures and can be recommended for finite element simulation of the stress-strain response of lead-free soldered joints.

It affects the overall performance and reliability of electronics devices. In this project, the response of Sn- 4. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 405) lead-free solder joints in a typical BGA package is examined. Finite element (FE) analysis is employed along with published experimental data in establishing {{a thorough understanding of}} the mechanics and failure process of the solder joints. The accuracy of FE results for SJR is highly dependent on the solder constitutive behavior prescribed in the analysis. In the respect, unified inelastic strain theory (<b>Anand</b> <b>model)</b> is employed with model parameters extracted from series of published tensile tests data at different temperatures and strain rates. The model is refined further to ensure better predictive capability. The SJR of a BGA test package subjected to solder reflow process and temperature cycles is examined. The critical solder joint is identified at location near to the die corner. The highest stress and inelastic strain magnitudes are calculated at the component side of the solder/intermetallics compound (IMC) interface. Stress-strain hysteresis suggested that solder joint fatigue is primarily contributed by localized shear effect. Both strainand energy-based life prediction models have been developed for the accelerated reliability cycles. The failure process of solder/pad interface under applied monotonic loading is described. In this respect, the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) is evaluated within the FE framework to simulate the relatively brittle interface. Materials parameters for CZM are established based on published data of solder ball shear tests. It was found that localized cracking of the solder/pad interface in lead-free solder joints under shear test setup is initiated by tensile stress field due to shear tool clearance...|$|E

40|$|Lead-free solders such as SnAg and SnAgCu {{are used}} {{extensively}} as replacements of SnPb solders in microelectronics packaging. But these alloys have several drawbacks, such as poor wetting ability and formation {{of intermetallic compounds}} (IMC). Doping of rare earth element (RE) on SnAg alloys {{has been found to}} improve the wetting property, reduce IMCs and their growth, and refine the microstructure which results in improved mechanical properties of the solder. 	This study focuses on establishing the quantitative effects of RE doping on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of 96. 5 Sn 3. 5 Ag alloy. SnAg alloys with different amounts of Lanthanum were made. Specimens were cast under typical reflow conditions, and then aged at different temperatures for three different aging times. 	Quantitative microscopy was conducted on samples with different amounts of La doping. It was found that doping greatly reduces the grain size, as well as the size of the intermetallic particles Ag 3 Sn. However, the inter-particle spacing remains relatively unaffected by the La doping amount. 	Creep tests at various temperatures and strain rates were conducted. The results show that La doping increases creep resistance of the SnAg alloy by ~ 15 %. The creep test result can be fit into a modified microstructure dependent <b>Anand</b> <b>model.</b> A new constitutive law was also proposed to account for the hierarchal microstructure over multiple length scales. Specifically, at the sub micrometer scale, the SnAg eutectic region is treated as a particulate-reinforced composite with the Ag 3 Sn being the particle and Sn being the matrix. At the micrometer length scale, the solder alloys is treated as a two-phase composite with the Sn dendrite as the particle and the SnAg eutectic region as the matrix. Good agreement was found between the model predictions and the creep test results. 	Fatigue test was performed on bulk samples.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the influence of silver content on the creep behaviour of ternary tin-silver-copper (SAC) solder alloys. To this end, the creep behaviour of Sn 98. 5 Ag 1. 0 Cu 0. 5 (SAC 105) solder alloy was characterised and compared to that of Sn 96. 5 Ag 3. 0 Cu 0. 5 (SAC 305). Both solder alloys were tested at the joint-scale (~ 180 μm) using specially designed specimens on a shear testing facility developed at the Stokes Institute. With the use of new lead-free solder alloys in electronic manufacturing processes, there are two critical considerations: reliability and cost. The reliability of electronic assemblies is linked to the mechanical performance of solder joints. SAC 105 is more cost effective than SAC 305 due to its lower silver content than SAC 305, but it is known to exhibit inferior reliability to SAC 305 under thermal fatigue. An Anand viscoplastic constitutive model is developed in this thesis for thermally preconditioned SAC 105 from a series of creep tests under varying constant shear stresses (5 MPa to 15 MPa), constant shear strain rates (1 E- 6 (1 /s) to 1 E- 2 (1 /s)) and temperatures (20 ºC to 100 ºC), in order to increase the understanding of the creep behaviour of the alloy. An extensive comparison is made of the creep characteristics of SAC 105 solder alloy to that of SAC 305. The microstructure of both alloys is found to be a beta-Sn matrix with precipitates of Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5; SAC 305 is noted to feature more Ag 3 Sn precipitates and smaller Sn dendrites than SAC 105, which are the primary reasons for its superior creep resistance. In terms of practical usage, SAC 105 is found to be preferable for applications which may experience high strain rate stimuli (portable electronic devices) as the alloy undergoes plastic flow at lower stress levels than SAC 305, minimizing the risk of interfacial failures. SAC 305 is superior for applications which feature thermo-mechanical fatigue (desktop computers, for example, or servers) as it accumulates less strain than SAC 105. SAC 105 is found to be significantly less creep resistant than SAC 305. With the <b>Anand</b> <b>model</b> parameters developed here, however, practitioners using finite element modelling can determine the suitability of the lower cost SAC 105 alloy for applications which induce thermal fatigue...|$|E
40|$|As microelectronic package {{construction}} {{becomes more}} diverse and complex, {{the need for}} accurate, geometry-independent material constitutive and failure models increases. Evaluations of packages based on accelerated environmental tests (such as accelerated thermal cycling or power cycling) only provide package-dependent reliability information. In addition, extrapolations of such test data to life predictions under field conditions are often empirical. Besides geometry, accelerated environmental test data must account for microstructural factors such as alloy composition or isothermal aging condition, resulting in expensive experimental variation. In this work, displacement-controlled, creep, and fatigue lap shear tests are conducted on specially designed SnAgCu test specimens with microstructures representative {{to those found in}} commercial microelectronic packages. The data are used to develop constitutive and fatigue fracture material models capable of describing deformation and fracture behavior for the relevant temperature and strain rate ranges. Furthermore, insight is provided into the microstructural variation of solder joints and the subsequent effect on material behavior. These models are appropriate for application to packages of any geometrical construction. ^ The first focus of the thesis is on Pb-mixed SnAgCu solder alloys. During the transition from Pb-containing solders to Pb-free solders, joints composed of a mixture of SnPb and SnAgCu often result from either mixed assemblies or rework. Three alloys of 1, 5 and 20 weight percent Pb were selected so as to represent reasonable ranges of Pb contamination expected from different 63 Sn 37 Pb components mixed with Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu. Displacement-controlled (constant strain rate) and creep tests were performed at temperatures of 25 °C, 75 °C, and 125 °C using a double lap shear test setup that ensures a nearly homogeneous state of plastic strain at the joint interface. Rate-dependent constitutive models for Pb-contaminated SnAgCu solder alloys ranging from the traditional time-hardening creep model to the viscoplastic <b>Anand</b> <b>model</b> are described. ^ The second focus of the thesis is on fatigue damage accumulation in SnAgCu solder alloys. While, typical fatigue fracture models are empirical, recently a non-empirical model termed Maximum Entropy Fracture Model (MEFM) was proposed. MEFM is a thermodynamically consistent and information theory inspired damage accumulation theory for ductile solids. This model has been validated recently for Sn 3. 8 Ag 0. 7 Cu solder alloy, and uses a single damage accumulation parameter to relate the probability of fracture to accumulated entropic dissipation. Isothermal cycling fatigue tests on Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu and mixed SnPb/Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder alloys at varying strain rates and temperatures are conducted using a custom-built microscale mechanical tester capable of submicron displacement resolution. MEFM is applied here in conjunction with the Anand viscoplasticity model to predict the softening occurring over successive cycles as a result of damage accumulation. The damage accumulation parameters for Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu in different aged states are related to a microstructural parameter which quantitatively describes the state of coarsening. In addition, damage accumulation parameters for the three mixed solder alloys are reported. This approach allows for a non-empirical prediction of both constitutive and fracture behavior of packages of different geometries and different microstructural states under thermo-mechanical fatigue. ^ Approaches to solder joint reliability predictions from materials science and mechanics perspectives differ dramatically. Materials science methods identify key failure mechanisms, but most models cannot predict failure. In contrast, mechanics approaches often provide estimates of joint lifetime, but fail to provide insight into microstructural influences. This work attempts to connect the two fields by relating constitutive behavior and fatigue fracture models for different alloys and aging conditions to one or more microstructural parameters. ...|$|E

The assembled package on PCB was accelerated thermally cycled (ATC) using IEC standard 60749 - 25. It was found in the result of the simulation that IMC does not only impact solder joint reliability but also is a key factor of fatigue failure of solder joints. The IMC sandwiched between bond pad at chip side and solder bulk is the most critical and its interface with solder bulk is the most vulnerable site of damage.

40|$|In this paper, {{the issue}} of the {{identification}} of constitutive parameters of the <b>Anand</b> visco-plastic <b>model</b> is addressed using the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) in an infinitesimal deformation framework. By using VFM, one can take advantage of heterogeneous strain fields obtained by full-field experimental techniques, such as Digital Image Correlation (DIC). Since a wide range of strains and strain rates are sampled in a typical heterogeneous strain field, the number of experiments required to reliably estimate constitutive parameters, especially of rate-dependent materials, is significantly smaller than that needed if conventional experiments (such as uniaxial tension or pure shear configurations) leading to nominally homogeneous strain states were used. However, for such an approach to be successful, the test configuration and loading program should be such that all the constitutive parameters play a significant role (are ‘activated’) in the resulting strain fields. An analysis of the <b>Anand</b> constitutive <b>model</b> shows that 4 of the 8 parameters can only be found to within a multiplicative constant from full-field kinematic data. Therefore, one of these 4 constants is arbitrarily chosen and the activation of the remaining 7 material parameters is investigated by performing a series of one-element models. Detailed sensitivities of the VFM cost function to these material parameters are derived for a variety of normal stress to shear stress ratios and loading rates. Two main conclusions are drawn based on this one-element study: (i) the VFM cost function sensitivities to the material parameters do not vary significantly with loading ratios or rates, and (ii) 2 of the 7 material parameters are not activated for any of the loading ratios or rates considered. Based on the results of the finite-element study, a modified single lap-shear test configuration is designed to yield heterogeneous strains in the joint. Deformation data from a finite-element analysis of this experiment are used as inputs to a VFM routine to compute the Anand material parameters.

40|$|As {{the trends}} in green manufacturing, miniaturization, and {{enhanced}} functionality of electronics devices continue without {{any sign of}} slowing down, the reliability of lead free solder joints with diminishing size has {{become more and more}} a challenge to the design engineers and the electronics manufacturing industry. In order to predict the reliability of solder joints accurately, it is necessary to develop test techniques to test solder joints efficiently under conditions that are comparable to those in application environment. In this day and age when computer simulation has become an indispensable tool in many areas, it is also very important that suitable material models are available for solder materials so that virtual design tools can be used to predict device reliability performance accurately. In this work, the aim was to develop vibration and cyclic shear test methods and equipment, and to use computer modelling techniques in the analysis of lead free solder joints in microelectronics devices, and to develop an inverse Finite Element technique and experimental data to obtain constitutive laws for lead-free solder alloys. In the development of the vibration test machine, a prototype test machine that uses piezoelectric cell as actuators for the loading was modelled using the Finite Element Analysis method, and the behaviours of the test specimen which is similar to a BGA solder joint in dimensions was analysed. The static and dynamic response of the equipment was modelled and compared with experimental results. A novel multi-joint test specimen in which the solder deformation is similar to that in solder joints of BGAs that are under thermal loading was analysed so that test results can be interpreted and the specimens and loading conditions can be improved. The response of the joints reinforced the understanding that the interface of the solder and the copper or printed circuit board is the mostly likely region for crack growth and hence failure of the package. In the inverse Finite Element Analysis of solder joints, cyclic shear test data and Finite Element Analysis methods were used to improve the Anand's visco-plastic constitutive law for the SAC solder specimens under the test conditions. To reduce the possibility of spurious experimental data skewing the entire analysis, a technique was employed that uses limited experimental datasets in determining the material parameters. Simulation results using the new constitutive law showed significant improvement in accuracy. The main contribution of this research work to the manufacturing, testing and virtual design of solder joints can be summarised as follows: (1) A unique dedicated high cycle fatigue test equipment that is especially suited for testing very small solder joints and other surface mounted technologies under vibration conditions has been successfully designed, and manufactured. This is expected to enhance the capability of the industry in solder joint tests. (2) The behaviours of individual solder joints in a BGA-like multi-joint test specimen under isothermal cyclic loading condition have been characterised making the prediction of solder properties more accurate and efficient. (3) A novel procedure that is based on inverse Finite Element Analysis to obtain nonlinear creep parameters of, for example, <b>Anand’s</b> <b>model,</b> has been proposed and demonstrated.

40|$|At {{high-temperature}} {{operations of}} electronic control devices, Tin-Silver-Copper (SnAgCu) alloy solder joints used {{to assemble the}} component of the devices are functioning at homologous temperature above 0. 8. In such ambient temperatures, solder alloys have limited mechanical strength and will be sensitive to strain rate. The sensitivity of solder properties to creep/visco-plastic deformation increases the rate of accumulation of plastic damage in the alloy and decreases the number of cycles to failure (Nf) of the joints. Most untimely rupture of solder joints in high-temperature electronics (HTE) system usually culminates in colossal loss of resources and lives. Typical incidences are reported in recent automotive and aircraft crashes {{as well as the}} collapse of oil-well logging equipment. To increase the mean time to failure (MTTF) of solder joints in HTE, an in-depth understanding and accurate prediction of the response of solder joints to thermally induced plastic strain damage is crucial. This study concerns the prediction of the reliability of lead-free solder joints in a flip chip (FC) model FC 48 D 6. 3 C 457 which is mounted on a substrate and the assembly subjected to high-temperature excursions. The research investigates the effect of the high-temperature operations on reliability of the joints. In addition, the investigation examines the impact of control factors (component stand-off height (CSH), inter-metallic compound (IMC) thickness, number of thermal cycle and solder volume) on Nf of the joints. A model developed {{in the course of this}} investigation was employed to create the assembly solder joints architecture.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{fundamental}} understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern indium attach degradation in applications requiring repeated excursions and extended long time dwells at temperatures below - 55 oC. This work was prompted by original effort of developing low temperature SiGe BiCMOS modules for Martine and Lunar exploration. Current exploration vehicles use a "warm electronic box (WEB) " to maintain the electronics in an earth-like temperature environment. This results in increasing system complexity and weight. Warm boxes also consume power and are not practical for the ~ 330 hour lunar night. Furthermore, intelligent nodes in a distributed system must operate in an ambient environment to monitor the health and performance of a space craft or rover, to sense the environment for scientific exploration and {{to act on the}} environment, such as to use a drill to obtain a soil sample for analysis. Nevertheless, the reliability and life span of electronic devices systems without WEB can be significantly degraded by thermal fatigue damage as a result of wide daily temperature swings during their space exploration, when cryogenic temperatures (below - 55 oC) can be encountered. Attachment layer, such as die attach, solder joint and substrate attach are most inclined to fatigue damage due to the global CTE mismatch between packaging materials and their material properties at extreme cold temperatures. With the aim of enhancing the reliability of cryogenic electronic package, indium was selected as the attachment material due to its excellent wetting capability, greater ductility and high electrical conductivity, with respect to standard PbSn solders at cryogenic temperatures. However, information on the reliability of indium attach is sparse and only concerns isothermal fatigue conditions at room temperature. No investigation has been reported on its thermal fatigue ranging from cryogenic temperature to high homologous temperatures (above room temperature), or on its isothermal fatigue behavior at cryogenic temperatures, or of the effect of microstructure evolution, in terms of intermetallics, under isothermal fatigue conditions on joint lifetime. Current lack of these fundamental understanding inhibits the assessment of the reliability of indium attach. In this thesis, an efficient and systematic assessment was conducted to evaluate the reliability of indium attach.

Hence, in this research multiscale modeling has been performed to capture several important phenomena which affect the material property changes and microstructure evolution of tungsten (W) and SiC during irradiation and to predict the failure limit of the materials under irradiation correctly. ^ In the present study, it is hypothesized that between fractal dimension and strength of irradiated materials can be uniquely determined for a given equilibrated structure after irradiation-induced impact. If the correlation of fractal dimension with strength of irradiated materials can be established, such relationship can be extended to possibly other irradiated microstructures. In this sense, use of fractal dimension is pursued in the present work to establish (1) the correlation of fractal dimension and the change of atomic configuration features such as type of GB and presence of defects; (2) the correlation of fractal dimension and strength of irradiated materials. Fractal dimension based approach is used to link relevant length scale for multiscale simulation. Physical mechanism obtained from lower length scale can be passed to higher length scale using fractal dimension. ^ Among the challenges of material selection for nuclear fusion and advanced nuclear fission power plant, the strength deterioration due to the helium (He) point defects that occur during irradiation and high level of irradiation damage have been the main issues in nuclear material research. The effect of He point defects on peak tensile strength of W grain boundaries (GBs) {{and the effect of}} radiation energy on tensile strength of SiC are investigated using ab initio simulations framework based on Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD). A fractal dimension based approach is employed to characterize the different GB geometries and atomic configurations of the disordered materials. A linear relationship between structural fractal dimension and tensile strength is observed in all examined GBs. Based on observed correlations, an empirical relation is developed to predict the peak tensile strength of W and SiC GBs. ^ The proposed GB strength relation was used for higher length scale simulation such as the phase-filed modeling by taking into account of interfacial energy in terms of fractal dimension. The evolution of voids in W polycrystalline under irradiation were studied using the phase-field modeling, including nucleation and growth of voids and sink efficiency for vacancy annihilation in vicinity of GB. Finally, finite element (FE) simulations have been performed using the <b>Anand</b> viscoplastic <b>model</b> to investigate the deformation behaviors and the yield failure limit of W microstructures at high temperature under the influence of irradiation. The FE analyses suggest that the yield strength of irradiated W microstructure is directly correlated with temperature and irradiation dose. Based on the simulation results, the empirical equation to predict yield strength as a function of temperature and irradiation dose was proposed. ...|$|R
