Three parametric synthesis systems are discussed: our traditional rule based <b>system,</b> a speaker <b>adapted</b> <b>system,</b> and finally a gesture system. The gesture system is a further development of the <b>adapted</b> <b>system</b> in that it includes concatenated formant gestures from a data-driven unit library. The systems are evaluated technically, comparing the formant tracks with an analysed test corpus. The gesture system results in a 25 % error reduction in the formant frequencies due to {{the inclusion of the}} stored gestures. Finally, a perceptual evaluation shows a clear advantage in naturalness for the gesture system compared to both the traditional system and the speaker <b>adapted</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

The data analysis and the research findings indicated that the <b>adapted</b> <b>system</b> for Affect worked well for both the Vietnamese and English language data.

This feature must cope with some fundamental requirements such as: ffl {{keeping up with}} the evolution and diversity of emerging hardware platforms, yet taking into account low-level details; ffl increasing the generality of system services, by integrating new features like quality of service and security, while keeping a good level of performance; ffl allowing the integration of new, application-level or middle-ware, software components, as a ground for building complete computing systems. In spite of the striving need for adaptability in operating systems, the means actually used to this end are rather ad hoc.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the nervous mechanisms mediating the withdrawal response of Littorina littorea in order to establish aspects of the functional organization of its nervous system. Observations of the withdrawal response, elicited by tactile stimulation of the tentacles and leading to partial withdrawal of the animal into its shell, revealed that the response consisted of a fast contractile phase followed by a prolonged relaxation and extension phase, without a period of prolonged contraction. The effects of tactile stimulation on isolated tentacles were determined and the roles of the tentacle and cerebral ganglia in mediating tentacle responses were established. Four classes of response, corresponding to four types of mechanosensory neurones, were recorded from the tentacle nerves. Two morphologically separate pathways were traced from the right tentacle between the paired cerebral, pleural and pedal ganglia to a nerve shown to innervate the columellar muscle and to originate from the left pleural ganglion. It was shown that the two pathways were excited by different classes of tentacle response. A comparison of 'normal' contractions of the columella muscle with those induced by either of the two pathways showed that both pathways initiated apparently normal muscle contractions. These consisted of a rapid contractile phase followed by a prolonged relaxation phase of similar character to that of the withdrawal response of the intact animal. An explanation of the double system of pathways has been suggested after consideration of the properties of the sensory neurones found in the tentacles. One pathway is thought to function both as a high threshold slowly <b>adapting</b> <b>system</b> and also as a low threshold system, while the other functions as a high threshold rapidly <b>adapting</b> <b>system.</b> The nerves, ganglia, tentacles and columellar muscle were examined histologically and some limited studies have been made of spontaneous central activity and conduction velocity. <p...|$|E

Dynamic adaptability has been studied in other system areas as well and system management through policies has crystallized itself as a very prominent solution in system and network administration.

Previous work on the APPEL policy language has been aimed at dynamically <b>adapting</b> <b>system</b> behaviour to satisfy end-user demands and – as part of STPOWLA – APPEL was used to adapt workflow instances at runtime.

An orthogonal {{approach is to}} probe for 'response signatures' that identify specific circuit motifs. For example, bistability, hysteresis, or irreversibility are used to detect positive feedback loops. For <b>adapting</b> <b>systems,</b> such signatures are not known. Only two circuit motifs generate adaptation: negative feedback loops (NFLs) and incoherent feed-forward loops (IFFLs). On the basis of computational testing and mathematical proofs, we propose differential signatures: in response to oscillatory stimulation, NFLs but not IFFLs show refractory-period stabilization (robustness to changes in stimulus duration) or period skipping. Applying this approach to yeast, we identified the circuit dominating cell cycle timing. In Caenorhabditis elegans AWA neurons, which are crucial for chemotaxis, we uncovered a Ca 2 + NFL leading to adaptation that {{would be difficult to}} find by other means.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{approach}} to the design of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) systems. One of ubicomp's design ideals is systems that adapt so as to maintain contextual fit. However, the contexts and uses of ubicomp systems are varied and changing, which makes achieving this ideal challenging [...] -especially when using traditional design approaches grounded in static definitions of types or classes, i. e. in static computational structures. Here we outline an alternative approach to system design, a 'vision' for ubiquitous computing, which relies on dynamically coupling together several complementary representations of class. One of these is a population of instances, each of which may differ in its structure, context and use. We offer examples of tools and analyses that set these representations within an ongoing socio-technical process that, we propose, offers significant potential for satisfying ubicomp's requirement for <b>adapting</b> <b>system</b> structure so as to sustain contextual fit...|$|E

In a wireless world, people move around, meet others and experience places and situations.

Social navigation systems rely on recording and representing people’s activity, and computational representation is affected by seams.
