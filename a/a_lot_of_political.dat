Scheff explained that [...] "the record label wasn't thrilled with the fact that they weren't involved ... during the making of it, plus <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> stuff was going on, where Warner Bros. was going through a big change, and letting some of their top executives go." ...|$|E

2500|$|The courage {{needed to}} develop these schemes {{required}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> will, and this would sometimes falter. By failing to identify cheaper alternatives when the financial case weakened, [...] "do-nothing" [...] often became the default action. For example, the extensive plans to develop a series of orbital and distribution roads into central London resulted {{in the construction of}} the A40(M) Westway, the M41 cross route and A102(M) Blackwall tunnel. However, the wide impact of these schemes raised such controversy during the 1970s that many associated road schemes soon ran into concerted opposition. After the 1973 oil crisis, those remaining schemes fell into limbo, casting a planning blight over the affected areas for a decade or more until they were finally laid to rest. [...] The recognition of environmental issues was also less well understood in the 1960s; the report's considerations were more for the human environment, rather than the natural issues which have tended to confound some subsequent road proposals.|$|E

2500|$|... 1988, {{the last}} ever Grand Prix of the turbo era, saw Alain Prost win his seventh {{race of the}} season from McLaren {{teammate}} and newly crowned World Champion Ayrton Senna with outgoing champion Nelson Piquet third for Lotus, giving Honda turbo's all three podium positions. The race was also the 15th win and 15th pole in 16 races in a season of total dominance for McLaren-Honda, a domination not seen before or since in Formula One. 1989 {{was hit by a}} deluge of rain and the drivers, notably Prost, {{who did not want to}} start the race because of the very wet conditions, particularly on the Brabham straight. This event came after controversial events 2 weeks before at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, where Prost crashed into his hated teammate Senna, and Senna got going again and finished 1st on the road but after <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> ramifications, he was disqualified for cutting the chicane before the pit straight at Suzuka; the repercussions of which dawned on the race. McLaren decided to appeal Senna's disqualification; so Senna still had a chance of winning the championship. The race was delayed for sometime and there were discussions about whether the race should be started. Senna qualified on pole position, and had every intention of starting the race. The circuit was still being hammered by rain and was covered by water, but the drivers, including Prost relented and they started. But an unconvinced Prost came in after one lap and withdrew; and Senna- who was in an awful mental state, immediately began driving as fast as he could. By the end of the first lap, due to Pierluigi Martini's slow Minardi holding up the two faster Williams cars of Belgian Thierry Boutsen and Italian Riccardo Patrese, Senna was an astonishing nine seconds ahead of Martini; the Williams cars soon passed Martini but by the end of the third lap, Senna was 23 seconds ahead of second-placed Boutsen. But even with such a huge lead which extended even further, Senna continued to push very hard- taking very daring chances even for himself; the psychological dominance F1 had exuded over the Brazilian meant that he was known to take chances that most other drivers would not. But going down the Brabham straight on lap 13, Senna came up behind Briton Martin Brundle's Brabham-Judd, and Brundle decided to move over to let Senna pass. But Senna was blinded by thick spray; and the Brazilian did not let up and then he hit the back of Brundle's car and it tore off his front left wheel and suspension, so the Brazilian had to retire; effectively handing Prost his third Drivers' Championship; McLaren's appeal had not been decided yet; and it was not only overturned but Senna received a $100,000 fine and a six-month ban, both of which were rescinded. Boutsen won the race in the unimproved conditions, the race was called after it reached the two-hour time limit.|$|E

The coastal plain provides <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> good land for settlement, being located near the coast for food as well as having the main Government road passing through the district. Also located within the district is Faleolo International Airport, the main airport within Samoa. The district although having no industrial business or enterprises, contains the usual family operated stores as well as one petrol station in Fasitoouta. The mountain inland is Mt Tafua Upolu, with a number of foothills at its base. The lagoon s around the entire Aana district is encompassed by the great reef that surrounds the entire island of Upolu. The soil is mostly volcanic as the past testifies, many of the old German plantation lands are located within Aana, as the soil is fertile.|$|R

50|$|In 1918, all Chinese officers, {{including}} Khouw, {{were relieved}} of their office {{as part of}} the government's review {{of the role of the}} Chinese officership in the colonial administration. Many community activists had criticised the system of governance by Chinese officers, or 'Indirect Rule', as an archaic relic of feudalism. Khouw, however, remained in the government's good books, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1920. Finally, in 1927, Khouw − but not the other Chinese officers − was restored to the Chinese Mayoralty of Batavia, probably thanks to the antiquity and, therefore, the historic and symbolic value of the institution Khouw represented. By then, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> and legal powers of the Chinese Mayoralty had devolved upon the colonial civil service.

The author notes the commonality of the ideological programmes of Grazhdanin and the journals Vremia (Time) and Epokha (The Epoch) published by the Dostoyevsky brothers. As an editor, Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky made some amendments and clarifi cations to the conception of Grazhdanin. He included the studies of the issues of church, everyday public and family life of Russia, district council (zemstvo), peasant world and new phenomena in literature into the blueprint of the journal. This blueprint was accomplished by Dostoyevsky in A Writer’s Diary that became the personal Diary of The Citizen and editorial diary of the weekly journal Grazhdanin. In feuilletons and articles, which modifi ed this column into a new genre of Dostoyevsky, he elucidated the standpoints of the journal regarding <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> social, <b>political</b> and state issues of those times...|$|R

The ECB, thus the complaint, cannot do all the heavy lifting in the European economy. Governments and workers have to do their bit by accepting painful but necessary constraints. Banks are, supposedly, impossible to control in this sense, since they can relocate if regulated too tightly — which probably also explains why so few bankers (none, in fact) have ended up behind bars despite rather spectacularly bad behaviour: being too strict with them would undermine the competitiveness of the financial sector...|$|R
