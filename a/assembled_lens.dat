In order to simultaneously increase robustness and reduce manufacturing cost, desensitization strategies can be applied. Tolerance effects have been included into the optimization function (merit function) by some lens designers to find insensitive designs 1 - 5 and frequently compensators are employed to further improve the performance of <b>assembled</b> <b>lenses.</b> Compensators are limited to {{a small number of}} system parameters, but selective assembly of components can extend the number of parameters available for compensation. It can be employed to reduce tolerance effects of disturbed parameters by finding the best matches out of a set of components. The potential of using tolerance desensitization in conjunction with selective assembly to reduce asymmetric errors in imaging optical systems is investigated. A focus is given on strategies t o find tolerance insensitive design forms under the presence of selective assembly compensators and the selection of suitable parameters for desensitization and measurement...|$|R

40|$|Tolerancing {{has long}} been {{identified}} as a crucial part in the development of optical systems. It aims at finding the best balance between quality and cost as tolerances closely tie together manufacturing expenses and performance. Tolerance effects have been included into the optimization function (merit function) by some lens designers to find insensitive designs 1 - 5 and frequently compensators are employed to further improve the performance of <b>assembled</b> <b>lenses.</b> Compensators are limited to a small number of system parameters, but selective assembly of components can extend the number of parameters available for compensation. It can be employed to reduce tolerance effects of disturbed parameters by finding the best matches out of a set of components. In this work we discuss how desensitization and selective assembly can be combined to loosen tolerances and increase as-built performance. The investigations concentrate on tolerance insensitive design forms under the presence of selective assembly compensators. In contrast to desensitizing a given lens or introducing new design means we focus on introducing new assembly strategies into the design procedure and investigate how using selective assembly as a compensator while desensitizing the remaining design parameters can lead to even less sensitive designs...|$|R

40|$|Consensus {{scholarship}} {{notes that}} the ethics described in the Confucian textual corpus focuses its attention primarily on concrete relationships, specific roles, and reciprocal duties. This has occasioned concern about whether Confucian ethics can offer adequate moral guidelines for interactions between people who have enjoyed no prior contact. In response, this dissertation suggests that early Confucianism does guide interactions with strangers, but that this guidance {{is to be found}} less in its ethical concepts or moral precepts than in its embodied ritual practices. To substantiate this claim, I carefully apply theories drawn from the fields of cognitive science, cognitive philosophy, American pragmatism, and ritual theory to several early Confucian texts: the Analects, Mencius, Xunzi, and the ritual manuals of the Liji and the Yili. From pragmatism and cognitive philosophy, I <b>assemble</b> <b>lenses</b> of conceptual and pre-conceptual meaning and use them {{to examine the effects of}} ritual practice on the creation of group boundaries and the generation of solidarity. In so doing, I reveal that the solidarity generated by embodied practice and physical co-presence shapes the boundaries and structure of early Confucian groups as much as concepts or shared values. I further outline the neural and psychological processes by which the physicality of Confucian ritual practice creates pre-conceptual solidarity, then highlight the ways that solidarity is framed and given a meaningful direction by the varied Confucian exemplars. Ultimately, I demonstrate that mutual engagement in ritual practice allows strangers to bond quickly, without the benefit of prior relationship or shared proposition. This, I argue, is the heart of the Confucian treatment of strangers. Ritual practice simultaneously creates a relationship between new contacts and energizes that relationship with strong, pre-conceptually-generated solidarity. This dissertation also analyzes a number of related topics, including the relationship between ritual practice and group boundaries and the influence of the body upon concepts and categorization. In its broadest goals, this study offers insight into the rich character of early Confucian physicality, suggests novel guidelines for the analysis of contemporary Confucianism, and reflects possible ways in which solidarity might be formed between members of groups with different value orientations...|$|R
5000|$|Ordinary lenses can be {{used for}} macro {{photography}} by using a [...] "reversing ring." [...] This ring attaches to the filter thread on the front of a lens and makes it possible to attach the lens in reverse. Excellent quality results up to 4x life-size magnification are possible. For cameras with all-electronic communications between the lens and the camera body specialty reversing rings are available which preserve these communications. When used with extension tubes or bellows, a highly versatile, true macro (greater than life size) system can be <b>assembled.</b> Since non-macro <b>lenses</b> are optimized for small reproduction ratios, reversing the lens allows it to be used for reciprocally high ratios.|$|R

We give the dependences of displacement value of the centers of curvature for the lens working surfaces from the base frame axis on the primary technological errors of interfaced details. It is shown that some errors of form and position of the frame surfaces produce an effect not on {{the accuracy of the}} lenses centering in the frame, but on the accuracy control centering. That causes displacement of the lens working surfaces centers when <b>assembling</b> the <b>lens</b> unit into the objective body. A functional diagram of the station for automated gluing and centering of lenses in the frames is shown; the accuracy of its work is considered. We present the ways of accuracy improvement of lenses centering in the frames carried out on this station, thanks to the centering along not one, but two working surfaces of the lens. The design of composite frames has been developed for performing exact centering of lenses at assembly for the various options of their deployment in the frames. Modernization of technological process for the lens automated alignment has been performed to implement centering along both working surfaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{retrieve}} relevant information {{is at the}} heart of every aspect of research and development in the life sciences industry. Information is often distributed across multiple systems and recorded in a way that makes it difficult to piece together the complete picture. Differences in data formats, naming schemes and network proto-cols amongst information sources, both public and private, must be overcome, and user interfaces not only need to be able to tap into these diverse information sources but must also assist users in filtering out extraneous informa-tion and highlighting the key relationships hidden within an aggregated set of information. The Semantic Web community has made great strides in proposing solutions to these problems, and many efforts are underway to apply Semantic Web techniques to the problem of information retrieval in the life sciences space. This article gives an overview of the principles underlying a Semantic Web-enabled information retrieval system: creating a unified abstraction for knowledge using the RDF semantic network model; designing semantic lenses that extract contex-tually relevant subsets of information; and <b>assembling</b> semantic <b>lenses</b> into powerful information displays.

40|$|Electrically tunable lenses are {{conceived}} as deformable adaptive optical components {{able to change}} focus without motor-controlled translations of stiff lenses. In order to achieve large tuning ranges, large deformations are needed. This requires new technologies for the actuation of highly stretchable lenses. This paper presents a configuration to obtain compact tunable lenses entirely made of soft solid matter (elastomers). This was achieved by combining the advantages of dielectric elastomer actuation (DEA) with a design inspired by the accommodation of reptiles and birds. An annular DEA was used to radially deform a central solid-body lens. Using an acrylic elastomer membrane, a silicone lens and a simple fabrication method, we <b>assembled</b> a tunable <b>lens</b> capable of focal length variations up to 55 %, driven by an actuator four {{times larger than the}} lens. As compared to DEA-based liquid lenses, the novel architecture halves the required driving voltages, simplifies the fabrication process and allows for a higher versatility in design. These new lenses might find application in systems requiring large variations of focus with low power consumption, silent operation, low weight, shock tolerance, minimized axial encumbrance and minimized changes of performance against vibrations and variations in temperature...|$|R
