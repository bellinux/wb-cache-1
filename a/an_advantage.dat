5|$|More {{offspring}} {{are produced}} than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> over their competitors {{are more likely}} to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer <b>an</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} albinistic prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) found that {{albinism}} in this species conferred <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> for the males {{compared to the}} wild-type; albino males had higher mount frequencies than wild-type males. In addition, the albinos had greater differential fertilizing capacity.|$|E

25|$|Poll numbers varied greatly the {{day before}} the {{election}} and through the election season. This can be attributed to varying polling methods, demographics, and sample sizes between pollsters, amongst other things. Final polls ranged from <b>an</b> 11% <b>advantage</b> for Obama to only <b>a</b> 2% <b>advantage.</b> The most accurate final poll numbers were from Fox News, Ipsos/McClatchy, and CNN/Opinion Research which predicted <b>a</b> 7% <b>advantage</b> for Obama.

40|$|Multinational {{corporations}} are often faced with regionally varying market conditions, local environments and demand preferences. This paper presents the lead markets concept of developing global innovation that {{takes advantage of}} the lead market phenomenon. A lead market is a regional market that is first to adopt global innovation designs. A system of five lead factors explains the lead role of a market: <b>a</b> demand <b>advantage,</b> <b>a</b> price <b>advantage,</b> <b>an</b> export <b>advantage,</b> <b>a</b> transfer <b>advantage</b> and <b>a</b> market structure <b>advantage.</b> The system of lead market factors is then evaluated in a detailed case study of the cellular mobile telephone industry. It is suggested that companies can harness lead markets for the development of global innovations. By developing and refining innovations in close interaction with the local environment of a lead market, a company can focus on a narrow range of preferences and feedback, lowering the risk of being locked into idiosyncratic environments, and generate true global innovations.

5|$|Damascus {{subsequently}} {{became the}} capital of the Ummayad Caliphate and all of the surplus revenue of the Ummayad Caliphate's provinces were forwarded to the treasury of Damascus.

5|$|Federer is {{also noted}} for his cool {{demeanour}} and emotional {{control on the}} court.

40|$|Abstract: There is {{a belief}} that the payoffs from {{investments}} in IT are difficult to recognize, and therefore <b>a</b> sustained competitive <b>advantage</b> from <b>an</b> IT-enabled strategy is difficult to distinguish from <b>a</b> temporary competitive <b>advantage.</b> We develop <b>a</b> model to test whether market participants are able to recognize <b>a</b> sustained competitive <b>advantage</b> due to <b>an</b> IT-enabled strategy, and test the model empirically. We find that <b>a</b> competitive <b>advantage</b> due to <b>an</b> IT-enabled strategy is discernable by market participants, and as apparent as <b>a</b> competitive <b>advantage</b> obtained through other means...|$|R

5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide <b>an</b> <b>advantage,</b> the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E
5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. <b>An</b> <b>advantage</b> of inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E

In their estimate they included the 110th and 111th Brigades of the HVO from Usora and Žepče, as well as three brigades of the ARBiH from Gradačac, Maglaj and Tešanj. Although these units {{were not involved in}} the fighting in Posavina, they tied a part of the VRS forces on their own positions. Besides manpower, the VRS also held <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> in armaments. While the Croat forces had 47 combat vehicles, 35 of which were tanks (9 T-34s, 22 T-55s and 4 M-84s), the VRS had 163 combat vehicles, including three PT-76s, 18 T-34s, 71 T-55s and 24 M-84s.

5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} block the ball with either their hands or arms.

5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field.

A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E
