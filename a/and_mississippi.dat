5|$|McClellan {{resigned}} {{his commission}} January 16, 1857, and, capitalizing on {{his experience with}} railroad assessment, became chief engineer {{and vice president of}} the Illinois Central Railroad, and then president of the Ohio <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Railroad in 1860. He performed well in both jobs, expanding the Illinois Central toward New Orleans and helping the Ohio <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> recover from the Panic of 1857. Despite his successes and lucrative salary ($10,000 per year), he was frustrated with civilian employment and continued to study classical military strategy assiduously. During the Utah War against the Mormons, he considered rejoining the Army. He also considered service as a filibuster in support of Benito Juárez in Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Extensive European {{exploration}} {{near the}} confluence of the Missouri <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> rivers began nearly a century before the city was officially founded.

5|$|The {{development}} of sawmills and flour mills at the falls spurred demand for railroad service to Minneapolis. In 1868, Minneapolis was only {{served by a}} spur from St. Paul, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, and by the fledgling St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Minneapolis millers found that railroads based in Milwaukee and Chicago were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from Minneapolis mills. In response, the owners of several Minneapolis mills chartered the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway, which would connect the Lake Superior <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Railroad through Minneapolis to the Iowa border. Meanwhile, Jay Cooke {{took control of the}} St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1871 with the goal of aggregating it into the Northern Pacific Railway. Bad economic conditions caused the Panic of 1873, and the Northern Pacific had to relinquish control of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and the Lake Superior <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic coastal impacts was a {{moderate}} tornado outbreak spawned by the cyclone's outer bands. The event spanned August26–31, 2005, with 57tornadoes touching down across 8states. One person died and numerous communities suffered damage of varying degrees from central Mississippi to Pennsylvania, with Georgia sustaining record monetary damage {{for the month}} of August. Due to extreme devastation in coastal areas of Louisiana <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> multiple tornadoes may have been overlooked—overshadowed by the effects of storm surge and large-scale wind—and thus {{the full extent of the}} hurricane's tornado outbreak is uncertain. Furthermore, an indeterminate number of waterspouts likely formed throughout the life cycle of Katrina.|$|E

5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> were settled by planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy {{with the use of}} slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E
5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{associated}} convective activity was east {{of the center of}} circulation, Louisiana <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> received minimal damage. However, on Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced the evacuation of residents. Florida received high wind gusts, heavy rainfall, and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers. 20,000homes in the state lost electricity. The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was extensive, and about 335 structures were damaged by the flooding. The storm caused a total of about $20million (2002USD; $23.96million 2008USD) in damage.|$|E

Including relief funds to Puerto Rico <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> associated with Georges, {{a total of}} $14,150,532 insurance claims was paid for by FEMA.

5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position {{on the issues that}} were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement.

On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the date}} of first {{settlement}} in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> rivers. The Ojibwe made {{some of the first}} maps on birch bark, which helped fur traders navigate the waterways of the area.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} had {{weakened}} to a depression when it moved inland, Cindy's effects were still significant across the final portion of its track. The day after its landfall in southeastern Louisiana, Tropical Depression Cindy reached central Alabama. There its rainbands produced heavy rainfall and eight tornadoes. Damage was mostly limited to trees and powerlines, but an F1 tornado in Macon county injured one man, destroyed an auto-repair shop, and damaged several nearby cars. About 35,000 residences in Alabama and 7,000 in both Florida <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi</b> were left without power following the storm.|$|E

5|$|Harrya chromapes is an ectomycorrhizal species, and its fruit bodies grow singly to {{scattered}} on soil.

It extends west to Michigan <b>and</b> <b>Mississippi.</b> The fruit season extends from late spring to late summer. In Costa Rica, where the species associates with oak, {{it has been}} recorded from the Cordillera Talamanca, the Poás and Irazu Volcano. It is also in Guatemala.
