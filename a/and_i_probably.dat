25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Bowie made {{numerous}} {{references to}} religions {{and to his}} evolving spirituality. Beginning in 1967, he showed an interest in Buddhism; after a few months' study at Tibet House in London, he was told by a Lama, [...] "You don't want to be Buddhist.... You should follow music". By 1975 Bowie admitted, [...] "I felt totally, absolutely alone. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God".|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{has said}} of her time with Automatic Dlamini: [...] "I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy {{to learn how to}} play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was {{listening}} to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people." [...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> did learn that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} in 2013 {{of an early}} draft of one of Sassoon's best-known anti-war poems had biographers saying they would rewrite portions of their work about the poet. In the poem, 'Atrocities,' which concerned the killing of German prisoners by their British counterparts, the early draft shows that some lines were cut and others watered down. The poet's publisher was nervous about publishing the poem, and held it for publication in an expurgated version at a later date. Said Sassoon biographer Jean Moorcroft Wilson on learning {{of the discovery of}} the early draft: [...] "This is very exciting material. I want to rewrite my biography <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> shall be able to get some of it in. It's a treasure trove." ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR WHITNEY:--I now {{expect to}} go to Chicago on the 15th, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> shall remain there or thereabouts for about two weeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it don't matter," [...] she decided. [...] "He's {{just one}} o' 'Rast's politicians, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> treated the fellow {{better than he}} deserved." ...|$|E
60|$|Then things took a turn, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>probably</b> {{not have}} to shovel coal for a living {{for some time to}} come, {{although}} I have done it, and could do it again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is confoundedly hard on {{an unfortunate}} and {{innocent}} man! This {{is a situation}} which will require considerable explaining, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>probably</b> never have an opportunity for attempting it," [...] he muttered.|$|R
60|$|Now, Mr. Hardinge {{was one of}} {{the last}} men in the world to suspect evil. He looked surprised, therefore, at my remark, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>probably</b> not much out of the way, in fancying that he looked displeased.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{rather go}} now, while I'm wet," [...] Vane answered. [...] "We came {{straight}} on {{as soon as}} we landed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> shouldn't feel like turning out again when I'd had a meal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing doing," [...] {{the negro}} {{declared}} shortly. [...] "Keys {{as important as}} this ain't lost. If I part with it, I get the chuck, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> get into the same mess as the others. If I keep it--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let that pass," [...] Seaman said. [...] "I am not of {{your order}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> do not {{understand}} the etiquette of these matters. I simply look upon you as a culprit in the eyes of our master, and I feel that he has a right to demand from you {{much in the way of}} personal sacrifice." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} a great exaggeration {{to say that this is}} always the feeling of the mother in respect to her children. I only mean that this is sometimes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> might <b>probably</b> say very often, the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have. I {{owe it to}} my husband's generosity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>probably</b> want it very soon. Do {{you suppose}} that, while Charley is crushed with anxiety and working from dawn to dusk, I would send Jimmy a penny?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 23: The first {{plate for}} the Bible of Amiens, curiously enough, {{failed in the}} engraving; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>probably</b> have to etch it myself. It will be issued with the fourth, in the {{full-size}} edition of the fourth chapter.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There at {{any rate}} you are wrong. Their {{marriage}} laws {{are not the same}} as ours, though how they may differ you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> do not accurately know. And they may be altered at any time as they may please. Let the laws be what they will, it is quite possible, after what you have told me, that they may bring up evidence which you would find it very difficult to refute. I don't think it will be so. If I did I should use all my influence to remove my sister at once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lawful issue," [...] added Paul, {{reddening}} to the temples, [...] "I {{should have}} added--Mrs. Ducie, {{who was married}} to the younger son of an English nobleman, claimed and obtained the rank. My pretension would have left the peerage in abeyance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> owe some little of the opposition I found, to that circumstance. But, after Ducie's generous conduct, I could not hesitate about joining in the application to the crown that, by its decision, the abeyance might be determined in favour {{of the person who}} was in possession; and Lady Dunluce is now quietly confirmed in her claim." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young girl}} and the wife {{transferred}} their gaze to me, with an intensified appeal in it. The man looked away with a certain shame- -the shame {{of a man who}} feels that his wife has made him make an ass of himself. I tried to treat his question, by {{the quantity and quality of}} my answer, as one of the most natural things in the world; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> deceived them all by this effort, though I am sure that I was most truthful and just concerning the claims of the different hotels to be the centre of excitement. I thought I had earned the right to ask at the end, [...] "Are you stopping at the Grand Union?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said so, squire, at {{the time}} he was smarting with the pain of a severe bite; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think <b>probably</b> he meant no more than a man who, under the same circumstances, would say, 'Confound the dog!' or even a {{stronger}} oath." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hamlin said {{afterwards}} {{that winning}} his first road course race [...] "means a lot. I can’t {{tell you how}} disappointed I was we didn’t win the first one. I just tried the best <b>I</b> could <b>and</b> overshot the corner <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn’t {{want to do it}} this time <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> under drove <b>and</b> let those guys be a little closer than I should’ve." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, when Leno {{departed}} from The Tonight Show {{a second time}} {{to make way for}} Jimmy Fallon, he said [...] "It's not my decision <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> would have stayed if we didn't have an extremely qualified, young guy ready to jump in." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{month of}} December has been notable {{in my life}} as follows: [...] Dec. 1809.—Born. 1827.—Left Eton. 1831.—Classes at Oxford. [...] 1832.—Elected to parliament. 1838.—Work on Church and State [...] published. 1834.—Took office as lord of the treasury. [...] 1845.—Secretary of state. 1852.—Chancellor of exchequer. [...] 1868.—First lord. Rather a {{frivolous}} enumeration. Yet it would not [...] be so if the love of symmetry were carried with a [...] well-proportioned earnestness and firmness into the higher parts [...] of life. I feel {{like a man with}} a burden under which he must fall [...] and be crushed if he looks to the right or left or fails from any [...] cause to concentrate mind and muscle upon his progress step by [...] step. This absorption, this excess, this constant ἄγαν is the [...] fault of political life with its insatiable demands, which do not [...] leave the smallest stock of moral energy unexhausted and available [...] for other purposes.... Swimming for his life, a man does not see [...] much of the country through which the river winds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> [...] know little of these years through which I busily work and [...] live.... It has been a special joy of this December that our son [...] Stephen is given to the church, “whose shoe latchet I am not [...] worthy to unloose.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Strictly {{speaking}} I {{never had}} a brother Henry, and yet I cannot say that Henry was an impostor. He came into existence in a curious way, and I can think of him now without malice as a child of smoke. The first I heard of Henry was at Pettigrew's house, which is in a London suburb, so conveniently situated that I can go there and back in one day. I was testing some new Cabanas, I remember, when Pettigrew remarked {{that he had been}} lunching with a man who knew my brother Henry. Not having any brother but Alexander, I felt that Pettigrew had mistaken the name. [...] "Oh, no," [...] Pettigrew said; [...] "he spoke of Alexander too." [...] Even this did not convince me, and I asked my host for his friend's name. Scudamour {{was the name of the}} man, and he had met my brothers Alexander and Henry years before in Paris. Then I remembered Scudamour, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> frowned, for I myself was my own brother Henry. I distinctly recalled Scudamour meeting Alexander and me in Paris, and calling me Henry, though my name begins with a J. I explained the mistake to Pettigrew, and here, for the time being, the matter rested. However, I had by no means heard the last of Henry.|$|E
60|$|The Miss Guests saw an {{alleviation}} to {{the sorrow}} of witnessing a folly in their Rector; at least their brother would be safe; and {{their knowledge of}} Stephen's tenacity was a constant ground of alarm to them, lest he should come back and marry Maggie. They were not among those who disbelieved their brother's letter; {{but they had no}} confidence in Maggie's adherence to her renunciation of him; they suspected that she had shrunk rather from the elopement than from the marriage, and that she lingered in St. Ogg's, relying on his return to her. They had always thought her disagreeable; they now thought her artful and proud; having quite as good grounds for that judgment as you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> have for many strong opinions of the same kind. Formerly they had not altogether delighted in the contemplated match with Lucy, but now their dread of a marriage between Stephen and Maggie added its momentum to their genuine pity and indignation on behalf of the gentle forsaken girl, in making them desire that he should return to her. As soon as Lucy was able to leave home, she was to seek relief from the oppressive heat of this August by going to the coast with the Miss Guests; and it was in their plans that Stephen should be induced to join them. On the very first hint of gossip concerning Maggie and Dr. Kenn, the report was conveyed in Miss Guest's letter to her brother.|$|E
25|$|The Indian records also {{describes}} Greek {{attacks on}} Saketa, Panchala, Mathura and Pataliputra (Gargi-Samhita, Yuga Purana chapter). However, the campaigns to Pataliputra are generally attested to the later king Menander <b>I</b> <b>and</b> Demetrius <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> only invaded areas in Pakistan. Other kings may have expanded the territory as well. By c. 175 BC, the Indo-Greeks ruled parts of northwestern India, while the Shungas {{remained in the}} Gangetic, Central, and Eastern India.|$|R
5000|$|Matt Burke in Matthew Burke: A Football Life recounts that, [...] "We {{ended up}} winning the game 19-12 - <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>probably</b> only one pass short of scoring a debut Test match try. David Campese put a pass over to Tim Horan, who carried {{it on and}} scored in the corner." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{have been}} here for two months, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>probably</b> come back here after Christmas (we go home for Christmas week) and stay on into February. But <b>I</b> shall write <b>and</b> propose a theatre before Christmas is out, so this is to warn you to get {{yourself}} into working pantomime order! ...|$|R
5000|$|Grote and {{his wife}} learned Transcendental Meditation in August 1974. Of their {{practice}} Grote said, [...] "it's like an instant seven or eight hours' sleep. … Because of it, my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> are more in love, closer, and more dependent on each other than we've ever been in 13 years of marriage." ...|$|E
5000|$|She was not {{selected}} for re-appointment to the 25th Seanad. Ms Higgins complained about how [...] "regrettable" [...] {{it was that}} more women {{were not included in}} the parliamentary party. She was quoted as saying: [...] "For me it was the last throw of the dice <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> won't be involved in representative politics again".|$|E
5000|$|The {{controversy}} {{caused by}} Rock's constant {{use of the}} word [...] "nigga" [...] led him to remove the piece from his act. In a 2005 60 Minutes interview, Rock said: [...] "By the way, I've never done that joke again, ever, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> never will. 'Cos some people that were racist thought they had license to say nigger. So, I'm done with that routine." ...|$|E
