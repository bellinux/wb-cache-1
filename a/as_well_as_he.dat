5|$|In early August Sudirman {{approached}} Sukarno {{and asked}} him to continue the guerrilla war; Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand, and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11August 1949.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{and mixing}} {{took place at}} Tico-Tico Studios in Kemi, Finland. The studio's {{schedule}} was too full for a single recording session, so Kalmah had to book time to record the album in three separate sessions, between the months of May and August, 2009. The majority of tracks were recorded in May, beginning with Janne Kusmin's drums, which were completed by May 12. Kusmin {{was not able to}} play <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had hoped because he had not been practicing. As a result, several of his drum parts were changed.|$|E

While Coulson shops for snacks {{in the back of the}} station, two robbers enter and demand the money from the register. When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, {{surrender}}s his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk not to mention his involvement to the police and leaves the station.|$|E

5|$|On his day off, Nikumbh {{sets off}} to Mumbai, to visit Ishaan's parents. Nikumbh is {{surprised}} to learn that Ishaan is passionate about painting, and shows great talent in art. Nikumbh then asks Mr Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Mr Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and was a poor student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Mr Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has dyslexia <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> may be having other conditions, which make him a difficult child.|$|E

25|$|Mannerheim {{supported}} Finland's military {{industry and}} sought {{in vain to}} establish a military defence union with Sweden. However, rearming the Finnish army did not occur as swiftly or <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> hoped, {{and he was not}} enthusiastic about a war. He had many disagreements with various Cabinets, and signed many letters of resignation.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth and}} final game in Allegheny saw Phillippe start his fourth game of the Series for the Pirates. This time, however, he wouldn't fare <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did in his first three starts.

25|$|Ideally a bowler of John Snow's {{tremendous}} pace {{should be}} used in short spells with adequate rest in between and he is usually more impressive and effective as a result. I knew this <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did but much as I wanted to help him, I had to be tough with John. Often I was forced to keep him on for lengthy spells because this was necessary for the team's success.|$|E
25|$|His {{best friend}} is Mungyeong Seong, who goes to school with him and Fanta. Ryang was held back a year because he missed too much school, for a reason {{that has not been}} {{disclosed}} yet, but he seems to be a decent student. He is fairly athletic <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is an extremely fast runner and good skateboarder. It is said that Ryang has no problem attracting girls, something that would get him into trouble later on. As for Ryang himself, {{there are more and more}} hints that he is attracted to Fanta.|$|E
25|$|The 2002–03 season, was a {{disaster}} for Grimsby Town; Mariners boss Paul Groves attempted to bolster his side <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, veteran footballers Darren Barnard and Steve Chettle amongst others {{were brought to the}} club, and such players as Steve Kabba, Richard Hughes and returning hero John Oster all played some part in the season. The club couldn't avoid relegation and Grimsby finished bottom of Division One and were relegated after five successive seasons at this level. Indeed, only one of their previous 12 seasons had been spent outside it and have never returned to this level.|$|E

Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman hit {{back to back}} home runs to lead the inning off and with two out, Wade Boggs drove in Dave Henderson with a single for a 3–0 Red Sox lead. Darling did not pitch <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had earlier in the series and was pulled in the fourth inning with two outs and a runner in scoring position. Sid Fernandez came in and after walking Boggs, {{he was able to}} retire Marty Barrett on a fly ball to right field. Fernandez then retired the side in order in the fifth and sixth.|$|E

He later {{withdrew from the}} US Open in New York <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> felt he still was not healthy enough to compete. On 11 September 2012, Nadal fell to a world No. 4 ranking, his lowest since 2010, as 2012 US Open winner Andy Murray climbed to No. 3. Nadal ended 2012 ranked No. 4 in the world, {{the first time in}} eight years that he has not been ranked 1st or 2nd {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{used his}} {{reputation}} to psyche out the hitters <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> looked {{in to his}} catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{overlooks the}} fact that Chao Phraya Chakri was himself of partly Chinese origin <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> himself being married to one of Taksin's daughters. No {{previous}} conflicts between them were mentioned in histories. Reports on the conflicts between the king and the Chinese merchants were seen caused by {{the control of the}} rice price in the time of famine. However, prior to returning to Thonburi, Chao Phraya Chakri had Taksin's son summoned to Cambodia and executed. All in all, Phraya Chakri was, in fact, the highest noble in the kingdom, charging the state affairs as the Chancellor. Therefore, he was of the greatest potential to be the new leader.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Carolus-Duran's atelier, Sargent visited Spain. There {{he studied}} the {{paintings}} of Velázquez with a passion, absorbing the master's technique, and in his travels gathered ideas for future works. He was entranced with Spanish music and dance. The trip also re-awakened his own talent for music (which was nearly equal to his artistic talent), and which found visual expression in his early masterpiece El Jaleo (1882). Music would {{continue to play a}} major part in his social life <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was a skillful accompanist of both amateur and professional musicians. Sargent became a strong advocate for modern composers, especially Gabriel Fauré. Trips to Italy provided sketches and ideas for several Venetian street scenes genre paintings, which effectively captured gestures and postures he would find useful in later portraiture.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with {{new life in}} 1994–95. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and {{led the league in}} triple-doubles. Roy Tarpley was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points, but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward Popeye Jones had a great year <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.|$|E
