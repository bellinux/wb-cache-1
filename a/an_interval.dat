5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested <b>an</b> <b>interval</b> of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E

5|$|Along crater and canyon walls, {{there are}} {{thousands}} of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies. The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the southern hemisphere and to face the Equator; all are poleward of 30° latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice, although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust. No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active. Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at <b>an</b> <b>interval</b> or intervals in earlier Mars history. Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across {{a large proportion of the}} surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.|$|E
5|$|Einsatzgruppe B, C, and D did not {{immediately}} follow Einsatzgruppe A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The Einsatzgruppe commanders, {{with the exception of}} Einsatzgruppe A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 {{that it was impossible to}} kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop. An Einsatzgruppe report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them. Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west. Thus, <b>an</b> <b>interval</b> passed between the first round of Einsatzgruppen massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942. During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.|$|E
