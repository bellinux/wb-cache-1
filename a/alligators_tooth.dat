Shark and <b>alligator</b> <b>teeth</b> and shells from the Gulf have been found as far north as Ohio, in the mounds of the Hopewell culture.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Labyrinthine patterns, {{of which}} those {{displayed}} {{on the surface of}} the mammalian brain are a notable biological example, are some of the most striking encountered in nature. A half-century ago Turing (Turing, 1952), who was studying morphogenesis in biological systems, had the insight that diffusion is not always a homogenizing influence, and that spatial patterns would be formed by a reaction [...] diffusion system combining local activation with long-range inhibition. Spots and stripes on animal coats (Bard, 1981; Murray, 1989), patterning on sea shells (Meinhardt, 1997), stripes on tropical fish (Kondo & Asai, 1995), and even <b>alligator</b> <b>teeth</b> (Murray & Kulesa, 1996), have all since been put forward as examples of Turing patterns in nature (Koch & Meinhardt, 1994). Here I propose that the morphogenesis of labyrinthine patterns in the mammalian brain may likewise be an instance of biological Turing pattern formation. The cerebral cortices of the higher mammals, and in particu...|$|R
40|$|Electroluminescent (EL) wire is {{a unique}} kind of wire because it glows when {{attached}} to a power source. EL wire has many applications, both creative and practical. For example: Burning Man enthusiasts like to adorn their clothing with the flexible wire, and emergency responders use it to mark off accidents on the road at night. What makes EL wire glow is the electrical reactions between its copper wires and phosphor coating. The problem with this wire, however, {{is that it is}} very difficult to connect it to a battery. This is due to the wire’s structure. Beneath its protective plastic shielding, EL wire has a core copper wire, double wrapped with a very fine pair of copper wires. These fine copper wires are hard to solder to, and can break without much effort. Standard soldering methods use a basic <b>alligator</b> <b>tooth</b> style double clamp to hold EL wires in place for soldering. This device is very poorly made, as one must tighten and re-tighten every moveable joint for a precision solder. Adjusting these clamps can be maddening, especially when many EL solder joints must be made. There must be a better way to terminate EL wire, therefore various connection methods are considered as possible solutions. They are: improved hand soldering, machine soldering, conducive epoxy, and crimping. Ultimately it was decided that an improved solder technique would prove to be the best solution. And it entailed manufacturing a custom fixture that would hold the EL wire for easy soldering. The design went though many phases and was tested to see if it commanded a faster soldering time over its clamping counterpart. The results suggest the fixture has a mean soldering time that is statistically significantly less than the mean soldering time of the alligator clamps, with ninety-five percent confidence. An economic analysis determined that if even just one electrician were to try to profit off of making EL wire assemblies, working either full-time or part-time, he or she would save money in labor hours by purchasing the fixture. A hobbyist on the other hand, who makes only a few EL wire assemblies a month, might be stretching his or her wallet too far by spend the money for the fixture. The bottom line is that if someone stands to make a profit off EL wire assemblies, or is serious about making all kinds of EL artwork, this fixture will save the user time...|$|R
50|$|At Monk's request, {{the medical}} {{examiner}} turns Webster's body over, and he mentions that drowning is the likely cause of death. The wounds on his body, while still extremely painful, are not fatal, and {{they appear to have}} been made by a creature of some sort. After Randy makes several wild guesses about what kind of animal could make a bite like the one on the body, (his guesses getting more bizarre until he guessses that a clam is responsible) Monk dismisses him and tells all that the animal that did this was an alligator. He points out that all of the teeth marks are identical, as <b>alligators</b> have <b>teeth</b> that are all perfectly identical. The medical examiner points out to Monk that alligators are not indigenous to San Francisco, but an alligator may have been responsible - after all, alligators kill their prey by grabbing them with their mouths, and then holding them underwater until they drown, and the pattern of injuries is consistent with this theory. Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer and Disher are all convinced that this is a rather cleverly committed homicide.|$|R
