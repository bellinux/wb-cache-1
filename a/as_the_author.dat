5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} of Foliot's education, but he likely received an education to fit him for his career in the church.

He helped consecrate Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, and attended the Council of Windsor in 1072 and the Council of London in 1075. At a later church council, Giso asserted his {{authority over the}} abbots of Muchelney and Athelney, but failed to uphold the same claim in regards to Thurstan, Abbot of Glastonbury.

5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, {{he would have had}} a considerable reputation <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 1826, he {{conducted}} a study connecting mortality rates with wealth and poverty based on neighborhoods in Paris. Louis-René Villermé is also accounted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of {{the one of the}} first life expectancy tables that directly linked income to mortality rates and life expectancy. He concluded that poor people die younger. This extended into his study in 1829 that reasoned the cause for shorter heights in poorer people was the result of inadequate money to provide proper nutrition. Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Laozi is {{traditionally}} regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), though {{the identity of}} its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history. It {{is one of the}} most significant treatises in Chinese cosmogony. As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be read as an analogy – the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, senses and desires.|$|E

5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres. A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie thought he was a student at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.|$|E
5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E

5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is {{a popular}} science book. Homer-Dixon takes an inter-disciplinary {{approach}} connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, biology, and ecology. The narrative is structured as a travelogue <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> travels to meet experts and construct his theory. His observations along the way illustrate the concepts he is explaining and supplement interviews and research. Collecting pieces of his theory from each of his interviews and destinations appears as a recurring metaphor. He includes anecdotes and social commentary.|$|E
5|$|The {{partners}} published their History of Quadrupeds in 1790, {{intended for}} children but reaching an adult readership, and its success {{encouraged them to}} consider a more serious work of natural history. In preparation for this Bewick spent several years engraving the wood blocks for Land Birds, {{the first volume of}} A History of British Birds. Given his detailed knowledge of the birds of Northumberland, Bewick prepared the illustrations, so Beilby was given the task of assembling the text, which he struggled to do. Bewick ended up writing most of the text, which led to a dispute over authorship; Bewick refused to have Beilby named <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> and in the end only Bewick's name appeared on the title page, along with a paragraph of explanation {{at the end of the}} preface.|$|E
5|$|The third {{variation}} {{added by}} Petipa was also composed by Drigo and has survived {{as one of}} the most beloved passages of Giselle. This variation, sometimes dubbed as the Pas seul, was arranged in 1887 for the ballerina Elena Cornalba. The variation was also danced by Cornalba's successors in the role of Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre. Cornalba's variation was first performed outside of Russia by Olga Spessivtzeva in 1924 at the Paris Opéra, and from then on all productions staged outside of Russia included the variation. There was much confusion at that time as to who was responsible for composing the music, leading many ballet historians and musicologists to credit Ludwig Minkus <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> a misconception which still persists.|$|E
