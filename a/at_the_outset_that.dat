An executive Building Committee was quickly formed to oversee the design and construction of the exhibition building, comprising Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert Stephenson, renowned architects Charles Barry and Thomas Leverton Donaldson, the Duke of Buccleuch and the Earl of Ellesmere, and chaired by William Cubitt. By 15 March 1850 {{they were ready to}} invite submissions, which had to conform to several key specifications: the building had to be temporary, simple, as cheap as possible, and economical to build within the short time remaining before the Exhibition opening, which had already been scheduled for 1 May 1851.|$|E

500|$|As in most Westminster system parliaments, Australia's {{government}} is {{formed by the}} party enjoying {{the confidence of the}} lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation. The Constitution forbids the Senate to originate or amend a money bill, but places no limitation on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, had stated of a budget bill, [...] "Let me make it clear <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate.

500|$|With Sinclair's new {{specifications}} in hand, Ogle {{worked on}} a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled Bond Bug – another Ogle design. The vehicle's handlebar steering {{was the brainchild of}} Wood Rogers, who decided <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver {{to get in and out}} easily – a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that [...] "putting the bars at the driver's sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural". A prototype was presented to 63 families in the A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5. In the autumn of 1983, Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle's detailing, build prototypes and test rigs, carry out testing and take forward the programme to production. The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving ground in Leicestershire.|$|E

But in applying it to the instant case she found that the state's explanations for the delays were reasonable enough, and that in turn Lazarus did not show any reasonable likelihood of prejudice resulting from missing evidence and unavailable witnesses. [...] "'s error {{did not affect the}} outcome," [...] Manella wrote, pertaining to the absence of chain of custody records for the evidence.

2500|$|The debate {{continued}} in 1862. A detailed paper by William Henry Flower in the prestigious journal, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, reviewed the earlier literature and presented his own studies based on having dissected sixteen species of primates, including prosimians, monkeys and an orangutan. Having stated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> {{he had no}} opinion on transmutation or the origin of humans, he refuted Owen's three claims, and went further, stating that {{in relation to the}} mass of the brain, the hippocampus minor was proportionately largest in the marmoset, and proportionately smallest in mankind. The paper used terms recently coined by Huxley, and Flower was one of his close colleagues. Huxley presented more evidence against Owen in his Natural History Review. The Dutch anatomists Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk and Willem Vrolik found that Owen had repeatedly used their 1849 illustration of a chimpanzee's brain to support his arguments, and to prevent the public from being misled they dissected the brain of an orangutan that had died in the Amsterdam zoo, reporting {{at a meeting of the}} Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences that the three features Owen claimed were unique to humans were present in this ape. They admitted that their earlier illustration was incorrect due to the way they had removed the brain for inspection, and suggested that Owen had become [...] "lost" [...] and [...] "fell into a trap" [...] in debating against Darwin. Huxley reprinted the report, in French, in his Review. His confrontations with Owen went on.|$|E

I quote again: 'Saakashvili must go'. This is completely unacceptable and crosses the line." [...] The Russian ambassador responded by saying, [...] "On Ambassador Khalilzad’s interesting reference to a confidential diplomatic telephone call between our Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Secretary of State, I must say <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> regime change is an American expression. We do not use such expressions." [...] After the meeting, CNN reported, [...] "But Churkin drew a rebuke from other Security Council members, including its current president, after he questioned the objectivity of a top U.N. official who briefed ambassadors on the conflict in Georgia". Sergey Lavrov later claimed that Russian [...] "peace enforcement" [...] operation was not linked to the removal of Saakashvili from office.
