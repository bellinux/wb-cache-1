5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America.

The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same genus.
