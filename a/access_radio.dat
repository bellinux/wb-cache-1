Local radio stations include Radio Dunedin, community station Otago <b>Access</b> <b>Radio</b> (formerly Hills AM, then Toroa Radio), and the university radio station, Radio One. The city has one local television station, Dunedin Television, part of Allied Press.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern part of Mostar was {{surrounded}} by HVO forces for nine months, and much of its historic city was severely damaged in shelling including the famous Stari Most bridge. Mostar was divided into a Western part, which was dominated by the HVO forces and an Eastern part where the ARBiH was largely concentrated. However, the Bosnian Army had its headquarters in West Mostar {{in the basement of}} a building complex referred to as Vranica. In the early hours of 9 May 1993, the Croatian Defence Council attacked Mostar using artillery, mortars, heavy weapons and small arms. The HVO controlled all roads leading into Mostar and international organisations were denied <b>access.</b> <b>Radio</b> Mostar announced that all Bosniaks should hang out a white flag from their windows. The HVO attack had been well prepared and planned.|$|E

After a congestion situation in the <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> is detected, congestion resolution mechanisms are triggered {{in order to reduce the}} overload in the congested RAT(s). In this paper, a framework for the detection and resolution of congestion conditions in a multi-access network is presented. Moreover, three approaches intending to solve congestion situations are proposed and the evaluation of an inter-RAT handover algorithm for solving congestion events in GERAN is also presented.
