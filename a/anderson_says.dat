In the case of cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air content is important. When cacti are grown in containers, recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly; Miles <b>Anderson</b> <b>says</b> that if asked to describe a perfect growing medium, [...] "ten growers would give 20 different answers". Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial soilless growing medium, one part hydroponic clay and one part coarse pumice or perlite, {{with the addition of}} soil from earthworm castings. The general recommendation of 25–75% organic-based material, the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit, is supported by other sources. However, the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others; Hecht says that cacti (other than epiphytes) [...] "want soil that is low in or free of humus", and recommends coarse sand as the basis of a growing medium.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Fred <b>Anderson</b> <b>says</b> that Washington's Providence was, [...] "a {{generally}} benevolent, {{as well as}} an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being, but He {{was hardly}} the kind of warm and loving God embraced by the evangelical Protestants." ...|$|E
2500|$|The artwork, which {{features}} a naked man sprawled on a bed was lifted from one of Anderson's old photo books. Taken by American photographer Joanne Leonard in 1971, the front cover picture was originally titled [...] "Sad Dreams on Cold Mornings" [...] and the rear photo [...] "Lost Dreams". <b>Anderson</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "I just liked the image, really, of the bloke {{on the bed in}} the room. It's quite sort of sad and sexual, I think, like the songs on the album." [...] The image on the window of the back cover is the same image on Quintessence' 1972 album Self.|$|E

5000|$|Gene Hackman was Anderson's {{choice for}} Royal, with <b>Anderson</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "It {{was written for}} him against his wishes". Etheline Tenenbaum was also written with Anjelica Huston in mind. Hackman was {{hesitant}} about accepting the role, citing his {{lack of understanding of}} or association to Royal. Hackman's agent persuaded him to assume the role, though his reluctance caused Michael Caine to be considered. Gene Wilder was also rumored to be considered.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{tribes in}} Texas, {{such as the}} Karankawan, Akokisa, Bidui and others, were {{extinguished}} due to conflicts with settlers. In his book The Conquest Of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing In The Promised Land, 1820–1875, Gary <b>Anderson</b> <b>says</b> [...] "the 'Texas Creed' was enshrined in the Texas Rangers." [...] According to Anderson, the Rangers believed the Indians were at best subhumans who [...] "had no right of soil" [...] and savaged pure, noble, and innocent settlers. According to captives of the period as written by them such as The Boy Captives and Nine Years with the Indians, the Rangers were the only force feared by the Indians. Killing Indians became government policy when second Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar prescribed [...] "an exterminating war" [...] of [...] "total extinction." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{single reading}} of the Miles Gloriosus leaves the reader {{with the notion that}} the names, place, and play are all Greek, but one must look beyond these {{superficial}} interpretations. W.S. Anderson would steer any reader away from the idea that Plautus' plays are somehow not his own or at least only his interpretation. <b>Anderson</b> <b>says</b> that, [...] "Plautus homogenizes all the plays as vehicles for his special exploitation. Against the spirit of the Greek original, he engineers events at the end... or alter the situation to fit his expectations." [...] Anderson's vehement reaction to the co-opting of Greek plays by Plautus seems to suggest that they are in no way like their originals were. It seems more likely that Plautus was just experimenting putting Roman ideas in Greek forms.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series <b>Anderson</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing you do is you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E
50|$|The label {{became a}} limited company during 2012, but Kenny Anderson {{increasingly}} {{distanced himself from}} the label early in the partnership, feeling that the label and collective had strayed into territory where he was less comfortable. The limited company ceased operations in August 2013, due to differences between Kenny Anderson and The Pictish Trail who had been handling most of the organisation of releases and events since 2003. The announcement that the limited company would cease operations {{was followed by a}} statement from <b>Anderson,</b> <b>saying</b> that he will continue to use the Fence Records name with new projects to be announced in January 2014.|$|R
6000|$|Harry {{himself was}} really subdued. He made no {{question}} as to the propriety of the decision, but rather felt his own unworthiness, and was completely humbled and downcast. When a note came from Mrs. <b>Anderson,</b> <b>saying</b> that she was convinced {{that it could not}} have been Dr. May's wish that she should be exposed to the indignity of a practical joke, and that a young lady of the highest family should have been insulted, no one had spirits to laugh at the terms; and when Dr. May said, [...] "What is to be done?" [...] Harry turned crimson, and was evidently trying to utter something.|$|R

Mario Bautista of People's Journal praised Sarah's acting abilities quoting [...] "She's a natural comedian who's very charming in her hilarious scenes but she also handles her dramatic scenes well", remarked about Gerald <b>Anderson</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "He certainly proves he can be on his own and not just identified with his love team with Kim Chiu" [...] and lastly praised Director Mae Cruz for the movie by quoting [...] "No doubt, this movie's intention is to just make kilig the viewers and Director Mae Cruz definitely succeeds in her intentions".|$|R
5000|$|Richards {{lived at}} the Harelson {{homestead}} for most of 1878, having successfully made it appear that Mrs. Harelson and her children had moved away without incident. Later that year, he befriended his neighbor, a Swedish immigrant named Peter Anderson. On December 8 or 9, Anderson became ill after eating a meal Richards had prepared, causing him to suspect Richards had poisoned him. Anderson told a neighbor of his suspicions, then confronted Richards, leading to a fight in which Richards beat Anderson {{to death with a}} hammer or hatchet. (Richards denied poisoning <b>Anderson,</b> <b>saying</b> using poison wasn't his style, and claimed that he killed in self-defense after Anderson attacked him with a knife.) ...|$|R

Duty and hate forced me. The Germans I met fell before me. I was shell-shot, shocked, gassed, and bayoneted. I took twenty-five wounds, and then it was a shell that downed me. I saw my comrades kill and kill before they fell. That is American. Our enemies are driven, blinded, stolid, brutal, obsessed, and desperate. They are German. They lack--not strength nor efficiency nor courage--but soul." ...|$|R

6000|$|The Idylls ended, Tennyson in 1874 {{began to}} {{contemplate}} a drama, choosing the topic, perhaps neither popular nor in an Aristotelian sense tragic, of Mary Tudor. This play was published, {{and put on}} the stage by Sir Henry Irving in 1875. Harold followed in 1876, The Cup in 1881 (at the Lyceum), The Promise of May (at the Globe) in 1882, Becket in 1884, with The Foresters in 1892. It seems best to consider all the dramatic period of Tennyson's work, a period reached so strangely late in his career, in the sequence of the Plays. The task is one from which I shrink, as conscious of entire ignorance of the stage and of lack of enthusiasm for the drama. Great dramatic authors have, almost invariably, had long practical knowledge of the scenes and of what is behind them. Shakespeare and his contemporaries, Moliere and his contemporaries, had lived their lives on the boards and in the foyer, actors themselves, or in daily touch with actors and actresses. In the present day successful playwrights appear to live much {{in the world of the}} players. They have practical knowledge of the conventions and conditions which the stage imposes. Neither Browning nor Mr Swinburne (to take great names) has had, it seems, much of this practical and daily experience; their dramas have been acted but rarely, if at all, and many examples prove that neither poetical genius nor the genius for prose fiction can enable men to produce plays which hold their own on the boards. This may be the fault of public taste, or partly of public taste, partly of defect in practical knowledge on the side of the authors. Of the stage, by way of practice, Tennyson had known next to nothing, yet his dramas were written to be acted, and acted some of them were. [...] "For himself, he was aware," [...] says his biographer, [...] "that he wanted intimate knowledge of the mechanical details necessary for the modern stage, although in early and middle life he had been a constant playgoer, and would keenly follow the action of a play, criticising the characterisation, incidents, scenic effects, situations, language, and dramatic points." [...] He was quite prepared to be [...] "edited" [...] for acting purposes by the players. Miss Mary <b>Anderson</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "he was ready to sacrifice even his MOST beautiful lines for the sake of a real dramatic effect." ...|$|E
