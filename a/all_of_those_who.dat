5|$|At 23:00 on August 29, the North Koreans {{attacked}} C Company again. Men on {{the left}} flank of the company position quickly abandoned their positions and soon the entire company was retreating, leaving the North Koreans in possession of the mountain again. Captain Lawrence M. Corcoran, the company commander, was left with only the 17 men in his command post, which included several wounded. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> stayed were later given Bronze Star Medals. After daylight on August 30, UN air strikes again came in on Battle Mountain, and US artillery, mortar, and tank fire from the valley concentrated on the North Korean-held peak. A wounded US soldier came down off the mountain where he had hidden for several hours while cut off from escape. He reported that {{the main body of}} the North Koreans had withdrawn to the wooded ridges west of the peak for better cover from the airstrikes, leaving only a small covering force on the mountain itself. At 11:00, B Company, which had to this point been the reserve unit, with the 3rd Battalion in support, attacked toward the heights and retook the top by 13:00. The poor defensive positions were repaired but logistical difficulties continued for the US troops at the top.|$|E

Šakić disappeared soon after and was not arrested until May 1998. He was extradited to Croatia, where he was tried, found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in October 1998 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He called the charges politically motivated and {{described himself as a}} Croatian patriot who only wanted to defend his country.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the war, enthusiasm for the Southern cause was high, and many ship owners responded to the appeal by {{applying}} for letters of marque.

Many ships of the Union Navy were diverted from blockade duty in efforts to capture privateers. Most of the privateers managed to remain free, but enough were caught that the owners and crew had to consider the risk seriously. The capture of the privateers Savannah and Jefferson Davis resulted in important court cases that did much to define the nature of the Civil War itself.|$|E

25|$|On 12 April 2000, the RUC {{was awarded}} the George Cross for bravery, a rare honour which had only been awarded collectively once before, to the island nation of Malta. The Award stated:For the past 30 years, the Royal Ulster Constabulary has been the bulwark against, and the main target of, a {{sustained}} and brutal terrorism campaign. The Force has suffered heavily in protecting {{both sides of the}} community from danger – 302 officers {{have been killed in the}} line of duty and thousands more injured, many seriously. Many officers have been ostracised by their own community and others have been forced to leave their homes in the face of threats to them and their families. As Northern Ireland reaches a turning point in its political development this award is made to recognise the collective courage and dedication to duty of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and who have accepted the danger and stress this has brought to them and to their families.|$|E
25|$|Although in the past, U.S. {{entrants}} had {{to successfully}} compete in regional competitions before the national championship, qualifying for the National Championship has been online since 2003. For the 2003 Championship, qualification {{was limited to}} the first fifty people who correctly completed an online quiz. Out of concerns that such methods of qualifying might not always ensure a competition of the best players, the 2009 Championship qualifying was expanded to include an online multiple-choice quiz (a score of 80% or better was required to advance); followed by an online five-question essay test; followed by a two-game online tournament at Pogo.com. The process was to have produced a field of 23 plus one: Matt McNally, the 2003 national champion, who received a bye and was not required to qualify. However, {{at the end of the}} online tournament, there was an eleven-way tie for the last six spots. The decision was made to invite <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had tied for said spots. In fact, two of those who had tied and would have otherwise been eliminated, Dale Crabtree of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Brandon Baker, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, played in the final game and finished third and fourth respectively.|$|E

Members of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment fired a salute from Princess Caroline's Battery. This {{was followed by a}} two-minute period of silence, and a second gun salute. A parade was also scheduled for the day, with participation of the British Forces Gibraltar and members of the Gibraltar and Estepona branches of the Royal British Legion.

25|$|Grid Autosport {{comes in}} two {{versions}} – a standard edition {{and a special}} edition, the latter of which is called the Black Edition. It was announced on 8 May 2014 and it includes an extra vehicle (a Mercedes Benz SLS AMG Coupé Black Series), extra sponsors and extra liveries for both offline and online modes.

The OS X and Linux port was released on 10 December 2015 by Feral Interactive. Lead designer James Nicholls confirmed as early as the initial game announcement that the game would not make it onto next-gen platforms given the tight timeframes the team worked with during the development process.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} theory {{states that}} the system was introduced by the Nambudiri Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area {{since at least the}} 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs. The Brahmins treated almost <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> acceded to their priestly status as shudra, permitting only a small number to be recognised as kshatriya, these being some of the local rulers who co-operated with them. Certainly by the 11th-century, this combination of association with kings and invaders, and with the destruction or take-over of Buddhist temples, had made the Brahmins by far the largest group owning land in the region and they were to remain so until very recent times. Their introduction of Sanskrit and their melding of it with the local Tamil language to form Malayalam was also striking. Their dominating influence was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture.|$|E

At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon.
