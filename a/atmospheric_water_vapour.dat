40|$|The {{analysis}} of the <b>atmospheric</b> isotopologic <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> composition provides valuable information on many climate, chemical and atmospheric circulation processes. The remote-sensing of the water isotopologues remains a challenge, which is enhanced by the large and fast variations of their spatial distributions. This paper presents {{for the first time}} the simultaneous retrieval of global distributions of the main water isotopologues (i. e. ~H 2 16 O, H 2 18 O, HOD) and their ratios. The results are obtained by exploiting the high resolution infrared spectra recorded by the Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse gases (IMG) instrument, which operated in the nadir geometry onboard the ADEOS satellite between 1996 and 1997. The retrievals are performed on a series of cloud-free radiance measurements in two atmospheric windows (1205 &ndash; 1228 cm&ndash; 1 ; 2004 &ndash; 2032 cm&ndash; 1 ) using a line-by-line radiative transfer model and an inversion procedure based on the Optimal Estimation Method (OEM). Characterizations in terms of vertical sensitivity and error budget are provided. A relatively high vertical resolution is achieved for H 2 16 O (~ 4 &ndash; 5 km), and we show that the retrieved profiles are in good agreement with local sonde measurements, representative of different latitudes. The retrieved global distributions of H 2 16 O, H 2 18 O, HOD and their ratios are also found to be consistent with previous experimental studies and models. The ocean-earth difference, the latitudinal and vertical dependence of the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> amount and the isotopologic depletion are notably well reproduced. Others trends, possibly related to smaller scales variations in the vertical profiles are also discussed. Despite the difficulties encountered for computing accurately the isotopologic ratios, our results demonstrate the ability of the infrared nadir sounding for monitoring <b>atmospheric</b> isotopologic <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> distributions on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolar {{radiation}} has {{a direct}} influence {{on the air and}} ground temperature, indirect influence on the value of atmospheric humidity, movement of air masses and precipitations, and it is easy to understand how its evaluation is essential not only in the technological area such as for sizing solar heating and photovoltaic plants, but also in fields such as agriculture or meteorology. Nowadays, the assessment of the solar energy resources over large areas and the elaboration of solar radiation maps are conducted using satellite derived information. Among the existing methodologies, those based on parametric models to firstly estimate the clear-sky solar radiation are usual. The success of that option depends both on the accuracy of the solar radiation algorithm and the satellite derived information and on the relationship between each other. In this work, daily global solar irradiation under clear skies is estimated by means of a model which includes the horizon effects. This characteristic is important in those cases where a complex topography is present, such as mountains. The topographic information is obtained from a digital elevation model. The other inputs to the model are the <b>atmospheric</b> precipitable <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content, the Angström's turbidity coefficient and the ground albedo. Experimental values of the <b>atmospheric</b> precipitable <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content are obtained from the MODIS sensor. The two latter parameters are averaged values calculated on previous studies. Estimates by the model are compared with ground measurements obtained in fourteen radiometric stations located in a mountain zone (Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain) recording global solar radiation, atmospheric temperature and relative humidity. Since ground experimental values of precipitable <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content are available, a comparison between these values and those derived from the MODIS sensor is also presented...|$|R
50|$|The main methods {{currently}} used for confirmation are absorption spectroscopy and geochemistry. These techniques have proven effective for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> and ice. However, using current methods of astronomical spectroscopy it is substantially {{more difficult to}} detect liquid water on terrestrial planets, {{especially in the case}} of subsurface water. Due to this, astronomers, astrobiologists and planetary scientists use habitable zone, gravitational and tidal theory, models of planetary differentiation and radiometry to determine potential for liquid water. Water observed in volcanic activity can provide more compelling indirect evidence, as can fluvial features and the presence of antifreeze agents, such as salts or ammonia.|$|E
5000|$|Using such methods, many {{scientists}} infer that liquid water once covered {{large areas of}} Mars and Venus.

Similar indirect evidence, however, supports the existence of liquids below the surface of several moons and dwarf planets elsewhere in the Solar System.

50|$|The first {{low-cost}} spectrophotometer {{capable of}} recording an infrared spectrum was the Perkin-Elmer Infracord produced in 1957. This instrument covered the wavelength range from 2.5 μm to 15 μm (wavenumber range 4000 cm−1 to 660 cm−1). The lower wavelength limit {{was chosen to}} encompass the highest known vibration frequency due to a fundamental molecular vibration. The upper limit was imposed {{by the fact that}} the dispersing element was a prism made from a single crystal of rock-salt (sodium chloride), which becomes opaque at wavelengths longer than about 15 μm; this spectral region became known as the rock-salt region. Later instruments used potassium bromide prisms to extend the range to 25 μm (400 cm−1) and caesium iodide 50 μm (200 cm−1). The region beyond 50 μm (200 cm−1) became known as the far-infrared region; at very long wavelengths it merges into the microwave region. Measurements in the far infrared needed the development of accurately ruled diffraction gratings to replace the prisms as dispersing elements, since salt crystals are opaque in this region. More sensitive detectors than the bolometer were required because of the low energy of the radiation. One such was the Golay detector. An additional issue is the need to exclude <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> because water vapour has an intense pure rotational spectrum in this region. Far-infrared spectrophotometers were cumbersome, slow and expensive. The advantages of the Michelson interferometer were well-known, but considerable technical difficulties had to be overcome before a commercial instrument could be built. Also an electronic computer was needed to perform the required Fourier transform, and this only became practicable with the advent of mini-computers, such as the PDP-8, which became available in 1965. Digilab pioneered the world's first commercial FTIR spectrometer (Model FTS-14) in 1969 (Digilab FTIRs are now a part of Agilent technologies's molecular product line after it acquired spectroscopy business from Varian).|$|E
30|$|Under common <b>atmospheric</b> {{conditions}} <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> neither freezes nor condenses {{without the}} presence of atmospheric particles or droplets—aerosols—hence these can exert {{a major influence on}} clouds and precipitation (Després et al. 2012). Any change in the abundance, character or dynamics of these aerosols will impact the water-cycle (Rosenfeld et al. 2008; Rosenfeld et al. 2014; Fan et al. 2016). The key relationships are non-linear. For example, increasing aerosol densities can increase or decrease both cloud cover and precipitation (Rosenfeld et al. 2008) and influence associated atmospheric behaviours (Koren et al. 2014; Seinfeld et al. 2016). Sensitivity to aerosols is illustrated by observations showing that the intensity of convective summer storms, and the occurrence of tornado and hailstorms in the eastern United States follow a seven-day cycle determined by week-day pollution (Bell et al. 2009; Rosenfeld and Bell 2011).|$|R

In 1865, he supplied photographer William Henry Fox Talbot (1800-1877) with a custom-made spectroscope. His crafting of fine spectroscopes strengthened his connection to the field of chemistry. In April 1872, Browning exhibited one of his spectroscopes at the Royal Society, more formally known as the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge. In his 1878 book How to Work With the Spectroscope: A Manual of Practical Manipulation With Spectroscopes of All Kinds, John Browning provided an overview of the field of spectroscopy, and the book became well known among spectroscopists. It has been published in a number of editions, most recently on 3 June 2010 by Cambridge University Press. [...] While the first edition of 1878 contained only black and white images, the second edition of How to Work With the Spectroscope included one notable colour illustration (pictured). It was of the rainband spectrum by lawyer and scientist John Rand Capron. It first appeared as a black and while image in Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine. However, the second, 1882 edition of John Browning's handbook reproduced the plate in colour. It demonstrated Joseph von Fraunhofer's solar lines A-F, with the rainband adjacent to the D lines. In the late 19th century, scientists were interested in the rainband for its potential in the detection of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> and, therefore, the prediction of rain. Evaluation of the rainband represented the first attempt to use spectroscopy in the field of meteorology. Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth supported the contention that water vapour bands could be used to predict rainfall in the 22 July 1875 issue of Nature. While the topic of the rainband and its use in meteorology was controversial, John Browning (and his competitors) manufactured pocket spectroscopes designed to show the rainband and marketed them as meteorological tools.|$|E

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> {{and the subsequent}} derivation of surface spectral reflectance from hyperspectral VNIR-SWIR remotely sensed data is important for many applications. A number of algorithms {{have been developed for}} estimating water vapour content from remotely sensed hyperspectral data that do not require in-situ measurements. Two algorithms, the Continuum Interpolated Band Ratio (CIBR) and the Atmospheric Precorrected Differential Absorption (APDA) have proven to be highly effective at estimating <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour.</b> Although highly successful, the two methods still exhibit unwanted or spurious results when challenging conditions are encountered. Such conditions include the estimation of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> over dark targets, when uncorrected atmospheric aerosols are present and over surfaces with complex spectral signatures. A differential absorption method called the Transmittance Slope Ratio (TSR) has been developed that negates these problems. The TSR method is comprised of a weighted mean radiance that is defined between two atmospheric water absorption features which is divided by a reference channel radiance to produce a measurable ratio value. This, is turn, may be related to a reference curve, such that, the TSR value may be expressed as an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content. To test the TSR method over real terrains, AVIRIS and HyMap measured hyperspectral radiometric data were used. Three test sites were used in total with each site allowing different aspects of the water vapour estimation to be critically examined. The sites are, Jasper Ridge and Moffett Field in California and Brukunga in South Australia. The TSR method is found to significantly improve estimated <b>atmospheric</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> over dark targets (with less than 3. 5 % error for reflectances as low as 0. 5 %), improvement over nonlinear surfaces, and finally, ++improvement in water vapour estimation when atmospheric aerosol conditions are not well known.
