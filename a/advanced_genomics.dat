40|$|High {{temperature}} response (HTR) or heat stress response (HSR) {{is a highly}} conserved phenomenon, which involves complex networks among different crop species. Heat stress usually results in protein dysfunction by improper folding of its linear amino acid chains to non-native proteins. This leads to unfavourable interactions and subsequent protein aggregation. To tackle this, plants have developed molecular chaperone machinery to maintain high quality proteins in the cell. This is governed by increasing the level of pre-existing molecular chaperones and by expressing additional chaperones through signalling mechanism.

However, the availability of this plethora of genomic data presents a significant challenge for storage, analyses and data management.

Because {{of the limited}} knowledge gain from routine cancer bioassays {{and the fact that}} HPV chemicals are tested only, there is the need for more cost-effective and informative testing strategies. Here we report the application of <b>advanced</b> <b>genomics</b> to a cellular transformation assay to identify toxicity pathways and gene signatures predictive for carcinogenicity. Specifically, genome-wide gene expression analysis and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were applied to untransformed and transformed mouse fibroblast Balb/c 3 T 3 cells that were exposed to either 2, 4 -diaminotoluene, benzo(a) pyrene, 2 -acetylaminoflourene, or 3 -methycholanthrene at IC 20 conditions for 24 and 120 h, respectively. Then, bioinformatics was applied to define toxicity pathways and a gene signature predictive of the carcinogenic risk of these chemicals. Although bioinformatics revealed distinct differences for individual chemicals at the gene-level pathway, analysis identified common perturbation that resulted in an identification of 14 genes whose regulation in cancer tissue had already been established. Strikingly, this gene signature was identified in short-term (24 and 120 h) untransformed and transformed cells (3 weeks), therefore demonstrating robustness for its predictive power. The developed testing strategy thus identified commonly regulated carcinogenic pathways and a gene signature that predicted the risk for carcinogenicity for three well-known carcinogens.

40|$|Background The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) shows a {{wide range}} of genetic and trait {{variation}} among wild accessions. Because of its unparalleled biological and genomic resources, the potential of Arabidopsis for molecular genetic analysis of this natural variation has increased dramatically in recent years. Scope <b>Advanced</b> <b>genomics</b> has accelerated molecular phylogenetic analysis and gene identification by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and/or association mapping in Arabidopsis. In particular, QTL mapping utilizing natural accessions is now becoming a major strategy of gene isolation, offering an alternative to artificial mutant lines. Furthermore, the genomic information is used by researchers to uncover the signature of natural selection acting on the genes that contribute to phenotypic variation. The evolutionary significance of such genes has been evaluated in traits such as disease resistance and flowering time. However, although molecular hallmarks of selection have been found for the genes in question, a corresponding ecological scenario of adaptive evolution has been difficult to prove. Ecological strategies, including reciprocal transplant experiments and competition experiments, and utilizing near-isogenic lines of alleles of interest will be a powerful tool to measure the relative fitness of phenotypic and/or allelic variants. Conclusions As the plant model organism, Arabidopsis provides a wealth of molecular background information for evolutionary genetics.

Although several hypotheses have been put forward, it is unclear as to whether particular gene loci on chromosome 21 (HSA 21) are sufficient to cause DS and its associated features. Here we present a high-resolution genetic map of DS phenotypes based on an analysis of 30 subjects carrying rare segmental trisomies of various regions of HSA 21. By using state-of-the-art genomics technologies we mapped segmental trisomies at exon-level resolution and identified discrete regions of 1. 8 – 16. 3 Mb likely {{to be involved in}} the development of 8 DS phenotypes, 4 of which are congenital malformations, including acute megakaryocytic leukemia, transient myeloproliferative disorder, Hirschsprung disease, duodenal stenosis, imperforate anus, severe mental retardation, DS-Alzheimer Disease, and DS-specific congenital heart disease (DSCHD).

40|$|Termites eat and digest wood, {{but how do}} they do it? Combining <b>advanced</b> <b>genomics</b> and {{proteomics}} techniques, {{researchers have}} now shown that microbes found in the termites' hindguts possess just the right tools. Most animals, from insects to mammals, carry complex communities of microbes in their digestive tracts. In the case of wood-eating termites, these gut microbes are particularly important: they are thought to provide most of the capabilities needed for efficient digestion of wood, which is otherwise a largely inaccessible food source. They also help to compensate for the paucity of some nutrients in wood, for example by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, and they synthesize essential amino acids and other compounds for their hosts [1, 2]. Despite their importance, relatively little is known about gut microbes in termites. This is partly because gut microbes are often difficult to grow in pure culture (as is the case for most microbes sampled from natural environments). Furthermore, a single termite can harbor a very complex assemblage of hundreds of different microbial lineages, whose members may vary widely in terms of abundance and growth rates. Without access to cultivated strains, researchers have to rely on so-called 'cultivation-independent' molecular techniques to analyze such communities. A clever combination of these techniques has now been applied to a section of the termite hindgut, aiming to identify molecular tools used by the microbes in this compartment to degrade wood [3]. Here, we review the procedures and results of this study, and discuss insights into the biological system as well as implications for the generation of biofuels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is {{the third}} most {{important}} pulse crop worldwide. Despite its importance, relatively {{little is known about}} its genome. The availability of a genome-wide physical map allows rapid fine mapping of QTL, development of high-density genome maps, and sequencing of the entire genome. However, no such a physical map has been developed in chickpea. Results We present a genome-wide, BAC/BIBAC-based physical map of chickpea developed by fingerprint analysis. Four chickpea BAC and BIBAC libraries, two of which were constructed in this study, were used. A total of 67, 584 clones were fingerprinted, and 64, 211 (~ 11. 7 ×) of the fingerprints validated and used in the physical map assembly. The physical map consists of 1, 945 BAC/BIBAC contigs, with each containing an average of 28. 3 clones and having an average physical length of 559 kb. The contigs collectively span approximately 1, 088 Mb. By using the physical map, we identified the BAC/BIBAC contigs containing or closely linked to QTL 4. 1 for resistance to Didymella rabiei (RDR) and QTL 8 for days to first flower (DTF), thus further verifying the physical map and confirming its utility in fine mapping and cloning of QTL. Conclusion The physical map represents the first genome-wide, BAC/BIBAC-based physical map of chickpea. This map, along with other genomic resources previously developed in the species and the genome sequences of related species (soybean, Medicago and Lotus), will provide a foundation necessary for many areas of <b>advanced</b> <b>genomics</b> research in chickpea and other legume species.
