5|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th century central English {{authority}} in Ireland had <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Under Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were {{virtually}} {{excluded from the}} important public offices. Mucianus himself <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77. Real power was unmistakably concentrated {{in the hands of}} the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of democracy.|$|E
5|$|Western Khmer, {{also called}} Cardamom Khmer or Chanthaburi Khmer, is spoken {{by a very}} small, {{isolated}} population in the Cardamom mountain range extending from western Cambodia into eastern Central Thailand. Although little studied, this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of vocal register that has <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> in other dialects of modern Khmer.|$|E

50|$|Focusing on the {{construction}} of female identity, Entre Quatre Murs, Berlin is a composition of women and space. This sequence of three-dimensional portraits transparentizes the female body, as Nathalie interweaves her subjects with their surroundings until the distinction between self and environment <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappears.</b> The women seem in turns melancholy, playful, defiant and nostalgic - as the bounds between their external world and interior self dissolve.|$|R
5|$|By the 1920s, {{the number}} of {{municipalities}} in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did not create many new municipalities, but local officials used zoning to affect land use, making annexation less attractive. Because of boroughitis, the township {{as a form of}} government <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from Bergen County. One that remains is South Hackensack, the remnants of Lodi Township that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces are separated from each other by several miles.|$|E
5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of kulintang {{music has been}} waning throughout the Eastern Malay Archipelago, and has become extinct in some places. Sets of five bronze gong-chimes and a gong making up the totobuang ensembles of Buru island in Central Maluku have also come to disuse. Kolintang sets of bossed kettle gongs were once played in Gorontalo, North Sulawesi long ago but that has <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared,</b> replaced by what locals are presently familiar with—a slab-key instrument known as a kolintang.|$|E
50|$|Generally, streams {{that flow}} only during and {{immediately}} after precipitation are termed ephemeral. There is no clear demarcation between surface runoff and an ephemeral stream, and some ephemeral streams can be classed as intermittent - flow <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappearing</b> in {{the normal course of}} seasons but ample flow (backups) restoring stream presence - such circumstances are documented when stream beds have opened up a path into mines or other underground chambers.|$|R
50|$|In the 1890s {{a railway}} siding was {{constructed}} {{in the area to}} service the timber industry, and later in 1906 the state government decided to create a town-site in the area. Lots were surveyed in 1907 and the town was gazetted in 1909.The town peaked in 1902 when its population was in excess of 1,500 people but it began to decline in the 1920s and saw the town <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappear</b> by the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|After <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappearing</b> from music, Middleton resurrected his old group The Marquis in 1990 for {{a reunion}} and fundraiser for a boys' soccer team, then {{occasionally}} {{crawled out of}} the basement again {{off and on for}} the next few years. He still occasionally makes appearances on the west coast, playing blues and jazz festivals, as well as the occasional club dates. Middleton gave up the music business and worked at Canada Post for 34 years until retiring in 2012.|$|R
5|$|Today {{the site}} of the church, {{including}} {{the upper part of the}} sea defences there, is managed by English Heritage, and the village has <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The present appearance of the cliff below the church, a grassy slope above a large stone apron, was the work of central government and was in place by April 1867. In 2000 the surviving fragments of an early medieval cross that once stood inside the old church were used to design a Millennium Cross to commemorate two thousand years of Christianity. This stands at the entrance to the car park and was commissioned by Canterbury City Council.|$|E
5|$|Working horses <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from Britain's streets by the 21st century; among few {{exceptions}} are heavy horses pulling brewers' wagons, or drays. However, when Young's Brewery ceased brewing in Wandsworth, London, in 2006, it ended more than 300years' use of dray horses by the brewery: its team of Shire horses was retired from delivery work {{and given a}} new career with the head horsekeeper, offering heavy horse team driving as a recreational event, although they continue to appear at opening ceremonies for new Young's pubs and other publicity events.|$|E
5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared,</b> while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E
40|$|The Bolivian {{experience}} suggests that, even in highly indexed economies, exchange rate auctions can work. After introduction of its auction, the Bolsin, {{not only did}} the parallel market premium for dollars <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappear</b> in Bolivia, <b>but</b> the Boliviano exchange rate remained surprisingly stable. This paper examines how the Bolsin accomplished this. The empirical evidence from daily auction data suggests that credit for the Bolsin's success should be attributed largely to central bank policy at the auction rather than the auction as an institution. ...|$|R

Another is Ban Ba Wa Saek, located further upriver, but inland a few kilometers.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The import tariff, enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857. Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all government revenue was raised from the import tariff. However, revenue from the tariffs <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the tariff would bring in about 25 million dollars in revenue in the first year alone. In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} scleractinians {{were not}} reef builders, but were small, phaceloid or solitary individuals. Scleractinian corals were probably at their greatest {{diversity in the}} Jurassic and <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> in the mass extinction event {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous, about 18 out of 67 genera surviving. Recently discovered Paleozoic corals with aragonitic skeletons and cyclic septal insertion – two features that characterize Scleractinia – have strengthened the hypothesis for an independent origin of the Scleractinia. Whether the early scleractinian corals were zooxanthellate is an open question. The phenomenon seems to have evolved independently on numerous occasions during the Tertiary, and the genera Astrangia, Madracis, Cladocora and Oculina, all in different families, each have both zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate members.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{our third}} {{specification}} adds detailed controls for individual and household characteristics. Accounting for disparity in the socio-demographic characteristics {{of immigrants from}} different origin countries reduces the estimated relationship between return migration and retirement status. The effect is still sizable for men (5.1 percentage points), but is no longer significant at conventional levels. At the same time, the effect <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappears</b> for immigrant women suggesting that the link between their retirement status and the return migration rate of their fellow countrymen is largely explained by variation across origin countries in women’s socio-demographic characteristics.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of biases on the learning dynamics of a two-layer neural network, a normalized soft-committee machine, is studied for on-line gradient descent learning. Within a statistical mechanics framework, numerical {{studies show that}} the inclusion of adjustable biases dramatically alters the learning dynamics found previously.

The extended model furthermore exhibits a much richer dynamical behavior, e. g. attractive suboptimal symmetric phases even for realizable cases and noiseless data...|$|R
5|$|Horse {{improvement}} as a goal, {{and horse}} breeding as an enterprise, date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports {{and for the}} culling of horses considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams of horses with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses to support the trade. Steam power took {{over the role of}} horses in agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued to be used in warfare for almost another 100 years, as their speed and agility over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared</b> from Britain by the 1980s, and today horses in Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September, as the 2nd Guards Brigade was {{approaching}} Jajce, the VRS withdrew from Donji Vakuf {{to avoid being}} surrounded, and the ARBiH captured the town. The 5th Corps of the ARBiH, on the left flank of the HV and HVO offensive, began its assault against the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps, moving south from Bihać towards Bosanski Petrovac. The HV 81st Guards Battalion was inserted into the operation to support the HVO exploitation forces, and when it approached Mrkonjić Grad it clashed with the VRS 7th Motorised Brigade defending the town. By {{the end of the}} day the 2nd Guards Brigade had reached Jajce. The civilian population of Jajce was evacuated when its capture appeared imminent. The 2nd Guards Brigade entered the deserted town, recapturing the townwhich had been lost to the VRS in Operation Vrbas '92, nearly three years before. Its capture prevented the 7th Corps of the ARBiH from advancing any further as its frontline facing the VRS <b>all</b> <b>but</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The 7th Corps then detached a substantial part of its force and sent them as reinforcements to the 5th Corps.|$|E
