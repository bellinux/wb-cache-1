In preparation for joining a relative in trade in Lisbon, he studied French, Italian, and German in addition to Aramaic, and Arabic. He was tutored by the Reverend George Haggerstone, who first introduced him to higher mathematics, natural philosophy, logic, and metaphysics through the works of Isaac Watts, Willem 's Gravesande, and John Locke.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} {{week of the}} season, however, Indiana {{suffered}} its first loss: a 2715 conference defeat {{at the hands of}} No.22 Wisconsin. The Hoosiers recovered from the setback, however, and won their next four games—all of which were against Big Ten opponents. The fourth of those victories came against the Michigan State Spartans, who had replaced Wisconsin at the No.22 spot in the country. Indiana held the Spartans scoreless in a tough defensive battle, earning a 100 victory. With a 71 record, Indiana appeared to be in position to compete for the Big Ten championship, but consecutive losses to highly ranked Penn State and Ohio State put an end to <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> of a championship. The Hoosiers ended the season with a 2417 win over traditional rival Purdue and accepted a bid to the Independence Bowl.|$|E

5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

But <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> of curtailing the fired cast members' network-television exposure backfired somewhat when they continued to perform for his substitute host, Robert Q.

25|$|In July 1810, {{shortly before}} {{completion}} of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an easy one. Wellington's superiors were equally surprised {{to hear about the}} defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> of another attempt and headed north.|$|E

25|$|In May, the Tigers were as many {{as eight}} games back of the first-place Cleveland Indians, but slowly pulled back to near-even by the All-Star break. As a {{three-way}} battle for the division title developed between the Tigers, Indians, and Chicago White Sox, the Tigers put together an 18-10 record in August to begin to pull away. After a loss on September 1, the Tigers reeled off a 12-game winning streak to put <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> of another late-season collapse to rest. The streak consisted of four consecutive three-game sweeps over their AL Central Division rivals. It was the Tigers longest winning streak since the 1934 team won 14 straight. On September 16, the Tigers clinched the AL Central Division title with a 3–1 win over the Oakland Athletics. It was their first AL Central title since joining the division in 1998, and first overall since 1987. The Tigers clinched the division with 11 games left to play, tying the franchise record set by the 1984 team.|$|E
25|$|Benny— Benny {{has been}} the most heavily altered from the {{original}} novel. Although he has an ape-like appearance, just as in the novel, his past as a homosexual scientist is entirely altered. In the game Benny was an overly demanding military officer who ends up killing members of his unit for failing to meet his expectations (with the game also implying that he might have cannibalized them). Benny's psycho-drama places him in stone-aged community where the villagers draw a lottery to decide which of them will be sacrificed to AM. Benny obsesses over food and eating— but is incapable of chewing anything he finds. AM had severely damaged Benny's brain, but restores it for the scenario so that he can think clearly again - then AM cripples Benny's body so he cannot act on <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> he has. Eventually Benny demonstrates the compassion he once lacked by saving a mutant child from the lottery, sacrificing himself in the child's stead.|$|E

25|$|However, <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> of a Miami {{comeback}} ended {{early in}} the third quarter. On the first play of the second half, 49ers defensive end Dwaine Board tackled Nathan for a 1-yard loss. Then after Marino threw an incompletion, Board sacked him for a 9-yard loss on third down. For {{the fourth time in}} the game, Roby had to punt, and again McLemore gave the 49ers good field position with an 8-yard punt return to San Francisco's 47-yard line. The 49ers then drove 43 yards and scored on kicker Ray Wersching's 27-yard field goal. On the Dolphins' ensuing drive, they were forced to punt again after Marino was sacked twice (once by defensive lineman Manu Tuiasosopo and once by Board). Starting on their own 30-yard line after a 5-yard return by McLemore, Montana completed a 40-yard pass to Tyler, followed up with a 14-yard completion to Francis. Three plays later, Craig scored his third touchdown on a 16-yard reception to make the score 38–16. The score proved to be the last one from either team, as the defenses of both teams took over {{for the rest of the}} game – especially the 49ers' defense, who intercepted Marino twice.|$|E
25|$|In early January 1949, {{two people}} {{identified}} {{the body as}} that of 63-year-old former wood cutter Robert Walsh. A third person, James Mack, also viewed the body, initially could not identify it, but an hour later he contacted police to claim it was Walsh. Mack stated that the reason he did not confirm this at the viewing was {{a difference in the}} colour of the hair. Walsh had left Adelaide several months earlier to buy sheep in Queensland but had failed to return at Christmas as planned. Police were skeptical, believing Walsh to be too old to be the dead man. However, the police did state that the body was consistent with that {{of a man who had}} been a wood cutter, although the state of the man's hands indicated he had not cut wood for at least 18 months. <b>Any</b> <b>thoughts</b> that a positive identification had been made were quashed, however, when Elizabeth Thompson, one of the people who had earlier positively identified the body as Walsh, retracted her statement after a second viewing of the body, where the absence of a particular scar on the body, as well as the size of the dead man's legs, led her to realise the body was not Walsh.|$|E
25|$|Johnson was {{an early}} example of the celebrity athlete in the modern era, {{appearing}} regularly {{in the press and}} later on radio and in motion pictures. He earned considerable sums endorsing various products, including patent medicines, and indulged several expensive hobbies such as automobile racing and tailored clothing, as well as purchasing jewelry and furs for his wives. He even challenged champion racer Barney Oldfield to a match auto race at the Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York one mile (1.6km) dirt track. Oldfield, far more experienced, easily out-distanced Johnson, ending <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> the boxer might have had about becoming a professional driver. Once, when he was pulled over for a $50 speeding ticket (a large sum at the time), he gave the officer a $100 bill; when the officer protested that he couldn't make change for that much, Johnson told him to keep the change, as {{he was going to make}} his return trip at the same speed. Johnson was also interested in opera (his favorite being Il Trovatore) and in history — he was an admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte, believing him to have risen from a similar origin to his own. In 1920, Johnson opened a night club in Harlem; he sold it three years later to a gangster, Owney Madden, who renamed it the Cotton Club.|$|E

500|$|However, not all reviews were as positive. Robert Abele of LA Weekly {{thought the}} pilot was average, {{containing}} [...] "fashionable gore, occasionally witty dialogue, serviceable suspense and boilerplate police-department politics".

500|$|The same Stuka {{bombardment}} {{that had}} put Brigade B to rout also broke {{the morale of}} the reserves at Rhenen. In the morning these troops had already shown severe discipline problems, with units disintegrating and leaving the battlefield because of German interdiction fire. In the late afternoon most of 4th Infantry Division was fleeing westwards. The Germans had expected that the Dutch would attempt to plug any gaps in the line and indeed it had been planned to shift to the north two regiments of the Dutch 3rd Army Corps for this purpose. But Dutch command now suffered such a loss of control that <b>any</b> <b>thoughts</b> to re-establish a continuous front had to be abandoned. A [...] wide gap had appeared in the defences. Fearing that otherwise they would be encircled, at 20:30 Van Voorst tot Voorst ordered the three Army Corps to immediately abandon both the Grebbe Line and the Waal-Linge Position and to retreat during the night to the East Front of Fortress Holland at the New Holland Water Line. The Germans, however, did not at once exploit their success; only around 21:00 had it become apparent to them that the gap even existed, when the renewed advance had met no enemy resistance.|$|E
