5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who was {{building}} a reputation for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer. However, he thought that success would also lead his 13 players who {{would be out of}} contract, to demand more money for <b>a</b> <b>renewal.</b>|$|E

Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of the Isles forced Sigtrygg to abdicate in 1036. Sigtrygg died in exile, at an unknown place, in 1042.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by {{the change}} to the rules, McCool had a five-year stint from 1956 in English county cricket. Somerset, having {{finished}} {{on the bottom of}} the County Championship table for the four years between 1952–1955, had embarked on <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> programme. Part of the programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign, including an offer to McCool that saw him return to first-class cricket at the age of 39.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta {{was also}} an elitist and {{encouraged}} {{the emergence of an}} elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating {{that he had}} opposed the Korea bill {{because it did not}} include aid to Taiwan, and had {{supported}} it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E
5|$|Such {{efforts were}} premature, {{and did not}} succeed; only 24,000 Jews were living in Palestine {{on the eve of}} the {{emergence}} of Zionism within the world's Jewish communities in the last two decades of the 19th century. With the geopolitical shakeup occasioned by the outbreak of World War I, the earlier calculations, which had lapsed for some time, led to <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of strategic assessments and political bargaining over the Middle and Far East.|$|E

5|$|With the re-unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Ahmose, <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> {{of royal}} {{support for the}} arts and monumental {{construction}} occurred. Ahmose reportedly devoted a tenth of all the productive output towards the service of the traditional gods, reviving massive monumental constructions as well as the arts. However, as the defeat of the Hyksos occurred relatively late in Ahmose's reign, his subsequent building program likely lasted no more than seven years, and much of what was started was probably finished by his son and successor Amenhotep I.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal battle}} that began {{the same year}} {{interfered}} with the band's working on another release. Volcano Entertainment—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E
5|$|Aziz al-Dawla's {{replacements}} were {{challenged by}} Salih and chaos prevailed in Aleppo. In 1023, Salih entered the Kilab into a military {{pact with the}} Banu Tayy of Transjordan and the Banu Kalb of central Syria, both of which opposed direct Fatimid rule. Medieval historian Yahya al-Antaki relates that the alliance was <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of a previous pact made by the same parties in circa 1021, during which they rebelled and ultimately reconciled with the new Fatimid caliph, az-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who took power {{in the aftermath of}} Caliph al-Hakim's disappearance in 1021. However, the reconciliation unraveled by 1023 due to the Tayy's conflict with Palestine's Fatimid governor, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, which prompted the respective chieftains of Tayy and Kalb, Hassan ibn Mufarrij and Sinan ibn Ulayyan, to meet with Salih at the outskirts of Aleppo and renew the alliance.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E
5|$|Heinz Field is {{a stadium}} {{located in the}} North Shore {{neighborhood}} of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It primarily serves as the home to the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) and the Pittsburgh Panthers of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The stadium opened in 2001, after the controlled implosion of the teams' previous stadium, Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium is named for the locally based H. J. Heinz Company, which purchased the naming rights in 2001. It hosted the 2011 NHL Winter Classic between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals on January 1, 2011. On September 10, 2016, it hosted the Keystone Classic, which featured <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of the Penn State-Pitt football rivalry, setting a new attendance record at 69,983 people. In 2017 it hosted the Coors Light Stadium Series game featuring the Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
5|$|In 1232 {{the castle}} was {{inherited}} by John's son, William de Braose, {{and in turn}} his son, also called William. In {{the second half of}} the century, Wales saw <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of fighting, and the castle was attacked again in 1251. The decision was taken to improve the castle's defences and, as part of this, a square, stone tower was added to the castle to provide living accommodation, with three chambers, the first floor containing a garderobe and a fireplace. A gateway was constructed through the curtain wall just to the south of the tower. Two further stone buildings were constructed within the castle walls.|$|E

5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{decaying}} {{infrastructure and}} {{the withdrawal of}} subsidies brought {{the future of the}} line into doubt. As one of its last acts the Greater London Council paid for the replacement of two bridges on the line, allowing operations to continue. The centenary of the line in 1989 saw <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of interest and an upgrading of the trains between Chalfont& Latimer and London Marylebone station made commuting more practical, and usage of the line stabilised. The introduction of London Underground S Stock in 2010 led to the replacement of the shuttle service with half-hourly through trains to and from London.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E

5|$|Protracted {{negotiations}} {{took place}} over House conference negotiations on the bill, revolving in large part around Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield's eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from Vietnam; during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted. On August 5, the Nixon administration pleaded for <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> before the Senate went on recess, but Gravel blocked Stennis's attempt to limit debate, and no vote was held. Finally on September 21, 1971, the Senate invoked cloture over Gravel's second filibuster attempt by one vote, and then passed the two-year draft extension. Gravel's attempts to stop the draft had failed (notwithstanding Gravel's later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft, taken at face value in some media reports, during his 2008 presidential campaign).|$|E

Richard left England in May 1194, and Longchamp accompanied him to the continent, never to return to England; Longchamp returned to the Emperor's court in 1195. Richard continued to use Longchamp in diplomacy—although it was Geoffrey who arranged a truce with King Philip in 1194—as well as retaining the bishop as chancellor, but the main power in England was now Hubert Walter. Longchamp {{spent the rest of}} his life outside his diocese, usually accompanying the king.|$|E

When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to <b>a</b> <b>renewal</b> of protest.
