5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, {{but it may}} also be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País. The comedian turned mayor of Reykjavík, Iceland, Jón Gnarr, {{has gone so far}} as to say that he would not enter a coalition government with <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> not watched the series.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition is of concern for museum scientists, and also for <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E

5|$|SCI {{is present}} in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma. <b>Anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{undergone}} force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is {{at high risk for}} other injuries also. In 44% of SCI cases, other serious injuries are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma. Other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic fractures, and long bone fractures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> ever {{studied the}} history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been married {{for more than a}} year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance.

50|$|The Act {{contained}} an unusual feature, in {{that instead of}} coming into force on one particular date, it instead came into force on different dates {{in different parts of}} the world. It came into force in May 1793 in respect of acts done in Great Britain, and also in May in respect of anything done outside of Great Britain by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been in Great Britain at any time after 1 April. It came into force on 1 June in respect of anything done in Europe (other than Great Britain) by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been in Great Britain at any time between 1 April and 1 June. It came into force on 1 August as to any acts done outside Europe, but not beyond the Cape of Good Hope, by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been in Great Britain between 1 April and 1 August. It came into force on 1 November in respect of anything done beyond the Cape of Good Hope by <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been in Great Britain between 1 April and 1 November 1793.|$|R
5|$|The total herd size is {{relatively}} small. The population numbers stabilized somewhat {{at the beginning}} of the 21st century, with around 1500 broodmares, 150 active stallions and 500 births per year. In 2006, 455 new foals were registered, 1,051 mares and 89 stallions were listed as active breeding stock and there were 306 breeders, a term applied to <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> at least one active broodmare. In the same year, the Mérens made up 2 percent of total horses in France. A genetic study in 2008 considers the original type of the breed to be endangered. The author suggested that the Mérens should be a conservation priority in order to maintain the maximum genetic diversity among French horse breeds.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E
5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E

5|$|Zeratul is {{the early}} protagonist until his death {{at the hands of}} Artanis, who later became a player {{character}} in StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void. Zeratul reveals what the prophecies further after giving his memory onto Raynor. He was shocked upon learning the worst truth, an ancient race tries to destroy all life in the Universe and recreate it to his will. He tried to warn Artanis, leader of the Protoss, but was set aside when the Protoss launches an attack on Aiur to reclaim it. But the invasion is a trap set by the ancient one who corrupts the protoss, save for <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> no connection to Khala. Zeratul was killed trying to save Artanis by severing his nerve cords. Wracked with guilt, Artanis regrouped all survivors and set off to find survivors. Shakuras was overran by Zerg and Hybrid and the surviving Dark Templar Protoss, chose to destroy Shakuras by overloading the temple. They also ended Hybrid production by destroying the facilities, along with the Terrans that served Amon, the Ancient Xel'Naga. They also find an ancient and sealed race named Purifiers and the former Xel'Naga's minions, the Tal'Darim sided with him, with the condition that he help a rogue Ascendant to kill the leader in a duel to the death. They later reclaim Aiur again, this time successfully liberating the corrupted Protoss. Kerrigan and Raynor appears later, when another Xel'Naga calls them to the Void, Kerrigan absorbed the Xel'Naga's powers and used it to kill Amon once and for all.|$|E
