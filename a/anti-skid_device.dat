40|$|The {{interest}} for effective preventive strategies for slips and falls is growing. Much {{remains to be}} done, however, to prevent slips and falls in the traffic environment. Some pedestrians are injured because of slippery pavements and roadways. Using an appropriate <b>anti-skid</b> <b>device</b> may {{reduce the risk of}} slips and falls on different surfaces outdoors during winter. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate new anti-skid devices on the Swedish market representing three different designs of anti-skid devices; heel device, fore-foot device and whole-foot device on different slippery surfaces, gravel, sand, salt, snow and ice. The evaluations were done according to subject's perceived walking safety and balance, videorecordings of walking postures and movements, time to take on and off each <b>anti-skid</b> <b>device,</b> advantages/disadvantages with each <b>anti-skid</b> <b>device</b> and a list of priority for own use according to three criteria; safety, balance and appearance. Practical tests were carried out on different slippery surfaces, gravel, sand, salt, snow and ice. The subject's were randomly selected from the registered population over 55 years in a city in northern Sweden. The results showed that eight or more of the ten subjects perceived all four anti-skid devices as fairly good or good regarding walking safety and balance when walking on gravel, sand, and salt. <b>Anti-skid</b> <b>device</b> 3, a whole-foot device was perceived as having none or bad walking safety and balance on snow by seven subjects and <b>anti-skid</b> <b>device</b> 4, a heel device, as having none or bad walking balance on ice by all ten subjects. Eight subjects walked with a normal muscle function in the hip and knee with all anti-skid devices on all surfaces. Small deviations in walking posture and movements were noted in one to two subjects when walking on different surfaces, but no systematic difference between the devices. <b>Anti-skid</b> <b>device</b> 1 'Rewa', a fixed heel device, was perceived as the most rapid one to take on. All four devices were perceived as easy to use and as giving good foothold. <b>Anti-skid</b> <b>device</b> 1 'Rewa' and 4 'Thulin-spike', both heel devices, had the highest priority according to walking safety. 'Rewa' also had the highest priority according to walking balance as well as own use. When combining the criterias 'Rewa' had the highest priority according to walking safety and balance, priority for own use, time to take on and easiness to use...|$|E
40|$|Every {{year there}} are {{thousands}} of pedestrians in Sweden who are injured because of slippery pavements and roadways. Using an appropriate <b>anti-skid</b> <b>device</b> may reduce the risk of slips and falls on ice and snow. Methods to describe functional problems in walking on different slippery surfaces during winter have been developed as rating scales for evaluating walking safety and walking balance and an observation method to observe posture and movements during walking. Practical tests of all 25 anti-skid devices on the market in Sweden were carried out on different slippery surfaces; gravel, sand, salt, snow and ice. The anti-skid devices were described according to the subjects' perception of walking safety, walking balance and priority for own use. The postures and movements during walking were analysed by an expert physical therapist. The wholefoot device 'studs' was perceived as the best according to walking safety and walking balance and had the highest priority for own use...|$|E
40|$|Wheel Slide Protection Systems (WSP Systems) or <b>Anti-Skid</b> <b>Devices</b> {{for rail}} {{vehicles}} {{have to go}} through a series of Dynamometer tests before test runs with equipped rail vehicles are permitted. The simulation tests are performed on Wheel Slide Protection Dynamometers (WSPD). The WSPD used for the tests in this thesis is placed in the laboratory of DB Systemtechnik in Germany. The function of a WSPD and possible improvements, which have been suggested by the UIC Report 2 of the task group B 164, are discussed within the thesis. One of the improvements is the implementation of adhesion curves in the simulation that are dependent of the wheel slip velocity. The implementation of this improvement in the named WSPD algorithm is explained as well the findings of a before and after test. The conclusion show that adhesion dependent wheel slip curves in the simulation algorithm of a WSPD are necessary to test a WSP Systems ability of finding the maximum adhesion during the braking process...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} human-centred methodologies-subjective, objective, and combined-are used for {{slipperiness}} measurement. They comprise {{a variety of}} approaches from biomechanically-oriented experiments to psychophysical tests and subjective evaluations. The objective {{of this paper is}} to review some of the research done in the field, including such topics as awareness and perception of slipperiness, postural and balance control, rating scales for balance, adaptation to slippery conditions, measurement of unexpected movements, kinematics of slipping, and protective movements during falling. The role of human factors in slips and falls will be discussed. Strengths and weaknesses of human-centred approaches in relation to mechanical slip test methodologies are considered. Current friction-based criteria and thresholds for walking without slipping are reviewed for a number of work tasks. These include activities such as walking on a level or an inclined surface, running, stopping and jumping, as well as stair ascent and descent, manual exertion (pushing and pulling, load carrying, lifting) and particular concerns of the elderly and mobility disabled persons. Some future directions for slipperiness measurement and research in the field of slips and falls are outlined. Human-centred approaches for slipperiness measurement do have many applications. First, they are utilized to develop research hypotheses and models to predict workplace risks caused by slipping. Second, they are important alternatives to apparatus-based friction measurements and are used to validate such methodologies. Third, they are used as practical tools for evaluating and monitoring slip resistance properties of footwear, <b>anti-skid</b> <b>devices</b> and floor surfaces...|$|R
