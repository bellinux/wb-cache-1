5000|$|In 2014, Discover, an American general {{audience}} science magazine, {{published a}} blog article by Keith Kloor concerning Ahmed's Guardian article about a supposedly [...] "NASA-sponsored" [...] and funded {{study of the}} collapse of industrial civilisation. Kloor objected to the lack of independent responses to the paper, yet to be published at the time, from other scholars in the field. A second post on the study by Kloor detailed serious reservations by specialists on the collapse study leading to an assertion that Ahmed had made an [...] "uncritical appraisal". The story was reported internationally by other media outlets, but Ahmed's claims about NASA were officially rejected. In a statement, NASA commented that the collapse study [...] "was not solicited, directed or reviewed by NASA. It is an independent study by the university researchers utilizing research tools developed for a separate NASA activity. As is the case with all independent research, the views and conclusions in the paper <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> alone. NASA does not endorse the paper or its conclusions." ...|$|E
