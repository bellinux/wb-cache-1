40|$|The paper {{presents}} utilisation of the <b>acoustic</b> borehole <b>imaging</b> method {{within the}} frame of structural geology research. <b>Acoustic</b> borehole <b>imaging</b> is a useful tool describing borehole walls.

Furthermore {{it is possible to}} determine direction of present kinematic indicators on the oriented core (and fracture planes). Identified fault planes and kinematic indicators are valuable information for structural geology research, particularly for paleostress analysis.

40|$|The {{miniaturization}} {{and three}} dimensional die stacking in advanced microelectronic packages poses {{a big challenge}} to their non-destructive evaluation by <b>acoustic</b> micro <b>imaging.</b> In particular, their complicated structures and multiple interfaces make the interpretation of acoustic data even more difficult. A common phenomenon observed in <b>acoustic</b> micro <b>imaging</b> of microelectronic packages is the edge effect phenomena, which obscures the detection of defects such as cracks and voids.

C-line plots are then derived from the simulated B-scan images to quantitatively analyze the edge effect.

50|$|In the half-century {{since the}} first {{experiments}} directly leading {{to the development of}} acoustic microscopes, at least three basic types of acoustic microscope have been developed.

For details of development see the History section below. More recently acoustic microscopes based around picosecond ultrasonics systems have demonstrated <b>acoustic</b> <b>imaging</b> in cells using sub-optical wavelengths working with ultrasonic frequencies into the multi-GHz. Since the vast majority of acoustic microscopes in use today are C-SAM type instruments, this discussion will be limited to these instruments.|$|E

A virtual transducer is designed in the finite element model to reduce the coupling fluid domain, and its performance is characterised against the physical transducer specification. The numerical results showed that the Under Bump Metallization (UBM) structure inside the package has {{a significant impact on the}} edge effect. Simulated wavefields also showed that the edge effect is mainly attributed to the horizontal scatter, which is observed in the interface of silicon die-to-the outer radius of solder bump.

5000|$|Acoustic seabed {{classification}} is the partitioning of a seabed {{acoustic image}} into discrete physical entities or classes. This {{is a particularly}} active area of development {{in the field of}} seabed mapping, marine geophysics, underwater acoustics and benthic habitat mapping. Seabed [...] classification is one route to characterizing the seabed and its habitats.

Acoustic seabed classification is possible using a wide range of <b>acoustic</b> <b>imaging</b> systems including multibeam echosounders, sidescan sonar, single-beam echosounders, interferometric systems and sub-bottom profilers.
