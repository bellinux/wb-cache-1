50|$|The {{scope of}} the CAMO is to {{organize}} and manage all documents and publications for Maintenance Organizations Part 145 and Part M approved, like development and management of aircraft maintenance programmes fulfilled. A CAMO must also provide record keeping of maintenance performed. In other words, a CAMO provides a service for aircraft maintenance organizations. EASA {{has the power to}} give CAMO second privileges also but not in all cases. These second privileges allow the CAMO to conduct <b>airworthiness</b> <b>review</b> on aircraft, issue (or recommend for issue) <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Review</b> Certificates and issue 'permit to fly' for maintenance check flights.|$|E
50|$|Between 2000 and 2003, the {{remaining}} K2s were retired and scrapped. The surviving K3s served as tanker/transports with No. 101 Squadron at Brize Norton, Oxfordshire {{and the single}} remaining K4 supported No. 1312 Flight at RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands. In January 2010, VC10 passenger operations were temporarily suspended while an <b>airworthiness</b> <b>review</b> was carried out.|$|E
50|$|Personnel {{required}} to be employed in a CAMO are the Accountable Manager (which can be the same person for CAMO and operator), the Quality Manager (to ensure all EASA requirements are in compliance) and appropriately qualified staff for airworthiness management. These personnel must be mentioned in the CAME. In case of second privileges <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Review</b> Staff must be employed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAutorotation landing is {{a special}} {{manoeuvre}} for helicopter when the engine failed. In this situation, it requires the pilot's accurate management, correct judgment and decision on time to enter into steady autorotation. After entry into steady autorotation, then according to the flight altitude and speed, select the landing position, flare from autorotation, and perform a power-off landing successfully. Herein, it will be discussed how the helicopter performs the autorotation when losing the power, including the affecting factors. And refer to the <b>airworthiness</b> regulation, <b>review</b> the relevant sections, discuss the concerning aspect in the certification flight. Finally, it will through reviewing the autorotation flight compliance report of a helicopter, to understand those concerning aspects...|$|R
40|$|The ALTUS Cumulus Electrification Study (ACES) is an {{uninhabited}} aerial vehicle (UAV) -based {{project that}} will investigate thunderstorms {{in the vicinity}} of the Florida Everglades in August 2002. ACES is being conducted to both investigate storm electrical activity and its relationship to storm morphology, and validate Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite measurements. In addition, as part of NASA's UAV-based science demonstration program, this project will provide a scientifically useful demonstration of the utility and promise of UAV platforms for Earth science and applications observations. Part of the demonstration involves getting approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration and the NASA <b>airworthiness</b> flight safety <b>review</b> board. ACES will employ the ALTUS II aircraft, built by General Atomics - Aeronautical Systems, Inc. Key science objectives simultaneously addressed by ACES are to: (1) investigate lightning-storm relationships, (2) study storm electrical budgets, and (3) provide Lightning Imaging Sensor validation. The ACES payload, already developed and flown on ALTUS, includes electrical, magnetic, and optical sensors to remotely characterize the lightning activity and the electrical environment within and around thunderstorms. ACES will contribute important electrical and optical measurements not available from other sources. Also, the high altitude vantage point of the UAV observing platform (up to 55, 000 feet) offers a useful 'cloud-top' perspective. By taking advantage of its slow flight speed (70 to 100 knots), long endurance, and high altitude flight, the ALTUS will be flown near, and when possible, above (but never into) thunderstorms for long periods of time, allowing investigations to be conducted over entire storm life cycles. In addition, concurrent ground-based observations will enable the UAV measurements to be more completely interpreted and evaluated in the context of the thunderstorm structure, evolution, and environment...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{availability}} and operational readiness of an aircraft are requisites {{for its ability}} to operate. After the aircraft has been supplied, both features determine airworthiness of the aircraft, in compliance with the ARC (<b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Review</b> Certificate). Improvement in methods of maintaining the aircraft availability proceeds in compliance with the MSG (Maintenance Steering Group) rules. The paper has been intended to outline the process of maintaining the engineering availability of the aircraft, with account taken of: aircraft maintainability, importance of the engineering diagnostics, and evaluation rates for different maintenance patterns. Maintaining technical ability / airworthiness of an aircraft, ground service of aircrafts, service-friendliness of an aircraft, unfitness and damages to an aircraft, ground diagnostic and provision equipment for A- 380, computer aided verification of an inspection of a front undercarriage (B) of an aircraft (A) and service of the B- 787 aircraft (C), percentage for composite material portion in the structure of some aircrafts and helicopters, positions of composite material airframe elements in B- 757 / 767, B- 777, B- 787 are presented in the paper...|$|E
