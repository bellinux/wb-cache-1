5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of the porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E

If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
5|$|The {{reforms of}} Sejanus most {{significantly}} included {{the founding of}} the Castra Praetoria, which established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force, for which it is primarily known today. Henceforth the Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, and the rulers were equally <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of the Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31, when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of Western influences.|$|E

5|$|After Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines {{suffered}} from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred much {{later on in}} the 15th century, by that time the Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341–71) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.|$|E

Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E

5|$|Imagine {{is set in}} post-apocalyptic Tokyo. In {{the events}} leading up to Imagine, which were {{depicted}} in Shin Megami Tensei. Humanity began experimenting with new technologies during the 1990s: among the discoveries made was the fact that all life and reality was made up of data. When demons began appearing across the world, chaos ensued with the rising of opposing factions supported by human sympathizers: servants of God who sought to bring order, and servants of Lucifer who spread chaos. The conflict culminated into the international launching of ICBMs, which devastated the world and left humanity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of demons. During the events of Shin Megami Tensei, a group of young people defied both God and Lucifer in creating a world where humans could flourish again.|$|E

5|$|Most of them {{unscrewed}} at {{once and}} 530kilograms (1170lb) of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump 210kilograms of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of the wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E

5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally off to the side in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of the elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind that made them lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was settled by voyages from South America {{and set out to}} prove that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the accidental voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been settled by intentional voyaging so migrations must have happened by accidental drift voyages. Sharp granted that Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, but held the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational tools were not reliable for intentional sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely accidental voyages, with landfall <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of wind and current. A 1973 study and computer simulation by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E

5|$|Round {{the rims}} of deserts, where more {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This {{may have happened}} when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, they were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which {{are at risk of}} erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm's great {{achievement}} was {{the adoption of}} the Constitution of May 3, 1791, often described as Europe's first modern written national constitution, and the world's second, after the United States Constitution. The Polish Constitution was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had placed a sejm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The May 3rd Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's reactionary magnates, with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} {{sought to}} supplant the prevailing anarchy fostered {{by some of}} the country's magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy. It introduced elements of political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. It banned parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which had put the Sejm <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>mercy</b> of any deputy who could revoke all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. The Commonwealth's neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the constitution. Frederick William II's Kingdom of Prussia broke its alliance with the Commonwealth, which was attacked and then defeated in the War in Defence of the Constitution by an alliance between Catherine the Great's Imperial Russia and the Targowica Confederation of anti-reform Polish magnates and landless nobility. The King, a principal co-author, eventually capitulated to the Confederates.|$|E

His power returned but left him drained and vulnerable when he used it, again leading to self-doubt about his value to the team.
