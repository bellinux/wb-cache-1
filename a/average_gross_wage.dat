40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the problems and}} prospects of identification and assessment for achieving the final Lithuania's success of the integration into European Monetary Union since 1 st of January, 2015. So the main aim {{of this paper is}} to assess the possibilities of Lithuania fully integrate by predicting the inflation rate changes since 2014 in 6 month period. Methods of scientific literature analysis, information grouping, comparison, and generalization and detail techniques were used. One of the most effective measure, that helped Slovenia to control the inflation and finally adopt the euro, was the macro-economic model SLOPOL 6. It is a tool for forecasting macroeconomic developments over the short and medium run and for evaluating alternative policies aiming at influencing the business cycle, at stabilizing inflation. According to an econometric model, the most important variables that can affect the inflation rate is the average monthly gross salary, level of production capacity and national currency exchange rate, expressed in the largest export partner country‘s currency. The research results show that there is high probability that convergence criteria for inflation will be fulfilled, but there is a risk that inflation may be uncontrolled. Assuming that in period of January and June, 2014 the <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> <b>wage</b> and labour levels of production capability will grow at the same pace as in period of January and June, 2013 since January- April, 2014 the inflation level would increase to 1. 8 percent.

The {{purpose of}} the article is to define some {{elements}} of the economic recovery in Croatia animed at the social priority of overcoming the poverty of large groups of the Croatian population, especially of retired and unemployed people. Retired and unemployed people have suffered the most from economic recession and war. The average monthly pension {{is little more than}} 40 % of the monthly average net wage of an employee in the legal economic sector. The <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> <b>wage</b> of an employee in Croatia is not lower than the <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> <b>wage</b> in the other transition countries of Central Europe. In order to overcome social tensions and solve the problems of poverty it should be necessary to adopt a policy of economic recovery with the aim of realizing high growth rates of the economy as a prerequisite to solving general social and structural problems. In this respect, an expansive fiscal policy should be implemented, using deficit financing to increase aggregate demand, especcially by financing an additional retirement fund and public investment, as for instance housing investment. The standard of living of retired people should be improved by increasing their average monthly pensions to the level of 70 per cent of their previous average monthly net wages or of the current average net wage. It would therefore surpass the poverty line by about 30 percentage points. An expansive fiscal policy should be coordinated with monetary and exchange rate policies to achieve the competitivness of the export sector on the European market. The tax system and budget expenditure policy should be reformed and restructured in the following way: the criteria should be to avoid an increase in unit labor costs in the business sector, to keep competitivness, and to raise capacity utilization of the economy. The tax system reform should include a tax system, budget expenditure should be restructured to decrease military expenditure and to offset public investment with a long term repayment period and high capital output ratios.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{estimate}} the number of deaths, potential years of lost working life and, loss of productivity attributable to tobacco by the year 2014 for the Spanish population older than 35 years old. Material and Methods Considering the human capital approach, labor productivity was approximated through remuneration in the labor market using the <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> <b>wage.</b> Employment data were obtained from the INE's Labor Force Survey. Deaths were obtained from the Register of Deaths. Relative risks associated to death rate with active cigarette smoking and smoking cessation was applied. The future values obtained were applied an annual discount rate of 3 % and an annual rate of growth of labor productivity of 1 %. Univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed on discount rates and labor productivity growth rates. Potential Years of Lost Work Life (APVLP) were also estimated. Results In summary, between 13. 243 - 14. 158 deaths have been estimated to be attributable to smoking to a population older than 35 years old. In addition, {{it has been estimated that}} between 21. 830 - 23. 271 of APVLP because of this habit. Therefore, this corresponded to 248. 86 - 266. 60 million euros of monetary losses in 2014. Most of the losses are concentrated in the malignant tumors of the trachea, bronchi, and lung. Conclusions The monetary value attributed to labor losses associated with smoking mortality was high especially for oncological related diseases. Therefore, it is important to include these costs in economic evaluations of tobacco programs.

40|$|In this thesis, I have {{examined}} how Norwegian prices on various consumption {{goods and services}} differ from the prices in other wealthy countries in Europe. The goal has been {{to find out how}} expensive it actually is to live an average life for an average citizen in Norway. The data used is based on European purchasing power parities study published by Eurostat. A key variable is the Price Level Index, which is an index {{for the price of a}} certain good or category of goods measured in a common unit, which makes it possible to compare price levels across countries. Another key variable is the Purchasing Power Standards, which are based on price level indices by converting these into an artificial common currency. Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) can thus be used when comparing quantities, like GDP per capita or consumption per capita, across countries. The empirical results are based on twelve main consumption categories. These categories include both goods and services paid by the households as well as goods and services that are covered by the government. The results confirm that within most of the consumption categories, Norway does have one of the highest price levels among all the economies surveyed. These high price levels are a result of a high income level - high gross domestic product per capita and on high wages. Prices on alcohol and tobacco are exceptionally high in Norway, when compared to other economies. But on these goods, high prices are due to a political decision-making rather than being a result of economic development. However, prices in Norway are not high for all the goods and services within the twelve categories. Both housing and other communal services as well as the communication sector are relatively inexpensive in Norway compared to the other European countries. Presumably, the reasons for that include governmental subsidies and different taxation policies. In addition, one must not forget the fact that consumers in different countries have different tastes and preferences, making the universal comparison more complicated. As prices influence both the quantity produced and the patterns of consumption, the thesis also takes a look at to what extent prices actually influence households’ consumption expenditure based on income levels. In case of Norway, the evidence indicates that when prices are measured against households’ <b>average</b> <b>gross</b> <b>wage,</b> there does not seem to be any clear effect on consumption patterns. However, when prices are measured against households’ net average wages, there seems to be a slight effect on households’ consumption. Thus Norwegian income tax and social security contributions do have an impact on actual consumer demand. The results show that for an average citizen working in Norway, it is not an expensive country to live in. This is because wages fit the prices and many of the vital services like healthcare, housing and education are partly covered by the state...|$|E

The assurance of a decent level of life depends on the degree of development of the society quantified in GDP and in the way that this is used. By looking at the fiscality impact upon the level of living, analyzed at the level of the employed population, we notice that the one that is taxed, is the most important category. This matter is supported by the numbers of share employees in all of the employed population (over 50 %),in the year 2003 share being 56, 04 %. By analyzing the salary in the period 1990 - 2005 a few conclusions have been drawn: - In the period 1992 - 1994 the <b>average</b> real <b>gross</b> <b>wage</b> dropped, but in the period 1994 - 1996 a rise has been encountered.
