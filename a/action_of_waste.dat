To provide guidance to disposal vendors and nuclear station waste generators for implementing those requirements, the NRC developed the Technical Position on Waste Form, Revision 1. That document details a specified set of recommended testing procedures and criteria, including several tests {{for determining the}} biodegradation properties <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> forms. Cement has been widely used to solidify LLW; however, the resulting waste forms are sometimes susceptible to failure due to the <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> constituents, stress, and environment. The purpose of this research program is to develop modified microbial degradation test procedures that will be more appropriate than the existing procedures for evaluating the effects of microbiologically influenced chemical attack on cement-solidified LLW. Groups of microorganisms indigenous to LLW disposal sites are being employed that can metabolically convert organic and inorganic substrates into organic and mineral acids. Such acids aggressively react with cement and can ultimately lead to structural failure. Results {{over the past year}} on the application of mechanisms inherent in microbially influenced degradation of cement-based material are the focus of the annual report. Data-validated evidence of the potential for microbially influenced deterioration of cement-solidified LLW and subsequent release of radionuclides has been developed during this study...|$|R

Currently, third-sector bulky waste recycling and reuse schemes (e. g. furniture reuse organisations (FROs)) redistribute approximately 2 · 5 million items annually, largely to needy families and individuals, thus diverting – or at least delaying – landfill disposal.

Turning to the efficacy of existing collection and reuse services, this paper considers: the various routes available for disposal; the operational effectiveness of FROs; and key aspects of the relationship between local authorities and FROs, such as coordination in communication and collection, funding and management of partnerships.

The two processes <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and repair go on together. Hence with faculties habitually exercised--as the senses of all persons, or the muscles of any one who is strong--it happens that, during moderate activity, the repair is so nearly equal to the waste, that the diminution of power is scarcely appreciable; {{and it is only}} when the activity has been long continued, or has been very violent, that the repair becomes so far in arrear <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> as to produce a perceptible prostration.

The classical theories of Ferdinand Tönnies and Georg Simmel are starting points in a discussion which ends in modern theories of urbanism {{as a way of}} life. In modern urbanism three spheres of life are distinguished; the private sphere, the neighborhood sphere and the public sphere. Especially the social structuring of the neighborhood sphere seems to be extremely important in processes of behavior change, e. g. in measures <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management and energy saving. The second part of the paper centers on urbanism and forms of life in Sweden. A discussion follows on social segregation, housing management and forms of tenure which ends in identification of different forms of life in the swedish housing market, the rental sector, the cooperative sector and the private sector.

A waste management plan designated for an extensive territory is a project comprising the following elements: the sequence <b>of</b> <b>actions,</b> the scope <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> collection and treatment actions; systems and methods <b>of</b> household <b>waste</b> collection, decontamination and processing; the number of collectors, collection procedure, and items of treatment machinery; the expediency of design, construction, reconstruction or expansion <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management facilities, their basic specifications and location, as well as the capital investments to be made into construction, purchase and installation <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management facilities. A waste management plan may be designated for a separate inhabited locality and the whole region. Despite the above, regional plans are preferable. The regional waste management plan analyzed in this article is designated for the territory of the Republic of Dagestan. It was developed by the specialists of MosvodokanalNIIproject in furtherance of the decree issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Republic of Dagestan. The top-priority objectives underlying the plan development included reduction of the overall amount <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> its toxicity (and other harmful properties), increase in the share <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> recyclable into secondary raw materials, and phasedown of land-filling. Identification of tentative locations <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> processing facilities requires preliminary land use planning, so that several municipal units or a group of settlements were serviced by a certain waste processing facility with account for the local terrain and climate, as well as reasonable waste transfer routes. Waste handling scenarios embrace various advanced technologies and their combinations, as they consider the projected increase in the municipal waste production rate for the term of up to ten years. Selection of the optimum option is to be based on the principle that any waste handling system is to comply with local standards of living and potential fundraising efforts. Any waste management plan designated for a region shall not exceed a term of five years, while projections may embrace up to 10 – 20 years. Any waste management plan developed for a territory may only be implemented in case of a well-coordinated cooperation between waste handling enterprises, local authorities and the local population.

Even if the role of occupants’ behavior is widely acknowledged {{to be a key}} factor influencing energy consumption in buildings, these predictive models are not used to quantify specific benefits deriving from precise occupants’ actions. In this work, a numerical–experimental campaign is carried out in a village of green buildings in central Italy, where the most innovative and efficient technologies are already implemented and, therefore, where further physical active or passive retrofits would not be cost-effective. This work demonstrates that, through a sophisticated theoretical–experimental modeling of a residential village, a substantial further energy saving is still to be achieved through zero-cost simple actions, i. e. human-based energy retrofits. Ordinary <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>waste</b> reduction are described within the physical model with the final purpose to quantify the effect of occupancy operations considered at the same level of traditional physical retrofit scenarios.

This work shows that, when theoretical dynamic simulation models are performed in order to investigate buildings’ thermal-energy behavior and predict the cost-benefit efficacy of common physical energy retrofits, simple and effective human-based energy retrofits should be considered at the same level of physical retrofits, and even before them, for their intrinsic technical and economical efficacy...|$|R
