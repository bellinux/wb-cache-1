5|$|Helium–neon lasers, {{a type of}} low-powered {{gas laser}} {{producing}} a red beam, had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser pointers, before they were <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> replaced by cheaper diode lasers.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} such fossil is the reputed bilaterian Vernanimalcula {{claimed by}} some, however, {{to represent the}} infilling of an egg-sac or acritarch. Later examples are <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> accepted as bilaterians and include the mollusc-like Kimberella, Spriggina (pictured) and the shield-shaped Parvancorina whose affinities are currently debated.|$|E
5|$|This {{could of}} course have simply been {{a case of}} Smuts's diffidence and reserve re-asserting itself {{in the face of}} new and {{unfamiliar}} surrounding; however Smuts's biographers <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> ascribe it to the poverty Smuts endured during this first year.|$|E
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care {{must be taken to}} prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|Asser is {{sometimes}} {{cited as a}} source for the legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's Life. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire Life is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> accepted as genuine.|$|E
5|$|In 1784, Belgium's {{population}} was 2.6million, with just 25 percent living in cities. During the 19th century, the population both expanded and urbanized. Between 1830 and 1875 {{the population of}} Brussels grew from 100,000 to 180,000, and by 1910 {{the population of the}} metropolitan area soared to 750,000. The population of Belgium was <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> Roman Catholic, though free-thinking movements like Freemasonry were also popular among intellectuals and the urban middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Rates of DKA {{vary around}} the world. In the United Kingdom, about 4% {{of people with}} type 1 {{diabetes}} develop DKA each year, while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. DKA was first described in 1886 and, until the introduction of insulin therapy in the 1920s, it was <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> fatal. The risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is currently around 1–4%. Up to 1% of children with DKA develop a complication known as cerebral edema.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{decompression}} sickness after diving {{can be managed}} through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon, though it remains to some degree unpredictable. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> use decompression tables or dive computers to limit or monitor their exposure and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures. If DCS is contracted, it is usually treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|Ostrom's {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969 {{has been described}} as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This development has been termed the dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of Deinonychus and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> accepted.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest {{that more than half of}} the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} {{description}} of diabetic ketoacidosis {{is attributed to}} Julius Dreschfeld, a German pathologist working in Manchester, United Kingdom. In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in London, he drew on reports by Adolph Kussmaul as well as describing the main ketones, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination. The condition remained <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> fatal until the discovery of insulin in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29 percent, and by the 1950s it had become less than 10 percent. The entity of cerebral edema due to DKA was described in 1936 {{by a team of}} doctors from Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} on 5 June at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité in Montmartre, more than 4,000 people were present. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who {{included}} Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic Halévy, Léon Halévy, and Massenet. An orchestra under Pasdeloup played Patrie, and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from Carmen. At the burial which followed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet {{had been struck}} down {{just as he was}} becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards the end of his address, Gounod broke down and was unable to deliver his final peroration. After a special performance of Carmen at the Opéra-Comique that night, the press which had <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> condemned the piece three months earlier now declared Bizet a master.|$|E
5|$|Decisive for {{the verdict}} about the {{legality}} of both pontificates were not the legal arguments, but {{the attitude of the}} Catholic world, which had <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> recognized Innocent II. His main supporters were Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, Archbishop of Magdeburg Norbert of Xanten and King Lothair III of Germany. The few secular lords who had initially supported Anacletus gradually abandoned his cause as lost; only King Roger II of Sicily, who had received the crown from Anacletus in exchange for support, stood at his side to the very end. Although Anacletus II was able to retain the control of the city of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter until his death in January 1138, his successor quickly made his submission to Innocent II, who is now regarded as true Pope.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E
5|$|Rugby union {{took root}} in Wales in 1850, when Reverend Rowland Williams became Vice-Principal at St David's College, Lampeter, where he {{introduced}} the sport. Wales played their first international on 19 February 1881; organised by Newport's Richard Mullock, Wales played against England, losing by seven goals, one drop goal and six tries to nil (8–0). On 12 March 1881, the Welsh Rugby Union was formed at The Castle Hotel, Neath. Two years later, the Home Nation Championshipnow the Six Nations Championshipwas first played and Wales did not register a win. However, rugby in Wales developed and, by the 1890s, the Welsh had developed the four three-quarters formation. This formation – with seven backs and eight forwards, instead of six backs and nine forwards – revolutionised {{the sport and}} was eventually adopted <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> at international and club level.|$|E
5|$|The Mauritius {{campaign}} of 1809–1811 {{was a series}} of amphibious operations and naval actions fought to determine possession of the French Indian Ocean territories of Isle de France and Île Bonaparte during the Napoleonic Wars. The campaign lasted from the spring of 1809 until the spring of 1811, and saw both the Royal Navy and the French Navy deploy substantial frigate squadrons with the intention of disrupting or protecting trade from British India. In a war in which the Royal Navy was <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> dominant at sea, the campaign is especially notable for the local superiority enjoyed by the French Navy in the autumn of 1810 following the British disaster at the Battle of Grand Port, the most significant defeat for the Royal Navy in the entire conflict. After their victory, the British used the original Dutch name of Mauritius for Isle de France. In 1814, Île Bonaparte was returned to France, who eventually renamed it La Réunion.|$|E
5|$|The aye-aye is <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, {{though the}} tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E
5|$|A {{spin-off}} titled Summer Days, {{was released}} on June 23, 2006, retelling the original game during summer vacation and {{from the perspective of}} Setsuna Kiyoura. Unlike its predecessor, however, Summer Days was <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> panned for its heavily bugged state, loads of patches, and recall. Another spin-off titled Cross Days {{was released on}} March 19, 2010. Set in the same continuity as School Days, Cross Days follows the life of another protagonist, Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls, Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura, during his second term at Sakakino Academy. The game also features yaoi scenarios, during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid. 0verflow released Shiny Days on February 2, 2012 which establishes a solid link between the Days series and Radish Vacation series. A third spin-off, Island Days, was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3, 2014. The game, developed by Klon, focuses on Makoto and the girls becoming trapped on a remote island and includes tower defense elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} in group 12 are usually {{considered to be}} d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are <b>almost</b> <b>universally</b> considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare {{and those that do}} exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, −. According to IUPAC's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested {{that it would be better}} to regard mercury as not being a transition metal.|$|E
