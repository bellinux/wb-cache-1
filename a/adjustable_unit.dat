40|$|We propose semi-random {{features}} for nonlinear function approximation. The flexibility of semi-random feature lies between the fully <b>adjustable</b> <b>units</b> in deep {{learning and the}} random features used in kernel methods. For one hidden layer models with semi-random features, we prove with no unrealistic assumptions that the model classes contain an arbitrarily good function as the width increases (universality), and despite non-convexity, we can find such a good function (optimization theory) that generalizes to unseen new data (generalization bound). For deep models, with no unrealistic assumptions, we prove universal approximation ability, a lower bound on approximation error, a partial optimization guarantee, and a generalization bound. Depending on the problems, the generalization bound of deep semi-random features can be exponentially better than the known bounds of deep ReLU nets; our generalization error bound can be independent of the depth, the number of trainable weights {{as well as the}} input dimensionality.

Improving its power efficiency is a very urgent topical objective, because its power consumption is a significant part in the structure of power consumption of water utilities. The aim of the present study is to identify opportunities of improving the power efficiency of pumping stations due to the automatic control of the pump group. The paper presents results of the study of the instantaneous efficiency changes of booster pumping stations under the conditions of variable water consumption. The basic reasons of the reducing pumping plant efficiency are reported in the article. Among them, there is a sharp decline in the effectiveness of the regulated pump units, when they functioning for the hydraulic network with a significant static component of the pressure. The main factors affecting the duration of the <b>adjustable</b> pumping <b>unit</b> in inefficient area are determined. The method of controlling a group of pumping units, taking into account the instantaneous efficiency of each of them was suggested. The approbation of this method at the local booster pumping stations was fulfilled. The effects of disabling the controlled pump unit which is in the ineffective area, on the overall efficiency of the pumping station and on alteration of its output pressure immediately after the pump is switched off are studied. It was shown that the timely shutdown of an inefficiently controlled pump unit can reduce the power consumption of the pumping plant by 8 – 10 % as compared to the traditional control methods. The range of variation of the instantaneous efficiency of the pumping station can serve as a criterion of correct selection of pumping equipment as well it can be the rationale of the necessity for its replacement. </p...|$|R

Cadmium sulfide (CdS) thin films are commonly used as buffer layers in thin film solar cells and can be produced by a number of solution and vacuum methods. We report the continuous solution deposition of CdS on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass substrates using Microreactor-Assisted Solution Deposition (MASD (TM)). A flow system consisting of a microscale T-mixer and a novel adjustable residence time microchannel heat exchanger has been utilized in this study. The CdS thin film synthesis involves a multistage mechanism in which an undesirable homogeneous reaction competes with the desired heterogeneous reaction. A microchannel heat exchanger with an <b>adjustable</b> residence time <b>unit</b> has been developed to optimize the reaction residence time and favor heterogeneous growth. Optimization of CdS reaction solution residence time facilitates improved control of CdS synthesis by minimizing the homogeneous reaction and subsequently improving key parameters for process scale-up such as yield and selectivity.

However, with increased pressure on cropland available from environmental effects and urbanization, new innovative methods of crop production need to be researched in order to increase agricultural production with limited land. This research focuses on the design of a single form of urban agriculture that is considered Zfarming and has the potential to produce quality urban agricultural produce through ground-based measures. This project produced detailed step-by-step analysis of the design process, develop variability within the modified hydroponic shipping container (MHSC) for research potential, create AutoCAD drawings of the different MHSC systems and components, and lastly identify which design areas can be improved with suggestions to commercial manufacturers for increasing productivity. The research oriented MHSC will contain four growing areas, each consisting of a growing, irrigation, environmental control system. The main purpose of this MHSC system is as a research module to compare to commercial products available. Throughout the design process, there has been a focus on variability in experimental execution in order to find the most optimal MHSC growing conditions. The MHSC can produce numerous crops, has <b>adjustable</b> supporting <b>units</b> to vary the growing tray slope up to 5. 5 %, allows different lighting sources, adjustable distance from plants to lights (from 2 ” to 54 ”), has an adjustable drain to vary water height from ½” to 2 ” within the growing trays, contains variable pump to vary the flow rate (0. 75 to 3 gpm), and potential for range of 3 to 60 air change per hour in the ventilation system. Four individual growing areas facilitate research experiments within one shipping container. To improve production based on observations from the bench tests conducted, a water cooling method was installed and the drain was re-designed. To improve the production potential of MHSCs, a focus increasing the environmental control accuracy, integration of harvesting automation, and improved energy efficiency are suggested. By designing this hydroponic shipping container to contain variable methods of production, further research will allow for optimization of production and an advantage in reaching the expected increase in food demand. ...|$|R
40|$|Remote Explosives Scent Tracing (REST) is {{the concept}} of {{bringing}} the mine field to Mine Detection Dogs or Rats, instead of vice versa. This is done by collecting air or dust from minefields, and taking these samples to a laboratory environment, where they are subsequently analysed by the detection animals. REST has previously proven to be very fast and cost effective, but one of the issues facing the method is that there is yet no reliable tool for sampling dust. In earlier sampling units, air has been collected in filters. However, the concentration of scents related to mines has been seen to be a million times higher in dust particles than in air sampled from above the ground. The aim of this project was to evaluate and improve a dust sampling prototype constructed in the beginning of 2010. The project was initiated in cooperation with the GICHD (Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian demining), and carried out in cooperation with APOPO (Anti-Personnel Landmines Detection Product Development). During this project, information was gathered on the samplers that have previously been used for REST. A new prototype was made in Trondheim in cooperation with NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology). With this new sampler prototype, tests were made in a laboratory environment at NTNU as well as at APOPO’s test mine field in Morogoro, Tanzania. Several obstacles were faced, such as difficulties to test and evaluate the sampler during the rainy season, insufficient air supply for the prototype, and issues with the laboratory equipment in Morogoro. Due to this, the number of tests performed and the number of repetitions of each test was not as high as would have been desired. The results of the information gathering and the tests are presented in this report, and the knowledge and experience gained resulted in several suggestions for improvements for the sampler prototype.

40|$|Abstract Background Adjustable shunts {{are very}} popular in the {{management}} of hydrocephalus and are believed to help in minimizing the number of surgical revisions. The drawback with almost all constructions is that they may be accidentally readjusted in relatively weak magnetic fields (around 30 – 40 mTesla) Materials and methods The ProGav Miethke shunt is composed of an <b>adjustable</b> ballon-spring valve <b>unit</b> and an integrated over-drainage compensating gravitational device (known as the shunt assistant). A mechanical 'brake' is intended to prevent changes to the valve's performance level in a strong magnetic field. We evaluated the performance and hydrodynamic properties of a sample of three valves in the UK Shunt Evaluation Laboratory. Results All the shunts showed good mechanical durability over the three-month period of testing, and good stability of hydrodynamic performance over a one-month period The pressure-flow performance curves, operating, opening and closing pressures fell within the limits specified by the manufacturer, and changed according to the programmed performance levels. The operating pressure increased when the shunt assistant was in the vertical position, as specified. The valve has a low hydrodynamic resistance (0. 53 mm mmHg ml - 1 min - 1). External programming proved to be easy and reliable. Strong magnetic fields from a 3 Tesla MR scanner were not able to change the programming of the valve. Conclusion The ProGAV shunt is an adjustable, low resistance valve that is able to limit posture-related over-drainage. Unlike other adjustable valves, the ProGAV cannot be accidentally re-adjusted by external magnetic field such as a 3 T MR scanner. </p...|$|R

According to the scale of Black a total of 97, 3 % showed an improvement, 75, 7 % demonstrated an even very good or good postoperative developing. All in all the neuro-imaging showed a tendency to only a minimal reduction of the ventricle width. We found a correlation between the radiologically noticed reduction of the ventricle width and the clinical outcome according to Stein & Langfitt, {{but there was no}} correlation found between the reduction of the ventricle width and the clinical outcome based on the Kiefer-Score. We observed one malposition of the ventricle catheter and two shunt infections (5, 3 %) in terms of valve-unrelated complications. There were no obstructions of the valve. During the survey three patients died from their underlying disease independent from the shunt therapy. In terms of valve-related complications we observed overdrainage in 5 cases (13, 16 %, four hygromas and one subdural hematoma), of which two were regressing spontaneously. The other three patients were helped by adjusting the opening pressure. In 14 cases (36, 8 %) we observed a functional underdrainage. Of these 14 patients a considerable improvement of the pathology could be achieved in seven cases by adjusting the opening pressure. There were a total of 0, 73 adjustments of the opening pressure per patient and - considered differently - 1, 5 adjustments per patient, whose opening pressure was adjusted at least once. Concerning the clinical outcome - including the adjustments of the opening pressure - 43, 2 % of our patients had a good or very good result immediately after the operation. After the adjustments the percentage increased to 75, 7 % (good or very good according to Black). Therefore 66, 7 % of the patients, whose opening pressure was adjusted, benefitted considerably from this possibility. The break release, the measurements and the adjustments of the opening pressure were uncomplicated and secure. We didn´t observe any spontaneous or MRI-related adjustments of the opening pressure. Altogether the clinical and radiological results indicate an advantage of proGAV over other valves and they justify its application in hydrocephalus diseases of all analyzed etiologies. However an accurate comparison is not possible until now - on the one hand because of the still to small sample size, on the other hand because of the internationally non-standardized study-design and the different definitions. Whether an <b>adjustable</b> gravitational <b>unit</b> can bring an additional benefit or not, will be shown in further {{clinical trial}}s...|$|R
