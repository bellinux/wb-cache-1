25|$|The {{issue of}} extramarital sex has been {{examined}} {{frequently in the}} United States. Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on convenience samples. <b>A</b> <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> means surveys are given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers). Convenience samples do not accurately reflect {{the population of the}} United States as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results. It should not be surprising, therefore, that surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results. These studies report that about 12–26% of married women and 15–43% of married men engage in extramarital sex.|$|E

5000|$|Recent {{research}} {{points at}} substantial {{differences in the}} cognitive styles of liberals and conservatives on psychological measures. For example, conservatives respond to threatening situations with more aggression than do liberals. Similarly, conservatives are more sensitive to threatening facial expressions. Jost and colleagues posed that political orientation is associated with psychological processes for managing fear and uncertainty A 2011 study by cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Kanai's group at University College London published in Current Biology, found a correlation between differences in political views and differences in brain structures in <b>a</b> <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> of students from University College London. The researchers performed MRI scans on the brains of 90 volunteer students who had indicated their political orientation on a five-point scale ranging from [...] "very liberal" [...] to [...] "very conservative". Students who reported more [...] "conservative" [...] political views tended to have larger amygdalae, a structure in the temporal lobes that performs a primary role in the processing and memory of emotions. In addition, they found clusters in which gray matter volume {{was significantly associated with}} conservativism in the left insula and the right entorhinal cortex. There is evidence that conservatives are more sensitive to disgust and the insula is involved in the feeling of disgust [...] On the other hand, more 'liberal' students tended to have a larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex, a structure of the brain associated with monitoring uncertainty and handling conflicting information. It is consistent with previous research suggesting that individuals with a larger ACC have a higher capacity to tolerate uncertainty and conflicts, allowing them to accept more liberal viewsThe authors concluded that, [...] "Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes." [...] In an interview with LiveScience, Ryota Kanai said, [...] "It's very unlikely that actual political orientation is directly encoded in these brain regions", and that, [...] "more work is needed to determine how these brain structures mediate the formation of political attitude." [...] Kanai and colleagues added {{that it is necessary to}} conduct a longitudinal study to determine whether the changes in brain structure that we observed lead to changes in political behavior or whether political attitudes and behavior instead result in changes of brain structure.|$|E
