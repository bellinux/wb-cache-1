25|$|During {{his time}} in office, Wickham first {{addressed}} the House of Commons in March 1937, to speak <b>about</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> He spoke at length at the subject again the following year. He was appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Florence Horsbrugh in the Ministry of Health in July 1939, and in November 1939 switched to the same role under the Secretary of State for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha. When, six weeks later, Hore-Belisha resigned from his post, Wickham also left his position in the War Office. He was appointed to another Parliamentary Private Secretary role in June 1940, assisting Victor Warrender, the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. Eight months later, he once took on the role under the Secretary of State for War, this time David Margesson. In 1944 he led a parliamentary delegation to Australia and New Zealand, and the following year visited the Buchenwald concentration camp.|$|E

500|$|Disraeli always {{considered}} foreign affairs {{to be the}} most critical and most interesting part of statesmanship. Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas <b>about</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> when he took office in 1874. [...] He had rarely travelled abroad; since his youthful tour of the Middle East in 1830–1831, he had left Britain only for his honeymoon and three visits to Paris, the last of which was in 1856. As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe. [...] His brief first premiership, and the first year of his second, gave him little opportunity to make his mark in foreign affairs.|$|E

2500|$|Based on this language, Alexander Bickel and Floyd Abrams {{felt there}} were three {{preliminary}} arguments to raise. [...] First, {{the wording of the}} statute was very broad. [...] Was each article <b>about</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> one [...] "relating to the national defense"? [...] What was the significance of [...] "reason to believe" [...] that the Pentagon Papers [...] "could be used to the injury of the United States or the advantage of any foreign nation"? [...] If the motivation was to educate the public, was that a defense that served to help, not hinder, the country? [...] Would the public be [...] "a person not entitled to receive" [...] the information? [...] Of equal import was what the statute did not say: No references to [...] "publication" [...] (as Attorney General Mitchell's cease-and-desist order referenced), no reference to classified information, and no support for Mitchell's reliance on the top secret classification to justify restraint on publication. [...] Additionally, there was no statutory language providing authority for prior restraint on publication at all.|$|E

Serious differences emerged over the future development of Germany and Eastern Europe. At Potsdam, the US was represented by a new president, Harry S. Truman, who on April 12 succeeded to the office upon Roosevelt's death. Truman was unaware of Roosevelt's plans for post-war engagement with the Soviet Union, and more generally uninformed <b>about</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and military matters. The new president, therefore, was initially reliant on a set of advisers (including Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman and Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. This group tended to take a harder line towards Moscow than Roosevelt had done. [...] Administration officials favoring cooperation with the Soviet Union and the incorporation of socialist economies into a world trade system were marginalized.

2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything <b>about</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. He always said it three times more, {{and he was always}} more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, all the other people I have, they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong. And Ribbentrop was blowing up the whole day and I had to do nothing. I had to break – much better!' ...|$|E
