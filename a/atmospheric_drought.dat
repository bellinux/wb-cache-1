40|$|One of the {{negative}} features of Poland’s climate is the periodic occurrence of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>droughts.</b> The most frequent source of this phenomenon is the occurrence of long-term (sometimes lasting several weeks) rainless periods. The occurrence of these periods is connected with the persistence of a stationary east European high that joins with the Azores anticyclone via central Europe. In such situations, with the accompanying lack or insufficiency of <b>atmospheric</b> precipitation, a <b>drought</b> begins to develop gradually. First, a soil drought appears, followed by hydrologic drought. During a hydrologic drought, {{a decrease in the}} ground water flow into surface waters is observed, among other phenomena. This results in the reduction of water flow in rivers. During such periods, a significant drop in the level of underground waters, as well as drying of some springs and small water courses, is observed. In its initial phase of development, a drought exerts its first negative effects on crops. Intensification of this phenomenon also causes disturbances in other sectors of the national economy. Droughts and their negative results do not pose the same threat to all areas of Poland, although in general the influence of droughts is stronger here than in the majority of central European countries. This situation {{is the result of a}} combination of natural and historic factors. One of the areas of interest of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW) is continuous monitoring and assessment of the course of meteorological and hydrological phenomena occurring in all areas of Poland. When preparing an analysis of the course of successive periods of drought spells, specialists from the IMGW branch in Poznan noticed the absence of similar studies of this phenomenon in Polish literature. In an attempt to fill this gap, they catalogued all droughts that occurred in Poland from 1951 to 1990. The research methods adopted in this study, and also the general characteristics of droughts in Poland, are summarized in this article...|$|R

At the same time, it is necessary to ascertain, that the efforts directed on it do not provide expected results, that is caused by a number of unsolved questions.

The importance of VPD as a dominant driver was underlined by simulations of extreme summer conditions. We found GPP to be affected more by summer temperatures and VPD as predicted for 2080 (− 17 %) than by reductions in summer precipitation (− 9 %). Because heterotrophic respiration responded less to heat (− 1 %) than to reductions in precipitation (− 10 %), net ecosystem C uptake declined strongest under hotter (− 38 %) compared to drier summer conditions (− 8 %). Considering warming trends across all seasons (September–May: + 3 °C and June–August: + 4. 5 °C), the negative drought effects were largely compensated by an earlier initiation of favorable growing conditions and bud break, enhancing early season GPP and needle biomass. An adverse effect, triggered by changes in early season allocation patterns, was the decline of wood and root biomass. This imbalance may increase water stress {{over the long term}} to a threshold at which ponderosa pine may not survive, and highlights the need for an integrated process understanding of the combined effects of trends and extremes...|$|E

30|$|The {{difference}} in horizontal <b>atmospheric</b> circulations between <b>drought</b> {{years and the}} non-drought years {{is related to the}} meridional vertical atmospheric circulation. The right figure in Fig.  5 shows the climatological mean difference between the drought and non-drought years and the anomalies in 1994 and 2003 for the meridional vertical atmospheric circulation averaged along 100 °– 145 °E. Here, central China, Korea and Japan lie in the longitude band of 110 °– 145 °E. In climatological mean difference and 1994, a drought year, there are an anomalous upward flow on the south of 30 °N and anomalous downward flow on the north. In other words, anomalous flow that rises in the SWNP descends over 30 °– 40 °N. In 2003, a non-drought year, the phenomenon reverses. It means that there is anomalous secondary circulation between the low and mid-latitudes in East Asia. This is one of the factors that cause drought or non-drought in summer in the mid-latitude regions of East Asia and TC genesis in the SWNP. Meanwhile, no circulation relation seems to exist between the mid-latitude and high latitude regions of East Asia.|$|R

This causes TCs to move from South China Sea via {{the eastern part of}} the mainland China to Manchuria or along the coast of East Asia. In 1994, Korea is under much influence of TCs because there is an anomalous easterly caused by anomalous cyclonic circulation on the south side of 30 °N and anomalous {{anticyclonic circulation}} on the north. In 2003, the pattern is the opposite from 1994. Half of the TCs occurring in that summer moved northwest to South China or Indochina. Consequently, there are contradicting meridional atmospheric circulation pattern based on 30 °N in East Asia between drought years and non-drought years. This is verified from OLR analysis as well. There are clear positive OLR anomalies in Korea, central China and Japan and negative anomaly in the SWNP. Such horizontal <b>atmospheric</b> circulation in <b>drought</b> years is related to vertical atmospheric circulation.

This is attributed to biases in climatological jet latitude, with important implications for projections of future climates and midlatitude weather events. Specifically, equatorward biases lead to the modeling of overly persistent jet shifts leading to erroneous projections into future climates. The eddy-mean flow interaction that characterizes the persistent anomalous state of the midlatitude jet depends on processes associated with the lower-tropospheric source of vertically propagating Rossby waves and processes associated with upper-tropospheric wave propagation and breaking. Although these mechanisms will not be explicitly detailed in this thesis, more details on the effect that different physical processes has on the annular mode time scales and eddy-mean flow feedbacks can be found in Burrows 2016. Instead, the effect of model resolution and truncation will be analyzed in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamic Laboratory's dry, atmospheric model to find consistencies across different grid configurations. A variety of climate change-like thermal forcings are used to generate a range of meridional shifts in the midlatitude eddy-driven jet. These thermal perturbations are used to mimic idealized greenhouse gas warming and El Niño/Southern Oscillation variability, both of which increase the equator-to-pole temperature difference (Δ T), and Arctic amplification (AA) which reduces Δ T. This produces a range of jet latitudes with which to examine annular mode variability. It is shown that along with a decrease in the time scales of jet variability, there is also a reduction in the eddy momentum feedback strength with an increase in jet latitude. These results are in agreement with many other modeling efforts including phase 3 and phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Recent proposals linking AA to increases in extreme events have received scrutiny from the scientific community for the lack of dynamical insight. It is believed that the reduction in Δ T leads to a less meridionally confined, amplified jetstream leading to enhanced advection of heat (cold or warm) and moisture. With an enhanced persistence, these events can lead to extreme weather. To test this hypothesis further Δ T can be directly increased (polar cooling) or decreased (polar warming) in a highly idealized model to determine the effect on midlatitude dynamics and extreme weather. Two methods will be used to define a blocking anticyclone and to classify isolated extreme weather events. Classically, blocking describes persistent, large amplitude, Rossby wave breaking in the middle to high latitudes leading to midlatitude easterlies and stalled weather systems. It will be shown that by decreasing Δ T, the midlatitude jetstream weakens and shifts equatorward along with eddy fluxes of heat and momentum. Following this, the blocking response shifts equatorward and weakens indicating a reduction in persistent blocking patterns. The climatological finite amplitude wave activity also reduces at all latitudes. These results are corroborated by using a more subjective definition of extreme events and show that the AA hypothesis does not hold true for this idealized model...|$|R

The storage water use was modeled using the ANAFORE model, integrating a dynamic water flow and ? storage model with a process-based transpiration model. The model was calibrated and validated with sap flow measurements for the growing season of 2000 (26 May? 18 October). Because there was no severe soil drought during the study period, {{we were able to}} study atmospheric effects. Incoming radiation was the main driver of storage water use. The general trends of sap flow and storage water use are similar, and follow more or less the pattern of incoming radiation. Nevertheless, considerable differences in the day-to-day pattern of sap flow and storage water use were observed, mainly driven by vapour pressure deficit (VPD). During dry atmospheric conditions (high VPD) storage water use was reduced. This reduction was disproportionally higher than the reduction in measured sap flow. Our results suggest that the trees did not rely more on storage water during periods of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>drought,</b> without severe soil drought. A third important factor was the tree water deficit. When storage compartments were depleted beyond a threshold, storage water use was limited due to the low water potential in the storage compartments. The maximum relative contribution of storage water to daily transpiration was also constrained by an increasing tree water deficit...|$|E
40|$|Here we reconstructed {{evaporation}} using tree-ring width variability. Drought variability and {{its effects}} on forest growth have been mainly characterized by changes in precipitation and temperatures, whereas <b>atmospheric</b> <b>drought</b> and evaporation rates have been little investigated. The area of study corresponds to northern Mexico, a region where water resources are increasingly limited. We used correlation analyses to identify the months in which evaporation is most strongly related to tree-ring width series. Then, we built a linear regression model to predict seasonal winter-to-spring evaporation as a function of ring-width indices. Correlation analyses showed that the radial growth of P. cooperi decreased in response to reduced water availability and increased evaporation during the winter prior to the growing season, and also during spring and the early summer of the year of tree-ring formation. Pine growth mainly benefitted from wet and cool conditions from winter to early spring. Linear regression models used in reconstruction were statistically robust and allowed reconstructing January-to-April evaporation for the period 1900 - 2010. Our study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} historical changes in evaporation in northern Mexico and, most importantly, it also emphasizes how atmospheric moisture demand is linked to tree growth.

40|$|Stomatal {{conductance}} (gs) is a {{key variable}} in Earth system models as it regulates the transfer of carbon and water between the terrestrial biosphere and the lower atmosphere. Various approaches have been developed that aim for a simple representation of stomatal regulation applicable at the global scale. These models differ, among others, in their response to atmospheric humidity, which induces stomatal closure in a dry atmosphere. In this study, we compared the widely used empirical Ball-Berry and Leuning stomatal conductance models to an alternative empirical approach, an optimization-based approach, and a semimechanistic hydraulic model. We evaluated these models using evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP) observations derived from eddy covariance measurements at 56 sites across multiple biomes and climatic conditions. The different models were embedded in the land surface model JSBACH. Differences in performance across plant functional types or climatic conditions were small, partly owing to the large variations in the observational data. The models yielded comparable results at low to moderate <b>atmospheric</b> <b>drought</b> but diverged under dry atmospheric conditions, where models with a low sensitivity to air humidity tended to overestimate gs. The Ball-Berry model gave the best fit to the data for most biomes and climatic conditions, but all evaluated approaches have proven adequate for use in land surface models. Our findings further encourage future efforts toward a vegetation-type-specific parameterization of gs to improve the modeling of coupled terrestrial carbon and water dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to focus on how soil {{moisture}} and vegetation heterogeneity can play an important role on surface processes such as <b>atmospheric</b> feedback under <b>drought</b> and non-drought conditions. The study also aims to improve land surface representation climatology in terms of single and coupled modes of land surface and weather forecasting models. The general methodology was applied to evaluate the performance of the offline high resolution Noah land surface model (version 3. 1) versus the Noah land surface model with the photosynthesis-based Gas exchange Evapotranspiration Model (Noah GEM) using different land types such as forest and agricultural areas (i. e., the Niwot Ridge Ameriflux site, USA and the Avignon CarboEurope site, France) ^ The coupled model Weather Research - Advanced Research Version (ARW ver. 3) was also employed to help understand the coupled processes between biochemical plant physiology, soil moisture, and atmosphere. Three cases were conducted: 1) an LLJ (low level jet) event observed on 3 June 2002 over the IHOP (International H 20 Project) field experiment, 2) a severe drought from 11 - 19 June 2006 over the Southern Great Plains region (SGP); and 3) deep and shallow convection from 10 - 13 June 2007 over the CLASIC (Cloud and Land Surface Interaction Campaign) SGP region. Field experiment and aircraft data from the Ameriflux and CarboEurope site, IHOP, and the CLASIC campaign were used to calibrate and validate the models. All three hypotheses have been answered showing 1) The improved land surface initial conditions (soil moisture and temperature) using a high resolution land data assimilation system (HRLDAS) will lead to enhanced predictions of summer daytime and nighttime mesoscale forcing under both weak and intense synoptically-driven cumulus convection conditions. 2) Vegetation transpiration is more efficient than soil evaporation in transporting moisture from the land surface to the atmosphere during convection simulations. 3) Interactions between local and large-scale land surface heterogeneity can affect regional convection in the Southern Great Plains for both IHOP and the CLASIC field phase (June 2002 and June 2007). ^ This study provides some of the first results highlighting land surface-vegetation-soil moisture-atmospheric feedback as an important factor not only for daytime processes but also for improved simulation of early morning and nighttime convection. Also the improved Noah land surface model predicted more accurate energy flux, cloud radiation, rainfall, soil moisture, and soil temperature during extreme drought conditions and shallow cumulus convection. Future works include the use of finer-scale data assimilation and long-term soil moisture climatology to improve model performance. Additional plant physiological biochemistry formulations need further evaluation. The impact of convection triggers and vegetation transpiration on deep convection also need further investigation. ...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{soil and}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>drought</b> on whole-tree {{transpiration}} (E-T), leaf water potential (psi(L)) and whole-tree hydraulic conductance (K-T) were investigated in mature rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis, clone RRIM 600) during the full canopy stage in the rainy season in a drought-prone area of northeast Thailand. Under well-watered soil conditions, transpiration was tightly regulated in response to high evaporative demand, i. e., above reference evapotranspiration (ETo) similar to 2. 2 mm day(- 1) or maximum vapor pressure deficit similar to 1. 8 kPa. When the trees experienced intermittent soil drought E-T decreased sharply when relative extractable water in the top soil was < 0. 4. The midday leaf water potential (psi(md)) on sunny days did not change {{as a function of}} soil drought and remained stable at approximately - 1. 95 MPa, i. e., displaying isohydric behavior. The decrease in E-T was mainly due to the change in K-T. K-T remained constant over a wide range of environmental conditions and decreased sharply at low soil water availability. A simple hydraulic model incorporating critical minimum water potential and the response of whole-tree hydraulic conductance to relative extractable water correctly simulated patterns of transpiration over 6 months. We conclude that an explicit and simplified framework of hydraulic limitation hypothesis was sufficient to describe water use regulation of a mature rubber tree stand in water-limited conditions. Given the complexity of constraints in the soil-plant-atmosphere pathway, our results confirm the relevance of this approach to synthesize the overall behavior of trees under drought...|$|E
