But she knew men, and especially, at that moment as their eyes met, she knew Kirk; and she {{understood}} that to him the road was a thing that could not be ignored. The mere idea of doing so would seem grotesque and impossible, probably even shocking, to him. Men were odd, formal creatures, slaves to precedent.|$|R

Ismail resigned from his government posts in 1967, citing his poor health. A heart specialist had previously told him to retire from politics due to Ismail being [...] "more sensitive to personality stresses than most people" [...] – advice Ismail said he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ignored,</b> <b>had</b> {{it not been for}} his five young children. The Tunku accepted Ismail's resignation, noting that he had previously forced Ismail's brother, Suleiman, to continue working in public service, with fatal results when Suleiman suddenly died. After retiring from politics, Ismail went on to head the Guthrie Group of Companies, where he was paid three times the amount earned by a cabinet minister.|$|R
2500|$|Cudworth {{singled out}} Hobbes {{not only as}} a defender of the hylozoic atheism [...] "which {{attributes}} life to matter", but also as one going beyond it and defending [...] "hylopathian atheism, which attributes all to matter." [...] Cudworth attempted to show that Hobbes had revived the doctrines of Protagoras and was therefore subject to the criticisms which Plato had deployed against Protagoras in the Theaetetus. On the side of hylozoism, Strato of Lampsacus was the official target. However, Cudworth's Dutch friends had reported to him the views which Spinoza was circulating in manuscript. Cudworth remarks in his Preface that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> hylozoism <b>had</b> he not been aware that a new version of it would shortly be published.|$|R
25|$|In {{the report}} Fireman Sim Webb {{states that he}} heard the torpedo explode, {{then went to the}} gangway on the engineer's side and saw the flagman with the red and white lights {{standing}} alongside the tracks. Going to the fireman's side, he saw the markers of the caboose of No. 83 and yelled to Jones. But it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been impossible for him to have seen the flagman if the flagman had been positioned 500–800 feet (150–240 m) before the torpedoes as the report says he was. In any event, some railroad historians have disputed the official account over the years, finding it difficult if not impossible to believe that an engineer of Jones' experience <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> a flagman and fusees (flares) and torpedoes exploded on the rail to alert him to danger.|$|R

5000|$|The attack {{leveraged}} an SQL injection to gain privileged root {{access to}} VTech servers. Once privileged access was acquired, the attacker exfiltrated the data, including some 190 gigabytes {{of photographs of}} children and adults, detailed chat logs {{between parents and children}} which spanned over the course of years and voice recordings, all unencrypted and stored in plain text. The attacker shared some 3,832 image files with the journalist for verification purposes, and some redacted photographs were published by the journalist. Commenting on the leak, the unnamed attacker expressed their disgust with being able to so easily obtain access to such a large trove of data, saying: [...] "Frankly, it makes me sick that I was able to get all this stuff. VTech should have the book thrown at them” and explained their rationale for going to the press was because they felt VTech <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> their reports and concerns.|$|R
50|$|Hatch {{attempted}} to revive Battlestar Galactica. In the 1990s, he began writing novels {{based on the}} series, and also wrote, co-directed and executive-produced a trailer called The Second Coming {{in the hopes of}} enticing Universal Studios - the rights holders for the franchise, into producing a new series that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a direct continuation of the original 1978 series; it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> the events of the failed spin-off Galactica 1980, in which Hatch had not appeared. Original actors John Colicos (Baltar), Terry Carter (Colonel Tigh) and Jack Stauffer (Bojay) appeared in the trailer with Hatch. Though the trailer won acclaim at science-fiction conventions, Universal proved not to be interested in Hatch's vision for the revival of Battlestar Galactica, and instead opted for a remake rather than the sequel for which Hatch had campaigned. Hatch, who had reportedly remortgaged his own house to produce the trailer, was bitterly disappointed by this turn of events and was highly critical of the prospective new series. His own role as Tom Zarek in the remake did not lessen his harsh criticism of it.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Westangle {{took her}} praises as passively, if not as modestly, as Verrian {{received}} his. She made no show of disclaiming them, {{but she had}} the art, invaluable in a woman who meant to go far in the line she had chosen, of not seeming to have done anything, or of not caring whether people liked it or not. Verrian asked himself, as he watched her twittering back at those girls, and shedding equally their thanks and praises from her impermeable plumage, how she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> behaved if Miss Shirley's attempt had been an entire failure. He decided that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> the failure with the same impersonality as that with which she now ignored the success. It appeared that in one point he did her injustice, for when {{he went up to}} dress for dinner after the long stroll he took towards night he found a note under his door, by which he must infer that Mrs. Westangle had not kept the real facts of her triumph from the mistress of the revels.|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} {{unhappiness}} {{in the parish}} on this head, and, especially, unhappiness to Mr. Bromley, who was a good man. That Mr. Caldigate should be {{what he called a}} pagan had been represented by Mr. Bromley to his friends as a great misfortune, and especially a misfortune to the squire himself. But he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> that in regard to social life,--so Mr. Bromley said when discussing the matter,--if the pagan <b>would</b> <b>have</b> desisted from arguing the subject. But when Mr. Caldigate insisted on the parson owning the unreasonableness of his own belief, and called upon him to confess himself to be either a fool or a hypocrite, then the parson found himself constrained to drop all further intercourse. 'It is the way with all priests,' said the old squire triumphantly to the first man he could get to hear him. 'The moment you disagree with them they become your enemies at once, and would straightway kill you if they had the power.' He probably did not know how very disagreeable he had made himself to the poor clergyman.|$|R

30|$|When {{analysing}} {{the role}} of e.g. car drivers in accidents, one should focus on all fatalities resulting from accidents.

Beginning in 1921 the Corps studied a variety of proposals for an ambitious program of dam construction on the Potomac and its tributaries, which proposed as many as sixteen major dam and reservoir projects. The most <b>ambitious</b> proposals <b>would</b> <b>have</b> created a nearly continuous chain of reservoirs from tidewater to Cumberland, Maryland. The 1938 program was focused on flood control, {{on the heels of a}} major flood in 1936. The reformulated 1963 program focused on water supply and quality, mitigating upstream pollution from sewage and coal mine waste.|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{educational}} policy recommends creating more ambitious instruction in schools through a centralized strategy of mandatory curriculum frameworks, high-stakes student assessments, and coordinated teacher training. This article suggests {{serious problems with}} such a strategy and recommends a decentralized alternative involving local choice of curricula, technical assistance, and professional development. Arguments for, problems with, and alternatives to the centralized strategy are examined in eight dimensions of {{educational policy}}: curriculum development, curriculum stratification, educational indicators, high-stakes examinations for students, school improvement, educational finance, educational governance, and teacher training. The article concludes with recommendations for policy and research. Systemic educational policy (Smith & O'Day, 1990) rests on five basic insights: (a) Curriculum in the United States is poor by almost any standard (Baker, 1993); (b) a more <b>ambitious</b> curriculum <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a strong, {{positive impact on the}} achievement o...|$|R
30|$|A modest {{sample size}} at level 2 (77 classes) impairs the {{measurement}} model fit of teachers’ work enjoyment, but using manifest variables {{to avoid these}} constraints <b>would</b> <b>have</b> simply <b>ignored</b> measurement errors. Teaching characteristics even entered the models by using a doubly latent approach of measurement (Marsh et al. 2009), which enabled us to control for both measurement and sampling errors. Still, although 77 classes are a considerable number in non-funded studies like the present one, further investigations should try to collect data from at least 120 - 150 classes (Little 2013, 199 et seq.). They might also complement student ratings by ratings of trained observers.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} fuzzy space is due {{independently}} to Poincaré and Zeeman. (Poincaré {{used the term}} "physical continuum", Zeeman the term "tolerance space". I have reluctantly introduced a third expression since my attempts to generate a vocabulary from either of these have all proved impossibly unwieldy.) Both were led to it {{by the nature of}} our perception of space, and both adapted to it tools current in topology. Unfortunately, neither examined the application of these tools in complete detail, and as a result the argument from analogy was somewhat over-extended by both. The resemblances to topology are strong; the differences are sometimes glaring and sometimes subtle. In the latter case the difficulties produced by a topologically-conditioned intuition can be severe obstacles to progress. (Certainly, having been reared mathematically as a topologist I have found it necessary to distrust any conclusion whose proof is not painfully precise.) For this reason many of the proofs in this paper are set out in somewhat more detail than would be natural in a more established field. For this reason also I have here not only set out the positive results I have so far obtained in the subject but, for the benefit of topologists, elaborated on the failures of analogy with topology where a more succinct exposition <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ignored</b> them as dead ends (e. g., in Chap. I, § 2) ...|$|R
