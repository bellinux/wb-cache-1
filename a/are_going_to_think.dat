2500|$|Cyrus' casting {{also led}} to the casting of her real life father, Billy Ray Cyrus, {{as the father of}} her {{character}} on the show. Cyrus was initially wary; according to her mother and co-manager, Tish Cyrus, [...] "Miley's concern at the time was, oh my gosh, people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I only got this part because of my dad." [...] However, worried that her family would otherwise have to be separated as they had been when her father first landed the lead in the television series Doc, Cyrus relented and helped audition her father for the part.|$|E
2500|$|The Forward related how one {{individual}} felt: [...] "'There's a great frustration that American Jews {{want to do}} something,' said Ira Youdovin, {{executive vice president of}} the Chicago Board of Rabbis. [...] 'In 1947, some number would have enlisted in the Haganah, ' he said, referring to the pre-state Jewish armed force. [...] 'There was a special American brigade. [...] Nowadays you can't do that. [...] The battle here is the hasbarah war,' Youdovin said, using a Hebrew term for public relations. [...] 'We're winning, but we're very much concerned about the bad stuff.'" [...] Indicative of the diversity of opinion is a 2003 Boston Globe profile of the CAMERA media watchdog group in which Mark Jurkowitz observes: [...] "To its supporters, CAMERA is figuratively - and perhaps literally - doing God's work, battling insidious anti-Israeli bias in the media. [...] But its detractors see CAMERA as a myopic and vindictive special interest group trying to muscle its views into media coverage." [...] A former spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in New York City said that the result of this lobbying of the media was: “Of course, a lot of self-censorship goes on. Journalists, editors, and politicians <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> twice about criticizing Israel if they know they are going to get thousands of angry calls in a matter of hours. The Jewish lobby is good at orchestrating pressure.” ...|$|E

[...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it with a belfry spire roofed with red tiles and a clock in the tower, and I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the clock as pointing to the exact hour of noon. Do you all understand? It is impossible that this man should know of how I mean to build that spire and about the clock, because until this moment no one knew except myself. If he can show me that, I shall begin to believe that he is inspired by his master, the devil. Do you all understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! They {{would not}} dare---but I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> this out," [...] said Prout. [...] "It needs thought. In {{intention}} they cribbed, and I must think out my duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Bomford," [...] he announced, [...] "and professor, I {{should like}} to see you to-morrow. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> over this matter to-night once more. It is very {{possible}} that I may see my way clear to do as you ask." ...|$|R
2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jacinta laughed softly, {{though the}} crimson {{was in her}} cheeks. [...] "Still, you would have {{mastered}} it. You were always discreet, you know, {{and that was why}} at last I--who have hitherto told all my friends what they ought to do--had to let some one else make it clear how much I wanted you. Now, you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> very little of me after that?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Ernestine {{read the}} letter {{carefully}} through, and instead of handing it back to Davenant, put it into her pocket when she rose up.

6000|$|... "I am not prepared," [...] Vine said, rising, [...] "to come to any {{definite}} {{decision at}} this moment. Frankly, I {{want to use}} it so as to do you the greatest possible amount of harm. On the other hand, I never contemplated any such developments as you and John Drayton have suggested. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> this matter over." ...|$|R
2500|$|A Saenuri Party assemblyman Nam Kyung-pil {{criticized the}} Park-centered {{nature of the}} party, {{regarding}} its preparation for the 2012 presidential election, and stated, [...] "If we keep seeing the same situation where Park Geun-hye gives a press conference before a general meeting of lawmakers is held, and what she says then gets decided on as the party's position, then the public <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> democracy has disappeared from the party." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the end, Brown {{ran into}} the problem of telling his story using people he knew: [...] "My 'story' intersects with other people's 'stories' and {{sometimes}} those people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I'm not telling their story right. If those people are friends, I've got a problem." [...] Chester Brown, 1998 ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{actually}} {{asked me}} the question, [...] "And you have forgiven him?" [...] And {{that was when}} I, you know, had this rush of adrenalin, and thinking, [...] "Well, hey, it's too late now. People <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I'm {{a bit of a}} nut." [...] "Yes, I have forgiven him, Margaret." [...] Sandy MacGregor being interviewed on Australian Story ...|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} in May 2010, Marquess was asked about Brendan {{and if he was}} a bad boy. He replied: [...] "Oh, definitely — hes an absolute bastard! I think people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> Heres the next Warren, but theyll be surprised when they find out what the real story is. He is Cheryls half-brother… and Cheryl wont hear a bad word against him..." ...|$|E

5000|$|But the {{intimacy}} was really, really good ... were some freaky-deaky things going on. The {{end of the}} song is the wake-up you realize, [...] "Man, I can't deal with this anymore." [...] The mental frustration isn't worth the bonus that you get intimacy-wise. When I wrote those lyrics, I <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> [...] "Ah, man, I don't know if the record company's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let this fly." [...] I didn't know what anybody in the band <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b>|$|R
5000|$|VCR Maintenance And Educational Publishing was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from critics, with many praising Yvette Nicole Brown's performance. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review, writing: “VCR Maintenance And Educational Publishing” probably isn’t an episode that anyone <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about fondly in years to come, when recalling their five or 10 favorite Community episodes, but it has moments—both humorous and emotional—where the show attains everything it’s capable of." ...|$|R
5000|$|Price {{avoided the}} term African American, preferring to call herself an American, even a [...] "chauvinistic American". She summed up her {{philosophy}} thus: [...] "If you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> black, think positive about it. Don't think down on it, or {{think it is}} something in your way. And this way, when you {{really do want to}} stretch out, and express how beautiful black is, everybody will hear you." ...|$|E
50|$|Alameda County Assistant District Attorney Chris Lamiero, who {{represented}} the prosecution in the case, undermined criminal intent by commenting:Gwen being transgender was not a provocative act. He's who he was. However, I would not further ignore the reality that Gwen made some decisions in his relation with these defendants that were impossible to defend. I don't think most jurors <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it's OK to engage someone in sexual activity knowing they assume you have one sexual anatomy when you don't.|$|E
5000|$|Schickel quotes {{film critic}} James Agee as hoping that: [...] Major de Seversky and Walt Disney {{know what they}} are talking about, for I suspect that {{an awful lot of people}} who see Victory Through Air Power <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they do… I had the feeling I was sold {{something}} under pretty high pressure, which I don't enjoy, and I am staggered at the ease with which such self-confidence, on matters of such importance, can be blared all over the nation, without cross-questioning.|$|E

6000|$|And, in a rush, Babbitt agreed. All {{nonsense}} the {{way people}} misjudged him, but still--He determined to join the Good Citizens' League {{the next time he}} was asked, and in furious resignation he waited. He wasn't asked. They ignored him. He did not have the courage to go to the League and beg in, and he took refuge in a shaky boast that he had [...] "gotten away with bucking the whole city.

5000|$|Moretz also commented [...] "It's a movie. If you {{are going}} to believe and be {{affected}} by an action film, you shouldn't go to see Pocahontas because you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> you are a Disney Princess. If you are that easily swayed, you might see The Silence of the Lambs and think you are a serial killer. It's a movie and it's fake, and I've known that since I was a kid... I don't want to run around trying to kill people and cuss. If anything, these movies teach you what not to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{went there}} for the trial and I'd go into {{restaurants}} with Park and people would get up and leave. I called the defense lawyer, {{who happened to be}} a pretty good friend of mine, and said, [...] "What do you think a Monroe, Louisiana, jury <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Tongsun Park?" [...] He said, I don't know. I was taken aback. What do you mean you don't know? You've tried a million cases here. [...] "I don't think they've ever seen a Korean before," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, dear Lady Scroope, I haven't {{thought of}} it, and I <b>am</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it;--and if I {{thought of it}} ever so much, I shouldn't do it.

5000|$|The album chiefly {{consists}} of interwoven low frequency sounds, flute, morse code and ocean sounds, {{as well as}} audio samples from sources such as a reading by Leonard Cohen of part of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Ravi Shankar, and the science fiction film Contact (1997). This is a quiet, reflective work in the vein of meditative music, and provides a stark antithesis to the aggressive heavy metal stance adopted by one of Townsend's other projects - Strapping Young Lad. Townsend describes it as [...] "much more user friendly than the Devlab...still; some people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it's just buzzing and humming noises, so again...it's not for everybody." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the album, guitarist and vocalist Chris DeMakes said: [...] "See the Light is pure Less Than Jake. 13 {{songs that}} were written, {{recorded}} and produced in our hometown of Gainesville, Florida. You {{never know what}} people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> when you release new music. All {{you can do is}} what comes from your heart and we feel like we have accomplished what we set out to do with these new songs. Hopefully our fans will feel the same passion for this album as we do." [...] Bassist and vocalist Roger Lima added: [...] "album's all new songs and new vibes, only recorded in our old school way." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking to CBS New York, on the 30th {{anniversary of}} the playwright's death, CUNY Professor Annette J. Saddik said Williams had been taking Seconal - a {{barbiturate}} derivative - to help him sleep, and also had been drinking the night he died. “When this happened, John Uecker, who was his companion and assistant at the time, was still around and told the (New York City) Medical Examiner, ‘Look, people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it’s suicide or AIDS or something bizarre and we don’t know what happened,’” Saddik said in the interview. “So the Medical Examiner, said, ‘OK, he choked on a bottle cap.’ But really, his body just gave up and the eventual diagnosis was intolerance.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Otsuka {{took over}} the role as the closer for the Rangers during the 2006 season, {{replacing}} Francisco Cordero, and recorded 32 saves while posting a 2.11 ERA. However, on December 19, 2006, the Rangers announced that newly signed Éric Gagné would take over the closer role in , with Otsuka moving back into a set-up role. On January 13, 2007, T. R. Sullivan reported that, {{in an interview in}} Japan, Otsuka said [...] "If there is the team which needs me as a closer, I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about (the trade)". Due to Gagné starting the season on the DL, Otsuka began the 2007 season as the closer. With the trade of Gagne to the Boston Red Sox, Otsuka assumed the closer's role again. However, Otsuka went on the DL after experiencing tighntess in his throwing shoulder. His stand-in was C. J. Wilson. Otsuka was not offered a new contract by the Rangers and became a free agent on December 12, 2007.|$|R
