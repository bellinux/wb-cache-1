40|$|Meat {{tenderness}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} characteristic quality of beef not only for consumers but for breeders of beef cattle too. Selection of cattle focussed on an increment of meat tenderness is complicated because this trait has large variability not only between different breeds but between individuals of equal breed too. Similarly a measurement of meat tenderness is expensive because it make after slaughter of animal and <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> post mortem. Therefore it was developed a several methods, by the help of which is possible increase tenderness of meat. However still exist variance in values of meat tenderness which are caused by distinctness genetic base of animal. By using molecular genetic methods was described the most significant candidate genes (CAPN 1, CAST) coding formation of the calpains-calpastatin proteolytic system, which exercise an influence on tenderness. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes were using to design commercially genetic marker panels GeneSTAR Tenderness and Igenity Tender-GENE. By help this commercially test is possible to make genotyping and selection of animals for production of tenderness beef meat in meat industry. doi: 10. 5219 / 102 </div...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} myofibrillar protein degradation, in muscle and in post mortem meat tenderization, is still poorly understood. Much {{research}} {{has been carried out}} investigating the roles of endogenous muscle proteinases, the cathepsins and the calpains. However, it does not appear that proteolytic degradation of myofibrillar proteins alone is the key to understanding protein turnover in muscle and the postmortem meat tenderization process. ^ Actin binding proteins, with the ability to bind and sever F-actin filaments have become the focus of many investigators in the recent past. In particular, the protein gelsolin, has been well characterized and studied. Research has shown that gelsolin is present in blood and muscle of many animals including pigs, chicken and cattle.

40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years, major changes {{have taken place}} in beef {{consumption}} in the Czech Republic. While in 1990 the per capita consumption of beef was 30 kg, it was less than 10 kg in 2004 (Kvapilík, 2004). A similar, although less pronounced, decline can also be observed in other EU countries and in the USA. The changes in consumer demand for meat are af-fected by health concerns, changes in demographic characteristics, need for convenience, and chang-es in distribution and price (Resurreccion, 2004). Consumers consistently demand tender, flavourful meat with low fat content (Homer et al., 1997). Compositional and sensory characteristics of beef are influenced by a number of factors (e. g. breed, slaughter weight, <b>age</b> <b>of</b> animal, diet, <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>meat).</b> Differences in palatability traits and in the chemi-cal composition of muscle between individual sire breeds were investigated by Wheeler et al. (1996, 2005). <b>Meat</b> quality <b>of</b> different beef breeds fat-tened to the same intramuscular fat content was examined by Chambaz et al. (2001, 2003). The fatty acid composition of human diet fat has recently received increased attention due to its impact on health. Besides environmental effects, meat fatty acid composition is also influenced by genetic factors (De Smet et al., 2004). Laborde et al. (2001) suggested that a genetic basis for differences in fatty acid composition between Simmental and Red Angus breeds might exist. Selective breeding could be used to improve the fatty acid composition of intramuscular fat. Breed differences in fatty acid proportions were also reported in the subcutane-ous and intramuscular fat of Aberdeen Angus and Wagyu steers (May et al., 1993), muscle phospholi-pids of Jersey and Limousin cattle (Malau-Aduli et al., 1998), intramuscular triacyglycerol and polar li-pids of Aberdeen Angus and Simmental steers (Itoh et al., 1999), and intramuscular fat from crosses of Czech Fleckvieh and different beef breeds (Šubrt et al., 2001).

The various histological structure, the variable chemical content, technological features are found in meat. The structure and composition depends on a way of living, the function of the parts of an animal body, on lots of intravital factors (a kind of an animal, breed, male or female, <b>age,</b> the way <b>of</b> nutrition, the state <b>of</b> health). <b>Meat</b> is a valuable source of nutrients and essential acids for a man. The human organism is not able to synthesize the essential acids itself. Lipids are the important part <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> their main function is storing energy. They are found as a reserve tissue in the subcutaneus parts of animals or among muscular fibre. The amount of carbohydrates contained in meat is not important, meat is low in carbohydrates. They are only important for meat maturation. Meat is high in minerals and vitamins. It is necesary for a man and should be a part of our diet. The important factor for a meat quality is described as a formation of muscular fibres. There are the thin fibres in the <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> a high quality and the thick and fat fibres in the <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> a low quality. The meat quality depends on a number and charactes of animal fibres. The <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> a high quality is for example loin - it is the meat with fine fibres. The next factor which has influence on a meat quality is course of post mortem changes. We can differentiate four stages in these processes: prae rigor, rigor mortis, <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> the <b>meat</b> and deep autolysis.

Decrease of shear force during <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>meat</b> samples was observed at normal pH (pH < 5. 8) beef ? from 6. 403 kg to 5. 982 kg. Correlations between pH and water holding capacity was found at samples which undergone ageing (r = 0. 879 ***) and also at one day post-mortem samples (r = 0. 872 ***). Middle correlation was observed between colour and pH at all colour parameters ? L* (r = - 0. 479 ***), a* (r = - 0. 478 ***) and b* (r = - 0. 581 ***). Water holding capacity and pH have influence on shear force of raw beef and also heat-modified beef; this was confirmed by correlation analysis. Lightness (L*) and water holding capacity affect heat-modified samples texture which was confirmed with multi-regression linear analysis (R 2 = 0. 565). As shown above the influence <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> <b>ageing</b> on quality parameters is high and properly aged meat from young bulls has better texture values. If the aged beef will be sold regularly it could be expected that consumer demand will increase especially due to remove the inconsistency of the quality of beef...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{method for}} the rapid removal <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> from the defeathered, noneviscerated warm chicken carcass was developed. Initially, breast meat, skin, and wing {{from one side}} of the bird were {{stripped}} in one motion from the noneviscerated carcass. Then leg bones are cut and pulled from leg meat. The procedure eliminates the need to eviscerate chickens before deboning. Yield data for 7 -through 12 -week-old broilers showed increases in combined breast and leg meat yields from 24. 7 % of slaughter weight for 7 -week-old males to 29. 3 % for 12 -week-old males and 24. 4 % for females at 7 weeks to 28. 2 % at 12 weeks <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> <b>Meat</b> yields were evenly divided be-tween breast and leg in males, but breast meat was heavier than leg meat in the females.

Bioactive components in the meat can be anserin, karnosin and bioactive peptides. The generation of bioactive components in the meat in the form of bioactive peptides can be done in three ways: (1) <b>aging</b> or storage <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> (2) meat fermentation, and (3) the enzyme treatment.

40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects <b>of</b> <b>ageing</b> time <b>of</b> lamb loins prior to freezing on technological characteristics and oxidation stability of coarse ground lamb loin sausage using in a model system. Methods Lamb loins (M. longissimus lumborum, n = 25) were aged at − 1. 5 °C for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8 wk and then frozen for the remaining days (a total of 30 wk). The aged/frozen/thawed lamb loins were ground, and model sausages were formulated with 75 % aged/frozen/thawed lamb loin, 25 % water, 1. 5 % sodium chloride (NaCl) and 0. 3 % sodium tripolyphosphate. The pH and thaw/purge loss of aged/frozen/thawed lamb loins were evaluated, and protein functionality (protein solubility and emulsifying capacity), water-holding capacity and textural properties of model sausages were determined. Cooked model sausages were vacuum-packaged in a plastic bag and displayed under continuous fluorescent natural white light (3 °C± 1 °C). Colour and lipid oxidation of the cooked model sausages were evaluated on 0 and 21 d of display storage. Results Ageing prior to freezing had no impact on pH and purge/thaw loss of lamb loins and the colour of cooked sausages (p> 0. 05) made from the loins. Lamb loins aged for at least 3 wk prior to freezing numerically improved total and myofibrillar protein solubilities (p> 0. 05) and emulsion activity index (p = 0. 009) <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> batter, but decreased cooking loss (p = 0. 003) and lipid oxidation (p< 0. 05) of model sausages. Conclusion This study suggests that post-mortem <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>meat</b> prior to freezing could improve water-holding capacity and lipid oxidative stability of sausage made from the meat...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Sheep meat {{quality is}} {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} factors either intrinsic (species, breed, sex, and age) or extrinsic (nutrition, environment, and pre- and post-slaughter handling) to the animal. However, it is not known whether wool fibre color variations within the same breed can influence the instrumental and sensory characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>meat.</b> Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the genetic group on the instrumental and sensory characteristics <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> white and natural colored Corriedale lambs. The 29 lambs (13 natural colored and 16 white) used in the experiments were raised on natural pasture under extensive grazing conditions in the region of the Pampa Biome, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The animals were slaughtered at average <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 18 months. <b>Meat</b> evaluations were performed on samples from longissimus dorsi muscles. The analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effect of the genetic group and the means were compared by the F test. The instrumental analysis showed that <b>meat</b> <b>of</b> natural colored lambs had darker red color, higher 24 h pH, and higher scores for fat cover and texture. Sensory profiling was performed by nine trained panelists in four sessions. The sensory evaluation showed that natural colored lambs had darker red color, higher scores of fat taste and characteristic taste to the species. Despite significant differences in some sensory aspects, the samples were equally accepted by the panelists. <b>Meat</b> <b>of</b> natural colored Corriedale lambs had different instrumental and sensory profiles from that of white lambs...|$|R
