5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, Gibbons also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. Gibbons stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character shots with a range of expressions would be challenging, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E
25|$|The casting of Fenella Woolgar as Agatha Christie {{was made}} at the {{suggestion}} of David Tennant, who had previously worked with her on Bright Young Things <b>and</b> <b>He</b> <b>Knew</b> <b>He</b> Was Right. She later played Hellan Femor in the audio play The Company of Friends and Morella Wendigo in Nevermore.|$|E
500|$|Shankly was 60 when Liverpool won the 1974 FA Cup {{and said}} in his {{autobiography}} that, on returning to the dressing room {{at the end of}} the match, he [...] "felt tired from all the years". His mind was made up <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was going to retire. His wife, Nessie, had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not the right time. Tommy Smith said that Shankly's feelings for Nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision. In 1974, he decided that he could leave Liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret, which was that he did not win the European Cup.|$|E
5000|$|... "Even at 29, there's things I {{can improve}} him on, I've had a decent record working with centre-forwards. The way we play will suit him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> {{got to work}} hard." [...] Micky Adams {{speaking}} to BBC Radio Stoke.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> had <b>known</b> it. <b>He</b> had <b>known</b> it. When the {{soldiers}} jostled him so evilly they robbed him. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it. <b>He</b> had <b>known</b> {{it as if}} it were fate. Even as if it were fated beforehand.|$|R
60|$|It isn't often Sammy Jay {{worries about}} anybody but himself. Truth to tell, he doesn't worry about himself very often. You see, Sammy is smart, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> is smart. Under that pointed cap of his {{are some of}} the cleverest wits in all the Green Forest. Sammy seldom worries about himself because he feels quite {{able to take care of}} himself.|$|R
2500|$|Metcalf’s {{experience}} in libraries {{began when he}} was thirteen years old, when he worked for at the Oberlin College library. His brother-in-law, Azariah Root, was the librarian. [...] Here, he was taught how to organize the shelves and process new orders that came to the library. [...] Despite being promised pay at five cents an hour, Metcalf was never paid for his efforts. [...] He says about this oversight, “I’m inclined to believe that absent-mindedness on my employer’s part, rather than poor work on mine, was why I was never paid…but I never ventured to complain.” [...] Regardless of why he wasn’t paid, Metcalf greatly enjoyed what he did <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had found his life’s work in librarianship.|$|E
2500|$|.....because {{the suspect}} was also a Jew and also because his {{evidence}} would convict the suspect, and witness would be the means of murderer being hanged {{which he did not}} wish to be left on his mind...And after this identification which suspect knew, no other murder of this kind took place in London...after the suspect had been identified at the Seaside Home where he had been sent by us with difficulty in order to subject him to identification, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was identified. On suspect's return to his brother's house in Whitechapel he was watched by police (City CID) by day & night. In a very short time the suspect with his hands tied behind his back, he was sent to Stepney Workhouse and then to Colney Hatch and died shortly afterwards - Kosminski was the suspect - DSS" ...|$|E
2500|$|Elliott, later {{speaking}} about the session, said [...] "The technique I used on this man was {{to get him to}} completely relax. I got him started counting by ones, twos, threes, etc., to a hundred and then backwards. I had established in his mind that I was his friend. He knew he was in very serious trouble <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was innocent. When he went under, he was counting by threes backward. He was completely relaxed. The critical stage is the next state when you say the subject is cataleptic. The longer you keep them in the state of catalepsy, the deeper they sink into the third state. I kept him ten minutes in this state of catalepsy. He {{was in a state of}} extreme exhaustion. Sweat was on his face. Observing that even Bill [...] was still somewhat skeptical of hypnosis, whether or not the man was truly hypnotized or faking, I resorted to a fail safe demonstration. Through suggestion, I removed all feeling, reflex actions, etc., from the subject's right arm and stuck a burning cigarette to his arm--absolutely no reaction. Bill was thoroughly convinced." ...|$|E
5000|$|... iAm's sole {{goal has}} always been to keep his brother from self-destructing- <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he’s</b> failed. It’s not until the Chosen Selena enters Trez's life that the male begins to turn things around ... but by then it’s too late. The pledge to mate the Queen’s {{daughter}} comes due and there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and no negotiating.|$|R
5000|$|Dalton accused Prosecutor Jeff Dusek of {{purposeful}} misconduct. [...] "The {{thing that}} makes me the most mad is that <b>he</b> is lying, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> lying," [...] she said at the trial. The jury's foreman, John Castleman, said they based the verdict of death on [...] "the type of murder it was," [...] {{although there was no}} physical evidence to support the prosecution's story that there even was a murder.|$|R
5000|$|Voice jumps {{straight}} to describing his ongoing need {{to complete a}} last story, to say {{what needs to be}} said, and keep on with this tale until its end; then {{he will be able to}} [...] "rest and sleep … not before." [...] Voice is desperate. Like Henry in Embers he's never been able to finish any of his stories <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> won't have any peace until he does.|$|R
2500|$|Barnes {{was then}} snapped up by former {{teammate}} and manager Kenny Dalglish, who was managing Newcastle United, although an approach {{had already been}} made by Harry Redknapp of West Ham; Barnes had agreed in principle to join them until at the final moment Dalglish called him and Barnes changed his mind. In the 1997–98 season Barnes played up front mostly, deputising for Alan Shearer after Shearer was injured {{for most of the}} season, and Barnes ended up Newcastle's top league scorer with six goals, which highlighted the Magpie's lack of ability to score in the absence of Shearer and Ferdinand (who had been sold along with Beardsley). Former Liverpool colleague Ian Rush and England colleague Stuart Pearce were also drafted in around this time. Pearce has since stated in his autobiography, [...] "Psycho", that he felt Barnes was overweight by the time he joined Newcastle and that both Barnes and Rush had less desire than himself to win at that stage in their careers as they had already won everything, and that they could have had more of an edge to them. Although Newcastle (the previous season's Premier League runners-up) endured a disappointing league campaign and finished 13th, they did reach the 1998 FA Cup Final, and Barnes went onto the field for the fifth FA Cup final of his career. However, Newcastle lost 2–0 to Arsenal, and following the sacking of Dalglish early in the 1998–99 season, he was left isolated and shunned along with a number of Kenny Dalglish and Kevin Keegan era players including Rob Lee and Stuart Pearce. Barnes with many others was dropped from the first team by new manager Ruud Gullit and spent several months in the reserves despite, in his opinion, [...] "excelling in training" [...] and showing he had lost none of his quality if some of his pace. He felt that himself and others were deliberately being cold shouldered to make it known Gullit wanted his own players in; Barnes had actually worked briefly with Gullit during the 1998 World Cup ITV commentary team, and they had played numerous international matches played against each other in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were not friends. Barnes knew it was the last straw when even his MBE from the Queen was overlooked by Gullit after a presentation had been given to Stuart Pearce for receiving one – this was in the winter of 1998 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was unwanted. [...] Barnes left the club on a free transfer to newly promoted Charlton on 10 February 1999.|$|E
60|$|The fever made Aaron {{naive and}} communicative, unlike himself. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was being unlike himself, {{he knew that}} he was not in proper control of himself, so he was unhappy, uneasy.|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} Hal {{went out to}} lunch--a light affair, as the youth had spent ten cents more than {{intended}} in following Hardwick the previous evening, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> must be sparing of his capital.|$|E
50|$|Luke Robinson shall {{go before}} ye, that snarling {{northern}} tyke; Be sure he’ll not adore ye, for honour he doth not like; He cannot honour inherit, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> can never merit, <b>And</b> therefore <b>he</b> cannot bear it {{that any one}} else should wear it. Sing hi ho, envious lown, you're of the beagle's kind, Who always bark'd at the moon, because in the dark it shined. Sing hi ho, etc.|$|R
60|$|But the guardsman's quick ear {{had caught}} the sound of moving feet from within, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> was master of the situation.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Tredway had {{a respect}} for Victoria <b>and</b> her opinions, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Hilary. <b>He</b> opened the door a little wider, and looked {{critically}} at Mr. Vane.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, at the closed face, which he thought so cruel. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could never touch her again. His will was broken, he was seared, but he {{clung to the}} life of his body.|$|E
6000|$|... "Morton, is it;--perhaps my friend's;--ah--ah,--yes." [...] He didn't {{like to say}} uncle because Reginald didn't look old enough, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{ought not}} to say brother, because the elder brother in England would {{certainly}} have had the property.|$|E
60|$|When a {{few moments}} later the canoe grated softly on a pebbly beach. Isaac saw, indistinctly in the morning mist, the faint {{outlines}} of tepees and wigwams, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was once more in the encampment of the Wyandots.|$|E
500|$|McVeigh {{believed}} that the bomb attack had {{a positive impact on}} government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh stated, [...] "Once you bloody the bully's nose, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> going to be punched again, he's not coming back around." ...|$|R
60|$|He was a {{long time}} resolving {{definitely}} to ask her to marry him. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew,</b> if <b>he</b> asked her, she must really acquiesce. She must, it could not be otherwise.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> {{must choose}} between two alternatives--either he must {{never go to}} the orchard again, or he must go as an avowed lover to woo him a wife.|$|R
60|$|When {{he went to}} {{the bedroom}} after supper, he found that the cradle and his wife's few little boxes and parcels--poor, pathetic properties!--had been removed to the garret, which they called a chamber, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was to sleep alone again.|$|E
60|$|More than that, he gloried in {{the look}} of them, in the trained, springy strides, in the lithe, erect forms, in the {{assurance}} in every move. Every detail of that practice photographed itself upon Ken Ward's memory, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would never forget.|$|E
60|$|An angry answer arose to Tom's lips, but {{he checked}} it. In the college Doctor Wellington's word was law, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{would only make}} matters worse by {{attempting}} to argue. With a heavy heart he turned, gazed coldly at Professor Sharp, and left the office.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{thought that}} these were heavy charges to bring upon him; but his father spoke calmly <b>and</b> kindly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> could easily show that {{what he said was}} true.|$|R
60|$|For {{many days}} D'Arnot lay upon his bed of soft ferns. The second day a fever {{had come and}} D'Arnot thought that it meant {{infection}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> would die.|$|R
60|$|It was {{to those}} who had neither been killed or escaped that <b>he</b> hastened. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> would find them by the great post in the center of Mbonga village.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{he wanted}} her still, he always, always wanted her. In his soul, he was desolate as a child, he was so helpless. Like a child on its mother, he {{depended}} on her for his living. He knew it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could hardly help it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's my fault," [...] he said, and, {{gathering}} himself together, {{he got up}} {{and began}} to talk trivialities. He felt insubstantial. In a vague way he hated her for it. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was as much to blame himself. This, however, did not prevent his hating her.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} laugh from the others, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had done wisely, when they clumsily {{expressed}} their satisfaction at his escape. He had, at least, discredited Jake, and {{it was evident that}} if the man made any more assertions of a similar nature, which was very unlikely, no one would listen to them.|$|E
50|$|Despite his immense {{internal}} strength, Larsen {{at times}} {{shows signs of}} weakness <b>and</b> depression. <b>He</b> is envious of his brother, because his brother is simple minded, and so is able to enjoy life unburdened. He also claims he is envious of Miss Brewster's and van Weyden's faith, but later says it is only his mind, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> is better off without it. He also speaks of frustration that he never amounted to anything great. He claims that {{he had all the}} determination and will required, but was never given the proper opportunity.|$|R
60|$|And in {{that long}} kiss {{darkness}} came upon him again, <b>and</b> when again <b>he</b> was conscious <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> was alone <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> was to die. He was wearily {{glad that he}} was to die.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{still his}} merit, my dear, that he's Lord Mark. He's just what <b>he</b> was, <b>and</b> what <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was. It's {{not for me}} either to reflect on him after I've so treated him." ...|$|R
