5|$|India ranks first {{worldwide}} in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 18.6% of the GDP in 2005, employed 60% {{of the total}} workforce and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and {{plays a significant role}} in the overall socio-economic development of India. Yields per unit area of <b>all</b> <b>crops</b> have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the green revolution.|$|E
5|$|Peninsula-wide, a {{total of}} 534transmission towers and 700,963telephone poles were downed; both these totals {{exceeded}} the totals of Hurricane Manuel and Hurricane Wilma. Consequently, at least 239,000people were left without electricity throughout Baja California Sur alone, equal to around 92%of the state's population. All access to drinking water across Baja California Sur was cut off. About 30%of <b>all</b> <b>crops</b> on the peninsula were destroyed. Odile inflicted damage on 10,000homes, including 1,800of which were destroyed. The majority of hotels along the southern portion of the state sustained minor damage. At least 479schools in the southern portion of the peninsula were damaged.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of Broome, the maximum wind gust {{recorded}} was 153km/h (95mph), recorded at the Broome aerodrome, as well as recording 163.8mm (6.45in) of rain for the 24hours up to 9 a.m. WST (0100 UTC) on 20 April. Vegetation in this area were badly damaged, particularly the African Mahogany trees which were either snapped off or uprooted. Parts of Cable Beach were severely eroded. An area {{which used to be}} covered with sand was completely covered by rocks. The eastern side of Roebuck Bay had evidence of severe erosion of the coastal terrain. At Broome's only banana plantation, almost <b>all</b> <b>crops</b> were completely lost, with 10 out of 18,000 plants left surviving. Fortunately, most buildings in {{the town of}} Broome remained unharmed, although power supplies were cut to many parts of Broome for several days.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Nina brought {{widespread}} {{damage to}} much of the northern Philippines. It was the strongest system to strike the archipelago since Typhoon Irma in1981. The capital city of Manila was spared the worst of Nina. There, only minor damage and power outages were reported, though 800were evacuated to shelters due to flooding and the city's airport closed. Two men were crushed to death in Lucena City. The worst effects of the storm were felt in Matnog, where 287people drowned due to storm surge. In nearby Verla, 61 fatalities occurred, where 98% of the city's buildings were damaged or destroyed and its supply of drinking water was cut off. Throughout the Sorsogon province, 80%of <b>all</b> <b>crops</b> were destroyed and 90% of all homes were either damaged or destroyed. Province-wide, 400people died. In the Albay province, 73people were killed. Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces combined, 80% of all schools and 50%of all public buildings were demolished.|$|E
5|$|A {{resident}} of Malakula was struck {{and killed by}} a falling coconut while seeking shelter from the worsening conditions. Agriculture on nearby Ahamb Island, already impaired by Paula, was further compromised; <b>all</b> <b>crops,</b> both those remaining after Paula and those planted in the intervening time, were destroyed. Four classrooms on the small island were also damaged beyond use. Buildings on Aoba incurred appreciable damage, while on Efate, the storm brought down utility poles, severely damaged local schools, and left roads covered with debris and floodwaters. Flooding in the nation's capital city of Port Vila forced 50 residents {{to leave their homes}} in search of higher ground. Espiritu Santo, particularly the island's south shore around Luganville, bore the brunt of Cyclone Sose. Several types of crops (also weakened by Paula) took a heavy beating, and 60 people had to evacuate due to encroaching floods. In total, the storm demolished 59 houses on the island and in some way damaged another 101. A young child drowned after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen waterway. Just offshore, the M/V Omale succumbed to the heavy seas; all 16 of its occupants successfully swam four hours to shore.|$|E
5|$|Across the Chuuk Lagoon, {{four people}} were killed and damage ranged from $30–$40million (1987USD). In the capital of Weno, 85%of {{dwellings}} and 50%of government buildings were damaged. Throughout the atoll, at least 1,000people were rendered homeless, approximately 1,000houses were damaged, and 39injuries were reported. While crossing the Philippines, Nina brought extensive damage to the northern portion of the island group. The town of Matnog sustained the worst damage from the typhoon, where 287people died. Sixty-one lives were lost in the nearby city of Verla, where 98%of all structures were either damaged or destroyed. Four hundred people died, 80%of <b>all</b> <b>crops</b> were destroyed, and 90%of all homes were either damaged or destroyed in the Sorsogon province. Nearby, in the Albay province, 73{{people were killed}}. Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces, four-fifthsof all schools and halfof all public infrastructure were destroyed. Elsewhere, in Boac, 80%of homes lost their roofs. In Bacacay, 18of the village's 200homes were destroyed. However, the capital city of Manila avoided the brunt of the typhoon. Throughout the Philippines, approximately 114,000people sought shelter, approximately 90,000houses were destroyed, leaving more than 150,000homeless. Nationwide, damage from the storm totaled $54.5million and 808people perished.|$|E
40|$|This study {{uses the}} Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem (GCCT) to {{investigate}} the consistency of aggregating major crop products in studying producer’s behaviour in Iran. The results show that <b>all</b> <b>crop</b> products, except corn, soybean, and melon can consistently be grouped into cereals, oil seeds, pulses, and vegetable composite commodities. In addition, the results testing the hypothesis {{of the possibility of}} aggregating <b>all</b> <b>crop</b> products in a single group was positive when we excluded sesame, cotton, and water melon from the list. Accordingly, modeling and estimating an aggregate production or cost function for Iranian crop sector will not cause consistent biases. Additionally, one can estimate a separate or cost function for each of the above sub-sectors without causing aggregation biases in grouping the commodities...|$|R

25|$|Over {{the course}} of {{thousands}} of years, paleo-indian people domesticated, bred and cultivated a number of plant species.

25|$|Agricultural grasses {{grown for}} their edible seeds are called cereals or grains (although the latter term, agriculturally, refers to both cereals and legumes).

25|$|Trincheras {{served a}} number of {{purposes}} such as defense, homesites, and agriculture. Their agricultural purposes were to provide farmers a level planting surface and aid in preventing erosion, collecting and managing water, and preventing frost damage. Hillside agriculture in the small fields created by trincheras was often of secondary importance to floodplain farming. Trinchera agriculture was probably used to grow <b>all</b> <b>crops.</b> Southwestern Indian farmers often cultivated several different fields and crops in different locations and environments {{to reduce the risk}} of crop failure.

25|$|The {{importance}} of sagebrush {{in the diet}} of adult greater sage-grouse is great; numerous studies have documented its year-round use.

Between December and February, it was the only food item found in <b>all</b> <b>crops.</b> Only between June and September did sagebrush constitute less than 60% of their diet. Sage grouse select sagebrush species differentially. Greater sage-grouse in Antelope Valley, California, browsed black sagebrush more frequently than the more common big sagebrush. The browse of black sagebrush is highly preferred by greater sage-grouse in Nevada. In southeastern Idaho, black sagebrush was preferred as forage.|$|E
