Conte had helped develop a type of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E

50|$|The {{legal status}} of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> varies from country to country. In the U.S., <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> are listed as Schedule III {{controlled}} substances under the Controlled Substances Act, which makes the possession of such substances without a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to seven years in prison. In Canada, <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> and their derivatives {{are part of the}} Controlled drugs and substances act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription. However, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II or III substances. Those guilty of buying or selling <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> in Canada can be imprisoned for up to 18 months.

50|$|Since their discovery, <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> (AAS) {{have been}} widely used as {{performance}}-enhancing drugs to improve performance in sports, to improve one's physical appearance, as self-medication to recover from injury, and as an anti-aging aid.

25|$|The risk of {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma in type 2 diabetics is greater (from 2.5 to 7.1 times the non diabetic risk) {{depending on the}} duration of diabetes and treatment protocol. A suspected contributor to this increased risk is circulating insulin concentration such that diabetics with poor insulin control or on treatments that elevate their insulin output (both states that contribute to a higher circulating insulin concentration) show far greater risk of {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} than diabetics on treatments that reduce circulating insulin concentration. On this note, some diabetics who engage in tight insulin control (by keeping it from being elevated) show risk levels low enough to be indistinguishable from the general population. This phenomenon is thus not isolated to diabetes mellitus type 2 since poor insulin regulation {{is also found in}} other conditions such as metabolic syndrome (specifically, when evidence of non alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD is present) and again there is evidence of greater risk here too. While there are claims that <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> abusers are at greater risk (theorized to be due to insulin and IGF exacerbation), the only evidence that has been confirmed is that <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> users {{are more likely to have}} hepatocellular adenomas (a benign form of HCC) transform into the more dangerous hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
40|$|<b>Anabolic</b> <b>steroids,</b> {{also known}} as anabolic-androgenic steroids or AAS, are a class of steroid hormones related to the hormone testosterone.

Non medical uses for <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> are controversial, because of their adverse effects and their use to gain potential advantage in competitive sports. The use of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> is banned by all major sporting bodies.

25|$|The same act also {{introduced}} more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. By the early 1990s, after AAS were scheduled in the U.S., several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the {{products in the}} U.S., including Ciba, Searle, Syntex, and others. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth.

At the time, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive steroid test. Rodriguez did not immediately confirm the allegations, deferring at first to the players' union. Two days after the allegations, Rodriguez admitted to steroid use from 2001 until 2003, claiming that he ceased using such substances after spring training that year.|$|E
