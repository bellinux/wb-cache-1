40|$|This study {{attempts}} to explore cheating behavior among Malaysian students of tertiary institutions. One {{in particular is}} Terengganu Advanced Technical Institute- University College (TATiUC). Cheating techniques, preventive measures and support required by lecturers to handle cheating incidents were examined. Six former students (confirmed cheaters) and two lecturers <b>cum</b> <b>administrators</b> of TATiUC participated in the study. Data were collected by using narrative responses and interviews. The results showed that creative and innovative techniques were used to outsmart lecturers from detecting cheating occurrences. The results also showed that participants believed even though various preventive measures were implemented, {{they were not able}} to stop academic cheating entirely. However, they were able to deter cheating to a certain extent. Furthermore, it was discovered that there were variations on the implementation of the examination rules and regulations among lecturers. Finally, the study revealed that support in terms of training and courses were needed in dealing with academic dishonesty. Thus, the findings of the study may assist lecturers and administrators in dealing with students' cheating behavior and enlighten the administrators on the kinds of support that can be extended to lecturers to mitigate their struggle dealing with students' academic misconduct...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} archaeology {{as a form of}} colonial knowledge production employed in Simcoe County in the years between 1830 and 1860, set {{against the backdrop of the}} Native assimilation policies in Upper Canada. I argue that the identification of archaeological sites, their survey, documentation, excavation, and the collection of their contents shaped new epistemologies that contributed to the administration and governance of Aboriginal populations, their territories and the nation-building efforts of this period. I ask: Who took on the tasks of digging, mapping and collecting in Simcoe County? Why were Aboriginal remains and artifacts tom from their original contexts and reinserted as new forms of knowledge into European historical chronologies? What did settlers, colonial <b>administrators</b> and missionaries <b>cum</b> archaeologists know, and how did they know? To address these questions, I draw on the theoretical framework advocated by historical anthropology and the anthropology of colonialism. Cultural studies of colonialism have revealed how, in the nineteenth century, all across the globe, territory was conquered not only through physical force and economic expansion but also through the creation of facts that gave colonial agents and settlers power over indigenous societies, their natural resources and their culture. Colonial domination was enacted through the defining and classifying of space, the counting of populations, the codifying and representation of the past, and the insertion of this information into government reports and archives (Cohn 1996; Dirks 1992). While historical anthropologists have focused heavily on the textual documentation found within these archives, I also interrogate the material, archaeological archive to reveal the complex architecture of colonialism. Yet, as this thesis demonstrates, colonial knowledge production was not monolithic, nor was it without its uncertainties: what was observed and how it was recorded and made into governable knowledge was conditioned by particular socio-political circumstances (Stoler 2009; Thomas 1994). Through the four case studies that structure this thesis, I seek out the ways in which the project of colonial archaeology in Simcoe County was both contingent and often unsettled. In addition, I identify how the production of archaeological knowledge was not an isolated activity. Published reports and archaeological evidence from Simcoe County moved quickly across imperial space, influencing the formation of emerging racial typologies and categories of difference within the metropole that, as I conclude, reverberate in the present...|$|R
