5|$|In 1942, while America {{geared up}} for front line {{involvement}} in World War II, Pflueger received fewer assignments {{than he had}} been seeing previously. Grover Magnin kept a flow of work with I. Magnin designs, and Pflueger also helped the Army with a depot building in Ogden, Utah. He began to draw up plans for a 12-story cross-shaped medical teaching hospital for the University of California, San Francisco (eventually to be built at 505 Parnassus in 1955 with additional design work performed by his brother Milton Pflueger). His firm accepted a commission to excavate below the Mark Hopkins Hotel {{in order to create a}} bomb-resistant radio transmission center for <b>AM</b> <b>station</b> KSFO and shortwave programs of the Voice of America. This space became the hotel's underground parking garage after the war.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is home to}} 15am and FM radio {{stations}}, two {{of which}} are French-language stations. St. John's is the only Canadian city served by radio stations whose call letters do not all begin with the letter C. The ITU prefix VO was assigned to the Dominion of Newfoundland before the province joined Canadian Confederation in 1949, and three AM stations kept their existing call letters. However, other commercial radio stations in St. John's that went to air after 1949 use the same range of prefixes (CF–CK) currently in use elsewhere in Canada, with the exception of VOCM-FM, which was permitted to adopt the VOCM callsign because of its corporate association with the <b>AM</b> <b>station</b> that already bore that callsign. VO remains in use in amateur radio.|$|E

25|$|CKY {{was also}} the call sign of two Winnipeg radio stations. CKY (AM) was founded in 1923 by Manitoba Government Telephones. In 1948, the station was {{purchased}} by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which changed its call letters to CBW. In 1949, the CKY call letters were reassigned to a new <b>AM</b> <b>station</b> in Winnipeg, owned by Moffat Broadcasting Ltd., which also founded CJAY-TV in 1960 and CKY-FM in 1962.|$|E
25|$|In the {{complicated}} switch that saw WFAN {{move to the}} 660 frequency, the 1050 frequency that was formerly the home of WFAN became that of Spanish-language WUKQ, owned by Spanish Broadcasting System. However, SBS already owned an <b>AM</b> <b>station</b> in the market, Newark-based WSKQ at 620kHz, and in those days Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules stipulated that companies could own only one <b>AM</b> <b>station</b> per market. As a result, SBS received a temporary waiver to run 1050 while exploring the sale of either AM frequency. SBS chose to keep 620 (it is now WSNR), and 1050 was traded to Forward Communications, which owned WEVD, then at 97.9 FM. After that deal was approved, WEVD's call letters and programming moved to 1050 AM (it is now WEPN and ironically, {{it is also a}} sports station), and SBS took over 97.9 as WSKQ-FM. The October NBC-Emmis switch also saw Emmis's WQHT (then at 103.5MHz.) move to 97.1MHz., which had been the home of NBC's WYNY. Emmis sold the 103.5 frequency to Westwood One, who also acquired the WYNY call letters and its country music format.|$|E
