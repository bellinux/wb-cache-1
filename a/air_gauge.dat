Air serves as the fuel for Extreme Gear, and is depleted gradually as the race goes on. and by certain maneuvers. These include cornering, allowing the player to round sharp turns with ease, and building tension before a jump, which involves using the air to propel the player higher off of ramps. If a player runs out of air, their character will start running, putting them at several disadvantages; they can't boost, attack, corner easily or use charged jumps. After going off ramps, players can perform various tricks, which refill the <b>air</b> <b>gauge</b> according to their rating.|$|E

In the proposed method, based on knowledge of the static characteristics of air gauges, the measuring range is kept unchanged but the nonlinearity is decreased.

As a result, the nonlinearity is reduced from 5 % down to 1 % and even below...|$|E

50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, <b>air</b> inflation <b>gauge,</b> inflation pedal and manual pressure bleed valve. The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The <b>air</b> inflation <b>gauge</b> displays the <b>air</b> pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The <b>air</b> inflation <b>gauge</b> displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual bleed valve is located next to the air hose and <b>air</b> inflation <b>gauge.</b> The manual bleed valve allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R

40|$|Current {{research}} focussed on {{the assessment}} of metal machining process parameters and {{on the development of}} adaptive control show that machine performance. work-piece and tool life, quality of machined surfaces, the geometry of cutting edges, and cutting conditions are closely related to the cutting forces. This information is of great interest to cutting tool manufacturers and users alike. Over the years there have been significant developments and improvements in the equipment used to monitor such forces. In 1930 mechanical gauges were replaced by resistance strain gauges and some 30 years later compact <b>air</b> <b>gauge</b> dynamometers were invented. Since this time intensive research has continued being directed towards developing new approaches to cutting force measurement. The Kistler Company, well known manufacturer of acceleration and piezoelectrical dynamometers worked in this field {{for more than three decades}} and developed vert sensitive devices. While leading manufacturing research laboratories are often equipped with this technology, classical electrical strain gauges and other dynanometers of individual designs are still commonly used in industry. The present paper presents data obtained using different techniques of force measurement in metal machining processes. In particular, areas of uncertainties, illustrated through results concerning the turning process. are analysed, leading to an appraisal of the current status of these measurements and their significance...|$|E

40|$|In process {{characterization}} {{the quality of}} information that is obtained depends directly {{on the quality of}} process model. The current quality revolution is now providing a strong stimulus for rethinking and re-evaluating many statistical ideas. Among these are the role of theoretic knowledge and data in statistical inference and some issues in theoretic-empirical modelling. With this concern the paper takes a broad, pragmatic view of statistical inference to include all aspects of model formulation. The estimation of model parameters traditionally assumes that a model has a prespecified known form and takes no account of possible uncertainty regarding model structure. But in practice model structural uncertainty {{is a fact of life}} and is likely to be more serious than other sources of uncertainty which have received far more attention. This is true whether the model is specified on subject-matter grounds or when a model is formulated, fitted and checked on the same data set in an iterative interactive way. For that reason novel modelling techniques have been fashioned for reducing model uncertainty. Using available knowledge for theoretic model elaboration the techniques that have been created approximate the exact unknown process model concurrently by accessible theoretic and polynomial empirical functions. The paper examines the effects of uncertainty for hybrid theoretic-empirical models and, for reducing uncertainty, additive and multiplicative methods of model formulation are fashioned. Such modelling techniques have been successfully applied to perfect a steady flow model for an <b>air</b> <b>gauge</b> sensor. Validation of the models elaborated has revealed that the multiplicative modelling approach allows us to attain a satisfactory model with small discrepancy from empirical evidence.
