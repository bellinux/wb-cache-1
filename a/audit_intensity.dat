As in previous, informal accounts of corruption-crackdowns, there is a well defined, negative effect on the measures used to capture corruption. Prices paid by hospitals for basic, homogeneous inputs fall by 17 % during {{the first nine months of}} the crackdown. After this period prices rise, but they are still 10 % lower than those prevailing before the crackdown. Relative to the pre-crackdown period, higher wages play no role in inducing lower input prices when <b>audit</b> <b>intensity</b> can be expected to be maximal (during the first phase of the crackdown), but have a negative and well-defined effect when <b>audit</b> <b>intensity</b> takes intermediate levels (the last phase of the crackdown). Controlling for fixed effects, we find that the wage elasticity of input prices exceeds 20 %. These results are consistent with the standard model of bribes of Becker and Stigler (1974). JEL: K 42.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to study the {{possibility}} to apply audit strategies developed for taxation on fraud and involuntary errors in the social benefit sector. The efficiency of different audit strategies is compared using a computer-based optimization algorithm. Two types of audit strategies are used in this study. One is to adapt the <b>audit</b> <b>intensity</b> to the propensity for errors and fraud in different segments of the group studied. The other type of audit strategy is based on adaptation of behaviour through information concerning the <b>audit</b> <b>intensity.</b> A model for determination of optimal tax audit strategies of the latter type was developed by Erard & Feinstein in 1994. This study is {{based on data from}} a large study of temporary parental benefit performed by the Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (Institutet för arbetsmarknadspolitisk utvärdering, IFAU) in 2006. The study has shown {{that it is possible to}} apply the Erard & Feinstein model on benefit fraud. However, the solution method developed by Erard & Feinstein has proven to be non-optimal. A new solution method based on simulation has been developed and used in the study...|$|E

40|$|Between 2006 and 2009, a {{group of}} Costa Rican NGOs, a Spanish aid agency, and local {{residents}} were entangled {{in the pursuit of}} transparency as a means to allocate funding for their “human right to water” project initiatives. Designed as a series of pedagogical activities to “build” local knowledge about water management, the aid agency conditioned their funding to the honest and correct implementation of the project as revealed by a system of indicators. Against orthodoxy, project leaders were put in charge of designing and implementing the auditing system, an arrangement that short-circuited the foundational separation between observers and observed that is customary in transparency-creation projects and gave the whole initiative an experimental quality. This article examines the building of that indicator system, my informants’ own fascination with producing “speaking numbers,” and the punctuated but constitutive role that laughter played in the process. I suggest that numeric indicators and laughter make the <b>audit</b> speak about <b>intensity</b> and emphasis rather than about the exclusive and discrete categories on which transparency is usually predicated. Here, the audit allowed political actors to rework the potential of water governance technologies, rather than limiting them to their explicit possibilities, in order to constitute what project participants imagine as an integral form of political agency. I argue that paying attention to the in-between process of creating the audit, before its final results are disclosed, highlights the self-referential, short-circuited, and productive uses of transparency as a political device...|$|R
40|$|Freight {{transportation}} {{is an integral}} element of various supply chains and has a complex and dynamical interrelationship with human economic activities. Modern logistical strategies paved way to the current supply chain organisation and logistics network design resulting in a more global economy and huge economies of scale. Recent trends of volatility of oil price have major implications in the movement of commodities across the supply chains. Likewise, climate change issues have presented urgent challenges in reducing carbon emissions for the transport and logistics sector. Pressure on the sector comes from both governments and consumers alike, demanding future sustainability as well as corporate environmental and social responsibility. The original contribution {{of this research is}} to investigate the system-wide dynamics of freight transportation and production in the context of supply chains. A theoretical framework called the ‘Geographic Adaptive Potential’ or GAP is built to understand how constraints in energy and emissions affect the production and distribution of commodities. The changes in the supply chain were investigated in four different components, namely a) the potential to shift to less energy and emissions intensive modes for long-haul freight, b) logistical strategies in the last leg of the chain or urban freight and c) local production and distribution, and d) the accessibility of potential customers to the markets. The design of the GAP components is in correspondence with the links of the supply chain. The analyses yielded an evaluation of the adaptive capacity of the freight transport and production system. For long-haul freight, a GIS-based model was created called the ‘New Zealand Intermodal Freight Network’ or NZIFN. It is an optimisation tool integrating the road, rail and shipping network of New Zealand and calculates that minimum time, operating costs, energy and emissions routes between 2 given locations. The case studies of Auckland to Wellington and Auckland to Christchurch distributions of non-perishable products established that even a marginal increase of rail and coastal shipping share produced around 10 % reduction in both freight energy and greenhouse gas emissions. In the study of the last leg of the supply chain, the truck trip generation rates of different food stores were investigated. The strongest factors influencing the trip rates to a store are its size and product variation, the latter being a new parameter introduced in the dissertation. It is defined as the total number of brands for 6 chosen commodities commonly found in the stores. The trip rates together with the truck type and distance travelled were used to compute the freight energy usage of the stores. Results revealed that supermarkets consume the most energy for their delivery operations but relative to its physical size, they are more energy efficient than smaller stores. This is due to the utilisation of advanced logistical strategies such as freight consolidation and the effective use of distribution centres. The localised production chapter was explored in the context of Farmers’ markets and their difference with the conventional supermarket distribution system. Using a freight transport energy <b>audit,</b> the energy <b>intensities</b> of both systems were compared. The findings showed that Farmers’ markets were more energy-intensive than supermarkets owing to the low volumes of goods delivered to the market and the lack of freight consolidation effort in the system. The study on the active mode access of potential customers to both Farmers’ markets and supermarkets captured the interplay between freight and personal transport and is the final component of GAP. The results of the ArcGIS based model called ‘Active Mode Access’ or AMA demonstrated that both Farmers’ markets and supermarkets have the same level of accessibility for walking or biking customers. However, the calculations also showed that almost 87 % of New Zealanders have no AMA to stores and are at risk for fuel price increase. Finally, the key result of this dissertation is the assessment that there is actually limited adaptive capacity of the freight transport and production system. This is due to network infrastructure and geographical constraints as well as commodity type and mode compatibility and other operational concerns. Due to these limitations, the GAP model assessed that reduction in energy and allowable emissions will ultimately reduce the amount of commodities moved in the system...|$|R
40|$|In a {{regulatory}} setting, audit provides incentives to an agent whose actions affect the future {{value of an}} asset. The principal does not observe the <b>audit</b> <b>intensity</b> nor the audit outcome and audit generates soft information. We show that with interim participation constraints, the principal may strictly prefer {{not to use the}} information of the agent but to rely only on the information given by the auditor. When this occurs, the auditor obtains property rights on the asset when he reports that the future value of the asset is high, while the agent is compensated by a monetary payment...|$|E

After the initial six months, however, the effect of efficiency wages on prices is negative and well defined. The effects are economically significant: a 10 % increase in the procurement officer’s wage when the perceived probability of punishment is at the average of our sample is expected to bring about a 1. 2 % reduction in input prices. These results are consistent with the standard model of bribes of Becker and Stigler (1974). Using micro data helps avoid simultaneity problems. JEL: K 42...|$|E
40|$|The Alternative Investment Market (AIM) was {{established}} in 1995 by the London Stock Exchange and, partly due to its more relaxed admission rules and reduced regulation, has established itself as {{an important part of}} the UK quoted company sector. Despite AIM’s growing importance relatively little academic attention has focused on AIM companies with a particular paucity of work in the context of auditing and financial reporting. This study seeks to address this gap by investigating the impact of a range of audit committee characteristics in relation to one proxy for audit quality – audit pricing. The absence of a corporate governance code for AIM companies means that, unlike their fully listed counterparts, there are no disclosure requirements relating to the existence and composition of audit committees. This then provides a fascinating opportunity to ascertain whether audit committee characteristics influence the quality of auditing undertaken in AIM firms. Specifically, following closely existing research in fully listed firms, we undertake an analysis of the impact of audit committee size, independence and expertise on the level of audit fees paid by 290 AIM firms who disclose detailed data on their audit committees. In summary, we find that the presence of an executive director on the audit committee has a significant and negative impact on audit fees while the presence of greater financial expertise has a positive impact. The link between reduced audit committee independence and lower audit fees is consistent with the notion that a lack of independence serves to reduce the extent of <b>audit</b> <b>intensity,</b> resulting in a lower quality audit. The positive impact of expertise on audit fees is consistent with greater expertise ensuring that audits are more comprehensive and resulting in a higher quality audit. Both of these findings are consistent with prevailing regulations relating to listed firms whereby greater audit committee independence and expertise are encouraged...|$|E
