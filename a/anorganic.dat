The installation consists of two identical but mirrored parts placed 100 meters away from each other on the concourse of the Phaeno Science Centre in Wolfsburg, Germany. Placing the two structures in separate locations encourages the visitors to play with each other by manipulating the structures with their hands and bodies, and learning about each other's shapes through touch.

Chromium supplement was in the form of <b>anorganic</b> and organic incoroporated to Rhizopus sp. fungus. Two experimental designs were used in this experiment. A completely randomized design with 10 treatments and 3 replications was used to measure dry matter and organic matter digestibilities (DMD and OMD). A factorial randomized block design 10 x 3 was used to measure total VFA and NH 3 productions. Factor A was diet treatments and Factor B was fermentation period. Rumen fluid was used as block (replication). Treatments consisted of K 1 (control diet), K 2 (K 1 + non mineral Rhizopus sp. fungus), A (K 2 + <b>anorganic</b> Cr) with 4 levels of <b>anorganic</b> Cr (1, 2, 3, and 4 ppm), and O (K 1 + organic Cr) with 4 levels of organic Cr (1, 2, 3, and 4 ppm). Incubation period was carried out for 1, 3, and 5 hours. The addition of non mineral Rhizopus sp. fungus (K 2) decreased total VFA production from 110 to 59 mM (P < 0. 05) and increased NH 3 production from 9. 97 to 13. 28 mM (P < 0. 05). Supplementation of <b>anorganic</b> Cr decreased DMD and OMD compared to K 2 (P < 0. 05), but organic Cr supplementation increased DMD and OMD.

Factor II: The sub-plot consists of three treatments: without fertilizer (P 0), NPK 300 kg /ha (P) and a combination of organic fertilizer 20 tons / ha nonorganic fertilizer (NPK), of 300 kg/ha (P 1). The parameter was the surface erosion rate, the growth and production of potatoes, that were observed, that is environment components: 1) the measurement of soil temperature at night. and the plant component (the number of tubers). The study showed that all types of mulch effectively decrease soil temperature. The rice straw mulch ttreatment with a combination of organic and <b>anorganic</b> fertilizer produced the lowest soil temperature of 17. 82 0 2 C. It is capable of recording the soil temperature up to 6. 43 C. The treatment of types of mulch in combination with organic and <b>anorganic</b> fertilizer produced the highest number of tuber compared to other types of treatments. However, treatment types of mulch are given a combination of organic and <b>anorganic</b> fertilizer resulted in the highest number of tubers. Future work should focus on the use of mulch and fertilizer in getting the optimum growth of potato. ...|$|E
