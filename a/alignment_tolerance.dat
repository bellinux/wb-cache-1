50|$|Stacking layers {{produces}} NIMs at optical frequencies. However, {{the surface}} configuration (non-planar, bulk) of the SRR normally prevents stacking. Although a single-layer SRR structure {{can be constructed}} on a dielectric surface, it is relatively difficult to stack these bulk structures due to <b>alignment</b> <b>tolerance</b> requirements. A stacking technique for SRRs was published in 2007 that uses dielectric spacers to apply a planarization procedure to flatten the SRR layer. It appears that arbitrary many layers can be made this way, including any chosen number of unit cells and variant spatial arrangements of individual layers.|$|E

40|$|The NSLS-II {{light source}} is a {{proposed}} 3 GeV storage ring, {{with the potential}} for ultra-low emittance. Despite the reduced emittance goal for the bare lattice, the closed orbit amplification factors are on average > 55 in both planes, for random quadrupole alignment errors. The high chromaticity will also require strong sextupoles and the low 3 GeV energy will require large dynamic and momentum aperture to insure adequate lifetime. This will require tight <b>alignment</b> <b>tolerances</b> ({approx} 30 {micro}m) on the multipole magnets during installation. By specifying tight <b>alignment</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the magnets on the support girders, the random <b>alignment</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the girders in the tunnel can be significantly relaxed. Using beam based alignment to find the golden orbit through the quadrupole centers, the closed orbit offsets in the multipole magnets will then be reduced to essentially the alignment errors of the magnets, restoring much of the dynamic aperture and lifetime of the bare lattice. Our R&D program to achieve these tight <b>alignment</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the magnets on the girders using a vibrating wire technique, will be discussed and initial results presented...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{interconnects}} {{are considered}} a promising solution for long distance and high bitrate data transmissions, outperforming electrical interconnects in terms of loss and dispersion. Due to the bandwidth and distance advantage of optical interconnects, longer links have been implemented with optics. Recent studies show that optical interconnects have clear advantages even at very short distances - intra system interconnects. The biggest challenge for such optical interconnects is the <b>alignment</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Many free space optical components require very precise assembly and installation, and therefore the overall cost could be increased. This thesis studied the misalignment tolerance and possible alignment correction solutions for optical interconnects at backplane or board level. First the <b>alignment</b> <b>tolerance</b> for free space couplers was simulated and the result indicated the most critical alignments occur between the VCSEL, waveguide and microlens arrays. An in-situ microlens array fabrication method was designed and experimentally demonstrated, with no observable misalignment with the waveguide array. At the receiver side, conical lens arrays were proposed to replace simple microlens arrays for a larger angular <b>alignment</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Multilayer simulation models in CodeV were built to optimized the refractive index and shape profiles of the conical lens arrays. Conical lenses fabricated with micro injection molding machine and fiber etching were characterized. Active component VCSOA was used to correct misalignment in optical connectors between the board and backplane. The alignment correction capability were characterized for both DC and AC (1 GHz) optical signal. The speed and bandwidth of the VCSOA was measured and compared with a same structure VCSEL. Based on the optical inverter being studied in our lab, an all- optical flip-flop was demonstrated using a pair of VCSOAs. This memory cell with random access ability can store one bit optical signal with set or reset beam. The operating conditions were studied to generate two stable states between the VCSOA pair.
