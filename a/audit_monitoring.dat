Our results indicate that the association between audit fees and board/audit committee independence and size are weaker for regulated companies. These observations are consistent with the notion that regulatory oversight partially substitutes the external audit as a monitoring mechanism. However, boards/audit committees with more multiple directorships demand a more extensive audit in the presence of regulatory oversight to protect their reputation capital. Our study enhances our understanding of the complex relationships among the major corporate governance elements. Copyright (c) The Authors. ...|$|E

However, despite the tradition of supervision being strongly embedded in youth justice practice, other imperatives, such as <b>audit</b> <b>monitoring</b> and the focus on inspection readiness, have impacted on the content of supervision and the degree of reflection which occurs. This article reports research that examined the experience of practitioners within a Local Authority Youth Offending Service, exploring the content and level of reflection within their supervision.

Interviews conducted with internal auditors working in State and Local Governmental Bodies (SLoGBs) located in Peninsular Malaysia highlighted numerous problems faced by the audit function. The problems range from staff, skills and training shortages to premeditated obstruction of the auditors in their attempts to perform their duties, and are similar to what is found in many other countries. The way forward towards an improved internal audit function begins with having the right kind of organisational head in the organisations. Other moves include the setting up of audit committees in the organisations and an internal audit monitory body at either the state or the federal level. Improvement in the audit function may also come about with specific moves coming from the federal government, the institutions of higher learning and the internal auditors themselves. For these different moves towards a well-functioning internal audit in SLoGBs to materialise, the prerequisite is Malaysia's possessing the right kind of social and political surroundings – which to this day is still an elusive matter. internal audit; Malaysia; state government; local government; interviews; audit committees; <b>audit</b> <b>monitoring.</b> ...|$|E

This paper presents methods for identification and risk {{assessment of}} central water supply systems, exemplified by {{a case study of}} the central water supply system in Luna locality, Cluj county during 2009 - 2010. System assessment was performed by means of previous data on water quality monitoring and water samples analysis for the parameters imposed by Law 458 / 2002 (<b>audit</b> <b>monitoring)</b> in the laboratories of the Environmental Health Center. The main risk identified at source was the significant water contamination with nitrates, in this regard results did not show significant change of the raw water quality (drain) over time. Occurence of nitrates in excess is of mixed origin in Luna water source, predominantly telluric net and accentuated anthropogenic due to agricultural practices in the area. In this respect, evolution of bacterial load was significantly related to the drain positioning in an intensively exploited agricultural area, the important increase of contamination being due to manure application on upstream lands. Two kinds of hazards were identified at the water treatment plant output and in the distribution network, {{as well as at the}} water source: contamination with nitrates and bacteriological contamination of faecal origin, the latter as a consequence of a completely inadequate chlorination. Water in the distribution network of Luna locality represents low health risks for small population groups (risk score 8), as characterized qualitatively on the basis of monitoring.

Nations have developed regulatory system {{with the aim of}} providing drinking water of sufficient quality and to minimize the risk of contamination of the water supply in the first place. In this study the chemical quality of Icelandic drinking water was evaluated by systematically analyzing results from <b>audit</b> <b>monitoring</b> where 53 parameters were assessed for 345 samples from 79 aquifers, serving 74 water supply systems. Compliance to the Icelandic Drinking Water Regulation (IDWR) was evaluated with regard to parametric values, minimum requirement of sampling, and limit of detection. Water quality compliance was divided according to health-related chemicals and indicators, and analyzed according to size. Samples from few individual locations were benchmarked against natural background levels (NBLs) in order to identify potential pollution sources. The results show that drinking compliance was 99. 97 % in health-related chemicals and 99. 44 % in indicator parameters indicating that Icelandic groundwater abstracted for drinking water supply is generally of high quality with no expected health risks. In 10 water supply systems, of the 74 tested, there was an indication of anthropogenic chemical pollution, either at the source or in the network, and in another 6 water supplies there was a need to improve the water intake to prevent surface water intrusion. Benchmarking against the NBLs proved to be useful in tracing potential pollution sources, providing a useful tool for identifying pollution at an early stage.

It was only in latter part of the 20 "^ century that the world became fully aware of the vulnerability of our planet and mankind's collective ability to damage it sometimes through a neglect that may bprder maUciousness, but more often that not, xmwittingly. Nevertheless, the seaports in recent years have emerged as logistics centres and as key competitive issue for the transportation industry. The seaports have attained a grater height in the transportation industry and have helped in improving supply chain and mass mobility of goods which has spurred economic growth, but it has also strained natural resources and caused extensive enviromnental damage. However, the fundamental question is how can we develop or operate a port system that can both underpin the economic growth to which the vast majority of the" world's population aspires and, at the same tune, have a minimal impact on our jfragile global environment?

40|$|The {{assets are}} {{established}} into a company as {{very important and}} strategic resources that are contributing at {{the creation of the}} needed premises to conduct the daily-basis activity and also to reach present and future planned objectives. Recent studies like COSO's Fraudulent Financial Reporting 1998 - 2007 have highlighted an increasing fraudulent activity against assets therefore the efforts of fighting against fraud must be supplemented in order to preserve the existence and value of those resources. Internal controls are processes implemented in order to give a reasonable assurance that the company will not become a fraud victim. Even so, a lot of internal controls are paying a heavy tribute to their lack of efficiency and update. Thus, for a correct functioning, internal controls must be monitored and assessed permanently in order to preserve their strength and ability to fulfill their mission. This approach will deliver more added value because rather than being corrected after they have already occurred, the frauds related with the assets will be prevented, detected and reported at a timely moment, thereby the incidence and value of those criminal activities will decrease significantly. Furthermore, because not only the process of monitoring is important but even the entity conducting this activity we believe that internal audit is the most appropriate to undertake this responsibility. Thus, through this material we opened a discussion about how important permanent monitored and updated internal controls are in order to assure a proper assets protection and why internal audit, rather than the management, should be the most eligible to undertake this responsibility. Also we provided some suggestions regarding the main activities that must be taken into consideration by an internal audit professional when is being involved in a monitoring process of internal control system. We do believe that this paper will be the starting point for new discussions about the future activities and resources that must be invested in order to assure that internal audit's independence, objectiveness and professionalism will deliver a proper degree of security against frauds. internal <b>audit,</b> <b>monitoring,</b> internal control, assets, fraud...|$|E
40|$|Agency theory {{predicts that}} {{ownership}} structure monitoring mechanisms can effectively align {{the interests of}} managers {{with those of the}} shareholders. In additions, it views external audit as a function that lends credibility to the information disclosed in financial reports. Prior research sustains these predictions in developed markets such as in the US. However, institutional settings such as ownership structure and regulatory oversight bodies differ around the world and accordingly, the sustain ability of agency theory predictions might also differ. Further, little research differentiates between accruals and real activities earnings management in contexts such as the Jordanian where ownership is concentrated, investors' protection is weak and capital market is still evolving. Therefore, this study addresses these issues and investigates the validity of agency theory predictions concerning the effectiveness of ownership structure and external <b>audit</b> <b>monitoring</b> mechanisms in mitigating both accruals and real activities earnings management in Jordan. In this study, four measures of earnings management are estimated through the models of Kothari et al. (2005) and Roychowdhury (2006) : Magnitudes of abnormal accruals are obtained from the former model and magnitudes of abnormal cash flow from operating activities, abnormal production costs and abnormal discretionary expenses are obtained from the latter model. As a result, four empirical models are constructed in which the estimated earnings management measures represent the dependent variables. Independent variables in each empirical model are the same and are classified into three categories: first, ownership structure variables include ownership concentration, controlling shareholders, institutional ownership and foreign ownership. The second category includes external audit quality measured by auditor size. Third, a set of control variables include board size, leverage, growth and firm size. These models are tested using the population of all manufacturing firms listed on Amman Stock Exchange over the period 2005 - 2008. The results reveal that controlling shareholders appear effective in constraining accruals manipulations, sales manipulations and production costs manipulations. As for manipulations in discretionary expenses, the results show that. only high levels of institutional ownership can effectively deter abnormal discretionary expenses. Moreover, contrary to the popular convention, the results suggest that non-big 5 auditors in Jordan who in fact mitigate abnormal accruals not big 5 auditors. Finally, no evidence is found supportive of the substitutive effect. That is, firms that are prevented from managing their earnings through accruals due to the enhanced scrutiny of non-big 5 auditors, do not resort to sales manipulations, production costs manipulations or discretionary expenses manipulations as substitutes to achieve desired levels of reported earnings. Given these findings, the present study provides understanding and extension for agency theory literature that focuses on earnings management in general and in emerging markets in particular. It highlights challenges to applicability of agency theory in emerging markets where corporate governance mechanisms are supposed to mitigate the practice of earnings management. As such, these fading’s could be helpful to investors and other stakeholders in making rational contractual decisions, especially when such decisions involve non-owner- controlled firms. Finally, Amman Stock Exchange could impose the corporate governance codes that actively promote internal corporate governance mechanisms to restrain accruals and real activities earnings management.

40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Quality in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013 Many top performing businesses, which achieve superior levels of success and sustainability, have a sound, implemented, and well maintained, Quality Management System (QMS). The correlation between business success and an implemented management system {{has been shown in}} numerous papers. This research, which culminates in a quantitative measure of QMS performance, was conducted at Eskom’s Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (KNPS). The power station is the operating leg of the Koeberg Operating Unit (KOU). The researcher is a QMS lead auditor in the KNPS Quality Assurance Department. A program of audits is planned based on the KOU quality and safety manual and the national regulatory licencing requirements. The <b>audit</b> <b>monitoring</b> program is then implemented over a three year period and considers all the management system processes which impact on nuclear safety and business performance. The individual audits each consider ISO 9001 criteria in context of the business area audited. Each major business area (e. g. design, maintenance, etc.) within the power station adheres to all generic ISO 9001 QMS clauses and considerations, such as documentation management, records management, etc. Each process or business area audit is thus effectively a QMS audit. The audit results, when combined are therefore a representative measure of the overall organisational QMS performance. The potential value to be gained from the audit results and data accrued over the monitoring period has not been optimised to maximise the return on investment to Eskom. The research problem statement thus proposes that the performance measurement capability of the quality management system at Eskom's Koeberg Power Station is insufficient. This diminishes management's ability to identify business risk resulting from management system deficiencies, which impacts negatively on business performance. The research question seeks to determine how the performance measurement capability of the QMS can be improved to assist management in identifying business risk resulting from quality management system deficiencies in order to improve business performance. The research objectives are supported by the literature study, which identifies the quality management methods currently used in order to measure and subsequently improve business performance. It also shows how QMS performance measurement, when deconstructed and analysed can provide the required insight for supporting management decision making. The research approach is considered inductive in that a theory is developed based on the collection and the analysis of that data. Applied research, will thus serve as the basis of the research methodology as it is considered the most appropriate research approach, based on the need to answer practical questions around the measurement of QMS performance philosophy. The research shows that by introducing additional theming and severity data into the secondary audit findings data, it is possible over time to extract high level strategic direction information when analysing the additional metadata. The dimensions and value of the QMS Performance measuring instrument are: Ø A cause and effect theming philosophy of audit findings providing an additional context to business improvement advice to management. Ø The provision of a QMS process deficiency locator / identifier which targets management action areas for improvement. Ø The provision of a quantitative measure of the management system performance, providing a reference from which to improve.
