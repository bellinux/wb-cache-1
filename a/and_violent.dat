During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined.|$|E

Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife, Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus.|$|E

The sample consisted of 1, 795 adolescents (48 % females) aged 11 to 18 years (M= 14. 2, SD= 1. 68). We used a structural equation model to analyze the effect of classroom environment <b>and</b> victimization in <b>violent</b> manifest <b>and</b> relational behavior. The results found that a direct positive relationship between victimization <b>and</b> relational <b>violent</b> behavior <b>and</b> a direct negative relationship between classroom environment <b>and</b> overt <b>violent</b> behavior. In addition, classroom environment and victimization were indirectly related to overt and relational violence through its relationship with loneliness, nonconformist ideal reputation and transgression of social norms. Multigroup analysis {{results indicated that the}} relationship between loneliness <b>and</b> relational <b>violent</b> behavior was significant for boys but not for girls. Finally, we discuss the results and their practical implications in the school context...|$|R
