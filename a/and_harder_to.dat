5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} edge of a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E

5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} storm petrels {{are found}} in the northern hemisphere although some species around the equator dip into the south. They are strictly pelagic, coming to land only when breeding. In the case of most species, little is known of their behaviour and distribution at sea, where they can be hard to find <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> identify. They are colonial nesters, displaying strong philopatry to their natal colonies and nesting sites. Most species nest in crevices or burrows and all but one species attend the breeding colonies nocturnally. Pairs form long-term monogamous bonds and share incubation and chick-feeding duties. Like many species of seabird, nesting is highly protracted with incubation taking up to 50 days and fledging another 70 days after that.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Proterozoic saw {{at least}} two Snowball Earths, so severe that {{the surface of the}} oceans may have been {{completely}} frozen.

During the Cretaceous the evolution of many fish groups trended towards faster swimming body types, making them harder to hunt for adult ichthyosaurs <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> escape from for newborn ichthyosaurs. This ecological scene favored ambush predators like plesiosaurs and the newly evolved mosasaurs over the ichthyosaurs, who succumbed to the competition.|$|E
25|$|Raw opium may {{be sold to}} a {{merchant}} or broker on the black market, but it usually does not travel far from the field before it is refined into morphine base, because pungent, jelly-like raw opium is bulkier <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> smuggle.

A sticky, brown paste, morphine base is pressed into bricks and sun-dried, and can either be smoked, prepared into other forms or processed into heroin.|$|E

25|$|Reconstructions of {{tectonic plate}} {{movement}} in the past 250million years (the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras) can be made reliably using fitting of continental margins, ocean floor magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic poles. No ocean crust dates back further than that, so earlier reconstructions are more difficult. Paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as orogenic belts, which mark the edges of ancient plates, and past distributions of flora and fauna. The further back in time, the scarcer <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> interpret the data get and the more uncertain the reconstructions.|$|E
25|$|The Penny Black lasted {{less than}} a year. A red {{cancellation}} {{was hard to see}} on the black design and the red ink was easy to remove; both made it possible to re-use cancelled stamps. In February 1841, the Treasury switched to the Penny Red and began using black ink for cancellations instead, which was more effective <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> remove. However, people still reused stamps by combining the uncancelled parts of two stamps to form an unused whole, so in 1864 as a further safeguard the top corner stars on the Penny Red were replaced by the lower corner check letters in reverse order.|$|E
25|$|IWF {{filtering}} {{has been}} criticised as interfering with legitimate Internet activity while being ineffective against anyone intending to access objectionable content. One carefully argued discussion, while opposing {{such things as}} child pornography and terrorism, points out that filtering has side effects, as discussed in this section, and would not stop access to material such as images {{of child sexual abuse}} as it would not stop email, ftp, https, p2p, usenet, irc, or many other ways to access the same content. As there are simple encryption systems, it never can stop it - at best it just drives it underground <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> assess and track.|$|E

25|$|In Season 18, John Nathan-Turner {{became the}} series' producer. He instituted {{a number of}} changes to the show, {{including}} toning down the humour and introducing more science fiction concepts. During this season the Fourth Doctor became very much subdued and, on occasion, melancholy. Baker began the season in poor health, though he eventually recovered. Both the actor and the character seemed noticeably older and tired, due to Baker's gaunt appearance and greying hair. Baker had been finding the role harder <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> maintain and the previous season had been particularly draining on him. Many of this season's stories also had an elegiac tone, with entropy and decay being a recurring theme.|$|E
25|$|The slowest mode of snake {{locomotion}} is rectilinear locomotion, {{which is}} also the only one where the snake does not need to bend its body laterally, though it may do so when turning. In this mode, the belly scales are lifted and pulled forward before being placed down and the body pulled over them. Waves of movement and stasis pass posteriorly, resulting in a series of ripples in the skin. The ribs of the snake do not move in this mode of locomotion and this method is most often used by large pythons, boas, and vipers when stalking prey across open ground as the snake's movements are subtle <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> detect by their prey in this manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} tail or vertical stabilizer of a multi-engine aircraft plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the {{vertical tail}} must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum bank angle of 5° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by FAR.|$|E

Terry's last tour with the group was the 2003 Christmastime Tour with Michael W. Smith, and her last concert was in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 28, 2004. Leigh had been officially on board since January 1, 2004, but her first concert was in Atlanta, Georgia on March 12, 2004.|$|E
25|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of using}} coal as a fuel source is the emission {{of carbon dioxide}} and other pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and particulates. Almost all coal-fired power plants use pulverized coal combustion, which grinds the coal to increase the surface area, burns it to make steam, and runs the steam through a turbine to generate electricity. Pulverized coal plants can only capture carbon dioxide after combustion when it is diluted <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> separate. In comparison, gasification in IGCC allows for separation and capture of the concentrated and pressurized carbon dioxide before combustion. Syngas cleanup includes filters to remove bulk particulates, scrubbing to remove fine particulates, and solid adsorbents for mercury removal. Additionally, hydrogen gas is used as fuel, which produces no pollutants under combustion.|$|E
