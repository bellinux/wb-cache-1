25|$|Jordan was now {{torn between}} his school {{business}} and {{his desire to}} be elected to an honorary surgeon's position at the Manchester Infirmary. He failed in an election of 1828 and again in 1833, although Turner had been successful in 1830. Among those opposing him were his former staff. Competition for the posts was tough and required influence with, and influencing of, both existing staff and people who subscribed the funds that financed the infirmary's work. Jordan determined to spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the next elections {{and to have the}} public support of Turner and his contacts. Jordan was successful in this effort, which arose upon the death of another surgeon in 1835, but it cost him, among other things, his Mount Street school. The school was closed and its students and library were transferred to Pine Street in 1834 as the price for Turner's future support.|$|E

25|$|In May 2002, Unomásuno fired 70 employees, {{including}} {{four of its}} founders: Christa Cowrie, Jorge Reyes Estrada, Fernando Belmont Acero, and Patricia Cardona. Most of them accepted the 33% severance plan the newspaper offered; Editorial Uno {{did not have the}} financial support to pay them what was required by law. The founders and eleven more employees, however, sued Unomásuno and asked for the company to fully pay for their severance plan. The employees wrote a petition stating that they were fired because PRI politician Francisco Labastida Ochoa was not winning the 2000 presidential race. They said that the owners poured <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> his campaign, including money that was to be used to pay its employees. Alonso Muñoz told the press that Unomásuno was going through financial difficulties and that he was thinking of selling the newspaper. The newspaper had MXN$85 million in debt and MXN$20 million in assets (totaling a negative net worth of MXN$65 million). Alonso Muñoz said he was considering partnering with Alonso Coratella's Mundo Ejecutivo media group and starting a new era for Unomásuno.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company {{gained control}} of the Staten Island Railway and its boats. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B) {{obtained}} control of the Staten Island Railway Ferry Company's operations the next year. A controlling interest in the Railway Ferry Company was obtained by the B in 1885 through purchases of stock. On November 21, 1885, Robert Garrett, President of the B, leased the Railway Ferry Company to the B for 99 years. The B could now provide service to a ferry terminal that was closer to Manhattan public transit. Rather than having passengers transfer to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ)'s ferries from the Jersey City Terminal to the Liberty Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan, which was not close to any elevated rail stations in the area, the B could now operate to the Whitehall Street terminal, {{where there was a}} direct transfer to an elevated station. Garrett resigned from his position at the B in 1887, and his successors did not show as much interest in Staten Island transit operations. Wiman lost <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the Panic of 1893, and two years later, much of his property was auctioned to pay off debts.|$|E

500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with Howard Stern, Rollins {{was asked about}} rumors that he had Joe Cole's brain in his house. Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed. During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because days prior to the incident, record producer Rick Rubin – who was {{a fan of the}} Rollins Band – had requested to hear the then newly recorded album, The End of Silence, and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that they had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the home.

The strategy failed {{as many of the}} businesses NWG invested in lost money, leaving the band facing tax rates potentially as high as 83 percent.
