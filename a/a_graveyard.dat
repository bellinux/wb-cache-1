5|$|A small hill {{known as}} Bukit Puteri {{can be found}} nearby to Pasar Payang. The hill is about 200 metres high, located near the banks of Terengganu River. Because of its {{strategic}} location, it {{was used as a}} fortification by the sultans of the state. Old artefacts, <b>a</b> <b>graveyard,</b> and monuments can be found on top of the hill.

5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village that would serve as <b>a</b> <b>graveyard.</b> An unused Louisiana field was {{used to create a}} racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they had to deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke's stuntman.|$|E

5|$|Kościuszko's {{internal}} organs, {{which had}} been removed during embalming, were separately interred in <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> at Zuchwil, near Solothurn. Kościuszko's organs remain there to this day; a large memorial stone was erected in 1820, next to a Polish memorial chapel. His heart, however, was not interred with the other organs, but instead kept in an urn at the Polish Museum in Rapperswil, Switzerland. The heart, {{along with the rest}} of the Museum's holdings, were repatriated back to Warsaw in 1927, where the heart now reposes in a chapel at the Royal Castle.|$|E
5|$|Many rituals {{were used}} to {{identify}} a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question.

5|$|Many, if {{not most}} Mauritians are unaware of the {{existence}} of such <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> in Mauritius.

Women's tombstones have rounded tops; men's have pointed tops, and inscriptions for royalty are gilt. For family members, small mausoleums with intricately-decorated stone walls were built.|$|E
5|$|Davidson took 4/62 in {{the first}} innings of the Third Test in Delhi as Australia took a 98-run first innings lead, but {{he was unable to}} add to his tally in the second innings as the hosts' batsmen held on for a draw.

Davidson had led the way with 29 wickets at 14.86 in a country {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> for fast bowling—in this era, the home team's attack was dominated by spinners. In six Tests in India, Davidson had taken 30 wickets at an average of 15.77.|$|E
5|$|Dealing with sanitation, Espejo {{observed}} that the hospital (Hospital de la Misericordia) of the city, the monasteries and the places of worship were filthy and that this would certainly contribute to future epidemics. He disapproved of the custom of burying the dead inside churches; instead, he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> chosen by the Church and owned by the town council. Finally, he condemned {{the management of the}} hospital by the Bethlehemites. He said their methods were outdated and that they provided poor service. The staff of the hospital reacted badly to this, and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor, José del Rosario.|$|E

5|$|Following {{financial}} difficulties during the First World War, the mining operations were bought by Store Norske, which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916. That year, SNSK built five new barracks, {{including one that}} {{was made into a}} hospital. SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank, consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone. The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset. In 1918, eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> was established in Longyear City. Two years later, 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1. This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2. The same year, the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory was rebuilt three times; {{the ruins}} visible today are principally {{those of the}} third rebuild. The site was {{occupied}} in Anglo-Saxon times {{by at least one}} structure, possibly a timber-framed church or boundary wall, indicated by a number of postholes. It is believed there was a Saxon settlement in the vicinity as late-Saxon potsherds and an 8th-century coin have been found buried under the remains of the priory's west nave. The site was abandoned at some point {{and by the time the}} priory was built the land on which it stood was mostly under cultivation. Part of it was used as <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> in the early 12th century and an early Norman building was erected in the vicinity, possibly a temporary church.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era.

Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E

5|$|The chapel {{replaced}} the Mosley Street Chapel (built 1789, demolished 1836) upon its completion for baptisms, burials and marriages. It was originally constructed for the Unitarians. The chapel {{was used for}} burial rites until 1882, the chapel had <b>a</b> <b>graveyard</b> from the outset, to both {{the north and south}} sides of the chapel. Restrictions were placed on this in 1856 and prohibited in 1882 except for the removal of remains from graves on the north side to brick vaults {{on the south side of}} the chapel. Baptisms were performed until at least 1912, and marriages until at least 1916. Ministers at the chapel include John James Tayler (until 1853), William Henry Herford (1866–70), Philip Wicksteed (circa 1890), John Trevor (1890–91, left to start The Labour Church) and Edward Walker Sealy (1910-???).|$|E
5|$|Various {{features}} in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder takes place in <b>a</b> <b>graveyard,</b> said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one {{for the end of}} the witching hour.
