5|$|After {{saving the}} Mushroom Kingdom in Super Mario Bros. 3, {{brothers}} Mario and Luigi {{decide to go}} on holiday to a place called Dinosaur Land, where there are many types of dinosaurs. However, while resting on the beach, Princess Toadstool disappears. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who then tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopas. Mario and Luigi soon realise {{that it must be}} the evil King Bowser and his Koopalings.|$|E
5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. <b>After</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.|$|E

5|$|Admiral de Grasse had {{the option}} to attack British forces in either New York or Virginia; he opted for Virginia, {{arriving}} at the Chesapeake {{at the end of}} August. Admiral Graves learned that de Grasse had sailed from the West Indies for North America and that French Admiral de Barras had also sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, and he concluded {{that they were going to}} join forces at the Chesapeake. He sailed south from New York with 19 ships of the line and arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake early on 5 September to see de Grasse's fleet at anchor in the bay. De Grasse hastily prepared most of his fleet for battle—24 ships of the line—and sailed out to meet him, and the two-hour engagement took place <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> maneuvering. The lines of the two fleets did not completely meet; only the forward and center sections fully engaged. The battle was consequently fairly evenly matched, although the British suffered more casualties and ship damage, and it broke off when the sun set. The British tactics have been a subject of debate ever since.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, in Hidalgo, about 100families {{required}} evacuation {{across the}} municipalities of Tlanchinol and Orizatlán due to heavy rain, with 7.09in (180.1mm) recorded in the latter. The rainfall triggered more than 80landslides statewide, and two {{were killed in a}} rockslide near the town of Jacala. Swollen rivers in El Arenal and Huejutla caused two drownings. Total damage from Arlene reached Mex$2.6billion (US$207.4million) across Hidalgo. In response, the state government allocated a total Mex$17million (US$1.45million) for rehabilitation works. Downpours in the state of Puebla triggered landslides that cut off roads to traffic. Toppled trees struck a home in the municipality of Zihuateutla, killing its inhabitant. In Tlacotepec municipality, a girl was left missing after falling into a rushing stream; by July4, officials confirmed she had drowned. <b>After</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> prolonged rainfall, concerns arose over the potential overflow of a dam in the municipality of Tlatlauquitepec. Three houses sustained damage in Eloxochitlán as a consequence of excessively saturated soils, and another collapsed in Atempan. Elsewhere in Puebla, mud and flood waters reached 1.6ft (0.5m) in a school after a nearby river overflowed.|$|E
5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric {{against them in}} arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, {{so much so that the}} body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the government. <b>After</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 2010, Van der Sloot {{reportedly}} {{confessed to}} killing Flores, <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> interrogation. He initially proclaimed his innocence. According to {{an expert in}} Peruvian law, the confession fit a defense strategy {{of trying to get}} the charge reduced to manslaughter, which is punishable by 6 to 20 years in prison, while a conviction for murder could result in up to 35 years' imprisonment. The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 30 years. Peru does not issue life sentences in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but exceptional circumstances, such as crimes committed under military law. A life sentence can be issued for a murder committed during the commission of a robbery. Peruvian president Alan García Pérez used the case to seek the reinstatement of the death penalty for murder.|$|E
5|$|Towards 15:00, <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> resistance, the Russian {{army was}} in dire straits, but the French forces were {{exhausted}} and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will {{to carry out}} another assault. At this crucial juncture, Murat's chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor's Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote {{an account of the}} campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was visible through the gaping hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war. Generals Daru, Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard to be committed to battle.|$|E

25|$|Teleradiology is the {{transmission}} of radiographic images from one location to another for interpretation by an appropriately trained professional, usually a Radiologist or Reporting Radiographer.

In these cases, the images can be sent across time zones (e.g. to Spain, Australia, India) with the receiving Clinician working his normal daylight hours. However at present, large private teleradiology companies in the U.S. currently provide most after-hours coverage employing night working Radiologists in the U.S. Teleradiology {{can also be used}} to obtain consultation with an expert or subspecialist about a complicated or puzzling case.|$|E
