2500|$|<b>Adaptive</b> <b>control</b> [...] {{control method}} {{used by a}} {{controller}} which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain. For example, as an aircraft flies, its mass will slowly decrease {{as a result of}} fuel consumption; a control law is needed that adapts itself to such changing conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The ACT (<b>Adaptive</b> <b>Control</b> of Thought) (and later ACT-R (<b>Adaptive</b> <b>Control</b> of Thought-Rational)) {{theory of}} {{cognition}} represents declarative memory (of which semantic memory is a part) with [...] "chunks", which {{consist of a}} label, a set of defined relationships to other chunks (i.e., [...] "this is a _", or [...] "this has a _"), {{and any number of}} chunk-specific properties. Chunks, then, can be mapped as a semantic network, given that each node is a chunk with its unique properties, and each link is the chunk's relationship to another chunk. In ACT, a chunk's activation decreases {{as a function of the}} time since the chunk was created and increases with the number of times the chunk has been retrieved from memory. Chunks can also receive activation from Gaussian noise, and from their similarity to other chunks. For example, if [...] "chicken" [...] is used as a retrieval cue, [...] "canary" [...] will receive activation by virtue of its similarity to the cue (i.e., both are birds, etc.). When retrieving items from memory, ACT looks at the most active chunk in memory; if it is above threshold, it is retrieved, otherwise an [...] "error of omission" [...] has occurred, i.e., the item has been forgotten. There is, additionally, a retrieval latency, which varies inversely with the amount by which the activation of the retrieved chunk exceeds the retrieval threshold. This latency is used in measuring the response time of the ACT model, to compare it to human performance.|$|E
