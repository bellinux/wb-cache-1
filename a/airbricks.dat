50|$|The {{first step}} in any course of {{treatment}} {{is to make the}} necessary repairs to the building defects (overflowing gutters, blocked <b>airbricks,</b> missing slates, etc.) that allowed the ingress of dampness. The treatment methods described below assume that the dry rot has been positively identified, {{the full extent of the}} rot ascertained, and that the building is now water tight.|$|E
5000|$|Stanley {{wanted the}} new {{building}} at the Government Printing Office to be constructed with machine-pressed bricks, which were not yet produced in Brisbane. At {{the time it was}} reported that he wanted [...] "to provide as much accommodation as possible in a plain substantial building, without striving after architectural display. The structure, however...will have really a handsome and imposing appearance". Tenders were called in October 1872, and the tender of John Petrie, for £4,751 plus £170 for machine pressed bricks and £50 for internal dressing, was accepted. The building included stone footings, brick walls, cast iron <b>airbricks</b> to the understorey and at the ceilings, cast iron columns (ground and first floors, front wing only), and water closets (WCs) and a lift {{at the end of the}} rear wing on each floor. The roof was steeply pitched to assist ventilation. Construction was estimated to take six months, but the new office was not completed until 1874, with delays being blamed on a shortage of bricklayers. The machinery was installed and gas lights were fitted by April 1874, and the finished cost was £5331/3/6.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} some of the most recent tests {{involving}} a number of studies in an unoccupied radon test house. The house has a suspended timber floor and naturally elevated indoor radon levels, peaking at times above 6000 Bqm 3. Various sensors monitor how different ventilation strategies affect indoor radon levels and the building environment Data from five different scenarios is presented. Initially the house was monitored as purchased with poor natural underfloor ventilation. This was followed by testing whole house pressurisation, improved natural undcrfloor ventilation, and two types of mechanical underfloor ventilation. The results from these and future studies may be used to make a more informed choice of remedy, based on a whole number of aspects, not only radon reduction as is frequently the case. DEFINITIONS To assist the reader it is necessary to explain some of the terms used in this paper. <b>Airbrick</b> a purpose built vent positioned in the external wall of an underfloor space to promote air movement Underfloor space: the space beneath a suspended floor. In the US this {{is often referred to as}} the crawl-space. In the UK such spaces are commonly inaccessible and poorly ventilated. Underfloor extract ventilation: mechanical extract ventilation of the underfloor space. Air is discharged to the outside. Underfloor supply ventilation: mechanical simply ventilation of outside air to the underflow space. Spillage: the flow of combustion gases into the room in which the combustion appliance is sited. This d y occurs for combustion appliances which are naturally ventilated by room air. Spillage is often referred to as 'backdraughting'.,. ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 10 million suspended timber ground floor constructions in the UK and millions more globally. However, {{it is unknown}} {{how many of these}} floors are insulated and their performance has not been widely investigated. This study investigates the impact of retrofitting insulation on the thermal performance of suspended timber ground floors through the detailed investigation of a UK case study dwelling. Practical and buildable interventions were undertaken: fully-filling the floor void with EPS beads, and 100 mm woodfibre insulation between the joists. The performance of both interventions was monitored by high-resolution in-situ heat-flow monitoring in 27 floor locations, allowing for comparison with the uninsulated floor and with modelled results. While floors often remain uninsulated due to the disruption of retrospective works, this study highlighted potentially significant heat loss reductions: the mean whole floor U-value dropped by 65 % for woodfibre insulation and 92 % for bead-insulation which also benefited from sealed <b>airbricks.</b> A disparity between the in-situ measured and modelled performance was observed; this gap reduced the better insulated the floor was. The findings have implications for policy, retrofit decision-making and carbon emission reduction stock models, especially given the modelled underestimation of floor heat loss, impact of interventions and assumed financial payback for this study...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether varieties selected in field trials "field selections " and commercial varieties occurred amongst the lower yielding plants at the potted seedling stage. Total above ground mass was determined for each plant. Few selections or commercial varieties occurred in the lightest 30 and 50 % of the plants. In a third experiment, 2 680 original seedlings growing in pots were assessed by eye for vigour. Approximately 25 % of the least vigorous plants were classified as "discards". A sample of 400 of the discards was sent through the normal field selection programme together with the 2 010 plants regarded as selections. No clones from amongst the discards reached stage IV of the field selection programme. Also, at earlier stages the selections outyielded the discards. The individual stalks can be cut and used as seedcane (Thomas'). This present study was done to assess {{the degree to which}} potentially good varieties are likely to be lost if the least vigorous plants are discarded at the potted seedling stage. Materials and Methods Seedlings were started in trays before being transferred to pots. <b>Airbricks</b> served as convenient pots (see Fig 1), giving a plant spacing of approximately 100 x 100 mm. The seedlings for all the trials were grown for 7 - 8 months. Setts slightly more than 20 mm long were cut from the small stalks and used to establish stage I (single stools) ofthe field programme (Fig 2) ...|$|E
