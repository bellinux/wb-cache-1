Under caution, he made a pit stop to have his car's toe plate checked <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> front end aligned. When the race restarted on lap8, Kevin Harvick led but after one lap, Martin and Allmendinger passed him. Three laps later, the second caution came out when J. J. Yeley had an engine failure. Most of the drivers made pit stops under the caution, except for Brad Keselowski. At the restart, he would lead and Bobby Labonte passed him for the lead on the next lap.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was a tactically {{versatile}} player, with a {{good understanding}} of the game, and was comfortable attacking on both wings or through the centre of the pitch; this allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line. His preferred position was in a free-role, as a creative, attacking midfield playmaker, although he was rarely deployed in this position throughout his career due to the prevalence of the 4–4–2 formation, in which he usually functioned as a striker. It was only in later years he was able to play in this free role more frequently. A prolific goalscorer, Baggio was an accurate finisher from {{both inside and outside the}} area, known for his composure in front of goal. Due to his excellent technique, he was a precise volleyer and a set piece specialist, renowned for his accurate bending shots and free-kicks. His free-kick technique influenced several other players, such as Alessandro Del Piero and Andrea Pirlo. During his time with Juventus, his free kick technique was described as cross between that of Maradona's, Zico's, and Platini's, as at the time, his ball-striking technique was thought to resemble Platini's, although, like Zico and Maradona, he preferred to take free kicks from close range, usually from a distance of around 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even just outside the area, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ball touched by a teammate first before striking it. Despite his decisive miss in the 1994 World Cup final shootout, Baggio was also a penalty kick specialist.|$|E

25|$|Student demonstrators, taking {{advantage}} of the loosening political atmosphere, reacted to a variety of causes of discontent. The diverse demands of protesters included greater economic liberalization, political democracy, media freedom, freedom of speech and association, rule of law, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> legitimacy of the movement recognized. Some protest leaders spoke against official corruption and speculation, price stability, social security, and the democratic means to supervise the reform process. Ironically, some of the original invective was also directed against Zhao. Party hardliners increasingly {{came to the conclusion that}} the demonstrations were due to Zhao's rapid pace of reform, which they believed caused a sense of confusion and frustration among college students. The protesters may have been encouraged by the imminent collapse of other Communist governments in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The core {{objective}} in {{training to be}} a solo diver is to become as self-sufficient and self-reliant as possible, {{to be able to}} deal with any reasonably foreseeable problems without assistance, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> competence, fitness, discipline, skills and equipment that will achieve this result. This requires competence at risk-assessment and the ability to plan dives and select equipment that limit the risks. An additional benefit of these disciplines is that they will improve the safety of buddy diving whenever the competent solo diver pairs up with another diver in a buddy team by reducing the risk of the second diver being exposed to an emergency which they may not be capable of managing. Agencies training solo divers also recommend the self-sufficiency training in their courses for all divers as their diving experience grows, so as to achieve greater safety in all diving—buddy and solo.|$|E

25|$|Art {{director}} James Robbins {{developed the}} design of the Ori and the Priors from scratch. At the beginning he knew a basic description of them and their powers, and that they would carry a staff weapon. The art department first looked at Japanese and Samurai from a costuming point of view. Inspired by remote jungle tribes for the mystical aspects, Robbins {{came up with the idea}} of scarification for the Priors and the Doci. The Priors have scarifications on the chin and the cheek, while the Doci also have them on their forehead. Scarification would therefore be a symbol of high establishment. Originally, it was also considered to have scarification on the hands, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Priors have finger extensions, but this became too impracticable. When the Prime Jaffa Gerak became a Prior in , his golden Jaffa tattoo on his forehead was replaced with a Prior scarification, and his makeup was made to look like the gold had melted and become part of his Prior scarification.|$|E
25|$|The Enlightenment {{also caused}} growing difficulties, as Voltaire and other Philosophes argued against unquestioned {{acceptance}} of the doctrines of the church. Paris became a battleground between the established church and the largely upper-class followers of a sect called Jansenism, founded in Paris in 1623, and fiercely persecuted by both Louis XIV and the Pope. The archbishop of Paris required that dying persons sign a document renouncing Jansenism; if they refused to sign, they were denied last rites from the church. There were rebellions over smaller matters as well; in 1765 twenty-eight Benedictine monks petitioned the King to postpone the hour of first prayers so they could sleep longer, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to wear more attractive robes. The church in Paris also had great difficulty recruiting new priests among the Parisians; of 870 priests ordained in Paris between 1778 and 1789, only one-third {{were born in the}} city.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, a {{confrontation}} broke {{out between the}} student protesters and the police {{when a group of}} female students went to sit in front of the monks who were on hunger strike. The police misinterpreted the move as the students attempting to push through the line and came charging toward the students. The issue was later resolved when student leaders came to calm down the situation. Earlier that day, students negotiated with Bago Region Border and Security Affairs Minister Col. Thet Htun who urged them to halt their march. The students offered a compromise and stated that they would disperse in Yangon if the minister agreed on the eight-point conditions: to march to Tharawaddy, the nearest town; to fly banners and use megaphones after they embarked on vehicles to Yangon; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> police forces keep a distance from them. However, they did not receive any response from the minister.|$|E

25|$|Jordan was now {{torn between}} his school {{business}} and {{his desire to}} be elected to an honorary surgeon's position at the Manchester Infirmary. He failed in an election of 1828 and again in 1833, although Turner had been successful in 1830. Among those opposing him were his former staff. Competition for the posts was tough and required influence with, and influencing of, both existing staff and people who subscribed the funds that financed the infirmary's work. Jordan determined {{to spend a lot}} of money in the next elections <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> public support of Turner and his contacts. Jordan was successful in this effort, which arose upon the death of another surgeon in 1835, but it cost him, among other things, his Mount Street school. The school was closed and its students and library were transferred to Pine Street in 1834 as the price for Turner's future support.|$|E
