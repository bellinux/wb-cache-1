50|$|Flashing may {{be exposed}} or concealed. Exposed {{flashing}} is usually of a sheet metal and concealed flashing may be metal or a flexible, <b>adhesive</b> <b>backed,</b> material particularly around wall penetrations such as window and door openings.|$|E
50|$|Types of {{flexible}} flashing products are rubberized asphalt, butyl rubber, polyvinylidene fluoride (sometimes known as kylar or hylar), and acrylic. The different types have different application temperature ranges, material adhesion compatibility, chemical compatibility, levels of volatile organic compounds, resistance to ultraviolet light exposure. No flexible flashing material {{is designed to}} remain exposed {{over the long term}} as are metal flashing materials. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>backed</b> materials are convenient during installation, but such adhesives are not intended for long-term water-resistance.|$|E

50|$|When {{the rack}} was manufactured, as a wire was installed, each end would be marked with wire labels (a.k.a. wire markers). This also applied for pulling wire into the factory through conduit or in trays where each wire would have {{corresponding}} numbers. Wire labels were typically pieces of white tape with numbers or letters printed onto them and collected in small, pocket sized booklets. A number strip would be peeled out and {{wrapped around the}} wire near the end. Wire numbers were {{made up of a}} series of the number strips so wire 1051 would be four strips. There are also pocket sized printers that print onto an <b>adhesive</b> <b>backed</b> label that can be wrapped around the wire.|$|E
5000|$|Electrodes from a {{power supply}} are {{attached}} to the transparent electrodes. With no applied voltage, the liquid crystals are randomly arranged in the droplets, resulting in scattering of light as it passes through the smart window assembly. This results in the translucent, [...] "milky white" [...] appearance. When a voltage is applied to the electrodes, the electric field formed between the two transparent electrodes on the glass causes the liquid crystals to align, allowing light to pass through the droplets with very little scattering and resulting in a transparent state. The degree of transparency can be controlled by the applied voltage. This is possible because at lower voltages, {{only a few of the}} liquid crystals align completely in the electric field, so only a small portion of the light passes through while most of the light is scattered. As the voltage is increased, fewer liquid crystals remain out of alignment, resulting in less light being scattered. It is also possible to control the amount of light and heat passing through, when tints and special inner layers are used. It is also possible to create fire-rated and anti X-Ray versions for use in special applications. Most of the devices offered today operate in on or off states only, even though the technology to provide for variable levels of transparency is easily applied. This technology has been used in interior and exterior settings for privacy control (for example conference rooms, intensive-care areas, bathroom/shower doors) and as a temporary projection screen. It is commercially available in rolls as <b>adhesive</b> <b>backed</b> Smart film that can be applied to existing windows and trimmed to size in the field.|$|E

40|$|The modern {{equivalent}} of copper sheathing, so successful on Nelson’s ships, {{is the use}} of a 90 - 10 copper-nickel alloy applied as an <b>adhesive</b> <b>backed</b> foil to ships and as granules embedded in polychloroprene rubber used on legs and risers of offshore structures. The 10 % nickel alloy is reported to have better corrosion resistance than copper whilst maintaining similar biofouling resistance. While independent long term evaluation studies for copper-nickel itself are widely available, little data exists for these types of composite products. A 7 and 8 year raft exposure trial study in Langstone Harbour, UK, evaluating the corrosion and biofouling behaviour of the foil and granule composite products respectively has now been completed. Removals of panels for destructive assessment after 1, 4 or 5 and 7 or 8 years were made. In addition, a third product under development {{at the start of the}} study, involving expanded mesh with a neoprene backing, and also a single sample of hot rolled plate were included in this study. The adhesion of the foil product was measured by peel resistance tests on 3 occasions over the exposure time. The results show that all products showed restricted colonization of fouling species and remained largely free of macrofouling. Where present it could be wiped away fairly readily. The foil product had thinned 5. 5 µm per annum when averaged over a 7 year period. Some reduction in bond strength was observed for the foil, being less pronounced on steel than GRP...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the {{activities on the}} ''Ultra Miniaturization of RF'' project conducted as part of Sandia's Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program. The objective was to evaluate a multichip module technology known as Microwave Chip on Flex (MCOF) [1], which is a newer form of the standard high density interconnect (HDI) technology originally developed by General Electric and Lockheed Martin [2, 3]. The program was a three-year effort. In the first year, the team focused on understanding the technology and developing a basic design library. In the second year, devices and interconnects used at L, X, and Ku frequency bands were evaluated via a test coupon (with no application specific circuit design). In the third year, we designed, fabricated, and evaluated a specific Ku-band circuit. The circuit design and layout was performed by Sandia, and the module fabrication was performed by Lockheed Martin Government Electronic Systems. In MCOF technology [1], bare die are placed face down on an <b>adhesive</b> <b>backed</b> flex circuit. The first level of the circuit is a pre-patterned titanium copper thin film metal system on a polyimide dielectric material. The complete module is then framed and filled with an epoxy encapsulant. The module is flipped and via holes are laser drilled through subsequent interconnect layers. Each addition layer is adhered {{to the top of}} the module and laser drilling repeated. The baseline design consisted of the original pre-patterned layer plus two additional metal layers. The base of the module is then machined so the heat spreader and frame are planar for a good thermal and electrical connection to the next assembly. This report {{describes the}} efforts conducted to evaluate the technology and its applicability to Sandia RF systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Household energy use accounts for nearly one-fourth of all energy consumed in the United States, amounting to more than $ 200 billion per year spent by consumers. Recent increases in energy prices have heightened consumers' interest in making their households more energy efficient. To this end, the federal government manages two key efforts [...] EnergyGuide and Energy Star [...] to inform consumers about the energy consumed by certain household products. EnergyGuide is a mandatory labeling program created under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) and administered by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with assistance from the Department of Energy (DOE). It requires manufacturers to label and prominently display information about the energy consumption and annual energy costs of 11 categories of household products. In recent years, manufacturers have used <b>adhesive</b> <b>backed</b> labels adhered to appliances and so-called "hang tags" loosely attached to the interior or exterior of appliances. In its August 2007 revisions to the rule, FTC, among other things, prohibited the use of hang tags on the exterior of appliances, but continues to allow them on the inside. The law requires retailers to provide this information in catalogs offering products for sale. In 2000, FTC interpreted its authority over catalogs to encompass Web sites and required retailers to provide the same information on Web sites where consumers may purchase such products. The law prohibits retailers from removing labels placed by manufacturers or making them illegible. Also, EPCA requires DOE, in consultation with FTC, to study new product categories {{to determine whether they}} should be added to the EnergyGuide program and to report annually on the energy savings of the program. Energy Star is a voluntary labeling program created in response to the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and jointly administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOE. In general, it is designed to identify models for 26 categories of household products that, without sacrificing performance, are the most energy efficient (the top 25 percent). Manufacturers are permitted to apply the Energy Star logo to products that the manufacturers identify are qualified, based on EPA or DOE criteria. Standards for internal control in the federal government require federal agencies, including FTC, EPA, and DOE, to establish goals, measure performance, and report program costs and accomplishments in order to improve management and program effectiveness. In this context, Congress asked us to analyze the EnergyGuide and Energy Star programs to determine (1) how these programs have changed over time, (2) how federal agencies verify the accuracy of the energy consumption estimates for household products covered by these programs, (3) the actions federal agencies take to ensure that the EnergyGuide is available to consumers and that the Energy Star logo is not misused, and (4) how federal agencies measure the effectiveness and cost of these programs. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{provided}} to bond strain gauges to various materials. First, a tape with an <b>adhesive</b> <b>backing</b> is placed across {{the inside of}} the fixture frame. The strain gauge is flatly placed against the <b>adhesive</b> <b>backing</b> and coated with a thin, uniform layer of adhesive. The tape is then removed from the fixture frame and placed, strain gauge side down, on the material to be tested. If the material is a high reluctance material, the induction heating source is placed on the tape. If the material is a low reluctance material, a plate with a ferric side and a rubber side is placed, ferric side down, onto the tape. The induction heating source is then placed upon the rubber side. If the material is an insulator material, a ferric plate is placed on the tape. The induction heating source is then placed on the ferric plate. The inductive heating source then generates frequenty from 60 to 70 kilocycles to inductively heat either low reluctance material, ferric side, of ferric plate and provides incidental pressure of approximately five pounds per square inch to the tape for two minutes, thoroughly curing the adhesive. The induction heating source, and, if necessary, the plate or ferric plate, are then removed from the tape after one minute. The tape is then removed from the bonded strain gauge...|$|R
