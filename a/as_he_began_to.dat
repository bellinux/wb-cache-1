5|$|By 1909 Keynes had {{published}} his first professional economics {{article in the}} Economics Journal, {{about the effect of}} a recent global economic downturn on India. He founded the Political Economy Club, a weekly discussion group. Also in 1909, Keynes accepted a lectureship in economics funded personally by Alfred Marshall. Keynes's earnings rose further <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> take on pupils for private tuition.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{remained}} {{active in}} the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He {{became a member of}} the state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{read up on}} {{the written}} {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Lodge of Antiquity in London in 1863, and {{that same year}} became Grand Chaplain of United Grand Lodge. While still Rector of Swillington, his new masonic duties {{took him to the}} consecration of many new lodges, and saw him deliver the oration at the laying of the {{foundation}} stone for the new extension to Freemason's Hall in Great Queen Street, London, the next year. In the same period, Woodford started to contribute articles on masonic history, starting with his researches into the old York lodges. He became known to local booksellers <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> collect old manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|They {{then changed}} the line-up with Ed Lay {{replacing}} Geraint Owen on drums <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{focus on his}} Welsh band The Heights. Under this lineup they became known as Snowfield. They played their debut gig under this name {{at the request of}} Fused Magazine in March 2003. The following summer the band self-released a demo six-track EP, all of which went on to become future Editors songs. Then, as it was the home of their management and the nearest big city, the band relocated to Birmingham after graduation in the autumn of 2003.|$|E
5|$|Titian was a {{personal}} friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given {{as a means to}} strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> see himself unaccountable to Rome.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Zoghby {{considered}} {{the issues of}} ecumenism and the schism between the Melkite Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox Churches. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> study both the historical roots of the separation and the modern divisions of Middle Eastern churches {{he came to the}} opinion that the schism was unjustifiable. He also began to question the domination of the so-called Uniate churches by the See of Rome. Zoghby, along with other Melkite priests in Egypt such as George Hakim and Joseph Tawil, were influenced by Father Oreste Karame, who advocated the need for the Melkite Church to return to its proper traditions and work for communion with the Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|Bolstered by {{publicity}} stunts, Land of the Soviets was {{a commercial}} success in Belgium, and also witnessed serialisation in France and Switzerland. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in the Congo, and the series became a defining {{part of the}} Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Damage to the original plates prevented republication of the book for several decades, while Hergé later expressed embarrassment at the crudeness of the work. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> redraw his earlier Adventures in second, colour versions from 1942 onward, he decided against doing so for Land of the Soviets; {{it was the only}} completed Tintin story that Hergé did not reproduce in colour. Growing demand among fans of the series resulted in the production of unauthorised copies of the book in the 1960s, with the first officially sanctioned republication appearing in 1969, after which it was translated into several other languages, including English. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing it as one of Hergé's weakest works.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of Victor Peirce in episode eight {{is portrayed as}} taking place in his car {{at the front of}} his home, but Peirce was shot dead while parked opposite a supermarket in Bay Street, Port Melbourne. The murder of alleged drug dealer Willie Thompson was portrayed in episode ten as Thompson being shot after leaving a martial arts class in broad daylight. However, Thompson was shot dead at around 9:30 pm, and the murder occurred on Waverley Road in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> drive off in his car, directly outside the entrance to the martial arts centre. Another fiction portrayed was the murder of Nik Radev by both Victor Brincat and Andrew Veniamin in the late hours of the night when Radev was in fact ambushed on a residential street in Coburg in the company of two bodyguards in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Once Jardine left Oxford, {{he began}} to qualify as a {{solicitor}} while still playing for Surrey. He made steady progress {{over the next three}} seasons but was overshadowed by other amateur batsmen. His contemporaries at Oxford and Cambridge attracted more attention in the press, as did the next generation of amateur batsmen. He was appointed vice-captain to Fender for the 1924 season. Several professionals, such as Jack Hobbs, could have been made captain, but Jardine was preferred as an amateur. In that season, Jardine was selected for the Gentlemen v Players match {{for the first time and}} came third in the Surrey averages. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,249 runs at an average of 40.29. In the following season, Jardine was less successful, scoring fewer runs at a lower average and with a highest score of 87 (1,020 runs at 30.90). Suggestions made in the press that Jardine should captain the Gentlemen with a view towards the future of the England Test team, were ignored. In the event, owing to an injury sustained playing village cricket, he was unable to appear in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. In 1926, Jardine had his most successful season to date, with 1,473 runs (average 46.03), although he was again overshadowed by other players and by the attention given to the Ashes series being played. Towards the end of the season, his batting became more attractive and his rate of scoring increased <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> play more shots. His assurance and judgement against all bowling, even international bowlers, increased and he scored 538 runs in his final ten innings.|$|E

5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, and {{imagined}} of catching a whale that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London.

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{study and}} {{interact}} with the works of European artists, he infused their influences in his art. This was especially visible in Al-Zahawi’s reliefs (see Seated Lady in Gallery section), which allowed him to create images that were influenced by his contemporaries, such as Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso who dominated the art scene throughout Al-Zahawi’s active years.|$|E
25|$|Born to Ray and Julie Bresnan, Tim {{attended}} Castleford High School Technology and Sports College, {{and subsequently}} attended NEW College, Pontefract.

He is a Leeds United FC supporter.|$|E
25|$|In 1883 he {{returned}} to Rome and, most notably, Pompeii, where further excavations had taken place since his last visit. He spent {{a significant amount of}} time studying the site, going there daily. These excursions gave him an ample source of subject matter <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> further his knowledge of daily Roman life. At times, however, he integrated so many objects into his paintings that some said they resembled museum catalogues.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, {{he fell in}} {{love with}} Nora and became {{dedicated}} to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt named Wallace {{chairman}} of the Board of Economic Warfare (BEW) and of the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board (SPAB) in 1941. Both positions became important with the U.S. entry into World War II. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> flex his newfound political muscle in his position with SPAB, Wallace came up against the conservative wing of the Democratic Party {{in the form of}} Jesse H.

25|$|Antonescu did halt deportations despite German {{pressure}} {{starting with}} October 1942, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> seek {{peace with the}} Allies, although {{at the same time}} he levied heavy taxes and forced labor on the remaining Jewish communities. Also, sometimes with the encouragement of Antonescu's regime, thirteen boats left Romania for the British Mandate of Palestine during the war, carrying 13,000 Jews (two of these ships were sunk by the Soviets (see Struma disaster), and the effort was discontinued after German pressure was applied).|$|E
