5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} <b>active</b> <b>site</b> are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the <b>active</b> <b>site.</b> The <b>active</b> <b>site</b> continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E
5|$|Several {{evolutionarily}} independent enzyme superfamilies {{with different}} protein folds use the N-terminal residue as a nucleophile. This commonality of <b>active</b> <b>site</b> but difference of protein fold {{indicates that the}} <b>active</b> <b>site</b> evolved convergently in those families.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, an {{alternative}} transferase mechanism has been evolved by amidophosphoribosyltransferases, which has two active sites. In the first <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> a cysteine triad hydrolyses a glutamine substrate to release free ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses though an internal tunnel in the enzyme {{to the second}} <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> where it is transferred to a second substrate.|$|E

By heating {{in the presence}} of molecular hydrogen, H+ <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> were formed with a concomitant decline of Lewis acid sites. The Lewis acid sites began to convert into H+ <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> at 348 K and the number of H+ <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> increased by increasing the heating temperature.

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>sites</b> and {{catalytic}} {{mechanism of}} nitrogen-doped graphene in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been extensively studied {{but are still}} inconclusive, {{partly due to the}} lack of an experimental method that can detect the <b>active</b> <b>sites.</b> It is proposed in this report that the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> on nitrogen-doped graphene can be determined via the examination of its chemical composition change before and after ORR. Synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of three nitrogen-doped multilayer graphene samples reveal that oxygen reduction intermediate OH(ads) which should chemically attach to the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> remains on the carbon atoms neighboring pyridinic nitrogen after ORR. In addition, a high amount of the OH(ads) attachment after ORR corresponds to a high catalytic efficiency and vice versa. These pinpoint that the carbon atoms close to pyridinic nitrogen are the main <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> among the different nitrogen doping configurations...|$|R

5|$|An {{example of}} an enzyme that {{contains}} a cofactor is carbonic anhydrase, which {{is shown in the}} ribbon diagram above with a zinc cofactor bound as part of its <b>active</b> <b>site.</b> These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> and are involved in catalysis.

5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role of molybdenum in living organisms is as a metal heteroatom at the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> in certain enzymes. In bacterial nitrogen fixation, the nitrogenase enzyme involved in the terminal step of reducing molecular nitrogen usually contains molybdenum in the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> (though replacement of molybdenum with iron or vanadium is also known).

40|$|Calorimetry of CO {{adsorption}} {{was used}} {{for the first time to}} study the surface properties of alumina-supported molybdenum phosphide (MoP/Al 2 O 3). To increase the dispersion of MoP <b>active</b> <b>sites,</b> the sample was prepared by novel citric acid-temperature programmed reduction (CA-TPR) method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of CO adsorption confirmed the formation of MoP by CA-TPR method. The calorimetry results proved that the novel method increased the amounts of <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> and led to the formation of a highly dispersed alumina-supported MoP, but the adsorption heat and the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> distribution were not much affected by the preparation method. Furthermore, the energetic distribution of <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> depended on the MoP loading. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|With an {{increase}} in initial concentration of the fluoride ion solution, the percentage removal of the fluoride ion has been decreased due to insufficient number of <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> that {{are available on the}} activated carbon adsorbents to adsorb the fluoride ions from highly concentrated solution of the fluoride ions. At low concentrated solution of the fluoride ions, sufficient numbers of <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> are available on activated carbon adsorbents, and hence, most of the fluoride ions interact with the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> on the activated carbon adsorbent, and thus, percentage removal of fluoride is more.|$|R
5|$|The {{sophistication of}} the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> network causes {{residues}} involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains {{the core of the}} <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E
5|$|Two {{evolutionarily}} independent enzyme superfamilies {{with different}} protein folds {{are known to}} use the N-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold) and Superfamily PE (acetyltransferases using the DOM fold) This commonality of <b>active</b> <b>site</b> structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> evolved convergently in those superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|When {{an enzyme}} has {{multiple}} substrates, inhibitors can show {{different types of}} inhibition depending on which substrate is considered. This results from the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> containing two different binding sites within the <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> one for each substrate. For example, an inhibitor might compete with substrate A for the first binding site, but be a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to substrate B in the second binding site.|$|E

A study on the structure–function relationship reveals that the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> are identical both in nature and function on various nanocarbon catalysts. Additionally, the quantity of the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> {{could be used as}} a metric to normalize the reaction rates, and thus to evaluate the intrinsic activity of nanocarbon catalysts. The morphology of the nanocarbon catalysts at the microscopic scale exhibits a minor influence on their intrinsic ODH catalytic activity.

40|$|AbstractEscherichia coli {{inorganic}} pyrophosphatase (PPase) is a hexamer {{of identical}} subunits. This work shows that trimeric form of PPase exhibits {{the interaction of}} the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> in catalysis. Some trimer subunits demonstrate high substrate binding affinity typical for hexamer whereas the rest of subunits reveal more than 300 -fold substrate affinity decrease. This fact indicates the appearance of negative cooperativity of trimer subunits upon substrate binding. Association of the wild-type (WT) trimer with catalytically inactive, but still substrate binding mutant trimer into hexameric chimera restores the high activity of the first trimer, characteristic of trimer incorporated in the hexamer of WT PPase. Interaction of PPase <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> suggests that there are pathways for information transmission between the <b>active</b> <b>sites,</b> providing the perfect organization and concerted functioning of the hexameric <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> in catalysis...|$|R

5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's <b>active</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} the {{chemical}} reaction of water with quartz powders undergoing mechanical activation. The reaction produces gaseous hydrogen and {{is accompanied by a}} decrease of the water pH. The observed behavior is related to the chemical reactivity of the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> generated at the surface of quartz powders by fracture and attrition. Their apparent surface density was estimated by connecting the reaction kinetics with the specific surface area of quartz powders. The apparent surface density of the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> generated by fracture is higher than the one of the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> generated by attrition. Unexpectedly, it is also higher than the maximum possible surface density of dangling bonds, which suggests for the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> generated by fracture an unusually high chemical reactivity. This can be regarded as a consequence of undisclosed mechanochemical effects...|$|R

Only {{a small portion of}} their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next to one or more binding sites where residues orient the substrates.

5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, {{the substrate}} and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's <b>active</b> <b>site.</b> This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E

5|$|In mixed inhibition, the {{inhibitor}} {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the <b>active</b> <b>site</b> is reduced.|$|E

5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's <b>active</b> <b>site</b> to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the <b>active</b> <b>site,</b> allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E

In this work, we extend previous feature-based {{analyses of}} <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> by defining a system of localized geometric and electrostatic descriptors that identify localized patterns of protein-ligand interactions. Singular Value Decomposition is used to identify linear combinations of features with maximum information content which are then used to compute the class conditional probability density distribution of <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> using kernel density estimation.

However, the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> of model catalysts are still largely disputed because of their structural complexity. Conventionally, H 2 evolution from solar water splitting over Pt/TiO 2 is widely deemed to take place on metallic Pt nanoparticles.

40|$|Previous {{experimental}} {{studies showed that}} the presence of O- 2 greatly enhances NO-carbon reaction while it depresses N 2 O-carbon reaction on carbon surfaces. A popular explanation for the rate increase is that the addition of O- 2 results in a large number of reactive carbon-oxygen complexes, and decomposition of these complexes produces many more <b>active</b> <b>sites.</b> The explanation for the latter is that excess O- 2 simply blocks the <b>active</b> <b>sites,</b> thus reducing the rate of N 2 O-carbon reaction. The contradiction is that O- 2 can also occupy <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> in NO-carbon reaction and produce <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> in N 2 O-carbon reduction. By using ab initio calculation, we find that the opposite roles of O- 2 are caused by the different manners of N 2 O and NO adsorption on the carbon surface. In the presence of excess O- 2, most Of the <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> are occupied by oxygen groups. In the competition for the remaining <b>active</b> <b>sites,</b> NO is more likely to chemisorb in the form of NO 2 and NO chemisorption is mon thermodynamically favorable than O- 2 chemisorption. By contrast, the presence of excess O- 2 makes N 2 O chemisorption much less thermally stable either on the consecutive edge sites or edge sites isolated by semiquinone oxygen. A detailed analysis and discussion of the reaction mechanism of N- 2 formation from NO- and N 2 O-carbon reaction in the presence of O- 2 is presented in this paper...|$|R
