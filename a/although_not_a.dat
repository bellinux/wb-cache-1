5|$|A subfamily, the Diplodocinae, {{was erected}} to include Diplodocus and its closest relatives, {{including}} Barosaurus. More distantly related is the contemporaneous Apatosaurus, {{which is still}} considered a diplodocid, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> diplodocine, {{as it is a}} member of the subfamily Apatosaurinae. The Portuguese Dinheirosaurus and the African Tornieria have also been identified as close relatives of Diplodocus by some authors. The Diplodocoidea comprise the diplodocids, as well as dicraeosaurids, rebbachisaurids, Suuwassea, Amphicoelias and possibly Haplocanthosaurus, and/or the nemegtosaurids. This clade is the sister group to Macronaria (camarasaurids, brachiosaurids and titanosaurians).|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} success, {{it included}} several short stories by authors such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick. The publication {{has been described}} by critics as a successor to the tradition of Unknown, a fantasy magazine that ceased publication in 1943. It was noted for printing fantasy with a rational basis such as werewolf stories that included scientific explanations. A selection of stories from Beyond was published in paperback form in 1963, also under the title Beyond.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> major characteristic, Mahone is {{depicted}} as remarkably good at unarmed combat (probably due to his military background). It is surprising when Lincoln attempts to kill him, he rapidly masters him and tries to choke him; Lincoln only manages to master him by squeezing his previous gunshot wound, only to be overcome again and have Mahone's gun on him. When one of Lechero's men attempts to stab Michael {{at the beginning of}} season three, Mahone stops him and breaks his neck in seconds. He is also the only one T-Bag believed could kill Sammy, but when the tunnel crumbles on top of Sammy Mahone rapidly masters his men. In season four when Christina Rose orders her bodyguard to kill Mahone, he beats both of them down within seconds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> true coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> vegetarian, Winslet, in 2010, narrated a {{video for}} PETA that showed animal cruelty in the {{production}} of foie gras. She encouraged chefs to remove the item from their menu and urged consumers to boycott it. In 2015, Winslet lent her support to the UNICEF campaign World’s Largest Lesson, which creates awareness among children about sustainable development and global citizenship. Teased as a child for her weight, Winslet takes a stand against body-shaming and bullying. She narrated an Australian animated short film named Daisy Chain (2015), about a victim of cyber-bullying. In 2017, Winslet teamed with Leonardo DiCaprio's environmental foundation for a fundraiser on global warming. Also that year, DiCaprio and Winslet auctioned off a private dinner with themselves to raise money for a British mother's cancer treatment.|$|E

In 2005, Guinness World Records declared Ramoji Film City to be the world's largest film studio.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{attended}} Stanmore Public School and, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> scholar, was a keen {{participant in}} sporting activities. His introduction to cricket came via his older brother, Horrie; Horrie was a useful batsman {{who played in}} the local Western Suburbs Churches league and paid Sid sixpence to bowl to him after he finished work. Taking {{an interest in the}} game, Sid had trials for the school team and was eventually selected in the first XI. An early controversy saw Barnes suspended for three weeks for disputing an umpire's decision. Successes for both his school team and his local club team, St. Augustine, saw him acquire the nickname The Governor-General—the nickname of Australian Test player, Charlie Macartney, and he was selected for New South Wales Schoolboys to play teams from Victoria and Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{was born}} in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (née Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney.

Cheney is a very distant cousin of both Harry S. Truman and Barack Obama; the three share a common ancestor in Mareen Duvall, a Huguenot who fled from France to England in the 17th century and later settled in Maryland.

5|$|In 1921 Fleming {{enrolled}} at Eton College. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> high achiever academically, he excelled at athletics {{and held the}} title of Victor Ludorum ("Winner of the Games") for two years between 1925 and 1927. He also edited a school magazine, The Wyvern. His lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women. Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He spent {{less than a year}} there, leaving in 1927 without gaining a commission, after contracting gonorrhea.|$|E

5|$|It grows well as {{far north}} as western coast of Scotland, {{including}} the village of Plockton. It is more common in Southern England and in Ireland where it is grown all over the island. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> palm, it is locally named Cornish palm, Manx palm or Torbay palm. The last name is due to its extensive use in Torbay, it being the official symbol of that area, used in tourist posters promoting South Devon as the English Riviera. It also grows in Spain, Italy and Japan. Even though the natural distribution of C.australis ranges from 34° S to 46°S, and despite its ultimately tropical origins, it also grows at about five degrees from the Arctic Circle in Masfjorden, Norway, latitude 61ºN, in a microclimate protected from arctic winds and moderated by the Gulf Stream.|$|E

In mid-1985, the group toured the United States and Canada for the first time, supporting Killing Is My Business... with Exciter. During the tour, guitarist Chris Poland abruptly left the band, and was replaced by touring guitarist Mike Albert. However, Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, and stayed with the band up to the recording of the next album.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
