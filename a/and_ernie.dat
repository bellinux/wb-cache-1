5|$|Despite losing {{three key}} players in Gar Heard, Jim McMillian <b>and</b> <b>Ernie</b> DiGregorio for long stretches, the Braves {{continued}} to improve. The Braves finished in 2nd place with a 49–33 record, as Bob McAdoo captured the NBA MVP Award. McAdoo led the league with 34.5 points per game, while adding 14.1 rebounds per game, which was 4th best in the league.|$|E
5|$|However, a rearguard action took England to a {{total of}} 165, before Johnston removed Alec Bedser to end the innings. Johnston {{finished}} with 5/36, in a display characterised by his accuracy and variations in pace and swing. When Australia batted, Johnston <b>and</b> <b>Ernie</b> Toshack wagged a last-wicket partnership of 33 runs in only 18 minutes. They played in a free-wheeling manner before Bedser trapped Toshack lbw to end the home team’s innings on 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead and Johnston unbeaten on 17.|$|E

5|$|Australia's lower order batted the {{tourists}} into {{control on the}} second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 8/275, Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner, supported by Johnston <b>and</b> <b>Ernie</b> Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29 before holing out for 53. Ending at 350, the Australians had regained the momentum, taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning.|$|E

5|$|First-class cricket resumed in Australia in 1945–46 {{after the}} end of the war, {{although}} the Shield competition was not held that season. O'Reilly captained New South Wales at the age of 40, and although the emergence of Ray Lindwall <b>and</b> <b>Ernie</b> Toshack in the state side indicated a shift in emphasis away from spin and towards faster bowling, O'Reilly maintained his pre-war standards. He took 33 wickets at 14.36 in six matches and New South Wales were undefeated; they won four matches and drew both fixtures against Victoria. He took at least two wickets in every innings and claimed his innings best of 6/43 against Queensland. O'Reilly also took a match total of 7/94 in an innings win over the Australian Services team, which had drawn a series against a full-strength England team.|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, Cy Feuer <b>and</b> <b>Ernie</b> Martin started {{producing}} musicals together. Feuer was {{the former}} head of the music department at low-budget Republic Pictures; Martin was a television executive. Having secured the rights to the farce Charley's Aunt, they produced it as the musical comedy Where's Charley?, with a score by Frank Loesser. Among the backers of Where's Charley? were Rodgers and Hammerstein, which helped secure additional investment. The show was a hit and helped establish Feuer and Martin on Broadway—they would go on to produce Guys and Dolls.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Henson and {{his wife}} moved to New York City, where the newly formed Muppets, Inc., would reside for some time. Jane quit {{performing}} to raise their children. Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppet performer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson later credited both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted 27 years; their teamwork is particularly evident in their portrayals of the characters of Bert <b>and</b> <b>Ernie,</b> Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear.|$|E

For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{entered the}} FA Cup in the Fourth Qualifying Round, {{in which they}} {{defeated}} Rochdale. However, they were knocked out by Stalybridge Celtic in the next round. A total of 19 players were used by Nelson in their 40 first-team matches, only six of whom had played for the club in the previous season. Bob Hutchinson <b>and</b> <b>Ernie</b> Braidwood, both new signings, played every league and cup match. With 23 goals in 36 appearances, Joe Eddleston was the team's top goalscorer for the second season in succession. The highest attendance of the season at the club's Seedhill stadium was 12,000 on two occasions, {{the first of these}} the win over Chesterfield on 10 March 1923.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the show}} was set aside {{for a series of}} funny, colorful, puppet {{characters}} living on the titular street.

Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter. It was around this time that a frill was added around Kermit's neck to make him more frog-like. The collar was functional as well: it covered the joint where the Muppet's neck and body met.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{made his}} Test debut in a one-off Test against New Zealand at Wellington in March 1946, {{although}} the match was only given Test accreditation two years later. On a wet wicket, New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the slow bowling of Bill O'Reilly <b>and</b> <b>Ernie</b> Toshack. Tallon made a stumping, a {{run out and}} took a catch. He scored only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103runs. Tallon had rarely kept to O'Reilly's leg spin and impressed the bowler, who compared him with Oldfield. During the tour of New Zealand, Australia won all of their five matches, four by an innings. Tallon scored 123 runs at 41.00 and made 12 dismissals.|$|E
