40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{mathematical model}} for ionic polymerization processes has been developed in Polymers Plus ® framework. The model {{is based on the}} method of moments and predicts the polymer number, weight and z-average molecular weights. The model takes into account all the important reactions such as reversible <b>initiator</b> <b>association,</b> chain initiation, propagation, association of growing polymer chains, exchange and coupling reactions, equilibrium between free ions and ion pairs, etc. The ionic kinetic scheme in Polymers Plus was used to model copolymerization of styrene and butadiene in a semi-batch reactor. Simulation results for monomer conversion, polymer molecular weight averages, fraction of live polymer, copolymer composition, etc. were compared with the available literature data. The effect of coupling agent, iodine, on the coupling efficiency was examined for styrene-butadiene thermoplastic elastomers...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: It is {{now well}} known that evading apoptosis, as a cancer hallmark, can lead to tumour initiation, {{progression}} and metastasis. As a result of genome wide <b>association</b> studies, an <b>initiator</b> protease in this pathway, caspase 8 (CASP 8), {{has been found to}} be an important gene regarding breast cancer susceptibility. The alterations of the expression of this gene have been reported in breast cancer cell lines. Given that in previous studies expression analysis of this gene had only been done in breast cancer cell lines, in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of this gene in breast cancer tissues versus adjacent normal tissues, using real-time quantitative method. Methods: Caspase 8 mRNA expression was quantified using comparative RT-qPCR in 27 fresh frozen breast tumours and 27 adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, relationship between the expression changes of CASP 8 in tumour tissue and various clinical and pathological features were evaluated in an Iranian population. Results: The present study showed that expression of CASP 8 was significantly reduced in tumour tissues compared to neighbouring normal tissues (p = . 004). CASP 8 expression was significantly correlated with the status of hormone receptors (ER and PR). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report on reduced expression of CASP 8 in breast cancer versus adjacent normal tissues. Our data support previous results obtained from cell lines and therefore highlights the seminal role of the induction of CASP 8 expression, as a novel therapeutic approach, in order to sensitize tumour cells to apoptotic stimuli...|$|R
