40|$|AbstractInfectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), {{a member}} of the dsRNA Birnaviridae family, is an {{important}} immunosuppressive avian pathogen. We have identified a strictly conserved <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> matching the consensus sequence used by fibronectin to bind the α 4 β 1 integrin within the protruding domain of the IBDV capsid polypeptide. We show that a single point mutation on this triplet abolishes the cell-binding activity of IBDV-derived subviral particles (SVP), and abrogates the recovering of infectious IBDV by reverse genetics without affecting the overall SVP architecture. Additionally, we demonstrate that the presence of the α 4 β 1 heterodimer is a critical determinant for the susceptibility of murine BALB/c 3 T 3 cells to IBDV binding and infectivity. Our data suggests that the IBDV might also use the α 4 β 1 integrin as a specific binding receptor in avian cells...|$|E

Here we report the 0. 98 -Å crystal {{structure}} of SPE 10, a dimeric plant defensin. SPE 10 associates as a dimer through a unique <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> involving residues R 36 –W 42 –R 40. The helix from one subunit interacts with arginines R 36 and R 40 from the other subunit, forming a sheet-like dimer with a highly extended molecular surface. A conserved hydrophobic patch on the molecular head largely overlaps with the putative receptor-binding site previously reported for another defensin. Structural analysis and mutational studies indicate that the dimeric association of SPE 10 is relevant to its function, and that the hydrophobic patch on the molecular head is required for its antifungal activity.

40|$|To perform {{effectively}} as a molecular chaperone, DnaK (Hsp 70) necessitates {{the assistance of}} its DnaJ (Hsp 40) co-chaperone partner, which efficiently stimulates its intrinsically weak ATPase activity and facilitates its interaction with polypeptide substrates. In this study, we address {{the function of the}} conserved glycine- and phenylalanine-rich (G/F-rich) region of the Escherichia coli DnaJ in the DnaK chaperone cycle. We show that the G/F-rich region is critical for DnaJ co-chaperone functions in vivo and that despite a significant degree of sequence conservation among the G/F-rich regions of Hsp 40 homologs from bacteria, yeast, or humans, functional complementation {{in the context of the}} E. coli DnaJ is limited. Furthermore, we found that the deletion of the whole G/F-rich region is mirrored by mutations in the conserved Asp-Ile/Val-Phe (DIF) motif contained in this region. Further genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that this <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> plays a critical role in regulation of the DnaK chaperone cycle, possibly by modulating a crucial step subsequent to DnaK-mediated ATP hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} the following sequence shuffling problem: Given a biological sequence (either DNA or protein) s, generate a random instance {{among all the}} permutations of s that exhibit the same frequencies of k-lets (e. g. dinucleotides, doublets of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>triplets,</b> etc.). Since certain biases in the usage of k-lets are fundamental to biological sequences, effective generation of such sequences {{is essential for the}} evaluation of the results of many sequence analysis tools. This paper introduces two sequence shuffling algorithms: A simple swapping-based algorithm is shown to generate a near-random instance and appears to work well, although its efficiency is unproven; a generation algorithm based on Euler tours is proven to produce a precisely uniform instance, and hence solve the sequence shuffling problem, in time not much more than linear in the sequence length...|$|R

40|$|Background: Several {{computational}} {{methods have}} been developed to predict protein-protein interactions from <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequences, but most of those methods are intended for the interactions within a species rather than for interactions across different species. Methods for predicting interactions between homogeneous proteins are not appropriate for finding those between heterogeneous proteins since they do not distinguish the interactions between proteins of the same species from those of different species. Results: We developed a new method for representing a protein sequence of variable length in a frequency vector of fixed length, which encodes the relative frequency of three consecutive <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of a sequence. We built a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict human proteins that interact with virus proteins. In two types of viruses, human papillomaviruses (HPV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), our SVM model achieved an average accuracy above 80 %, which is higher than that of another SVM model with a different representation scheme. Using the SVM model and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of proteins, we predicted new interactions between virus proteins and human proteins.

40|$|The {{carcinoembryonic antigen}} (CEA) gene family members, CEACAM 1, CEACAM 3, CEACAM 5 and CEACAM 6, {{are bound by}} the Opa outer {{membrane}} proteins of pathogenic Neisseria spp., whereas CEACAM 8 is not. In this study, we demonstrate that the closely related CEACAM 4 and CEACAM 7, which are also members of the CEA family, are not Opa receptors. We exploited the high conservation between CEACAM 6 and CEACAM 8 to generate an extensive set of chimeric receptors in order to delineate the sequences necessary for Opa binding. Using a transfection-based infection system, we showed that binding of Opa 52 involves residues 27 - 42, which are predicted to form beta-strand C and short loops adjacent to it, and residues lying between amino acids 60 and 108 in the amino-terminal domain. The replacement of residues 27 - 29 in CEACAM 6 with the CEACAM 1 or CEACAM 5 sequences generated recombinant CEACAM 6 receptors that are bound by CEACAM 1 /CEACAM 5 -specific Opa variants. Together, our data demonstrate that Opa proteins bind to residues exposed on the GFCC' face of the N-terminal domain of CEACAM receptors, and identify an <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> sequence {{that is responsible for}} the differential binding of Opa proteins to CEACAM 1, CEACAM 5 and CEACAM 6...|$|E
40|$|Sp 3 is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} human {{transcription factor}} {{closely related to}} Sp 1 and Sp 4. All three proteins contain a highly conserved DNA binding domain and two glutamine-rich regions, suggesting that they possess similar activation functions. In our previous experiments, however, Sp 3 failed to activate transcription. Instead, it repressed Sp 1 -mediated transcriptional activation, suggesting {{that it is an}} inhibitory member of this family of regulatory factors. Here we show that Sp 3 can also act as a positive regulator of transcription. The glutamine-rich domains on their own have a strong activation function and interact with the TATA box binding protein (TBP) -associated factor dTAFII 110. However, in full-length Sp 3 as well as in Gal 4 -Sp 3 fusion proteins, both activation domains are silenced by an inhibitory domain located between the second glutamine-rich region and the DNA binding domain. The inhibitory domain completely suppressed transcriptional activation when fused to a heterologous glutamine-rich domain but only moderately suppressed transcription when linked to an acidic activation domain. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a stretch of highly charged amino acid residues essential for inhibitor function. Substitution of the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> KEE by alanine residues within this region changed the almost transcriptionally inactive Sp 3 into a strong activator. Our results suggest that the transcriptional activity of Sp 3 might be regulated in vivo by relief of inhibition...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{performed}} a detailed literature survey of the ¿-turn in peptides and proteins. This three-dimensional structural feature is characterized by an eleven-membered pseudo-cycle closed by an intramolecular backbone…backbone H-bond. Interestingly, in this motif {{the direction of the}} N-H…O¿=¿C H-bond runs opposite to that of the much more popular and extensively investigated a-, ß-, and ¿-turns. We did not authenticate unequivocally the ¿-turn main-chain reversal topology in any linear short peptide. However, it is frequently observed in small cyclic peptides formed by four, five, and six amino acid residues with stringent geometric requirements. Rather surprisingly, ¿-turns do occur in proteins, although to a relatively moderate extent, as an isolated feature or in the turn segment of hairpin motifs based on two antiparallel, pleated ß-strands. Moreover, the ¿-turn may also host not only the seven-membered, intramolecularly H-bonded, pseudo-cycle termed ¿-turn, either of the classic or inverse type, but also one (or even two) cis peptide bond(s) or a ß-bulge conformation. Based on their ¿, ¿ backbone torsion angles, we were able to classify the protein ¿-turns in six different families. Conformational energy computations using the DFT methodology were also performed on the ¿-turns adopted by the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> -Gly-Gly-Gly- (Gly is the most commonly found residue at each of the three positions in our analysis of proteins).

Most COL 17 A 1 mutations lead to a premature termination codon (PTC), whereas only a few mutations result in <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> substitutions or deletions. We describe here two novel glycine substitutions, G 609 D and G 612 R, and a splice site mutation resulting in a deletion of three Gly–X–Y <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplets.</b> In order to investigate the molecular pathomechanisms of non-PTC mutations, G 609 D and G 612 R and two previously known substitutions, G 627 V and G 633, and deletion of the <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> 779 – 787 were introduced into recombinant collagen XVII. The thermal stability of the mutated collagens was assessed using trypsin digestions at incremental temperatures. All the four glycine substitutions significantly destabilized the ectodomain of collagen XVII, which manifested as 16 °C– 20 °C lower Tm (midpoint of the helix-to-coil transition). These results were supported by secondary structure predictions, which suggested interruptions of the collagenous triple helix within the largest collagenous domain, Col 15. In contrast, deletion of the three full Gly–X–Y <b>triplets,</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> 779 – 787, had no overall effect on {{the stability of the}} ectodomain, as the deletion was in register with the triplet structure and also generated compensatory changes in the NC 15 domain...|$|R

Point mutations resulting in the substitution of Gly residues in Gly-X-Y <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplets</b> of the triple helical domain of the alpha 1 (I) or alpha 2 (I) chains are the most frequent mutations. They interrupt the repetitive Gly-X-Y structure that is mandatory for the formation of a stable triple helix. Most babies have their own private de novo mutation. However, the recurrence rate is about 7 % owing to germline mosaicism in one parent. The mutations act in a dominant negative manner as the mutant pro alpha chains are incorporated into type I procollagen molecules that also contain normal pro alpha chains. The abnormal molecules are poorly secreted, more susceptible to degradation, and impair the formation of the extracellular matrix.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify amino acids in these two CRF 2 receptors conferring these differences. An <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> in the third extracellular domain (Asp(262) Leu(263) Val(264) in hCRF(2 A) or Lys(264) Tyr(265) IIe(266) in xCRF(2)) was found to diverge between both receptors. When binding and signaling characteristics of receptor mutants hR 2 KYI and xR 2 DLV were assessed, the tri-amino acid motif replacement produced receptors with binding properties resembling the xCRF(2) receptor. The converse mutation created a mutant receptor with a binding pharmacology identical to the profile of the hCRF(2 A) receptor. This effect was most notable for xR 2 DLV, which possessed a binding affinity for astressin similar to 15 -fold greater for astressin than sauvagine. In contrast, the binding profiles of the hCRF(2 A) receptor and hR 2 KYI did not differ. These data indicate that another domain of the xCRF(2) receptor mediated low-affinity binding of astressin. Two amino acids in the first extracellular domain differ in xCRF(2) (Asp(69) Ser(70)) and hCRF(2 A) (Glu(66) Tyr(67)) receptors. The hCRF(2 A) receptor mutant (hR 2 DS-KYI) bound astressin with a low affinity indistinguishable from the xCRF(2) receptor. Therefore, these data demonstrate that ligand selectivity differences between amphibian and human forms of the CRF 2 A receptor are governed by these two motifs of the extracellular domains of the xCRF(2) receptor...|$|E

Little {{is known about the}} conduction properties of a large family of plant proteins with structural similarities to cloned animal cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs). Animal CNGCs are nonselective cation channels that do not discriminate between Na+ and K+ permeation. These channels all have the same triplet of amino acids in the channel pore ion selectivity filter, and this sequence is {{different from that of the}} selectivity filter found in K+-selective channels. Plant CNGCs have unique pore selectivity filters; unlike those found in any other family of channels. At present, the significance of the unique pore selectivity filters of plant CNGCs, with regard to discrimination between Na+ and K+ permeation is unresolved. Here, we present an electrophysiological analysis of several members of this protein family; identifying the first cloned plant channel (AtCNGC 1) that conducts Na+. Another member of this ion channel family (AtCNGC 2) is shown to have a selectivity filter that provides a heretofore unknown molecular basis for discrimination between K+ and Na+ permeation. Specific amino acids within the AtCNGC 2 pore selectivity filter (Asn- 416, Asp- 417) are demonstrated to facilitate K+ over Na+ conductance.

The whitefly species Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) is the vector {{for members of}} the genus Begomovirus. The closely related bipartite Central American begomoviruses Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV), Sida golden mosaic virus originating from Costa Rica (SiGMV-CR), and Sida golden mosaic virus originating from Honduras (SiGMV-Hoyv) were used to study transmission by their insect vector. The AbMV isolate is defective in transmission, whereas the two Sida-infecting viruses are readily transmitted by B. tabaci. These three viruses are able to form pseudorecombinant viruses by exchange of genomic components. The pseudorecombinant virus SiGMV-Hoyv A/AbMV B was transmissible, whereas the reciprocal pseudorecombinant virus AbMV A/SiGMV-Hoyv B was not transmitted, indicating that DNA B is not involved in the transmission defect. However, the uptake of the pseudorecombinant virus AbMV A/SiGMV-Hoyv B was much better than AbMV itself, indicating that DNA B or DNA B gene products enhance uptake of viral DNA. Exchange of AbMV coat protein with that of SiGMV-CR resulted in a transmissible chimeric AbMV. Mutagenesis of the AbMV coat protein showed that the exchange of two amino acids, at positions 124 and 149, was sufficient to obtain a whitefly-transmissible AbMV mutant. However, when amino acid 174 was altered in addition to amino acids 124 and 149 AbMV was readily transmitted by B. tabaci. From this we conclude {{that it is not a}} concise motif, such as the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet,</b> aspartate-alanine-glycine (DAG), involved in aphid transmission of potyviruses, that determines transmissibility of begomoviruses by B. tabaci.

Such patients can be transplanted successfully {{provided that the}} donor has no mismatched HLA antigens that react with the patient’s alloantibodies. Serum screening against HLA-typed panels {{must be done to}} determine the alloantibody specificity spectrum so that unacceptable HLA antigen mismatches can be identified. This approach, however, does not work if the patient’s serum has a very high PR A. Often, many highly sensitized patients remain on the waiting list with little prospect of a transplant because insufficient informa-tion is available about HLA mismatch acceptability and the probability of finding a zero antigen mismatch is very low.

A "guide-and-clasp" manner for receptor-receptor interactions is proposed where "adhesive guides" may be <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> homologies, which were determined for different kinds of D 2 heteroreceptor complexes. The first putative D 2 heteroreceptor complex to be discovered in relation to schizophrenia was the A 2 A-D 2 heteroreceptor complex where antagonistic A 2 A-D 2 receptor-receptor interactions were demonstrated after A 2 A agonist treatment in the ventral striatum. The A 2 A agonist CGS 21680 with atypical antipsychotic properties may at least in part act by increasing β-arrestin 2 signaling over the D 2 protomer in the A 2 A-D 2 heteroreceptor complex in the ventral striatum. The antagonistic NTS 1 -D 2 interactions in the NTS 1 -D 2 heteroreceptor complex in the ventral striatum are proposed as one molecular mechanism for the potential antipsychotic effects of NT. Indications were obtained that the psychotic actions of the 5 -HT 2 AR hallucinogens LSD and DOI can involve enhancement of D 2 R protomer signaling via a biased agonist action at the 5 -HT 2 A protomer in the D 2 - 5 -HT 2 A heteroreceptor complex in the ventral striatum. Facilitatory allosteric D 2 likeR-OTR interactions in heteroreceptor complexes in nucleus accumbens may have a role in social and emotional behaviors. By blocking the D 2 protomers of these heteroreceptor complexes, antipsychotics can fail to reduce the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The discovery of different types of D 2 heteroreceptor complexes gives an increased understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in causing schizophrenia and new strategies for its treatment and understanding the side effects of antipsychotics...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{heterozygous}} mutation of the COL 3 A 1 {{gene that}} encodes the alpha 1 (III) chains of type III collagen was identified {{in a family}} with the acrogeric form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV (EDS-IV). Cultured dermal fibroblasts produced normal and shortened alpha 1 (III) chains. The triple helix of the latter chain was shortened owing to a 33 amino acid deletion of Gly- 184 to Pro- 216. The corresponding region of cDNA lacked 99 base pairs from nucleotides 1051 to 1149. The deletions corresponded exactly to the normal sequence encoded by exon 17 of the COL 3 A 1 gene. The proband was heterozygous for a T to G transversion at position + 2 of intron 17, which resulted in skipping of exon 17. The splicing defect was not corrected by growing the fibroblasts at 33 degrees C and no other splicing variants were identified at 33 or 37 degrees C. The affected brother had the same mutation but his unaffected mother did not. Heterotrimeric type III collagen molecules containing normal and mutant chains were retained within the cell. The mutant homotrimeric molecules were modified and secreted normally and were thermally stable. These normal characteristics of the mutant homotrimers suggested {{that the loss of}} ten Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets (where Gly-Xaa-Yaa is a repetitive <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> structure in which Xaa and Yaa are other amino acids, proline and hydroxyproline being more common in the Yaa position) did not adversely affect the formation and stability of the triple helix or the structural requirements for secretion. However, the mutant homotrimers were not incorporated into the extracellular matrix of an in vitro model of EDS-IV dermis. The EDS-IV phenotype in this family was probably due to a deficiency in the amount of normal type III collagen available for formation of the heterotypic collagen fibrils of the extracellular matrix. Intracellular and extracellular quality-control mechanisms prevented the incorporation of heterotrimeric and homotrimeric mutant type III collagen molecules into the cross-linked extracellular matrix...|$|E

Combining mutagenesis and patch-clamping under physiological conditions of calcium and voltage on BK α- (cbv 1) and β 1 subunits from rat cerebral artery myocytes, we identify the steroid interaction site from two regions in BK β 1 transmembrane domain 2 proposed by computational dynamics: the outer site includes L 157, L 158, and T 165, whereas the inner site includes T 169, L 172, and L 173. As expected from computational modeling, cbv 1 +rβ 1 T 165 A,T 169 A channels were LC-unresponsive. However, cbv 1 + rβ 1 T 165 A and cbv 1 + rβ 1 T 165 A,L 157 A,L 158 A were fully sensitive to LC. Data indicate that the transmembrane domain 2 outer site does not contribute to steroid action. Cbv 1 + rβ 1 T 169 A was LC-insensitive, with rβ 1 T 169 S being unable to rescue responsiveness to LC. Moreover, cbv 1 + rβ 1 L 172 A, and cbv 1 + rβ 1 L 173 A channels were LC-insensitive. These data and computational modeling indicate that tight hydrogen bonding between T 169 and the steroid α-hydroxyl, and hydrophobic interactions between L 172,L 173 and the steroid rings are both necessary for LC action. Therefore, β 1 TM 2 T 169,L 172,L 173 provides the interaction area for cholane steroid activation of BK channels.

The results show that there is no strong correlation between the number of triplet mismatches and the CTLp frequency. Even in the case of zero triplet mismatches, a high CTLp frequency can be found.

Introduction of the respective mutations into the gag-coding sequence of HI-proviruses and subsequent transfection into Cos- 7 cells led to particle production and release.

These residues may be important for correct folding and assembly of the processed matrix protein and the production of infectious HIV. In vitro studies of wild-type and mutated matrix proteins using spectroscopic methods (NMR, fluorescence, CD) yielded detailed data about structure and stability. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy showed that wild-type and mutant proteins (p 17 -NPG and p 17 -TSE) are well folded. Besides structural changes at the mutated site, chemical shift changes indicate small but significant long range structural rearrangements. The stability against chemically and thermally induced unfolding of the mutants p 17 -NPG and p 17 -TSE was slightly decreased, while that of p 17 -LLE was drastically diminished. The alterations have only a local effect on protein folding for the mutants p 17 -NPG and p 17 -TSE, and the globular tertiary structure remains nearly unchanged.

Presently the recognition factors for more than 300 mitochondrial editing sites are still unidentified.

The MEF 35 protein contains eleven PPR repeats and E and DYW extensions at the C-terminus. Two T-DNA insertion mutants, one inserted just upstream and the other inside the reading frame encoding the DYW domain, show loss of editing at a site {{in each of the}} mRNAs for protein 16 in the large ribosomal subunit (site rpl 16 - 209), for cytochrome b (cob- 286) and for subunit 4 of complex I (nad 4 - 1373), respectively.

The MEF 35 protein interacts in Y 2 H assays with the mitochondrial MORF 1 and MORF 8 proteins, mutation of the latter also influences editing at two of the three MEF 35 target sites. Homozygous mutant plants develop indistinguishably from wild type plants, although the RPL 16 and COB/CYTB proteins are essential and the amino acids encoded after the editing events are conserved in most plant species. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the computational target prediction to screen for target RNA editing sites of E domain containing PLS-class PPR proteins...|$|E
40|$|Acid sensing ion {{channels}} (ASICs) are sodium-selective and proton-sensitive {{members of}} the DEG/ENaC gene family and are expressed in the chordate lineage while being absent in evolutionary older animals. Although {{members of the}} DEG/ENaC family share similarities with respect to topology, selectivity for sodium and sensitivity to the blocking agent amiloride, the family comprises ion channels of various functions and diverse gating mechanisms. So far, four ASIC genes {{have been identified in}} mammals (asic 1 -asic 4) that code for at least six different ASIC subunits. Amino acid sequences {{of the members of the}} ASIC subfamily are at least 45 % identical and they are composed, like all members of the DEG/ENaC family, of two transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop domain and rather short intracellular termini. So far, ASICs have been cloned from urochordates, jawless vertebrates, cartilaginous shark and bony fish, from chicken and different mammals. Proton-sensitivity, however, was postulated to have evolved with the rise of bony fish and ASICs from lower chordate species were characterized as proton-insensitive. Since the crystal structure of chicken ASIC 1 was resolved in 2007 it is known that functional ASIC channels are trimeric structures that assemble in a homo- or heteromeric fashion in vivo and in vitro. Depending on the subunit composition they exhibit different functional features regarding proton sensitivity or gating kinetics. Some ASICs, like the abundant ASIC 1 a, are broadly expressed in the peripheral as well as in the central nervous system whereas the expression pattern of other ASICs, for example ASIC 1 b and ASIC 3, is restricted to the peripheral nervous system. Predominantly located at the postsynaptic membrane, ASICs are supposedly implicated in modulation of synaptic transmission and pain perception, but they also contribute to pathophysiological processes like ischemia, epilepsy as well as to axonal degeneration during neuroinflammation. Moreover, knockout of the asic 1 gene leads to deficits in spatial memory and learned fear, suggesting a contribution to higher brain functions. Because of such important implications and the limited pharmacological toolkit for ASIC modulation, it is desirable to find new specific drugs for ASIC modulation and understanding of the gating process of ASICs would be of great benefit for designing new highly specific drugs. The first part of this work shows that proton-sensitivity evolved latest in cartilaginous fish and that ASIC 1 b from shark (Squalus acanthias) indeed responds to extracellular acidification. Furthermore, a detailed characterization of homomeric shark ASIC 1 b channels revealed that the current of these channels exhibit unique features and that it can be divided into two components. The fast transient current component shows a time constant of desensitization (tau) of less than 50 ms and is followed by a highly proton sensitive sustained current component that does not completely desensitize as long as protons are present in the extracellular solution. In addition, the second part of this thesis elucidates the amino acids that are crucial for the unique sustained current component of shark ASIC 1 b. An <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> (M 109 DS) in the proximal region of the extracellular domain that is located in the linker region between two beta-sheets partially controls the time constant of desensitization and is necessary for the generation of the sustained current of shark ASIC 1 b. Additionally, it is shown that the same triplet is also sufficient to introduce a sustained current in rat ASIC 1 a, a channel that usually completely desensitizes during prolonged acidification. Moreover, when the most critical residue of this triplet at position 110 is mutated to cysteine, different MTS-modification rates at this position in the closed and the desensitized state, respectively, provide evidence that this residue is moving during the gating transition. Finally, engineering of a cysteine at position 110 (position 82 in rat) and at an adjacent position in the beta 11 -beta 12 -linker leads to spontaneous formation of a disulfide bond that traps shark ASIC 1 a and rat ASIC 1 a in the desensitized conformation. Collectively the results presented in this work suggest that the beta 1 -beta 2 and beta 11 -beta 12 linkers are dynamic during gating and tightly oppose each other during desensitization gating. Obstruction of this tight opposition leads to reopening of the channel. It results that the beta 1 -beta 2 and beta 11 -beta 12 linkers modulate gating movements of ASIC 1 and may thus be drug targets for modulation of ASIC activity...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is divided}} in two parts: {{the first one}} {{concerns}} the STAS domains, while the second one the Myb/SANT domains. The guiding thread linking the two parts is constituted by the method and the aims: these are {{the study of the}} structure and of the interactions of these domains by means of NMR techniques. The first family, the STAS (Sulfate Transporter and Anti-Sigma factor antagonist) was originally discovered by similarity with the ASA (Anti Sigma factor Antagonist), bacterial domains contained in proteins involved in the environmental stress response and in the induction of sporulation. The STAS are present in plants, bacteria, fungi and animals, in proteins with different roles, like light/oxygen/cyclic nucleotides sensors, transporters of various kinds, etc… They present a structure with five β-sheets and four α-helices, interspersed in a irregular way. The STAS structures from transporters currently known (Protein Data Bank, January 2013) are currently five: four bacterial one, one of mammal, none vegetal. The only mammalian structure known corresponds to the STAS of prestin from Rattus norvegicus, missing the Intervening Sequence (IVS), a sequence largely variable among the same family of proteins: one of the aims was achieving the full domain. The aforementioned prestin belongs to the SLC 26 A family, transmembrane anion transporters with a role in maintaining the electrolytic balance in epithelia. However, prestin is an anomalous member of this family, since it does not work as a transporter but as the motor protein responsible of the cochlear sound amplification. Besides the interest {{in the study of the}} full STAS domain, the attention was focused also on possible interaction partner. One of them, based on the activity model of an ammonium transporter where its C-terminal domain interacts with a cytoplasmic loop, could have been the so called Saier motif, constituted by a repeated <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplet</b> with a certain degree of conservation. The construct for the Saier motif was modelled on structural data available for the bacterial transporter BicA, a model that demonstrated to be not applicable to prestin, since this construct, cloned and expressed, had severe problems of solubility during the purification, already as a fusion protein. The STAS domain were most of the efforts were focused on was the one belonging to the sulfate transporter SULTR 1; 2 from Arabidopsis thaliana. This domain presents a 10 amino acid intervening sequence and no STAS structures from plants are currently known. After a trial with a construct already available, five new ones were cloned and tested. Anyway, it has not been possible obtaining a NMR sample but the most promising construct has been chosen for further attempts to optimize the final NMR buffer. The second part of this thesis, carried out at the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) in Toronto, Canada, deals with the Myb/SANT domains. These 50 amino acid domains present a three helix structure, where the second and the third helix (the most C-terminal ones) constitute a Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH) motif. Additional elements, such as further helices or β-hairpins, could be present. The difference of this domains stays in the distribution of the superficial charge: positive on the third helix and negative on first one for the Myb, the opposite for the SANT. The Myb are known chiefly as DNA-binding domains with their third helix, even if new evidence support that the first helix can interact with the basic histone tails; the SANT instead bind the histone tails with their third helix. Two domains of this family were solved and presented in this work: the repeat R 1 of the DNA-binding domain of hDmp 1 and the SANT 2 domain of NCoR 2. hDmp 1 is a tumour suppressor protein with a DNA-binding domain constituted by three imperfect repeats: the structure of the most N-terminal repeat, R 1, was solved, which showed the typical three helix structure and the same electrostatic surface properties of the Myb domains. Anyway, this portion of the domain does not bind DNA, tested with known and new sequences. This result is in agreement with what is known about DNA-binding domains of similar structure, where the interaction with DNA concerns only the R 2 and R 3 repeat, while R 1 seems to have a secondary function. The other domain solved is the SANT 2 of the protein NCoR 2, a protein acting as nuclear receptor repressor in the absence of ligand. This protein has two SANT domains: the structure of the most N-terminal one was already solved (PDB. 1 XC 5) and studied, in particular as interaction partner of the enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC 3). Nevertheless, the SANT 2 domain has shown particular properties: besides a long additional helix at the C-terminal and a region of conformational averaging between these helix and the previous one, it presents electrostatic surface properties typical of the Myb, not of the SANT domains. No DNA interactions are known, but with the H 4 histone tails, used for binding experiments monitored by 15 N-HSQC. However, the concerned region lies in proximity of a mutation that was detected in the NMR sample during the assignment: the production of the wild-type protein and the repetition of the binding experiments have been planned...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{computational}} {{methods have}} been developed to predict protein-protein interactions from <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequences, but most of those methods are intended for the interactions within a species rather than for interactions across different species. Methods for predicting interactions between homogeneous proteins are not appropriate for finding those between heterogeneous proteins since they do not distinguish the interactions between proteins of the same species from those of different species. Results We developed a new method for representing a protein sequence of variable length in a frequency vector of fixed length, which encodes the relative frequency of three consecutive <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of a sequence. We built a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict human proteins that interact with virus proteins. In two types of viruses, human papillomaviruses (HPV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), our SVM model achieved an average accuracy above 80 %, which is higher than that of another SVM model with a different representation scheme. Using the SVM model and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of proteins, we predicted new interactions between virus proteins and human proteins. Conclusions Encoding the relative frequency of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplets</b> of a protein sequence is a simple yet powerful representation method for predicting protein-protein interactions across different species. The representation method has several advantages: (1) it enables a prediction model to achieve a better performance than other representations, (2) it generates feature vectors of fixed length regardless of the sequence length, and (3) the same representation is applicable to different types of proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This report {{describes}} an algorithm for identifying acceptable HLA antigens for highly alloim-munized patients {{without the need}} for extensive serum screening. This algorithm is based on the concept that immunogenic epitopes are represented by <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplets</b> on exposed parts of protein sequences of human leukocyte antigen chains (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) accessible to alloantibodies. A computer program (HLA-Matchmaker) has been developed to determine class I HLA compatibility at the molecular level. It makes in-tralocus and interlocus comparisons of polymorphic trip-lets in sequence positions to determine the spectrum of non-shared triplets on donor HLA antigens. In most cases is it possible to identify certain mismatched HLA anti-gens that share all their polymorphic triplets with the patient’s HLA antigens and could therefore, be considered fully compatible. HLAMatchmaker permits also the iden-tification of additional mismatches that are acceptable as determined from the triplet information on HLA-typed panel cells that do not react with patient’s serum. HLAMatchmaker provides an assessment of donor-recipient HLA compatibility at the structural level and this algorithm is different from conventional methods based on the mere counting of numbers of mismatched HLA antigens or CREGs. This donor selection strategy is suitable especially for allosensitized patients in need of a compatible transplant or platelet transfusion. Huma...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: HLAMatchmaker is a {{computer}} algorithm that assesses human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibil-ity at the structural level by intralocus and interlocus comparisons of polymorphic <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplets</b> in anti-body-accessible sequences of HLA class I molecules. This program permits the identification of mismatched HLA antigens that share all of their polymorphic triplets with the patient’s HLA antigens and, therefore, could be con-sidered fully compatible. The validity of this algorithm has been verified by analyzing the antibody specificity patterns of 127 well-characterized sera (panel reactive antibody [PRA] 80 %) that had been screened by direct complement-dependent and/or anti-human globulin aug-mented lymphocytotoxicity testing with large HLA-typed cell panels. A 22 table-based Chi-square analysis program was applied to determine positive and negative correlations between serum reactivity and the presence HLA triplets assigned from the HLA types in the cell panel. The results indicate that high PRA patients do not produce antibodies to shared triplets on mismatched HLA antigens. Moreover, this serum analysis has permitted the identification of triplets with different degrees of immu-nogenicity {{as indicated by the}} frequencies of positive and negative correlations of serum reactivity with the HLA-typed cell panel. Mismatching for triplets with low immunogenicity provides further opportunities for identifying donors with acceptable HLA mismatches for highly sensitized patients. Human Immunology 63...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} a novel application of HLAMatchmaker to determine platelet compatibility in 16 alloimmunized patients with aplastic anemia refractory to random donor platelet transfusions. HLAMatchmaker is a software algorithm that predicts HLA compatibility by identifying immunogenic epitopes represented by <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplets</b> in antibody-accessible regions of {{human leukocyte antigen}} (HLA) molecules and determines the number of triplet mismatches (TMMs) and highly immunogenic triplet mismatches (HIMMs). Corrected count increments (CCIs) and molecular HLA typing were available for 523 transfusions. Conventional compatibility assessment based on cross-reactive group (CREG) determination was not predictive of transfusion outcome. Low HIMMs and TMMs numbers were associated with a higher likelihood of satisfactory (CCIs ≥ 8) compared with unsatisfactory (CCIs < 8) outcomes (median HIMMs = 4 vs 6, p 2 value <. 001; median TMMs = 11 vs 13, p 2 value <. 001). Although receiver operator characteristic curves revealed that HIMMs or TMMs number are not powerful predictors of individual transfusion outcome, a threshold of at least 3 HIMMs or at least 9 TMMs appeared {{to be associated with}} successful transfusions. Triplet-matched transfusions were successful, regardless of CREG matching.

40|$|Perinatal lethal {{osteogenesis imperfecta}} {{is the result}} ofheterozygous {{mutations}} ofthe COLlAl and COL 1 A 2 genes that encode the al(I) and a 2 (I) chains of type I colla-gen, respectively. Point mutations result-ing in the substitution of Gly residues in Gly-X-Y <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplets</b> of the triple helical domain of the al(I) or a 2 (I) chains are the most frequent mutations. They interrupt the repetitive Gly-X-Y structure that is mandatory {{for the formation of}} a stable triple helix. Most babies have their own private de novo mutation. However, the recurrence rate is about 7 % owing to germline mosaicism in one parent. The mutations act in a dominant neg-ative manner as the mutant proa chains are incorporated into type I procollagen molecules that also contain normal proa chains. The abnormal molecules are poorly secreted, more susceptible to de-gradation, and impair the formation ofthe extracellular matrix. The collagen fibres are abnormally organised and min-eralisation is impaired. The severity of the clinical phenotype appears {{to be related to the}} type of muta-tion, its location in the a chain, the sur-rounding <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequences, and the level of expression of the mutant allele.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The recent {{sequencing}} of the viral genomes SV 40, X 174 [1 - 3] strongly supports {{the existence of}} multiframe codon reading. This overlapping of protein sequence information within the genome, while not the rule, {{was part of the}} original proposal by Gamow et al. in 1956 [4]. The fact that a minimum of three bases is required to code for anything over sixteen possible <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> results in considerable degeneracy for the encoding of the known twenty <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> by <b>triplets.</b> The natural question which arises is what restrictions are imposed on pairs of proteins coded for within the same region of DNA. In order to approach this question it is conceptually convenient to view these restrictions as being imposed on one of the proteins given the other. In other words, to what degree does the specification of one <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence, even with the degeneracy of the code, constrain the possibilities available for the second sequence? *Present address: Department of Molecular Bioph...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{learning}} {{approaches to}} predicting RNA-binding residues in a protein sequence construct a non-redundant training dataset {{based on the}} sequence similarity. The sequence similarity-based method either takes a whole sequence or discards it for a training dataset. However, similar sequences or even identical sequences can have different interaction sites depending on their interaction partners, and this information is lost when the sequences are removed. Furthermore, a training dataset constructed by the sequence similarity-based method may contain redundant data when the remaining sequence contains similar subsequences within the sequence. In addition to {{the problem with the}} training dataset, most approaches do not consider the interacting partner (i. e., RNA) of a protein when they predict RNA-binding <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Thus, they always predict the same RNA-binding sites for a given protein sequence even if the protein binds to different RNA molecules. Results We developed a feature vector-based method that removes data redundancy for a non-redundant training dataset. The feature vector-based method constructed a larger training dataset than the standard sequence similarity-based method, yet the dataset contained no redundant data. We identified effective features of protein and RNA (the interaction propensity of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>triplets,</b> global features of the protein sequence, and RNA feature) for predicting RNA-binding residues. Using the method and features, we built a support vector machine (SVM) model that predicted RNA-binding residues in a protein sequence. Our SVM model showed an accuracy of 84. 2 %, an F-measure of 76. 1 %, and a correlation coefficient of 0. 41 with 5 -fold cross validation on a non-redundant dataset from 3, 149 protein-RNA interacting pairs. In an independent test dataset that does not include the 3, 149 pairs and were not used in training the SVM model, it achieved an accuracy of 90. 3 %, an F-measure of 72. 8 %, and a correlation coefficient of 0. 24. Comparison with other methods on the same datasets demonstrated that our model was better than the others. Conclusions The feature vector-based redundancy reduction method is powerful for constructing a non-redundant training dataset for a learning model since it generates a larger dataset with non-redundant data than the standard sequence similarity-based method. Including the features of both RNA and protein sequences in a feature vector results in better performance than using the protein features only when predicting the RNA-binding residues in a protein sequence. </p...|$|R
