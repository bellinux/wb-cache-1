5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E

5|$|Along with Davis' {{other records}} during the 1970s, Dark Magus was {{received}} ambivalently by contemporary critics, but it inspired noise rock acts {{during the late}} 1970s and the experimental funk artists of the 1980s. The album was not released in the United States until July 1997, when it was reissued by Sony Records and Legacy Records. In retrospective reviews, critics praised its jazz-rock aesthetic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> members' performances, and some believed certain parts foreshadowed jungle music.|$|E

The hurdle method is closely linked to hands-on learning.|$|E

When the completed album was presented to Don Ellis, Epic's A director, he stated that he hated the album and {{was not going to}} release it. The next day, Wicked Lester manager Lew Linet requested and received the group's release from Epic Records.|$|E
