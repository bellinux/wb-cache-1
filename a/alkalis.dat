40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of <b>alkali</b> {{adsorption}} on the agglomeration of particles of bauxite, kaolinite, emathlite, lime, and two types of coal ash. An agglomeration (adhesion) temperature is defined which characterizes the adhesion propensity of particles. Using a small fluidized bed, a unique experimental technique is developed to measure this agglomeration point in-situ. The effects of <b>alkali</b> adsorption on the agglomeration characteristics of the substrates are determined. The agglomeration temperature of all substrates decreases as the <b>alkali</b> content increases. At low <b>alkali</b> loadings, <b>alkali</b> adsorption enhances particle agglomeration by forming new compounds of lower melting points. At high <b>alkali</b> concentrations, adhesion and agglomeration are caused by a layer of molten <b>alkali</b> which covers the exterior of the particles. <b>Alkali</b> surface composition of particles is studied using a Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM). Results indicate that the <b>alkali</b> surface concentration decreases as agglomeration temperature increases. SAM depth profiling data provides information on the variations of <b>alkali</b> loading across particles. These results show that an <b>alkali</b> surface product layer is formed where most of the <b>alkali</b> adsorbed is concentrated. The use of additives to scavenge <b>alkali</b> vapors is further studied in a pilot scale downflow combustor under more typical combustion conditions. SAM surface analyses of additive particles indicate three mechanisms of <b>alkali</b> capture. <b>Alkali</b> adsorption by reaction, <b>alkali</b> surface condensation, and <b>alkali</b> nucleation and coagulation with additive particles. These mechanisms may occur independently or simultaneously depending primarily on the <b>alkali</b> vapor concentration and the temperature profile along the combustion furnace. A mathematical model is developed to represent the kinetics and mechanisms of the <b>alkali</b> adsorption and agglomeration process. Modeling results indicate that the adsorption-reaction process is influenced by diffusion of <b>alkali</b> through the surface product layer. The model predictions of the <b>alkali</b> adsorbed as a function of minimum agglomeration temperature agree very well with the experimental results. Alkali-additive interactions in a downflow combustor are also modeled to predict the mechanisms of <b>alkali</b> capture and the overall <b>alkali</b> removal efficiency. Model predictions of the <b>alkali</b> capture agree well with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|An <b>alkali</b> metal filter {{having a}} layer of {{metallic}} bismuth deposited onto the <b>alkali</b> metal is provided. The metallic bismuth acts to stabilize {{the surface of the}} <b>alkali</b> metal to prevent substantial surface migration from occurring on the <b>alkali</b> metal, which may degrade optical characteristics of the filter. To this end, {{a layer of}} metallic bismuth is deposited by vapor deposition over the <b>alkali</b> metal to a depth of approximately 5 to 10 A.

40|$|The {{internal}} friction and the dielectric losses of Na-K metaphosphate glasses have been investigated. A single <b>alkali</b> and a mixed <b>alkali</b> {{internal friction}} peak were observed. The single <b>alkali</b> peak shifted to higher temperatures with increasing {{concentration of the}} second <b>alkali</b> and eventually disappeared. The activation energy of this peak increased with the <b>alkali</b> mixing ratio. As in silicate and borate glasses, the single <b>alkali</b> peak correlates closely with the dielectric loss. The mixed peak showed {{a dramatic increase in}} size with the addition of the second <b>alkali,</b> but the activation energy was practically independent of the <b>alkali</b> mixing ratio. The large reduction in height of the mixed peak, observed on annealing, is discussed together with the influence of water...|$|R

At higher temperatures, all three metals react with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Because of the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr4+ is 79picometers and that of Hf4+ is 78pm.|$|E

It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures; with fluorine at room temperature; with chlorine and hydrogen at 200°C; and with nitrogen at 400°C, with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200°C. It resists corrosion by fused <b>alkalis</b> and by acids, including aqua regia, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids.

5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg.

It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous <b>alkalis</b> to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E

EXAFS data indicate that the Ni nanodomains disappear progressively when adding <b>alkali</b> oxide, whatever {{the nature of the}} <b>alkali.</b> This medium range reorganization around Ni is associated with a change of the local site from 6 - to 5 -fold coordination at 27 – 30 mol% <b>alkali</b> oxide and 4 -fold coordination at higher <b>alkali</b> oxide content. Ni–Ni connections are still present for [5]Ni but no second neighbors are observed for [4]Ni in the EXAFS signal.

5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in {{the periodic table}} {{to the left of}} uranium and to the right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in <b>alkalis.</b> Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur.

Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or tellurous acid H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling <b>alkalis,</b> to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E
