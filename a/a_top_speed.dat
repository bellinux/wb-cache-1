5|$|Dragon Challenge (known as Dueling Dragons from 1999 to 2010) {{was a pair}} of intertwined, {{inverted}} {{roller coasters}} in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter area of Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, United States.

5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated and the Model 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force that, even with the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued to perfect the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with <b>a</b> <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain performance requirements for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, these requirements called for <b>a</b> <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, far beyond the capabilities of 464-29.|$|E

Dreadnought used steam turbines for propulsion, giving her <b>a</b> <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of 21 knots, against the 18 knots typical of the pre-dreadnought battleships. Able both to outgun and outmaneuver their opponents, the dreadnought battleships decisively outclassed earlier battleship designs.|$|E

5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached <b>a</b> <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E
