40|$|Abstract. To deliver complex {{functionalities}} in a {{cost effective}} manner, embedded software should ideally be developed with standardized interoperable components. At the same time, {{most of these}} embedded systems must be demonstrably safe and reliable. This paper aims to extend SaveCCM, a modelling language for component-based embedded systems, with standard safety evaluation models. Based on this extension, failure and hazard probabilities can be estimated early in the development process {{and can be used}} to check if a system can fulfil its safety requirements. The procedure of the safety evaluation is demonstrated with the case study of a computer <b>assisted</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} design problem of an automotive <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is developed in this article. A description of the overall system followed by {{a detailed description of}} the individual subsystems is presented. The design model of the individual subsystems is then developed. The overall system design model that includes the different subsystem models and the models that describe the performance of the entire system is then presented. A vacuum <b>assisted</b> hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is one of the common <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> used in cars. Shown in Fig. 1 is a typical vacuum <b>assisted</b> hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> for a car.

50|$|Most modern {{vehicles}} use {{a vacuum}} <b>assisted</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> that greatly increases the force {{applied to the}} vehicle's brakes by its operator. This additional force is supplied by the manifold vacuum generated by air flow being obstructed by the throttle on a running engine. This force is greatly reduced when the engine is running at fully open throttle, as the difference between ambient air pressure and manifold (absolute) air pressure is reduced, and therefore available vacuum is diminished. However, brakes are rarely applied at full throttle; the driver takes the right foot off the gas pedal and moves it to the brake pedal - unless left-foot braking is used.|$|R

In 1996, the W140 received <b>Brake</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>System</b> BAS, which engaged during emergency maneuvers to boost braking power to maximum.|$|R
30|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, VO {{also plays a}} big role. It is applied in numerous driver assistance systems, such as vision-based <b>assisted</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems.</b> VO is considered a cost-effective solution compared with LIDAR systems (Fraundorfer and Scaramuzza 2012). In ground vehicle robotics, the effective use of visual sensors for navigation and obstacle detection is the main goal (Nistér et al. 2006). VO is employed {{in cases where the}} GPS signal is unavailable (in planetary environments), too heavy to carry (on a small air vehicle), or insufficiently accurate at a low cost (in agricultural applications) (Zhang et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2014 a). It is also used in agricultural field robots to estimate the robot’s position relative to the crops (Ericson and Astrand 2008; Jiang et al. 2014 a).|$|R

A Nine Degree of Freedom (9 -DOF) armored vehicle model was derived mathematically and integrated with an analytical tire dynamics known as Pacejka Magic Tire model. The armored vehicle model is developed using three main inputs of a vehicle system which are Pitman arm steering system, Powertrain system and also hydraulic <b>assisted</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> Several testings in lateral and longitudinal direction are performed such as double lane change, slalom, step steer and sudden acceleration and sudden braking to verify the vehicle model. The armored vehicle model is verified using validated software, CarSim, using HMMWV vehicle model as a benchmark. The verification responses show that the developed armored vehicle model can be used for both lateral and longitudinal direction analysis...|$|R

50|$|The 2WD models {{feature the}} new Electronic Braking Force Distribution (EBD) system that uses {{electronic}} control to optimally distribute braking {{force to the}} front and rear wheels according to changes in the payload (number of passengers) being carried. This system works in tandem with the <b>Braking</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>system</b> (a <b>brake</b> booster with a two-stage mechanical assist mechanism plus ABS) to achieve synergies between effective utilization of front and rear braking force (EBD) and reduced pedal pressure (<b>Braking</b> <b>Assist).</b> As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less pedal pressure in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload. The 4WD models also provide the nearly same high level of braking performance by adopting a load sensing valve (LSV) as a mechanical <b>braking</b> force distribution <b>system</b> in a set with the <b>Braking</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The full {{proceedings}} of ESV 2009 are freely available at: [URL] work (Perron et al., 2001) on emergency brake application concluded that driver population diversity and “the overlap of braking parameter distributions between normal conditions and emergency situations” is such, that triggering criteria cannot both detect all emergency braking actions and never activate the assistance {{in situations where}} it is not necessary. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate driver-braking characteristics, in order that future systems might achieve greater effectiveness. 48 drivers drove an instrumented vehicle on a public road section before arriving at a test track, where they were instructed to follow at their preferred distance another vehicle towing a trailer. They were told the aim was to measure their preferred car-following distance. They were naïve to the fact that 0. 2 miles down the track the trailer would be released and rapidly decelerate to a stop. The main variables analysed included “throttle-off” rate, brake pedal pressure/force, and clutch pedal pressure/operation. The results indicate a series of relationships exploitable by an intelligent <b>brake</b> <b>assist</b> <b>system.</b> An intelligent <b>brake</b> <b>assist</b> <b>system</b> could take advantage of those characteristics and adapt its performance to individuals’ braking style. Limitations of the study include resource constraints (use of a single instrumented vehicle, time-limited access to the test track) and the contrived nature of the emergency braking scenario (need for surprise element, practically a one-off study, limitation of speed to 30 mph/ 48 kmph). The study provides evidence of a background for a customisable <b>brake</b> <b>assist</b> <b>system</b> that learns from the driver and adjusts its full-brake trigger accordingly...|$|R
