Even if the courts do hold that RCRA civil penalties are limited by the general five-year statute of limitations, this will not apply to RCRA 2 ̆ 7 s injunctive relief.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{allow an}} {{accurate}} evaluation of abstracts of systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement recommends that {{the limitations of}} the evidence (e. g., risk of bias, publication bias, inconsistency, imprecision) should be described in the abstract. We aimed to evaluate the impact of adding such limitations sections on reader's interpretation. METHOD: We performed a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a sample of 30 abstracts of systematic reviews evaluating the effects of healthcare intervention with conclusions favoring the beneficial effect of the experimental treatments. Two formats of these abstracts were derived: one reported without and one with <b>a</b> standardized <b>limitations</b> section written according to the PRISMA statement for abstracts. The primary outcome was readers' confidence in the results of the systematic review as stated in the abstract assessed by a Likert scale from 0, not at all confident, to 10, very confident. In total, 300 participants (corresponding authors of RCT reports indexed in PubMed) were randomized by a web-based randomization procedure to interpret one abstract with <b>a</b> <b>limitations</b> section (n = 150) or without <b>a</b> <b>limitations</b> section (n = 150). Participants were blinded to the study hypothesis. RESULTS: Adding <b>a</b> <b>limitations</b> section did not modify readers' interpretation of findings in terms of confidence in the results (mean difference [95 % confidence interval] 0. 19 [- 0. 37 - 0. 74], p = 0. 50), confidence in the validity of the conclusions (0. 07 [- 0. 49 - 0. 62], p = 0. 80), or benefit of the experimental intervention (0. 12 [- 0. 42 - 0. 44], p = 0. 65). This study is limited because the participants were expert-readers and are not representative of all systematic review readers. CONCLUSION: Adding <b>a</b> <b>limitations</b> section to abstracts of systematic reviews did not affect readers' interpretation of the abstract results. Other studies are needed to confirm the results and explore the impact of <b>a</b> <b>limitations</b> section on <b>a</b> less expert panel of participants.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>limitation</b> of the radial {{velocity}} method {{used to detect}} Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the {{radial velocity}} measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, it implies that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>limitation</b> of the radial {{velocity}} method {{used to detect}} Gliese 876 b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of the orbit, which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) {{were able to use}} one of the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the astrometric wobble created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84°±6° (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of the orbit is 59°, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|In the Netherlands, all the {{objective}} conditions were present {{for a successful}} defence: a dense population, wealthy, young, disciplined and well-educated; a geography favouring the defender; and a strong technological and industrial base including an armaments industry. However, these had not been exploited: while the Wehrmacht at the time still had many shortcomings in equipment and training, the Dutch army, by comparison, was far less prepared for war. The myth of the general German equipment advantage over the opposing armies in the Battle of France {{was in fact a}} reality {{in the case of the}} Battle of the Netherlands. Germany had a modern army with tanks and dive bombers (such as the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka), while the Netherlands had an army whose armoured forces comprised only 39 armoured cars and five tankettes, and an air force in large part consisting of biplanes. The Dutch government's attitude towards war was reflected in the state of the country's armed forces, which had not significantly expanded their equipment since before the First World War, and were inadequately armed even by the standards of 1918. During the 1920s, an economic recession lasting from 1920 until 1927 and the general détente in international relations caused <b>a</b> <b>limitation</b> of the defence budget. In that decade, only 1.5 million guilders per annum was spent on equipment. Both in 1931 and 1933, commissions appointed to economise even further failed, because they concluded that the acceptable minimum had been reached and advised that a spending increase was urgently needed. Only in February 1936 was a bill passed creating a special 53.4 million guilder defence fund.|$|E
