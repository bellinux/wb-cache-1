5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic <b>and</b> <b>Geographic</b> Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that the}} pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry <b>and</b> <b>geographic</b> indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} John Coles {{from the}} University of Cambridge began {{a research project}} {{that resulted in the}} publication of an important series of papers on many aspects of the Levels. A range of archaeological projects, such as the exploration of various trackways from the 3rd and 1st millennia BC and the establishment of their economic <b>and</b> <b>geographic</b> significance, was funded by various donors including English Heritage. Possibly the project's most significant excavation was of the Sweet Track in 1970, during which a Jadeite axe was discovered. Eight radiocarbon determinations of the date of the axe place it at around 3200 BC.|$|E

5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, <b>and</b> <b>geographic</b> fate.|$|E
5|$|An EKOS poll {{conducted}} in December 2009 revealed that 83% {{of the respondents}} believed the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured.

As time progressed, 61% of Canadians still believed Afghan detainees were tortured in May 2010, according to an Ipsos-Reid poll. This poll also found that 52% of respondents believed that Stephen Harper and Canadian soldiers knew torture was occurring, and 75% believed senior military officials would have known about the problem. A poll done by Angus Reid during 5 January and 6, found that 38 per cent of Canadians believed that Harper used the 30 December 2009 prorogation to curtail the Canadian Afghan detainee issue.|$|E
5|$|Cabral's discovery, {{and even}} his resting place {{in the land of}} his birth, had been almost {{completely}} forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition. This began to change beginning in the 1840s when Emperor Dom Pedro II, successor and son of Pedro I, sponsored research and publications dealing with Cabral's life and expedition through the Brazilian Historic <b>and</b> <b>Geographic</b> Institute. This was part of the Emperor's ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among Brazil's diverse citizenry—giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique Portuguese-speaking empire, surrounded by Hispanic-American Republics. The initial resurgence of interest in Cabral had resulted from the rediscovery, in 1839, of his resting place by the Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen (later Viscount of Porto Seguro). The completely neglected state in which Cabral's tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between Brazil and Portugal—the latter then ruled by Pedro II's eldest sister, Maria II.|$|E
