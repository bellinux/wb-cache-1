5|$|Hotel Mario is {{a puzzle}} video game {{developed}} by Fantasy Factory {{and published by}} Philips Interactive Media and Nintendo for the Philips CD-i in 1994. The primary character {{of the game is}} Mario, who must find Princess Toadstool by going through seven Koopa hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> on each stage. Defeating a Koopaling on the hotel's final stage takes the player to the following building.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005, {{construction}} commenced {{on the new}} South Ferry–Whitehall Street {{station on}} the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which is located underneath an older loop-platformed station {{of the same name}} in South Ferry, Manhattan. It is designed as an ADA-accessible, two-track terminal, which allows all ten cars of the train to platform and <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> to be opened, as opposed to only the first five cars in the old station.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{subdivided}} into an eleven watertight compartments,so proportioned {{that the ship}} would float if any two adjacent compartments became flooded. The watertight doors throughout the ship were operated on the Stone-Lloyd system that enabled <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> to be closed instantly and simultaneously from the bridge.|$|E

50|$|After {{considering}} {{the circumstances of}} a rape incident in Newcastle in 2012 Baird promoted {{the development of new}} national training requirements for <b>all</b> <b>door</b> staff. These new requirements were instituted by the Security Industry Authority (SIA) in November 2013.|$|R
25|$|<b>All</b> <b>doors</b> are {{framed and}} ledged, most {{retaining}} original hardware including locks, metal bolts, keyhole covers and timber reeded knobs, with elaborate metal hinges on exterior doors. Side doors open onto raised semicircular concrete balconies, {{with the western}} balcony balustrade cut back to allow access from an adjacent car park.|$|E
25|$|The courtyards, usually stone-flagged, are {{generally}} {{at a higher}} level than the outside and approached by massive staircases and narrow defensible entrances with large wooden doors. <b>All</b> <b>doors</b> have thresholds to discourage the entrance of spirits. Temples are usually set at a level above the courtyard with further staircases up to them.|$|E
25|$|The Talent units can be coupled {{together}} to form longer trains, but current ridership levels do not require this extended service, which in any case would require more trains and longer platforms at the stations. Each of the three carriages has a plug-type doorway for {{each side of the}} train. Rather than <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> opening at each station, passengers must individually open the door of which they intend to board or disembark by pressing a button.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. Serial {{main and}} sub-controllers. <b>All</b> <b>door</b> {{hardware}} {{is connected to}} sub-controllers (a.k.a. door controllers or door interfaces). Sub-controllers usually do not make access decisions, and instead forward all requests to the main controllers. Main controllers usually support from 16 to 32 sub-controllers.|$|R
50|$|On December 14, 2015, the TTC {{introduced}} Presto, proof-of-payment and <b>all</b> <b>door</b> loading for <b>all</b> streetcars on all routes. All streetcar {{passengers are}} required to carry proof that they have paid their fares such as a validated TTC ticket, paper transfer, pass or Presto card while riding.|$|R

25|$|Shop {{owners are}} trying to find ways around the law, such as {{allowing}} customers to smoke in the back or opening <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> and windows to have their restaurant be considered an outdoor establishment in which smoking would be allowed. They still take much caution, however, as they can be subject to fines and have the additional risk of the complete shutdown of their business following multiple offenses. Smoking customers themselves are subject to fines up to around $44.|$|E
25|$|Initial reports {{showed that}} fire crews had {{difficulty}} during the rescue operation because {{doors on the}} train were locked. This was against the rules, but it was commonplace for attendants to lock the end doors of the pair of coaches that they were responsible for. This meant that attendants could greet passengers on arrival, and it helped to keep out intruders. Following this discovery, BR made it absolutely clear that <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> were to be left unlocked at all times.|$|E
25|$|The MBTA's {{solution}} was to turn the surface portion of the Green Line into a proof-of-payment system {{to increase the efficiency}} of boarding at peak times on surface Green Line stops. <b>All</b> <b>doors</b> on all trolleys open at some or all stations, depending on the branch. Passengers can pay their fare in several ways, depending on their payment method. Passengers paying with cash must enter through the front door and pay at the farebox, where they may receive a proof-of-payment receipt. Stored-value CharlieCard or CharlieTicket holders may also need to pay at the farebox.|$|E
50|$|Great Western Railway High Speed Train sets have SDO {{at almost}} <b>all</b> <b>door</b> locations. These trains {{are of the}} slam door variety and fitted with the Central Door Locking system. The guard {{operates}} the SDO system from most door control panels throughout the train. The guard can then either de-select doors {{in front of that}} location or behind.|$|R

25|$|The colour layout {{on these}} trains are also {{different}} from their earlier counterparts. Cars 1 and 6 use a sort of pinkish-purple color on the seats, while cars 2 and 5 use a different shade of blue, and the middle cars using a bluish-green. <b>All</b> <b>door</b> panels and walls are white, which is a standard appearance of all SMRT trains.|$|R
25|$|At {{the main}} {{entrance}} are three doors. Apart from {{the main entrance}}, all other entrances, except for the one fronting Victoria Street, have only one door. The entrance fronting Victoria Street had three doors initially until the walling up of the centre door. <b>All</b> <b>doors</b> are double-leaf, of timber construct and, except for the two fronting Victoria Street, all are panelled. While {{the doors of the}} two side entrances at the nave are double the height of the doors found at the ends of the transept, these four doors have each a stained-glass window over them.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, {{she and her}} son {{returned}} to Moscow, unaware of the reception she would receive. In Stalin's USSR, anyone who had lived abroad was suspect, as was anyone who had been among the intelligentsia before the Revolution. Tsvetaeva's sister had been arrested before Tsvetaeva's return; although Anastasia survived the Stalin years, the sisters never saw each other again. Tsvetaeva found that <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> had closed to her. She got bits of work translating poetry, but otherwise the established Soviet writers refused to help her, and chose to ignore her plight; Nikolai Aseev, who she had hoped would assist, shied away, fearful for his life and position.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s Grant became {{troubled by the}} deaths {{of so many of}} his close friends, {{including}} Howard Hughes in 1976, Howard Hawks in 1977, Lord Mountbatten and Barbara Hutton in 1979, Alfred Hitchcock in 1980, Grace Kelly and Ingrid Bergman in 1982, and David Niven in 1983. At the funeral of Mountbatten he was quoted as remarking to a friend: [...] "I'm absolutely pooped, and I'm so goddamned old...I'm going to quit all next year. I'm going to lie in bed...I shall just close <b>all</b> <b>doors,</b> turn off the telephone, and enjoy my life". Kelly's death was the hardest hitting on Grant, as the death was unexpected, and the two remained close friends after filming To Catch a Thief. Grant visited Monaco three or four times each year during his retirement, and showed his support for Kelly by joining the board of the Princess Grace Foundation.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{the pope}} himself opens {{and closes the}} doors of St. Peter's Basilica personally, and designates a {{cardinal}} to open those of St. John Lateran, St. Mary Major, and St. Paul outside the Walls. In the Great Jubilee, the pope chose to open <b>all</b> the <b>doors</b> personally, while designating cardinals to close <b>all</b> the <b>doors</b> except that of St. Peter's.|$|R

500|$|Charles Arbuthnot was {{a widower}} with four children; his son Charles {{was a mere}} nine years junior to his new wife. His first wife Marcia, a lady in waiting to the notorious Princess of Wales, had died in 1806. Like the other two men his second wife so admired, Viscount Castlereagh and Wellington, Charles Arbuthnot {{was a member of}} the Anglo-Irish aristocracy. [...] He had been a member of {{parliament}} since 1795, when he became the member for East Looe. At the time of his marriage to Fane, he was the member for St Germans. [...] He had briefly interrupted his political career to become Ambassador Extraordinary to the Ottoman Empire between 1804 and 1807. Marriage to such a pillar of the establishment as Charles Arbuthnot opened <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> to his young new wife, who, as one of the 14 children of a younger son of an aristocratic family possessed of no great fortune, would otherwise have been on the periphery of the highest society. However, as the debate and wrangling over her dowry proved, money was tight.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, {{bombings and}} violent demonstrations {{led to a}} {{crackdown}} on dissent, with Castro and Raúl fleeing the country to evade arrest. Castro {{sent a letter to}} the press, declaring that he was [...] "leaving Cuba because <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> of peaceful struggle have been closed to me... As a follower of Martí, I believe the hour has come to take our rights and not beg for them, to fight instead of pleading for them." [...] The Castros and several comrades traveled to Mexico, where Raúl befriended an Argentine doctor and Marxist–Leninist named Ernesto [...] "Che" [...] Guevara, who was working as a journalist and photographer for [...] "Agencia Latina de Noticias". Fidel liked him, later describing him as [...] "a more advanced revolutionary than I was". Castro also associated with the Spaniard Alberto Bayo, who agreed to teach Castro's rebels the necessary skills in guerrilla warfare. Requiring funding, Castro toured the U.S. in search of wealthy sympathizers, there being monitored by Batista's agents, who allegedly orchestrated a failed assassination attempt against him. Castro kept in contact with the MR-26-7 in Cuba, where they had gained a large support base in Oriente. Other militant anti-Batista groups had sprung up, primarily from the student movement; most notable was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE), founded by José Antonio Echeverría. Antonio met with Castro in Mexico City, but Castro opposed the student's support for indiscriminate assassination.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, {{bombings and}} violent demonstrations {{led to a}} {{crackdown}} on dissent; Castro was placed under protective armed guard by supporters, before he and Raúl fled the country. MR-26-7 members remaining in Cuba were left to prepare cells for revolutionary action and await Castro's return. He {{sent a letter to}} the press, declaring that he was [...] "leaving Cuba because <b>all</b> <b>doors</b> of peaceful struggle have been closed to me. Six weeks after being released from prison I am convinced more than ever of the dictatorship's intention, masked in many ways, to remain in power for twenty years, ruling as now by the use of terror and crime and ignoring the patience of the Cuban people, which has its limits. As a follower of Martí, I believe the hour has come to take our rights and not beg for them, to fight instead of pleading for them." [...] The Castros and several comrades traveled to Mexico, which had a long history of offering asylum to leftist exiles. Here, Raúl befriended an Argentine doctor and Marxist-Leninist named Ernesto [...] "Che" [...] Guevara, a proponent of guerrilla warfare keen to join Cuba's Revolution. Fidel liked him, later describing him as [...] "a more advanced revolutionary than I was." [...] Castro also associated with the Spaniard Alberto Bayo, a Republican veteran of the Spanish Civil War; Bayo agreed to teach Fidel's rebels the necessary skills in guerrilla warfare, clandestinely meeting them at Chapultepec for training.|$|E
