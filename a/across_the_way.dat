5|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> is a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under the Princess brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named Sparks playing a trick on his friend to make him question his sanity. The trick involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, but then a burglar attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the burglar and later marries him instead of Sparks. The Princess comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, the Princess brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
5|$|The Princess {{production}} {{department of the}} Thanhouser Company started in 1913. It would have a film released on every Friday. Early Princess productions were mostly comedies that performed well, but the company's dramas were often unfavorable. The early Princess productions were marked by their poor scenarios that were illogically written or consisted of uninteresting material. Princess produced films out of a studio in New Rochelle from 1913 until 1915, when the production brand was changed and renamed Falstaff. The production and release of <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> occurred before Edwin Thanhouser returned and took personal interest in {{improving the quality of}} the productions at the New Rochelle studio. The new brand, Falstaff, would soon replace the Princess productions.|$|E

25|$|When Lafayette Street {{was opened}} {{parallel}} to the Bowery in the 1820s, the Bowery Theatre was founded by rich families {{on the site of}} the Red Bull Tavern, which had been purchased by John Jacob Astor; it opened in 1826 and was the largest auditorium in North America at the time. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the Bowery Amphitheatre was erected in 1833, specializing in the more populist entertainments of equestrian shows and circuses. From stylish beginnings, the tone of Bowery Theatre's offerings matched the slide in the social scale of the Bowery itself.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E

500|$|Merrill Barr of Forbes {{felt the}} purpose of the {{crossover}} was to establish the back-stories of Legends characters Vandal Savage, Hawkman and Hawkgirl who are not a natural fit with Arrow and The Flash.

Barr was fascinated at how intertwined the crossover is, but saw it as [...] "more than just a Legends of Tomorrow set-up".
