5|$|Kittens may {{be taken}} by several predators, {{including}} owls, eagles, foxes, coyotes, <b>and</b> <b>bears,</b> {{as well as other}} adult male bobcats; when prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood.

40|$|There is no {{previous}} research on the dating of bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> cycles in the Norwegian stock market. Even for the U. S., few researchers have conducted a thorough analysis of the bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> markets. The purpose of this thesis is to provide an analysis of bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> markets in the U. S. and Norway from 1914 to 2016. Bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> markets are identi ed using a formal dating method. We divide our datasets into two sub-periods, {{to account for the}} robustness of our results. We nd that bull markets are longer <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> markets are shorter in the U. S. compared to Norway. We perform a structural break analysis and nd a major break in the growth rate in the U. S. and the Norwegian stock market. We see that the dominance of bull markets are almost identical for the U. S. and Norway post-structural break. Additionally, we test the return di erences between the rst (last) six months and the remaining months of bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> market states. These tests reveal evidence that returns are greater (smaller) in the rst (last) six months than the remaining for all bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> markets, except Norwegian bear markets. Finally, we test the investor overreaction hypothesis on the bull <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> market amplitude <b>and</b> nd that the dynamics of the U. S. stock market can partially be explained by investor overreaction...|$|R

The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, <b>and</b> <b>bears</b> a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E

5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it.

The episode was filmed in the Californian desert, with a filtering effect used to make it appear to be night on the planet, as its sun rarely rises.
