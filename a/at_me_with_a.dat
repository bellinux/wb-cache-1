500|$|Ahimsa as {{an ethical}} concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with {{discussing}} ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, {{but do not}} emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices {{and the concept of}} Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the concept that describes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, [...] "may all beings look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".|$|E
2500|$|On 15 August 1942 Winston Churchill {{saw her in}} Stalin's private {{apartments in}} the Kremlin, {{describing}} her as [...] "a handsome red-haired girl, who kissed her father dutifully."

2500|$|Baer hardly {{trained for}} the bout. Braddock, {{on the other}} hand, was {{training}} hard. [...] "I'm training for a fight. Not a boxing contest or a clownin' contest or a dance", he said. [...] "Whether it goes 1 round or 3 rounds or 10 rounds, {{it will be a}} fight and a fight all the way... When you've been through what I've had to face in the last two years, a Max Baer or a Bengal tiger looks like a house pet. He might come <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cannon and a blackjack and he would still be a picnic compared to what I've had to face." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{stood looking}} at the school— it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white {{students}} through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were {{waiting to see what}} was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn’t move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer.
