5|$|During the {{development}} of these algorithms <b>and</b> <b>tables,</b> it was recognized that a successful algorithm could be used to replace the existing collection of incompatible tables for various air and Nitrox diving modes currently in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual with a set of mutually compatible decompression tables based on a single model, which was proposed by Gerth and Doolette in 2007. This has been done in Revision 6 of the US Navy Diving Manual published in 2008, though some changes were made.|$|E

By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Recreational divers {{are trained}} in the theory and {{practice}} of decompression {{to the extent that the}} certifying agency specifies in the training standard for each certification. This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid decompression obligation for entry level divers, to competence in the use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers, decompression software, <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> for advanced technical divers. The detailed understanding of decompression theory is not generally required of either commercial or recreational divers.|$|E

5|$|Since divers on {{the surface}} after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies, any {{subsequent}} dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule {{to take account of}} the residual gas load from the previous dive. This will result in a shorter available time under water or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive. The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.|$|E

Considered {{as one of the}} greatest tag teams of all time, they are the only team to have held the WWF/World, WCW, TNA, ROH and Raw Tag Team Championships.

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six-man tag team match pitting {{the team of}} Rhino and Team 3D against the team of Jeff Jarrett and America's Most Wanted. The latter was {{accompanied}} by Gail Kim. Various weapons were used by both teams throughout the match without the referee disqualifying either. Some weapons used included trash cans, cheese graters, <b>and</b> <b>tables.</b> Rhino tackled Jarrett with his signature Gore maneuver late in the match, but the pin was broken up by AMW. This led to Team 3D throwing Harris {{out of the ring}} and performing their signature 3D tag team maneuver, slamming Storm onto the mat. They followed with the pin to win the contest at 15 minutes and 48 seconds. After the contest, Jarrett attacked Rhino by bashing him over the head with a guitar. Jarrett, AMW, and Team Canada then proceeded to assault Rhino and Team 3D until Christian Cage came out to the ring. Cage attacked Coach Scott D'Amore and aided Rhino and Team 3D is fighting off Jarrett, AMW, and the result of Team Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building's interior initially {{had dark}} wood panels and {{was decorated with}} flowers, oriental rugs on the terrazzo floor, <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> and chairs in the Mission style. In 1959, when the library moved in, local architect and village resident William Anders Sharman planned the building's $2,000 renovation; he later became {{the first president of}} the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society. The station's circular ticket office was replaced by the librarian's desk, bookshelves replaced station furniture, and the baggage room became the children's section. Former library president Theodore R. Malsin dedicated the children's room in memory of his son Donald. From 1959 until 2009, the building housed a main reading room and children's room; a vestibule and second-story balcony were added in 1980.|$|E
5|$|There are 24 vending {{stands in}} the {{corridor}} area behind the stands, with a selection of different snacks, light meals, and beverages. Other facilities include exhibition space, 330 toilets for men, 120 for women, and six for the disabled. Pre-match and half-time activities take place behind the terracing of the Northern Stand. This area is called Ståplatstorget ("The terracing square"), and includes eight vending stands and MFF Support's supporter centre. At the supporter centre, fans can buy souvenirs, and tickets to away matches. The square also contains publicly accessible benches <b>and</b> <b>tables.</b> Access between the {{different areas of the}} stadium was limited by a system of security gates {{until the end of the}} 2011 season, when Malmö FF announced that supporters would be able to roam the stadium freely, except for the areas occupied by away supporters. This was done to create a more free and friendly atmosphere, and to encourage fans to arrive earlier for matches. To further motivate spectators to come early, pre-match activities are often held at Ståplatstorget.|$|E

5|$|Tower C is {{different}} from Towers A and B in several ways, but primarily {{in the fact that}} its rooms are single occupancy. The rooms are 2/3 the size of rooms in Towers A and B, and like Tower A and Tower B, every third floor has a lounge containing a television, couches, <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> for extra study. In addition, each floor has 30 rooms, except floors containing a lounge, which have 27. No official specialized student communities are housed in Tower C, but designated male and female floors are 24-hour Quiet Living Communities. Up until 2010-11, Tower C was open to students of any year, however it now houses primarily first-year students.|$|E
5|$|Towers A and B {{are very}} similar to each other. All rooms in both towers are doubles, meaning that two people share each room. There is a lounge the size of three dorm rooms every third floor, {{containing}} a large television and several couches <b>and</b> <b>tables</b> for studying. Communal and university-sponsored events frequently take place in the various lounges throughout the towers. Every floor shares a communal bathroom, with several shower and restroom stalls. Each floor has twenty rooms, except for the lounge floors, which only have seventeen. Each floor's resident assistant lives alone in their respective room, meaning each floor houses 39 people. On the ground floor of Tower A there is a small fitness center containing treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and weight equipment. A fully functioning post office and all student mailboxes are located {{on the ground floor of}} Tower B. Due to the fact that both Towers A and B are exclusively residences for first year students, they are both designated as alcohol-free. Its distribution, sale, and consumption, is punished if discovered.|$|E
