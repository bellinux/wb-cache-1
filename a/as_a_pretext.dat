5|$|In February 1828, {{shortly before}} his 41st birthday, Etty soundly {{defeated}} John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, {{at the time the}} highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for nudity.|$|E
5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that {{they would be able to}} cut back on overall expenditure. In one case, a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced to eight months corrective labour after being found guilty of using the reforms <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to extract unpaid overtime from workers.|$|E
5|$|The Kuomintang (KMT) {{party in}} China {{launched}} a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon {{embroiled in a}} civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.|$|E
50|$|Football in {{the sixteenth}} century is also {{documented}} <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for raids across the border against the English.|$|R
500|$|Ali Haidar, Syria's Minister of National Reconciliation, {{praised the}} {{agreement}} as [...] "a victory for Syria that was achieved {{thanks to our}} Russian friends." [...] He described the agreement <b>as</b> removing <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for <b>a</b> U.S. attack on the country. Iran also stated that the agreement had deprived the U.S. of <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for attacking Syria.|$|R
50|$|As bishop, he was {{considered}} rather ineffectual against the Roman Catholics, preferring not to offend the gentry. The reformer Christopher Goodman attacked him in 1571, <b>as</b> supine, on <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> of the continuing Whitsun plays.|$|R
5|$|The final {{steps in}} the shift to empire may have been {{triggered}} by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean {{and led to the}} revolt of several allies, such as Miletus and Erythrae. Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to gain control of the League's finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from Delos to Athens in 454–453BC.|$|E
5|$|Tự Đức {{continued}} {{to hope that}} Vietnamese compliance with the treaty would convince France to return the three southern provinces. In the words of Gian, Vietnam's full cooperation with the 1862 treaty was necessary to maintain {{the possibility of a}} territorial retrocession. The French officers in Saigon, the capital of Cochinchina, frequently accused the Nguyễn court of violating the treaty by quietly supporting continued resistance. In 1867, they took this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to seize the other three provinces in southern Vietnam: Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên and An Giang.|$|E
5|$|Using his {{responsibility}} for the Volksdeutsche of the Banat <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext,</b> Meyszner constantly interfered with operational orders issued to the 7th SS Division. In September 1943, the total police forces at his disposal comprised the 5th SS-Polizei Regiment, minus one company detached to occupied Greece and seven battalions of Hilfspolizei (auxiliary police) of various ethnicities, which had only received 4–5 weeks training due to constant employment.|$|E
50|$|In August 2016 {{researchers}} at Turkey Blocks identified new emergency wartime legislation {{introduced by the}} state <b>as</b> <b>a</b> likely <b>pretext</b> for <b>a</b> social media shutdown observed {{on the eve of}} Turkey's military operation Euphrates Shield during which incursions were made on the border with Syria.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{invitation}} of French-speaking factions in Vaud, 12,000 French troops under general Ménard invaded Vaud on 28 January. An alleged incident, in which French soldiers were killed by Swiss soldiers, was cited <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>pretext.</b> They occupied Vaud without resistance and were cheered on by the population. A second army under general Schauenburg advanced from Mont-Terrible, the former Prince-Bishopric of Basel, towards Bern and demanded its government to put pro-French Revolutionary parties in power. The Bernese refusal to do so {{was used by the}} French to justify war. On 3 February, the Légion fidèle or [...] "Loyal Legion" [...] was formed out of French-speaking volunteers from Vaud who wished to stay loyal to Bern and recapture the Lemanic Republic.|$|R
5000|$|Grady's {{proposal}} was widely regarded <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt {{to circumvent the}} board's February 2006 vote to retract a controversial model lesson plan and to remove the indicator on which it was based from the standards; the indicator, which called for students {{to be able to}} [...] "describe how scientists continue to investigate and critically analyze aspects of evolutionary theory," [...] was generally criticized <b>as</b> providing <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for instilling scientifically unwarranted doubts about evolution.|$|R
5|$|As the JNA {{disengaged}} from Croatia, its personnel {{prepared to}} set up a new Bosnian Serb army; Bosnian Serbs declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992. Between 29 February and 1 March 1992, a referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinawhich would later be cited <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for the Bosnian Warwas held. Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In the final days of March, the Bosnian Serb army started shelling Bosanski Brod, and Sarajevo was attacked on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|At the temple, Kassandra is {{assaulted}} by Khryse, a priest who disguises himself as Apollo {{in order to}} seduce her. She sees through his trickery and fights him off, but the god feels insulted by her refusal and makes the city's residents stop believing her prophecies. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon uses Helen's flight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for war and soon begins launching daily raids on Troy, beginning the Trojan War. Kassandra spends {{more time with her}} family to help with daily tasks while the menled by Hectorfight off the Akhaian invaders. The war continues sporadically despite the attempts of former Trojan ally Odysseus to end the conflict.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Macedonian War (200–196 BC), Macedon {{had given}} Sparta control over Argos, an {{important}} {{city on the}} Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos {{at the end of}} war was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over the next eight years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E
50|$|After the {{invasion}} of Denmark by Germany in April 1940, President Roosevelt ordered the International Ice Patrol to continue <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>pretext</b> to patrol Greenland, whose cryolite mines were vital to refining aluminum and whose geographic location allowed accurate weather forecasts {{to be made for}} Europe. The Greenland Patrol was maintained by the Coast Guard {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|Go-Toba {{saw this}} attack as both ingratitude of the rankest sort and the {{culmination}} of a series of affronts, this latest being petty resentment at what Go-Toba would have seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> flimsy <b>pretext</b> for attempting {{to get out of the}} poetry competition. Accordingly, he banished Teika from his court, a banishment that would last for more than a year; this feud distressed devotees of poetry.|$|R
50|$|It {{can also}} be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{rationale}} (or <b>pretext)</b> for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's constitution or basic law. The procedure for and legality of doing so varies by country.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to worsen relations. On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin {{to negotiate the}} handover of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on secession. The Poles refused {{to comply with the}} German demands and on the night of 30–31 August in a violent meeting with the British ambassador Neville Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 1901, Leon Czolgosz, an {{unemployed}} factory worker and registered Republican {{with a history}} of mental illness, shot US President William McKinley twice during a public speaking event in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was hit in the breastbone and stomach, and died eight days later. Czolgosz was arrested, and interrogated around the clock. During interrogation he claimed to be an Anarchist and said he had been inspired to act after attending a speech held by Goldman. The authorities used this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to charge Goldman with planning McKinley's assassination. They tracked her to a residence in Chicago she shared with Havel, as well as Mary and Abe Isaak, an anarchist couple. Goldman was arrested, along with Isaak, Havel, and ten other anarchists.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss did {{not accept}} these resolutions of the Imperial Diet, and they {{explicitly}} refused to pay the common penny. They had no interest whatsoever in sending troops to serve in an army under Habsburg authority, nor in paying taxes, nor would they accept any foreign court's jurisdiction; and they had succeeded in securing public peace within their territories reasonably well by themselves. They simply considered the whole proposal a curtailing of their freedom. The Swiss were by far not the only members of the empire who {{refused to accept the}} resolutions, but Maximilian would use their refusal later <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to place the Swiss Confederacy under an imperial ban (Reichsacht).|$|E
25|$|Although most Swedish {{officers}} were skeptical about their chances in fighting the {{larger and more}} experienced Russian army, Gustav Adolf had an unrealistic view of Sweden's ability to defend itself against Russia. In Saint Petersburg, his stubbornness was viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> convenient <b>pretext</b> to occupy Finland, thus pushing the Russo-Swedish frontier considerably {{to the west of}} the Russian capital and safeguarding it in case of any future hostilities between the two powers.|$|R
5|$|The biographer Montague Haltrecht {{suggests}} that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract <b>as</b> <b>a</b> convenient <b>pretext</b> {{to abandon the}} Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden. However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed. He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged {{that he had had}} <b>a</b> lucky escape, <b>as</b> he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{service of}} a process upon a {{non-resident}} will be set aside where the criminal proceedings are instituted against him in bad faith, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ruse or <b>pretext</b> for getting him into the jurisdiction in order to serve him with civil process.|$|R
5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In {{the final days of}} March, Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo.|$|E

5000|$|The {{government}} of Uzbekistan {{is accused of}} unlawful termination of human life and of denying its citizens freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. The government vehemently rebuffs the accusations, maintaining that it merely conducted an anti-terrorist operation, exercising only necessary force. In addition, some officials claim that [...] "an information war on Uzbekistan has been declared" [...] and the human rights violations in Andijan are invented by the enemies of Uzbekistan <b>as</b> <b>a</b> convenient <b>pretext</b> for intervention in the country's internal affairs.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{destruction}} of Vientiane, Laotian affairs were dominated by Siam, although the Vietnamese also involved themselves from over the mountains. It was not until 1884, when France guaranteed Annam the integrity of its territorial domain, that Siamese hegemony over the eastern bank of the Mekong encountered a new challenge. Using Annam's claims to Laotian territories <b>as</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic <b>pretext,</b> France forced Siam to renounce all claims to territory east of the Mekong and even to islands in the river by successive treaties between 1893 and 1907.|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: The Body and its Images in Eighteenth-century Europe {{focuses on}} sculptures, paintings, medical {{treaties}} and philosophical or literary pieces concerning the body during the 18 th century.

5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of the}} canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E
5|$|In 572 the Byzantine ruler JustinII (reigned 565–578) {{refused to}} renew the annual {{payments}} to Sassanid Persia that {{had been part of}} the peace agreement concluded by his uncle, JustinianI (r. 527–565) and the Persian shah KhosrauI (r. 531–579) in 562. This marked the culmination of the progressive deterioration of Byzantine–Persian relations over the previous years, which manifested itself in diplomatic and military manoeuvring in their geopolitical periphery. Thus the Byzantines initiated contacts with the Central Asian Göktürks for a joint effort against Persia, while the Persians intervened in Yemen against the Christian Axumites, allies of Byzantium. Justin furthermore regarded the annual tribute as an indignity unworthy of Romans, and used the outbreak of a major revolt in Persian Armenia in 571–572 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for refusing to continue the payments.|$|E
5|$|In 602 the Roman army {{campaigning in}} the Balkans mutinied under the {{leadership}} of Phocas, who succeeded in seizing the throne and then killed Maurice and his family. Khosrau II used the murder of his benefactor <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretext</b> for war. In {{the early years of the}} war the Persians enjoyed overwhelming and unprecedented success. They were aided by Khosrau's use of a pretender claiming to be Maurice's son, and by the revolt against Phocas led by the Roman general Narses.* GreatrexLieu (2002), II, 183184 In 603 Khosrau defeated and killed the Roman general Germanus in Mesopotamia and laid siege to Dara. Despite the arrival of Roman reinforcements from Europe, he won another victory in 604, while Dara fell after a nine-month siege. Over the following years the Persians gradually overcame the fortress cities of Mesopotamia by siege, one after another.* GreatrexLieu (2002), II, 185186 At the same time they won a string of victories in Armenia and systematically subdued the Roman garrisons in the Caucasus.|$|E
40|$|The Japanese {{government}} has implemented various positive aid sanctions policies in African countries. There {{are two main}} reasons why the Japanese government preferred to use the positive sanctions. Firstly, the Japanese government refrained from taking strict measures against countries that maintain strong economic and diplomatic relations with Japan. Second, even if the Japanese government did take punitive measure against those countries it softened its stance <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>a</b> convenient <b>pretext</b> could be found. All this indicates that policymakers in Japanese government still give priority to Japan’s economic interests. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1637, {{an armed}} revolt arose against Iemitsu's anti-Christian {{policies}} in Shimabara, {{but there were}} other reasons involved, such as overly-high taxation and cruel treatment of peasants by the local lord. The period domestic unrest is known as the Shimabara Rebellion. Thousands were killed in the shogunate's suppression of the revolt and countless more were executed afterwards. The fact that many of the rebels were Christians was used by the Bakufu <b>as</b> <b>a</b> convenient <b>pretext</b> for expelling the Portuguese and restricting the Dutch East India Company to Dejima in Nagasaki.|$|R
40|$|The cliché that {{identifies}} Silvina Ocampo’s literature as fantastic acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> calming <b>pretext</b> which somehow domesticates her oddity. In current critical interpretations, this reductive idea, which was explanatory enough in specific past circumstances, continues to operate, {{even though it}} results clearly inapplicable nowadays. In my view, the most characteristic moments in Ocampo’s narrative are defined by a writing form whose folly disconcerts the reader, rather than by topics and procedures involving the supernatural, abnormal or unreal. In order to read this literature in these new terms, I posit nonsense <b>as</b> <b>a</b> narrative of insensibility, a usage of madness as aesthetics and ethics...|$|R
