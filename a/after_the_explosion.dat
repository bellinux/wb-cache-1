5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> of the Citadel reactor {{from which}} Gordon was {{extracted}} by the G-Man and where Alyx Vance was left behind, time suddenly freezes. Several Vortigaunts appear and rescue Alyx from the blast. After she is rescued, the Vortigaunts {{appear before the}} G-Man and stand between him and Gordon. They teleport Gordon away from the scene, much to the G-Man's displeasure.|$|E
5|$|Efforts began shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> {{to clear}} debris, repair buildings, and {{establish}} temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion. By late January 1918, around 5,000 were still without shelter. A reconstruction committee under Colonel Robert Low constructed 832 new housing units, which were furnished by the Massachusetts-Halifax Relief Fund.|$|E
50|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>explosions,</b> {{perimeter}} security was {{the responsibility of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> <b>the</b> 173rd Airborne Brigade moved to the base to secure the perimeter.|$|R

5|$|Local {{physician}} Dr. J. A. Crum and his wife, a nurse, {{had both}} served in World War I and {{had returned to}} Bath to open a pharmacy. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> they turned their drugstore into a triage center, with the dead bodies being taken to the town hall, which was {{being used as a}} morgue.|$|E
5|$|Soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> Thompson was {{informed}} by an Iowa crewman that the Navy was conducting a dishonest {{investigation into the}} cause of the tragedy. Thompson, a producer for the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, later produced several television reports which disputed the Navy's conclusions as to what had caused the explosion.|$|E
5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It {{was caused by a}} large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} sank {{five days}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> (March 20), in 1200 m {{of water with}} an estimated 1500 t of crude oil remaining on board.|$|R
25|$|The blasts {{blew out}} windows on {{adjacent}} buildings {{but did not}} cause any structural damage. Runners continued to cross the line until 2:57p.m., 8 minutes <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions.</b>|$|R
25|$|This {{time the}} IRA {{boarding}} party {{was composed of}} 12 volunteers. The attack was again launched from the pilot boat based at Moville, and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions,</b> <b>the</b> cargo vessel sank on her starboard side in some 15 meters of water. She was raised and scrapped by November 1982.|$|R
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> Bennington was refloated and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Because of {{the extent}} of the damages and the age of the ship, Bennington was not {{repaired}} but was instead decommissioned on 31 October 1905. After five years of inactivity, Bennington was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 September 1910 and sold for scrap on 14 November. Bennington was not scrapped but was purchased in 1913 by the Matson Line for use as a molasses barge. She was towed to Honolulu and remained in use there from 1913 until 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.|$|E
5|$|For {{ten minutes}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> {{there was no}} firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately {{extinguishing}} fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ending}} cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While {{traveling}} {{down a long}} corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on {{to the core of}} the tower, then a blinding light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.|$|E

5|$|The black {{community}} of Africville, {{on the southern}} shores of Bedford Basin adjacent to the Halifax Peninsula, was spared the direct force of the blast by the shadow effect of the raised ground to the south. However, Africville's small and frail homes were heavily damaged by the explosion. Families recorded the deaths of five residents. Africville received little of the donated relief funds {{and none of the}} progressive reconstruction invested {{in other parts of the}} city <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The day <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> Organisation Todt {{workers were}} {{assigned}} {{to clean up the}} debris and wreckage. On 30 March at 16:30 the torpedoes from MTB 74, which were on a delayed fuse setting, exploded at the old entrance into the basin. This raised alarms among the Germans. The Organisation Todt workers ran away from the dock area. German guards, mistaking their khaki uniforms for British uniforms, opened fire, killing some of them. The Germans also thought that some Commandos were still hiding in the town, and made a street by street search, during which some townspeople were also killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first point}} regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were {{reported}} missing <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> In the aftermath, investigators {{were able to}} locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, {{they were unable to}} determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E
5000|$|Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich visited <b>the</b> site <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> on 28 February {{and called}} <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> [...] "a terrible tragedy for Russia {{and for our}} coal industry". <b>The</b> <b>explosion</b> was {{considered}} to be the deadliest in Russia's mining industry since the 2010 Raspadskaya mine explosion which killed 91 workers.|$|R

5|$|The oil {{terminal}} supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, {{and because}} of the fire, the airport had to start rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at Stansted Airport or other European airports to refuel, while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warren was {{personally}} responsible for the safety aspects of the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico. There was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours. Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren could get some rest. Fortunately, no problems arose with the test.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> day <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions,</b> {{four other}} Communist schools were raided by police for {{suspected}} bomb-making, namely the Heung To Middle School, Hon Wah Middle School, Fukien Middle School, and the Mongkok Workers' Children School.|$|R
25|$|As seen on video, the {{suspects}} stayed to observe <b>the</b> chaos <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions,</b> then walked away casually. The public sent authorities a deluge of photographs and videos, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public social networks.|$|R

Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions,</b> Abrini was filmed {{walking away from the}} airport towards the city center.|$|R
5|$|Cassidy Sharp (voiced by Jennifer Hale): The game's {{first female}} protagonist. Cassidy is the agent who {{attempts}} to stop Jericho {{on the train}} in the game's opening sequence. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> of Lazarus' prison, she joins Jericho but is soon murdered by Lazarus. Cassidy returns as a good ghost and befriends Jericho, aiding him in his mission to stop Lazarus (a role similar to this of Cortana in the Halo series). As a little girl, Cassidy was orphaned in a vampire attack and then raised as a ward of the Darkwatch. Eventually, she became the most serious and dangerous agent in the organisation, yet really she is also deeply insecure about herself. If fought as the final boss, she turns into an angel.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{one year}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> of Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida for spring break with her friends, Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman. On route, Kimberly has a premonition of logs falling off a semi, causing a massive car {{accident}} that kills everyone involved. She stalls her {{car on the}} entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis; widow Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim; businesswoman Kat Jennings; stoner Rory Peters; pregnant Isabella Hudson; high school teacher Eugene Dix; and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke. While Thomas questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs. Shaina, Dano and Frankie are killed by a speeding truck, but Kimberly is saved by Thomas.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance {{for the help}} that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} immediately after the disaster. That gift was revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston's support <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> The gift was later {{taken over by the}} Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston's official Christmas tree and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.|$|E
25|$|Forensic {{teams and}} police {{investigators}} {{arrived at the}} crime scene soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions.</b> <b>The</b> head of the magisterial inquiry was to be Magistrate Consuelo Scerri Herrera, who had fought a legal battle with Caruana Galizia in 2010–11. Caruana Galizia's family successfully challenged her role in the investigation citing no confidence in the magistrate. Scerri Herrera abstained from the investigation 17 hours later and was replaced by Magistrate Anthony Vella.|$|R

50|$|Immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosions,</b> <b>the</b> {{remainder}} of the flotilla attempted to rescue <b>the</b> crew. Just <b>after</b> 20:00, Max Schultz exploded and sank, probably striking a mine. What followed was confusion. There were many erroneous reports of air attack, submarines detected and torpedoes; ships dashed back and forth. Theodor Riedel dropped depth charges on a supposed submarine and <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> temporarily jammed its rudder.|$|R
