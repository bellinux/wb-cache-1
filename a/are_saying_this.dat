500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and Brown, and was filmed in August 2012. On August 29, 2012 Brown released an image from the shoot, showing himself seated {{on the floor of}} an abandoned room in an unbuttoned jacket. On September 11, 2012 Brown released a similar image, tweeting, [...] "'Don't Judge Me' video coming soon!". The video premiered on Vimeo on September 27, 2012. It begins with Brown walking through the desert, while intercut scenes of himself sitting in front of a couch (with his girlfriend, played by Runa Lucienne, sleeping behind him) are shown. As the chorus begins for the first time, Brown is seen catching a ride from an army truck. He eventually arrives at an army base to prepare for a [...] "suicide mission", which involves him riding a spacecraft into outer space to save the world from an alien ship invading Earth. A news reporter at the base (Brown's girlfriend) runs to him with the question, [...] "People <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> is a suicide mission, why are you doing this?" [...] Brown replies, [...] "I'm doing a service for my country and my planet. If that means saving the people I love and I care about, then that's what I'll do." [...] As the spacecraft takes off, tears run down Brown's face before the spacecraft crashes into the alien ship, killing him. Brown and his girlfriend are then shown, hugging on the couch.|$|E

60|$|They <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> as they surge out {{in great}} waves of furs and silks, with black crush hats {{floating}} on billows of white wraps among the foam of gossamer scarfs.

6000|$|... 'I know,' said Karenin at last, 'that {{many people}} <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing. I {{know that there}} is a vast release of love-making in the world. This great wave of {{decoration}} and elaboration that has gone about the world, this Efflorescence, has of course laid hold of that. I know that when you say that the world is set free, you interpret that to mean that the world is set free for love-making. Down there,--under the clouds, the lovers foregather. I know your songs, Kahn, your half-mystical songs, in which you represent this old hard world dissolving into a luminous haze of love--sexual love.... I don't think you are right or true in that. You are a young, imaginative man, and you see life--ardently--with the eyes of youth. But the power that has brought man into these high places under this blue-veiled blackness of the sky and which beckons us on towards the immense and awful future of our race, is riper and deeper and greater than any such emotions....|$|E
6000|$|Though he had thus {{spoken to}} his father of his blasted hopes in regard to Mary Lowther, he had not as yet {{signified}} his consent to the measure by which their engagement was to be brought altogether to an end. The question {{had come to be}} discussed widely among their friends, as is the custom with such questions in such circumstances, and Mary had been told from all sides that she was bound to give it up,--that she was bound to give it up for her own sake, and more especially for his; that the engagement, if continued, would never lead to a marriage, and that it would in the meantime be absolutely ruinous to her,--and to him. Parson John came up and spoke to her with a strength for which she had not hitherto given Parson John credit. Her Aunt Sarah was very gentle with her, but never veered from her opinion that the engagement must of necessity be abandoned. Mr. Fenwick wrote to her a letter full of love and advice, and Mrs. Fenwick made a journey to Loring to discuss the matter with her. The discussion between them was very long. [...] "If you <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> on my account," [...] said Mary, [...] "it is quite useless." ...|$|E

5000|$|An IHH {{board member}} responded in the Los Angeles Times that IHH {{provides}} charity {{in more than}} 100 countries. He stated there was no proof that IHH has any connections to Al Qaeda or its affiliates, and also said that its involvement with Bosnia and Chechnya amounted to food, clothes and medicine. Those who [...] "accuse us of terrorism are {{the very people who}} kill innocent victims," [...] said Ali Cihangir, an IHH board member, referring to the Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara that left nine Turkish activists dead.

[...] The film showed that film-level special effects could be produced by the common fan. Macomber and Thomas said they had [...] "taken a few calls" [...] from Hollywood effects houses after the film premiered.|$|E

5000|$|Bart Ehrman, in an {{interview}} with the Fortean Times, was similarly asked for his views on the work of Freke and Gandy. Not having read their work, he responded by commenting on the thesis, [...] "This is an old argument, even though it shows up every 10 years or so. This current craze that Christianity was a mystery religion like these other mystery religions-the people who <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> are almost always people who know nothing about the mystery religions; they've read a few popular books, but they're not scholars of mystery religions. The reality is, we know very little about mystery religions-the whole point of mystery religions is that they're secret! So I think it's crazy to build on ignorance in order to make a claim like this." ...|$|E
5000|$|In October 2013, ProgressNow Colorado {{released}} a controversial series of advertisements promoting Obamacare. According to the Denver Post, one advertisement [...] "features a woman flashing a thumbs {{up with one}} hand and holding a packet of birth-control pills in the other. She is wrapped in a man's arm next to text that includes the sentence 'Let's hope he's as easy to get as this birth control.'" [...] In response to inquiries about whether taxpayer funding was used for the advertising campaign, the executive director of ProgressNow Colorado said, [...] "I know some people <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> is a taxpayer-funded campaign...but that is just not the case." [...] ProgressNow said the series of advertisements was paid for with donations and individual contributions, and the organization denied association with state agencies.|$|E
5000|$|As a caricaturist {{for these}} publications, Levine {{distinguished}} his process {{from that of}} political cartoonists: [...] "I could take time to really look it over and think about it, read the articles and so on. The political cartoonists don't get a chance. The headlines <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> and this about so-and-so, {{and you have to}} come up with something which is approved by an editor. I almost never had to get an approval. In forty years I may have run into a disagreement with The New York Review maybe two times." [...] However, as his son Matthew Levine wrote in 1979, on at least three occasions The New York Times refused to print works it had specifically commissioned David Levine to draw for its Op-Ed page, including cartoons of Henry Kissinger, Richard Nixon, and former New York mayor Ed Koch.|$|E

50|$|Socioeconomic {{disadvantages}} {{have created}} unequal differences among educational attainments {{for children and}} families from various socioeconomic backgrounds. Differences between parent to child dialogue differs in homes of Low to High SES families. In homes of low SES children, there tends to be less direct conversation with the child, fewer opportunities of book reading and much less time shared between child and parent about the same subject or event. This lack of dialogue slows the understanding of Syntax as children receive less opportunities to learn and understand the arrangement of their language. In homes of high SES children, mothers tend to speak more freely with their children about emotions and feelings, as well as attempt to directly follow up with what their children <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>This</b> proper and consistent verbal stimulation may add to a stronger verbal development than children from low SES families.|$|E
5000|$|Informal {{cooperative}} learning consists of having students {{work together to}} achieve a joint learning goal in temporary groups that last from {{a few minutes to}} one class period. [...] The students take part in focused discussions before and after the lesson and interspersing pair discussions throughout the lesson. Informal {{cooperative learning}} ensures students are actively involved in understanding what is being presented. It is also useful to set a mood conducive to learning, help set expectations, provide closure to an instructional session and precue the next session. [...] Moreover during the informal cooperative learning techniques, teachers have time to move around the class listening to what students <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>This</b> can give instructors insight into how well students understand the material, as well as being behavior that increases the individual accountability of each student participating in the discussions.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{people in}} the {{worldwide}} parkour community also accused UF of distorting the image of parkour, associating it with the flips and artistic movements of freerunning and tricking. Because of this, in 2006 many UF team members walked out. Some critics have even {{gone as far as}} making public demonstrations against Urban Freeflow, such as burning UF memorabilia.Furthermore, Urban Freeflow was criticized for organizing freerunning competitions sponsored by Barclaycard. The critics believed that freerunning, like parkour, should be a non-competitive activity. There are also complaints of the corporate nature of the event, many freerunning sites saying that the introduction of merchandising and sponsorships would compromise {{the true nature of the}} sport. To this one of the founders of Urban Freeflow, Ez has replied [...] "The people who <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>this</b> are the ones who don't have any sponsorship,". However many people practicing parkour and freerunning believe that they are [...] "free" [...] disciplines and they don't belong to corporations, sponsors and medias.Sébastien Foucan has since commented on the matter, that free running is about following your 'own way,' and though he himself does not personally believe in competition, others might believe that to be their 'way.' ...|$|E
