40|$|How {{does one}} make <b>acquaintances?</b> A simple {{observation}} from everyday {{experience is that}} often one of our <b>acquaintances</b> introduces us {{to one of his}} <b>acquaintances.</b> Such a simple triangle interaction may be viewed as the basis of the evolution of many social networks. Here, it is demonstrated that this assumption is sufficient to reproduce major non-trivial features of social networks: Short path length, high clustering, and scale-free or exponential link distributions.

40|$|Relationships among self-construal, self-efficacy, {{and group}} {{behaviors}} during a group problem-solving task {{with friends and}} <b>acquaintances</b> were hypothesized. The sample comprised 126 students in Grades 8 – 11, from 5 randomly selected government high schools, organized into 42 groups. Data collection involved self-reports and observations. Self-report data measured self-construal, self-efficacy for working with friends, and self-efficacy for working with <b>acquaintances,</b> and the observational data captured salient student behaviors. Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and multilevel modeling. Self-efficacy for working with <b>acquaintances</b> {{was related to the}} development of ideas and also the critical review of ideas in groups. This study provides insights into the relatively underexplored phenomena of group work with friends and <b>acquaintances...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bengali film actor Prosenjit Chatterjee {{encouraged}} Ghosh {{to shoot}} in Kolkata.

5|$|His {{library and}} {{collections}} {{were left to}} his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried {{to sell it to}} Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an <b>acquaintance</b> of his agreed to buy the collection. The <b>acquaintance</b> was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} cross-cultural differences in interpersonal closeness {{to different people}} and whether these differences {{can be explained by}} independent and interdependent self-construal. Turkish and Euro-Canadian samples of university students were asked to indicate how close they feel and how close they ideally would like to be to family members, romantic partners, friends, and <b>acquaintances.</b> As predicted, Turkish participants scored higher on interdependent self-construal, whereas there was no culture difference on independent self-construal scores. Turkish participants rated their actual and ideal closeness with others higher than Euro-Canadian participants did. Both Turkish and Euro-Canadian participants reported feeling closest and ideally wanting to be closest to their romantic partner, and then to their families and friends, followed by <b>acquaintances.</b> Turkish participants desired more closeness with family members and <b>acquaintances</b> than Euro-Canadian participants did. Interdependent self-construal was found to partially mediate the relationships between culture and actual closeness scores for family, friends, and <b>acquaintances</b> and between culture and ideal scores for family and <b>acquaintances...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Given that {{starters}} {{knew only}} the target recipient's name and address, {{they had a}} seemingly impossible task. Milgram monitored the progress of each chain via returned [...] "tracer" [...] postcards, which allowed him to track the progression of each letter. Surprisingly, {{he found that the}} very first folder reached the target in just four days and took only two intermediate <b>acquaintances.</b> Overall, Milgram reported that chains varied in length from two to ten intermediate <b>acquaintances,</b> with a median of five intermediate <b>acquaintances</b> (i.e. six degrees of separation) between the original sender and the destination recipient.|$|R
5000|$|During Pollard's trial, the U.S. government's {{memorandum}} in aid of sentencing {{challenged the}} [...] "defendant's {{claim that he}} was motivated by altruism rather than greed". The government said that Pollard had [...] "disclosed classified information in anticipation of financial gain" [...] in other instances:The government's investigation has revealed that defendant provided to certain of his <b>acquaintances</b> U.S. classified documents which defendant obtained through U.S. Navy sources. The classified documents which defendant disclosed to two such <b>acquaintances,</b> {{both of whom are}} professional investment advisers, contained classified economic and political analyses which defendant believed would help his <b>acquaintances</b> render investment advice to their clients... Defendant acknowledged that, although he was not paid for his unauthorized disclosures of classified information to the above-mentioned <b>acquaintances,</b> he hoped to be rewarded ultimately through business opportunities that these individuals could arrange for defendant when he eventually left his position with the U.S. Navy. In fact, defendant was involved in an ongoing business venture with two of these <b>acquaintances</b> at the time he provided the classified information to them...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have also been}} put forward to explain the derivation of Bunbury, and Bunburying, which {{are used in the}} play to imply a secretive double life. It may have derived from Henry Shirley Bunbury, a hypochondriacal <b>acquaintance</b> of Wilde's youth. Another suggestion, put forward in 1913 by Aleister Crowley, who knew Wilde, was that Bunbury was a combination word: that Wilde had once taken a train to Banbury, met a schoolboy there, and arranged a second secret meeting with him at Sunbury.|$|E

5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} cigars {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S.

5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547.

Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E
