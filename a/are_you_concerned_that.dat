Are you scared that one day a {{colleague}} will ask you the data/results of a paper, and you will have to excavate them out of a folder named 'allDataResultsVersion 8 bFinalizedRecheckedPleaseEnd'? 	 	 	<b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> your contributions will not have much impact, because people {{may not be able to}} access them properly? 	 If yes, you are in the same shoes with me, when I started my PhD! In this talk, I present how I embraced reproducibility to avoid some of these common problems. I explain some best practices, simple tricks and habits I have learned throughout my doctoral research, which improved the quality of my research, made it reusable by others (and myself), and hence improved the accessibility and visibility of my work. I give practical examples in where I failed (and then gradually improved) on organizing, developing, versioning, documenting, licensing and publishing the research material (data, code, experimental setups and results etc.). I also introduce some of the available software tools and services, which would help you to achieve these goals. I hope that this talk will convince you to consider reproducibility as a major criteria in academic research, and give you a head start on achieving this objective...|$|E

My hands tingled to strike him, as if I had been a man! I only kept them quiet by tearing his card to pieces under my shawl. Without saying a word on my side, I walked away from the house (for fear of Laura seeing us), and he followed, protesting softly all the way. In the first by-street I turned, and asked him what he wanted with me. He wanted two things. First, if I had no objection, to express his sentiments. I declined to hear them. Secondly, to repeat the warning in his letter. I asked, what occasion there was for repeating it. He bowed and smiled, and said he would explain. The explanation exactly confirmed the fears I expressed before you left us. I told you, if you remember, that Sir Percival would be too headstrong to take his friend's advice where <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned,</b> and <b>that</b> there was no danger to be dreaded from the Count till his own interests were threatened, and he was roused into acting for himself?" ...|$|R

It is usually spread through the air from someone with the infectious type of TB. The germ gets into the air when that person coughs, sneezes or spits. Who can get TB? Anyone can get TB {{but it is difficult to}} catch. It mainly depends on the amount of time that is spent in contact with someone with infectious TB. What if I have been in close contact with someone with infectious TB? If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> identified as a contact at risk from TB then <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> invited for screening. Initial screening consists of a skin test to determine if your immune system recognises TB. The skin test is called the Mantoux test, the result of which needs to be read 48 hours later. People who have a positive skin test and / or evidence of TB infection found on chest X-ray, or who are unwell will be investigated further by a specialist doctor and may be treated with a course of anti-TB medication. How is TB treated? TB is curable. Treatment consists of a long course of different types of specialist antibiotics. What happens next?

50|$|In 2004, {{following}} more {{complaints from}} the MAMA campaign and Mr Clark, Professor Southall {{was found guilty}} of serious professional misconduct by the General Medical Council (GMC), after alleging to a police child protection officer that the husband of Sally Clark, a mother convicted of murdering two of her babies, was himself almost certainly responsible for murdering the couple's children. Professor Southall made the claim in confidence to a child protection officer of the Staffordshire police after watching a television documentary about the case as he was concerned about the safety of the surviving child. He subsequently presented his evidence to a formally convened child protection case conference, members of which expressed their view at a GMC hearing that his input was important. Despite this a GMC panel banned Professor Southall from child protection work for three years. The Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence challenged the decision as insufficient and argued that he should be deregistered, but a High Court of Justice decision in 2005 held that the sanction was not unduly lenient.In the General Medical Council’s (GMC) subsequent publication: Protecting children and young people: the responsibilities of all doctors July 2012 and active 3 September 2012, there is the following statement: “You must tell an appropriate agency, such as your local authority children’s services, the NSPCC or the police, promptly if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> a child or young person is at risk of, or is suffering, abuse or neglect unless it is not in their best interests to do so (see paragraphs 39 and 40). You {{do not need to be}} certain that the child or young person is at risk of significant harm to take this step. If a child or young person is at risk of, or is suffering, abuse or neglect, the possible consequences of not sharing relevant information will, in the overwhelming majority of cases, outweigh any harm <b>that</b> sharing your <b>concerns</b> with an appropriate agency might cause”.|$|R

40|$|Imagine that a {{scientist}} {{from the state}} university asks {{you and your family}} to participate in a study on a particular gene variant associated with alcoholism. The project focuses on your ethnic group, the Tracy Islanders, who have a higher incidence of alcoholism, as well as a higher incidence of the gene variant, than the general population. <b>You</b> will not <b>be</b> informed whether <b>you</b> have the gene variant, but your participation in the study might help scientists develop drugs to help individuals control their addiction to alcohol. You {{have a family history of}} alcoholism, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> your twenty-one-year-old son may be susceptible to the condition as well. Do you agree to participate in the study? Now imagine that, with your participation, the study concludes that Tracy Islanders with the particular gene variant have a ten percent chance of becoming alcoholics, whereas Tracy Islanders without the gene variant have only a five percent chance. Although the scientists are careful to note that the gene variant exists in the general population and is not 2 ̆ 2 the cause 2 ̆ 2 of alcoholism, the sound-bite reported by the media is that Tracy Islanders are hardwired to become alcoholics. That same day, your son gets drunk at a bar and pushes an off-duty police officer through a window, killing him. Your son is charged with murder, and his lawyer wants to use his genetic predisposition toward alcoholism as a defense. Some members of your family and community are <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> this approach will only further stigmatize Tracy Islanders as alcoholics. How do you advise your son and his lawyer? These scenarios were presented to a panel of scientists, legal experts, journalists, and community leaders in a recent PBS television program entitled [*pg 344] Genes on Trial: Genetics, Behavior, and the Law. 1 This article uses the television program as a framework for exploring the implications of behavioral genetics research for the individual, family, community, and society. In particular, it focuses on the unique potential for behavioral genetics research, when placed in the context of criminal law, to stigmatize racial and ethnic minority groups through the blame-shifting mechanisms of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism. Like the scarlet 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 in Nathaniel Hawthorne 2 ̆ 7 s famous novel, 2 DNA associated with criminal or antisocial behavior might become a 2 ̆ 2 scarlet gene 2 ̆ 2 that marks the individual, his family, and his racial or ethnic community as 2 ̆ 2 flawed, compromised, and somehow less than fully human. 2 ̆ 23 This article proceeds in six parts. The remainder of Part I summarizes the Genes on Trial program and introduces the issues raised by it. Part II explains why behavioral genetics research tends to focus on discrete and insular populations that overlap with socially constructed racial or ethnic groups. Part III locates behavioral genetics research on a spectrum spanning from single-gene disorders to complex behavioral traits, positing that the behavioral end of the spectrum carries the most potential for stigma. Part IV explores how the blame-shifting mechanisms of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism affect the individual, family, community, and society when genetics research focuses on criminal or antisocial behavior. Part V analyzes how racial and ethnic stigma arise from behavioral genetics research and perpetuate inequality. Part VI concludes by considering the ethical dilemmas that geneticists face when choosing who and what to study...|$|R
