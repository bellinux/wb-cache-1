5|$|December 2001: During {{the opening}} {{stages of the}} war in Afghanistan {{launched}} following the September 11 attacks, the U.S. and its allies believed that bin Laden was hiding in the rugged mountains at Tora Bora. Despite overrunning the Taliban <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> positions, they failed to capture or kill him.|$|E
5|$|These units linked {{up several}} times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy. One such battle {{happened}} during Operation Anaconda the mission to squeeze life out of a Taliban <b>and</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> stronghold dug deep into the Shah-i-Kot mountains of eastern Afghanistan. The operation was seen {{as one of the}} heaviest and bloodiest fights in the War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Al-Balawi was a Jordanian {{doctor and}} {{jihadist}} website writer who was detained and interrogated over three days by the Jordanian intelligence service, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), in January 2009. The GID and the CIA {{thought they had}} turned al-Balawi to penetrate al-Qaeda in the Pakistani tribal areas to provide intelligence for high-level targets. Instead, al-Balawi used this trust {{to gain access to}} the CIA base in Afghanistan unsearched and perpetrate the attack. The Pakistani Taliban <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> claimed responsibility, saying they helped al-Balawi with the attack.|$|E

50|$|Clashes erupted {{between the}} Pakistani troops <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda's</b> <b>and</b> other militants joined by local rebels and pro-Taliban forces. The Pakistani actions were {{presented}} {{as a part of}} the War on Terrorism, and had connections to the war and Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. However, the offensive was poorly coordinated and the Pakistani Army suffered heavy casualties as well public support for the attack quickly evaporated.|$|R
5|$|In 2003 {{and into}} 2004, the brigade {{deployed}} {{for the first}} time to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. As the only aviation brigade in the theater, the brigade provided air support for all U.S. Army units operating in the country. The brigade's mission at that time focused on close air support, medevac missions, and other duties involving combat with Taliban <b>and</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> forces in the country. The brigade returned to Fort Drum in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban <b>and</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|In May, Jarrah {{received}} a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, arriving in Florida in June 2000. There, he began taking flying lessons {{as well as}} training in hand-to-hand combat. Jarrah maintained contact with his girlfriend in Germany and {{with his family in}} Lebanon in the months preceding the attacks. This close contact upset Mohamed Atta, the tactical leader of the plot, <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> planners may have considered another operative, Zacarias Moussaoui, to replace him if he backed out.|$|E
25|$|It was the {{dedicated}} and unflinching faith of these commanders in their cause {{that the most}} resilient <b>and</b> tenacious <b>Al-Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> Taliban elements were defeatead and annihilated from the restive Valley of Bajuar.|$|R

5|$|In late 1999, a {{group of}} men from Hamburg, Germany arrived in Afghanistan, {{including}} Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak English, and had experience living in the West. New recruits were routinely screened for special skills <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot's license. Mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in Western clothing.|$|E
5|$|The drone attacks {{carried out}} by the CIA in Pakistan rely on local informants, who can cross the border into Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base were involved in the coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Pakistani Taliban <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda.</b> At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first {{presented}} it to Osama bin Laden in 1996. At that time, bin Laden <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> were {{in a period of}} transition, having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan. The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.|$|E
50|$|The LIFG {{links to}} Al-Qaeda hail from Afghanistan, where {{hundreds}} joined Al-Qaeda. High ranking LIFG operatives inside Al-Qaeda, are {{the leader of}} the insurgency Abdel-Hakim Belhadj (also known as Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq), and the recently killed Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was killed in a CIA drone strike, <b>and</b> <b>Al-Qaeda's</b> Abu Yahya al-Libi.|$|R

50|$|However, al-Qaeda Central {{has never}} officially {{accepted}} Boko Haram as an affiliate, {{and after the}} Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping, al-Qaeda did not praise Boko Haram, leading some analysts {{to conclude that the}} group was too violent for <b>al-Qaeda.</b> The form <b>and</b> structure of <b>al-Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> its affiliates remains a matter of debate within the US Intelligence Community, and the exact current status of ties between Boko Haram <b>and</b> the <b>al-Qaeda</b> organization remains unclear.|$|R
5|$|In summer 2003, the TF Warrior {{returned}} to Afghanistan, relieving TF Devil from the 82nd Airborne Division for Operation Enduring Freedom IV. For more than 6 months, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the}} country such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban <b>and</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote {{regions of the country}} to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number of humanitarian missions.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 2001, the War in Afghanistan {{began when}} U.S. and British forces {{initiated}} aerial bombing campaigns targeting Taliban <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> camps, then later invaded Afghanistan with ground {{troops of the}} Special Forces. This {{eventually led to the}} overthrow of the Taliban rule of Afghanistan with the Fall of Kandahar on December 7, 2001, by U.S. led coalition forces. Conflict in Afghanistan between the Taliban insurgency and the Afghan forces backed by NATO Resolute Support Mission is ongoing. The Philippines and Indonesia, among other nations with their own internal conflicts with Islamic terrorism, also increased their military readiness.|$|E
50|$|Mohamed was a {{major in}} the Egyptian army's {{military}} intelligence unit, until being discharged for suspected fundamentalism in 1984. He enlisted in the U.S. Army and used U.S. military information to train <b>al-Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> other Muslim militants, <b>and</b> write <b>al-Qaeda's</b> multivolume terrorist training guide.|$|R
50|$|The war {{on terror}} began and once again the corps began to {{undertake}} duty on the western borders, catching <b>and</b> neutralising <b>Al-Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> Taliban operatives, although {{it has not been}} involved to such an extent as the XI Corps. The operations continue to this day.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Department of the Treasury, at {{the behest}} of India, has {{designated}} Makki as a Specially Designated National. It has announced a reward of $2 million through its Rewards for Justice Program for information leading to the location of Makki. [...] Makki is alleged to be in proximity to Taliban's supreme commander Mullah Omar <b>and</b> <b>Al-Qaeda's</b> Ayman al-Zawahiri.|$|R
5|$|The NATO council {{declared}} {{the attacks on}} the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter. This marked the first invocation of Article 5, which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind. Australian Prime Minister John Howard who was in Washington D.C. during the attacks invoked Article IV of the ANZUS treaty. The Bush administration announced a War on Terror, with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists, and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents <b>and</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in August 2005 an Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of}} Operation Slipper, operating in the southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG, based on similar structure deployed during Operation Falconer, {{was made up of}} elements from the SASR, a commando company and a troop from the Incident Response Regiment. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were {{deployed to}} Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. During this deployment the Commandos were involved in Operation Perth which resulted in the death of over 150 Taliban <b>and</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> fighters in nine days of fierce fighting in the Chora district of Uruzgan Province. The SFTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in September 2006 and replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days and involved in 139 contacts and sustained 11 soldiers wounded.|$|E
