500|$|Favorable {{reviews of}} Eragon often {{focused on the}} book's {{characters}} and plot. IGN's Matt Casamassina called the book [...] "entertaining", and added that [...] "Paolini demonstrates that he understands how to hold the reader's eyes {{and this is what}} ultimately separates Eragon from countless other me-too fantasy novels." [...] Chris Lawrence of About.com thought the book had all the [...] "traditional ingredients" [...] that make a fantasy novel [...] "enjoyable". The book was a [...] "fun read" [...] for him because it is [...] "quick and exciting" [...] and [...] "packed" [...] with action and magic.

[...] On October 3, 2013, during an interview with Rap-Up, Pusha T revealed that it was actually the son of Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich who produced the song, saying [...] "Joaquin Phoenix gave the beat to 'Ye, so when I got the beat from 'Ye, it was, Yo, Joaquin gave me this beat.

500|$|One direct death {{occurred}} in North Carolina; {{a young girl}} was killed when a tree fell on her Currituck County home. Throughout eastern portions of the state, trees and powerlines were downed, and {{there were reports of}} structural damage. Numerous docks, piers and bulkheads were either damaged or destroyed, including the Iron Steamer and Indian Beach piers, which both lost large sections to the strong wind and surf. Due to the winds, the Brunswick Community Hospital lost about [...] of roof and an air conditioner. The storm left about 500,000 people in the state without electric power. In some areas, vegetative and structural debris accumulated in piles several feet deep; it is reported that thick underbrush prevented the debris from traveling further inland. Wilmington [...] "turned into a disaster zone", with flooded highways, and downed trees lying across roadways. Crop, particularly tobacco, damage was extensive. According to then-governor Jim Hunt, [...] "You fly along and don't see much damage to the beach houses, and it's easy to think we didn't have much damage. But then you look at the tobacco in fields <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> damage has been extensive." [...] The crop losses accounted for much of the overall damage. Forty-seven of those who failed to evacuate in time sought shelter in the Bald Head Island lighthouse as the worst of the storm bore down. Despite the effects, Bonnie's impact was actually less than originally predicted. Overall, property damage in the state is estimated at $240million (1998 USD), with significantly higher crop damages.|$|E

2500|$|A {{common thread}} in the {{argument}} against VSU {{is the notion}} of a campus culture, or the university experience. University has traditionally been a time of broadening horizons, socialising, and political activism. Opponents argue that VSU makes it more difficult for students to have high quality sports grounds, lively music and social venues, and the resources necessary to mount protests and political campaigns, leading to moribund campuses. This was a view expressed by Senator Barnaby Joyce who said the original VSU legislation could lead to [...] "unnecessary collateral damage against sporting facilities and other vital parts of university infrastructure, and we can get rid of compulsory student unionism without affecting you know, the sporting clubs <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> childcare facilities" [...] Proponents counter that the free-market system rewards venues and establishments which students enjoy and value, and that it lets students choose their own level of contribution to a political cause.|$|E

Burroughs felt vindicated by the settlement. [...] "I'm not at all sorry that I wrote it. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> suit settled – it settled in my favor.

Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway.
