40|$|Background: This {{study was}} carried out in various {{hospitals}} to analyze the use of rational fixed dose combinations (FDCs) in Pune. Methods: 279 prescriptions were evaluated in this study. Information about age, sex, names of the all the drugs prescribed by doctor/ physician, diagnosis for the use of prescriptions and adverse effects were noted in the audit form from the prescriptions of the patients. Rationality of fixed dose combination is evaluated according to WHO Model List of Essential Drugs, 17 th updated version, 2011. Results: 56. 98 % doctor&# 8217;s prescriptions in this study were containing of fixed dose combinations and out of this 10. 69 % prescriptions were including two or more FDCs in their prescriptions. Only 13. 20 % FDCs were in accordance with WHO Model List of Essential Drugs. FDCs from antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products, vitamins, minerals, <b>antianaemic</b> <b>preparations,</b> drugs for acid related disorders, antibacterials for systemic use and cough and cold preparations were used more by private non teaching hospitals as compared to SKNMC & GH teaching hospital. 64. 61 % prescriptions of private hospitals and 34. 08 % prescriptions of teaching hospital were containing more than one drug. Conclusions: This study has shown that about every alternate prescription contains FDC. More than 80 % of prescribed FDCs are not in accordance with Essential Drugs List. Vitamins, minerals, antianaemic preparation FDCs should be prescribed judiciously as they are not free from ADRs. More number of drugs (poly-pharmacy) and FDCs were prescribed by non teaching private hospitals. [Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol 2013; 2 (1. 000) : 61 - 68...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{process of}} obtaining a {{complete}} medication history for patients {{admitted to the}} hospital from the ED at hospital admission, without discrepancies,is error prone and time consuming. Objectives: The goal of this study was the development of a clinical decision rule (CDR) with a high positive predictive value in detecting ED patients admitted to hospital at risk of at least one discrepancy during regular medication history acquisition, along with favourable feasibility considering time and budget constraints. Methods: Data were based on a previous prospective study conducted at the ED in Belgium, describing discrepancies in 3592 medication histories. Data were split into a training and a validation set. A model predicting the number of discrepancies was derived from the training set with negative binomial regression and was validated on the validation set. The performance of the model was assessed. Several CDRs were constructed and evaluated on positive predictive value and alert rate. Results: The following variables were retained in the prediction model: (1) age, (2) gender, (3) medical discipline for which the patient was admitted, (4) degree of physician training, (5) season of admission, (6) type of care before admission, number of (7) drugs, (8) high-risk drugs, (9) drugs acting on alimentary tract and metabolism, (10) antithrombotics, antihaemorrhagics and <b>antianaemic</b> <b>preparations,</b> (11) cardiovascular drugs, (12) drugs acting on musculoskeletal system and (13) drugs acting on the nervous system; all recorded by the ED physician on admission. The final CDR resulted in an alert rate of 29 % with a positive predictive value of 74 %. Conclusion: The final CDR allows identification of the majority of patients with a potential discrepancy within a feasible workload for the pharmacy staff. Our CDR is a first step towards a rule that could be incorporated into electronic medical records or a scoring system. status: publishe...|$|E
