The {{factors that influence}} the seal of a miniature Wankel compressor mainly include axial double mechanical <b>seal</b> and <b>apex</b> <b>seals.</b> Axial mechanical seal depends on machining precision on the end face. In the compression cavity, the springs for seal flake on the Wankel rotor put pressure on cylinder,which generates the desired amount of pressing force.

25|$|Although in two {{dimensions}} the seal system of a Wankel {{looks to be}} even simpler {{than that of a}} corresponding multi-cylinder piston engine, in three dimensions the opposite is true.

50|$|The {{rotor housing}} {{was made of}} sand-cast {{aluminum}} plated with chrome, while the aluminum sides were sprayed with molten carbon steel for strength.

25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion <b>sealing</b> utilised <b>Apex,</b> corner and side seals. At the three rotor <b>apexes,</b> tip <b>sealing</b> was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. <b>Apex</b> <b>seals</b> were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle. Primary power transfer to the clutch and transmission is by duplex chain.|$|R

25|$|On some Wankel engines the sump oil remains {{uncontaminated}} by {{the combustion}} process, so no oil changes are required.

50|$|The {{very first}} Mazda Cosmo {{prototype}} used a 798 cc L8A two-rotor Wankel. The engine and car were both {{shown at the}} 1963 Tokyo Motor Show. Hollow cast iron <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> reduced vibration by changing their resonance frequency and thus eliminated chatter marks. It used dry-sump lubrication. Rotor radius was up from the 40A to 98 mm (3.9 in), but depth dropped to 56 mm (2.2 in).|$|R
2500|$|The {{problem of}} {{clearance}} for hot rotor apexes passing between the axially closer side housings {{in the cooler}} intake lobe areas was dealt with by using an axial rotor pilot radially inboard of the oils seals, plus improved inertia oil cooling of the rotor interior ( [...] C-W , C.

50|$|The sealing {{elements}} were too fragile, as designed by Wankel, {{but the basic}} principle of using a pressure actuated cylindrical pin at each apex of the rotor was recognized. Making the trochoid profile “oversized”, by the radius of the <b>apex</b> <b>seal</b> tip, was recognized as essential to seal, in three planes, and this was retained unchanged, but made heavier initially, and later changed to more rugged Curtiss-Wright patented designs that still retained the cylindrical pin.|$|E

25|$|In Britain, Norton Motorcycles {{developed}} a Wankel rotary engine for motorcycles, {{based on the}} Sachs air-cooled rotor Wankel that powered the DKW/Hercules W-2000 motorcycle, this two-rotor engine was included in their Commander and F1. Norton improved on the Sachs's air cooling, introducing a plenum chamber. Suzuki also made a production motorcycle powered by a Wankel engine, the RE-5, using ferroTiC alloy <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> and an NSU rotor in a successful attempt to prolong the engine's life.|$|R
25|$|Among the alloys {{cited for}} Wankel housing use are A-132, Inconel 625, and 356 treated to T6 hardness. Several {{materials}} {{have been used}} for plating the housing working surface, Nikasil being one. Citroen, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, A P Grazen and others applied for patents in this field. For the <b>apex</b> <b>seals,</b> the choice of materials has evolved along with the experience gained, from carbon alloys, to steel, ferrotic, and other materials. The combination between housing plating and <b>apex</b> and side <b>seals</b> materials was determined experimentally, to obtain the best duration of both seals and housing cover. For the shaft, steel alloys with little deformation on load are preferred, the use of Maraging steel has been proposed for this.|$|R
25|$|Traditional {{spark plugs}} {{need to be}} {{indented}} into {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark plugs and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|R

50|$|The Renesis design {{features}} two major changes from its predecessors. First, the exhaust ports are not peripheral but {{are located on}} the side of the housing, which eliminates overlap and allows redesign of the intake port area. This produced noticeably more power thanks to an increased effective compression ratio; however, Mazda engineers discovered that when changing the exhaust port to the side housing, a buildup of carbon in the exhaust port would stop the engine from running. To remedy this, Mazda engineers added a water jacket passage into the side housing. Secondly, the rotors are sealed differently through the use of redesigned side seals, low-height apex seals and the addition of a second cut-off ring. Mazda engineers had originally used apex seals identical to the older design of seal. Mazda changed the <b>apex</b> <b>seal</b> design to reduce friction and push the new engine closer to its limits.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the frictional losses from the <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> in a rotary engine was developed. The modeling was initiated with a kinematic {{analysis of}} the rotary engine. Next a modern internal combustion engine analysis code was altered {{for use in a}} rotary engine to allow the calculation of the internal combustion pressure as a function of rotor rotation. Finally the forces from the spring, inertial, and combustion pressure on the seal were combined to provide the frictional horsepower assessment...|$|R
2500|$|Problems arose during {{research}} in the 1950s and 1960s. For a while, engineers were faced with what they called [...] "chatter marks" [...] and [...] "devil's scratch" [...] in the inner epitrochoid surface. They discovered that the cause was the <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of <b>apex</b> <b>seals.</b> Scratches disappeared after the introduction of more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings. Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole, which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing, instead of plug being screwed directly into the block housing. Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm, part load, specific fuel consumption by 7%, and also emissions and idle. A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water-cooled rotaries, which has had widespread use, being patented by Curtiss-Wright, with the last-listed for better air-cooled engine spark plug boss cooling. These approaches did not require a high-conductivity copper insert, but did not preclude its use. Ford tested a rotary engine with the plugs placed in the side plates, {{instead of the usual}} placement in the housing working surface ( [...] , 1978).|$|R
5000|$|In April 1973, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relaxed {{emission}} standards for '75, and GM tuned {{the engine to}} provide better mileage at a sacrifice to exhaust emissions by reverting to the earlier layout. Other refinements improved mileage to a remarkable 20 mpg, according to GM, but with the fuel breakthrough came related side-effect problems. Durability under the [...] "hot" [...] set-up began to deteriorate. Higher temperatures and pressures affected both <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> and the chrome-on-steel-on-aluminum coating of the trochoid surface. The surface plating tended to crack and flake away around the exhaust port, blamed by GM engineers on sudden cooling after hard, hot running.|$|R
50|$|Series 1 (2004-2008) RX-8 Renesis {{commonly}} {{suffer from}} engine failures between 80,000 and 120,000 miles due to premature <b>apex</b> <b>seal</b> wear from {{the lack of}} a center/middle oil injector which gets its oil from the oil metering pump. The rotor main bearing can also fail due to various problems like low oil pressure, and a lower viscosity oil was recommended in the North American market. The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the oil pickup tube flow causing main bearing failures as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience side seal failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well. Most of the issues can be circumvented by using a higher viscosity oil and adding 2 cycle oil to the gas.Flooding can occur in the RX-8 as in previous generations of rotary engine cars.|$|E

50|$|In mid 1973, Mazda {{released}} a visually updated Savanna in Japan, though drivetrain choices {{remained the same}} with the S102A 10A and the S124A 12A both available in twin distributor form. Externally the entire front end sheet metal was revamped and a different set of taillights with twin brake lights were included (commonly known as Savanna tail lights in Australia). In the months that followed, the range was updated to the single distributor 12A and the 10A motor was discontinued in early 1974. The Series II RX-3 came to Australia in March 1974 powered by the new 12A single distributor (12B). The starter motor was relocated in these updated engines {{from the top of the}} engine to the lower left hand rear side. Other internal 12A changes included moving from dual row side seals to single row and significant changes to <b>apex</b> <b>seal</b> design. The Series II was slower than the 10A Series I down the quarter mile even with the 1,146 cc 12As greater capacity and 15 percent more power. The Rotary Engine Anti Pollution System (REAPS) hurt torque. As a result, the Series 2 was slow off the mark but had a better top speed. The loss of torque plus a 44-kilo weight increase slowed the Series II to a 17.8 second quarter mile. Interior changes were minor and included a change from the km/h/mph speedometer to a 200 km/h speedometer (180 km/h for the 808), an exhaust overhead light, a 50 Amp ammeter (up from 30 Amps) plus design changes to the trims and seat belts. Notably the radio antenna was enhanced by a twin post (rather than single) design.

50|$|Nikasil was {{introduced}} by Mahle in 1967, initially developed to allow rotary engine <b>apex</b> <b>seals</b> (NSU Ro 80, Citroën GS Birotor and Mercedes C111) to work directly against the aluminium housing.

Unlike other methods, including cast iron cylinder liners, Nikasil allowed very large cylinder bores with tight tolerances and thus allowed existing engine designs to be expanded easily. The aluminium cylinders also gave a much better heat conductivity than cast iron liners, an important attribute for a high-output engine. The coating was further developed {{as a replacement for}} hard-chrome plated cylinder bores for Mercury Marine Racing, Kohler Engines, and as a repair replacement for factory-chromed snowmobiles, dirt bikes, ATVs, watercraft and automotive V8 liners/bores.|$|R
