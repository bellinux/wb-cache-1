5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past {{is one of}} {{the best-selling}} SNES games, with 4.61 million units sold worldwide, and has had an {{exceptionally}} long stay on Nintendo Powers top games list (ranking number 2 in Nintendo Power's last issue in December 2012): when the SNES list was finally retired, <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past had more than five consecutive years in the number one spot. It was re-released as a Player's Choice title in North America, indicating that it has sold a minimum of one million copies there. In the United States, <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pasts Game Boy Advance version alone sold 1.4 million copies and earned $41 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 8th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now separate items, as bombs are in the original, instead of using a Rupee to fire an arrow. <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can run with the aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus Shoes in the GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead of merely stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E
5|$|The {{designers}} {{thought that}} Link's appearance should change when Link entered {{a wall and}} the perspective switched from a top-down view to side view. They chose to make Link a mural {{while he was on}} a wall; this {{led to the creation of}} Yuga, the game's antagonist, a sorcerer that can transform himself and others into paintings. Aonuma mentioned that the idea of Link turning into a mural was inspired by Phantom Ganon jumping into paintings during his encounter in Ocarina of Time. As the game's story takes place long after the events of a <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past and the player travels between the two worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, the development team chose A Link Between Worlds instead of <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past 2 for the game's English-language title.|$|E

5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{agreed that}} A Link Between Worlds excelled at {{making use of}} the console's 3D capabilities.

5|$|The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is an action-adventure game {{presented}} in stereoscopic 3D polygonal graphics, with gameplay predominantly experienced from a top-down perspective. Players control {{a young boy}} named Link, who embarks on an adventure to rescue the Seven Sages and defeat Yuga, the game's primary antagonist. The game is set in two kingdoms—Hyrule and Lorule—both of which bear an open world structure and similar layout, but contrast in style and tone. A Link Between Worlds {{is seen as a}} successor to the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title , and is similar in many aspects.
