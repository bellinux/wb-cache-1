25|$|Depending on the {{temperature}} {{at which it}} is applied, asphalt is categorized as hot mix, warm mix, or cold mix. Hot mix asphalt is applied at temperatures over 300°F (150°C) with a free floating screed. Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of 200–250°F (95–120°C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool {{too much on the}} long trip from the <b>asphalt</b> <b>plant</b> to the construction site.|$|E

50|$|Although an <b>asphalt</b> <b>plant</b> {{had stood}} there previously, that <b>asphalt</b> <b>plant</b> had become outdated, as the {{surrounding}} neighborhoods transformed from semi-commercial to residential. However, Borough President Stanley Isaacs {{felt that the}} neighborhood remained the ideal location for an <b>asphalt</b> <b>plant</b> because {{the location of the}} neighborhood minimized the need for the trucking of raw materials through the streets. Therefore, he called for the new <b>asphalt</b> <b>plant</b> to be made in a style that would be an industrial structure, but also be more suited towards the residential character of the neighborhood. The interior of the plant was designed first, and the exterior of the building was designed based on the internal structure. The exterior was designed with four arched ribs, constructed with reinforced concrete. They are spaced twenty two feet apart, eighty four feet and six inches high, and ninety feet wide. The sides of the ribs have windows {{a third of the way}} up the walls.|$|E

40|$|Studies of 10 <b>asphalt</b> <b>plants</b> in the Intermountain Region have {{identified}} average ID fan energy savings of 68 % by controlling airflow using Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) on the fan motors {{in place of}} damper control (inlet or outlet). Average paybacks were 3 - 5 years before utility incentives. In the 10 plants evaluated, the ID fans accounted {{for as much as}} 30 % of the total plant electrical consumption. In the majority of these plants the outlet dampers were typically 50 %- 60 % closed. Fan motors ranged from 200 Hp to 500 Hp. With approximately 3, 600 existing <b>asphalt</b> <b>plants</b> in operation across the United States, a large opportunity for retrofits exists. Working with manufacturers and owners, a new standard can be established for installing VFDs on all plants...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented thesis is, to check the possibilities of using modern quality management systems in the building industry on the example of <b>asphalt</b> <b>plants.</b> At first the necessary basics of quality management, the current systems of quality control and out of them the call for action are presented. There, {{it was possible to}} identify the weak spot of the present asphalt production. The description of the status quo with qualitative weak spot analysis, analysis of control tests and asphalt-plant-data shows the general problems of asphalt production and the demand for a structural and individual usable method to evaluate the failure possibilities and their consequences. Therefore, an application model of the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is developed for the case of asphalt production. The attempt, to analyse the data-bank 'test-roads' of the Federal Institute of Road Affairs, should show the connection between mixing parameters {{and the quality of the}} pavement structure. It was found, that an incorrect filler content has consequences on rutting. The summary of these results leads to a modell for a quality management system in <b>asphalt</b> <b>plants</b> and furthermore to a catalogue of recommendations for implementation. The results can be divided in higher problems (for example installation of QM-Systems for other fields of pavement construction or general technical problems) and in specific problems (for example individual realization of the FMEA in <b>asphalt</b> <b>plants).</b> Guidelines for the installation are given as well.

25|$|Few Canadian {{refineries}} can {{process more}} than {{small amounts of}} heavy oil, so production has traditionally gone to United States <b>asphalt</b> <b>plants.</b> This changed in the 1980s, however, with the announcement that construction would begin on two heavy oil upgraders. Like the plants at Syncrude, Suncor and Shell's Scotford facility near Edmonton, these refinery-like operations turn heavy oil and bitumen into lighter and lower-sulfur, more desirable crude.|$|R
