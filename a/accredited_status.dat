According to Morris, TRACS and ICR founder, TRACS is a [...] "product of the ICR Graduate School" [...] and was created [...] "Because of the prejudice against creation-science, outspoken creationist schools such as ICRGS used to stand {{little or no}} chance of getting recognition through accreditation." [...] TRACS was officially recognized as an accreditor by the US Department of Education in 1991. Following the ICR's move to Dallas, in November 2007, TRACS terminated its <b>accredited</b> <b>status</b> after the ICR requested its termination. Texas does not recognize TRACS' accreditation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influx of}} missionaries {{over the past}} several years has led to {{pressure}} by groups in Russia, specifically nationalists and the Russian Orthodox Church, to limit the activities of these [...] "nontraditional" [...] religious groups. In response, the Duma passed a new, restrictive, and potentially discriminatory law in October 1997. The law is very complex, with many ambiguous and contradictory provisions. The law's most controversial provisions separates religious [...] "groups" [...] and [...] "organizations" [...] and introduces a 15-year rule, which allows groups that have existed for 15 years or longer to obtain <b>accredited</b> <b>status.</b> According to Russian priest and dissident Gleb Yakunin, new religion law [...] "heavily favors the Russian Orthodox Church at the expense of all other religions, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.", and it is [...] "a step backward in Russia's process of democratization".|$|E
