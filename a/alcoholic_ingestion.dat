40|$|Introduction: Epidemiologic {{researches}} about {{psychoactive substance}} use have shown an up-and-coming situation to abusive {{consumption of alcohol}} in adolescent and young-adult groups. This consumption over come the knowledge about damage caused by abusive of these substances, especially for the population part {{who is in the}} “top of life experiences”; the university students. Aim: To estimate the prevalence of the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion</b> and alcohol abuse in university students at Jequié-BA, and to verify the association between the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion</b> and alcohol abuse with the gender, race, smoking and graduation area. Methods: Prevalence study with probabilistic randomized sample (n = 129) of a population of 3, 644 university students, registered in three universities. It was used a Questionnaire contends socio-demographic data, asking for the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion</b> and test CAGE to abuse. Results: It has been found prevalence of 63. 6 % to alcohol ingestion, 21. 7 % of high risk in abuse, and 8. 5 % of alcohol abuse. Although they have not been gotten association statistics between these variable and gender, race, graduation area and smoking; the data had demonstrated highest rates of alcohol abuse, and high risk in developing in students of masculine gender, medium brown race, who attend a graduation course in the health area. Those who have used of the tobacco had presented percentile greater of high risk in becoming alcohol consumer abusive. Conclusions: Intent for data found, as much alcohol ingestion as abuse, since they reflect the necessity of prevention politics to the alcoholic abusive ingestion in this populatio...|$|E
40|$|Objetivos: Verificar a freqüência de ingestão alcoólica em vítimas de causas externas atendidos no Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal de Uberlândia. Métodos: Determinou-se alcoolemia em 85 pacientes no pronto socorro (PS) (TDx/TDxFLx-Etanol, Abbott) e entrevistou-se 301 internados sobre possível ingestão alcoólica previamente ao trauma; em ambos os locais aplicou-se o questionário CAGE. Nos ambulatórios, entrevistou-se cinquenta pacientes etilistas e cinquenta não etilistas sobre antecedentes de trauma. Resultados: A alcoolemia foi positiva em 31, 8 % dos pacientes no PS, destes 85, 2 % eram homens e 70, 4 % necessitaram internação (p< 0, 05). Proporcionalmente, alcoolemia positiva foi mais freqüente (p< 0, 05) entre as vítimas de agressão física (57, 2 %) do que as de queda (15, 4 %), mas não do que as de trânsito (29, 3 %). Nas enfermarias, 29, 9 % dos pacientes tinham história positiva de ingestão alcoólica, e nestes, a agressão física (68, 9 %) foi proporcionalmente mais freqüente (p< 0, 01) do que acidente de trânsito (27, 4 %) ou queda (15, 2 %). Entre os que tinham bebido, no PS e enfermarias, respectivamente, a ocorrência de incidentes foi maior (p< 0, 05) no final de semana (62, 9 e 57, 8 %) e no período noturno (59, 2 % e 63, 4 %) e o CAGE foi positivo em 81, 5 % e 82, 3 %. Nos ambulatórios, 93, 1 % dos alcoolistas e 9, 1 % no grupo controle (p< 0, 01) relataram antecedentes de trauma relacionado à ingestão alcoólica. Conclusões: Um terço dos pacientes ingeriram bebidas alcoólicas previamente ao trauma e, entre eles, a maioria era etilista crônico, os incidentes foram mais freqüentes nos finais de semana, no período noturno e as lesões foram mais graves. Entre os pacientes dos ambulatórios, os etilistas se acidentaram mais freqüentemente. Objective: To {{verify the}} {{frequency}} of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion</b> in victims of external causes at the Hospital of Clinics from Uberlândia. Methods: Blood alcohol content was determined in 85 patients of emergency room (ER). A total of 301 in-patients were interviewed on <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion</b> prior to incidents. All ER and in-patients were submitted to the CAGE questionnaire. Also, 50 alcoholic patients and 50 no alcoholics attended at ambulatory level were interviewed on trauma antecedents. Results: Blood alcohol content was positive in 31. 8 % ER patients (85. 2 % were men and 70. 4 % required internment; p< 0. 05) and it was more frequent (p< 0. 05) in physical aggression (57. 2 %) than fall (15. 4 %) victims, but not compared to traffic victims (29. 3 %). Among in-patients, 29. 9 % had positive history of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion</b> and physical aggressions (68. 9 %) were more frequent (p< 0. 01) than traffic accidents (27. 4 %) or falls (15. 2 %). Among ER patients with positive blood alcohol content and drinker in-patients, the occurrence of incidents was higher (p< 0. 05) in the weekend (62. 9 % and 57, 8 %, respectively) and the night period (59. 2 % and 63. 4 %, respectively), with positive CAGE in 81. 5 % ER patients and 82. 3 % in-patients. At ambulatory level, 93. 1 % alcoholic patients reported trauma antecedents related to <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion</b> compared to 9. 1 % no alcoholics (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: A third of patient s ingested alcoholic drinks prior to incidents, and among them, the most were chronic alcoholics. Incidents were more frequent in the weekends and the night period, with lesions more severe. Among the ambulatory patients, the alcoholics were the most frequently injured...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{present the}} CT andMR imaging {{findings}} in acute methanol intoxication in a 35 -year-old {{man who was}} admitted to the emergency department with weakness, blurred vision, mild bilateral areactive mydriasis, and a progressive decrease in the level of consciousness. CT and MR imaging showed bilateral putaminal hemorrhagic necrosis and subcortical white matter lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement. There was only partial improvement in patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score during follow-up. Methanol is a clear, colorless, highly toxic liquid with asmell and taste similar to ethanol. It is used as a constit-uent {{of a large number of}} commercially available solvents. Methanol intoxication appears after accidental or suicidal oral ingestion of industrial solvents or cleaning and antifreeze liquids or occasionally is due to fraudulent adulteration of wine or other <b>alcoholic</b> beverages. Its <b>ingestion</b> can cause se-vere metabolic acidosis and clinical disturbances such as blindness, permanent neurologic dysfunction, and death. CT andMR imaging are able to demonstrate toxic effects ofmeth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Ethanol {{is widely}} used {{in all kinds of}} {{products}} with direct exposure to the human skin (e. g. medicinal products like hand disinfectants in occupational settings, cosmetics like hairsprays or mouthwashes, pharmaceutical preparations, and many household products). Contradictory evidence about the safety of such topical applications of the alcohol {{can be found in the}} scientific literature, yet an up-to-date risk assessment of ethanol application on the skin and inside the oral cavity is currently lacking. The first and foremost concerns of topical ethanol applications for public health are its carcinogenic effects, as there is unambiguous evidence for the carcinogenicity of ethanol orally consumed in the form of alcoholic beverages. So far there is a lack of evidence to associate topical ethanol use with an increased risk of skin cancer. Limited and conflicting epidemiological evidence is available on the link between the use of ethanol in the oral cavity in the form of mouthwashes or mouthrinses and oral cancer. Some studies pointed to an increased risk of oral cancer due to locally produced acetaldehyde, operating via a similar mechanism to that found after <b>alcoholic</b> beverage <b>ingestion.</b> In addition, topically applied ethanol acts as a skin penetration enhancer and may facilitate the transdermal absorption of xenobiotics (e. g. carcinogenic contaminants in cosmetic formulations). Ethanol use is associated with skin irritation or contact dermatitis, especially in humans with an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) deficiency. After regular application of ethanol on the skin (e. g. in the form of hand disinfectants) relatively low but measurable blood concentrations of ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde may occur, which are, however, below acute toxic levels. Only in children, especially through lacerated skin, can percutaneous toxicity occur. As there might be industry bias in many studies about the safety of topical ethanol applications, as well as a general lack of scientific research on the long-term effects, there is a requirement for independent studies on this topic. The research focus should be set on the chronic toxic effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde at the point of impact, with special regard to children and individuals with genetic deficiencies in ethanol metabolism. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if abnormal laboratory findings {{are more common}} in individuals with hypertension and in those with other risk factors, such as obesity, smoking and alcohol ingestion. METHODS: A study {{was carried out in}} the general outpatient clinics of a university hospital (145 individuals without previous diagnosis of hypertension) and the following variables were assessed: high blood pressure (as defined by the VI Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection and Treatment of High Blood Pressure - VI JNC), obesity [calculated using body mass index (BMI) ], tobacco use, and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion.</b> The laboratory examinations consisted of the following tests: hemogram, glycemia, uric acid, potassium, total/HDL-fraction cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium and creatinine. RESULTS: High blood pressure was not associated with a higher number of abnormal laboratory tests. Hypertensive individuals with a BMI > or = 25 kg/m² or normotensive obese individuals, however, had a higher frequency of diabetes (12 X), hypertriglyceridemia (3 X), and hypercholesterolemia (2 X), as compared with hypertensive individuals with BMI < 25 kg/m² and preobese/normal weight normotensive individuals. CONCLUSION: High blood pressure is not associated with a higher frequency of abnormal laboratory tests. The association of high blood pressure and obesity, however, increases the detection of diabetes and dyslipidemias...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol {{ingestion}} produces {{changes in}} blood lipids {{as well as}} changes in liver lipids. The administration of alcohol to human subjects {{as well as to}} the experi-mental animal produces increases in plasma triglycerides, followed at later stages by increases in serum fatty acids which seem to be derived primarily from adipose tissue. In the liver, a lipid accumulation develops which involves the participation of four reactions: (1.) an increased supply of fatty acids; (2.) de-creased oxidation of fatty acids; (3.) an increased esterification of fatty acids to triglycerides; and (4.) a decreased release of triglycerides into the plasma at very high alcohol concentrations. These various mechanisms are discussed in some detail. VV E HAVE been interested for some time in the mechanism of deranged lipid metabolism produced by a variety of agents; and among these has been con-sideration of how the ingestion of alcohol leads to a fatty liver and to changes in plasma lipid constituents. Such studies were prompted by the fact that frequent-ly patients are seen who upon acute or chronic <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion</b> develop in-creased amounts of fat in the liver (i. e., fatty liver) and frequently have a turbid or creamy plasma which reflects eleva-tions of blood triglycerides. In order to appreciate some of these metabolic changes it will be important to recall some of the major points tha...|$|E
40|$|Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} mediator of fatty acid metabolism with paradoxical effects in the liver. Administration of IL- 6 {{has been reported to}} confer protection against steatosis, but plasma and tissue IL- 6 concentrations are elevated in chronic liver diseases, including fatty liver diseases associated with obesity and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>ingestion.</b> In this study, we further investigated the role of IL- 6 on steatosis induced through a high-fat diet (HFD) in wild-type (WT) and IL- 6 -deficient (IL- 6 −/−) mice. Additionally, HFD-fed IL- 6 −/− mice were also chronically treated with recombinant IL- 6 (rIL- 6). Obesity in WT mice fed a HFD associated with elevated serum IL- 6 levels, fatty liver, upregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT 1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription- 3 (STAT 3), increased AMP kinase phosphorylation (p-AMPK), and downregulation of the hepatic lipogenic enzymes fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD 1). The HFD-fed IL- 6 −/− mice showed severe steatosis, no changes in CPT 1 levels or AMPK activity, no increase in STAT 3 amounts, inactivated STAT 3, and marked downregulation of the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCα/β), FAS and SCD 1. The IL- 6 chronic replacement in HFD-fed IL- 6 −/− mice restored hepatic STAT 3 and AMPK activation but also increased the expression of the lipogenic enzymes ACCα/β, FAS and SCD 1. Furthermore, rIL- 6 administration was associated with aggravated steatosis and elevated fat content in the liver. We conclude that, in the context of HFD-induced obesity, the administration of rIL- 6 might contribute to the aggravation of fatty liver disease through increasing lipogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{preliminary}} study the alcohol absorption behavior of cross-linked polyacrylamide (CLP) in alcoholic and alcoholic-acidic media representing the gastric environment after ingestion. Background. Polymers which can swell in alcohol and quickly gel <b>alcoholic</b> drinks after <b>ingestion</b> are hypothesized to slow ethanol absorption into the bloodstream. With its 57 favorable structure for alcohol interactions, and rapid and high swelling in aqueous media, CLP was screened {{to be well}} suited for this purpose. Methods. CLP was commercially obtained (Hydrosource® CLP) and screened to a particle size retained on a 250 μm sieve. For swelling capacity measurement, 30 mg of CLP was allowed to soak in 10 mL of swelling media for 2 minutes. Using tea-bag and gravimetric methods, the volume and weight swelling ratios were then calculated in hydroalcoholic (5 % to 80 % v/v), acidic (pH 1 to pH 5), and acidic-hydroalcoholic solutions prepared by diluting acidic solutions with ethyl alcohol to 5 % v/v. Results. The CLP superabsorbent polymer exhibited very high absorption capacity in hydroalcoholic solutions containing up to 40 % v/v ethyl alcohol. Swelling was reduced at low pH, but quickly increased past 150 g/g in solutions at pH 3 and above, representing the environments of the stomach and upper intestines. Conclusion. Polymers such as CLP, when properly formulated in small doses, appear promising as an oral method to slow the rapid absorption of ethanol from the gastrointestinal tract. Grants.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to study changes of balance control after a {{short-term}} multidimensional treatment in a sample of chronic <b>alcoholics.</b> Alcohol <b>ingestion</b> negatively impacts physical performance, causing worsening of psychomotor skills and reduced postural control [1], exercise is associated with positive outcomes in the treatment of alcohol dependence [2]. Method: Participants were 30 alcoholic patients (20 men, 10 women; mean age = 46. 9 ± 6. 6 years; mean BMI = 25. 7 ± 4. 4) consecutively admitted to a 4 -week residential treatment. They completed the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Pre- post-measures of standing balance were collected with open and closed eyes on a firm surface and on a foam, by using a low cost set up based on Nintendo Wii Balance Board and a custom-made software [3, 4]. Dynamic balance was tested by means of the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) test. Twelve patients attended a specific balance exercises program (group 1, mean session = 10. 8 ± 0. 8), 10 participated in standardized group-based physical activities (group 2, mean sessions attended = 11. 2 ± 1. 3), 8 served as control and did not take part to organized physical activities during their hospitalization (group 3). Results: No significant difference by group were observed at the baseline on all the variables. Significant correlations (p <. 01) of FES-I with DHI and DGI and between DHI and DGI were found. Significant correlation between all the sway-path measures (mm/s) with open/closed eyes and with/without foam were recorded. The mean value of the FES-I at baseline was 10. 2 ± 4. 5. Patients in group 1 reported significant improvements in the DHI (p =. 019) and in the DGI (p =. 021). Patients in group 2 and in group 3 did not reported significant changes in both self-reported measures and in static and dynamic balance test. Conclusion: Findings support the notion that balance control represents a serious problem for chronic alcoholics and that most patients are not aware of their problematic. A specific exercise program oriented to improve balance control seems to be an effective strategy to ameliorate in the short time the selfperceived handicapping effects imposed by balance-related problems and the dynamic balance.

40|$|Esta pesquisa quanti-qualitativa foi desenvolvida com o objetivo de avaliar o consumo de álcool, através do Alcohol Use Disorders Investigation Teste AUDIT, entre os alunos e alunas de graduação do curso de Física, da Universidade Estadual Paulista UNESP, Campus Rio Claro, e identificar os conhecimentos e atitudes destes(as) estudantes sobre a ingestão de bebidas alcoólicas. Os resultados obtidos na etapa inicial da pesquisa quantitativos permitiram o direcionamento da etapa seguinte qualitativa. Foram {{realizadas}} entrevistas semi-estruturadas com oito alunos(as) dos 30 que responderam ao Teste AUDIT. Os resultados do referido teste mostraram que pouco mais de 83 % apresentam padrão de consumo de baixo risco. A transcrição e análise das entrevistas permitiram um mergulho no universo destes estudantes, sendo então possível apreender parte de seus conhecimentos e atitudes com relação ao álcool, e a identificar os fatores de vulnerabilidade e de empowerment. Ficou clara a necessidade de orientação, aos adultos que convivem com jovens e crianças, sobre os malefícios do uso de bebidas alcoólicas e sobre a necessidade de uma maior atenção àquelas situações que venham a facilitar o seu uso. Foi possível também perceber a importância da família como fator de apoio à conduta destes jovens. Quanto ao ambiente escolar, verificou-se que falta preparo aos educadores e profissionais da saúde, e uma maior reflexão por parte de toda a sociedade, para que a questão do consumo de bebidas alcoólicas seja encarada como catalisadora de tristes conseqüências futuras para crianças e jovens. O trabalho educativo deve exceder o campo da informação e a universidade deve ousar e ir além dos conhecimentos técnicos, para a formação integral dos diversos profissionais que por ela passam.
