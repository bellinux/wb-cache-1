5|$|About 0.3â€“0.7% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by schizophrenia during their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty <b>and</b> <b>homelessness</b> are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%).

5|$|Another {{composition}} {{from the}} song genre, also mentioned by Fisk and others, as intimately {{related to the}} last sonatas, and also depicting a feeling of wandering <b>and</b> <b>homelessness,</b> is the Winterreise (A Winter's Journey) song cycle. Numerous connections between different songs from the cycle and the sonatas, especially the C minor Sonata, have been mentioned. For example: in the C minor Sonata, the first movement's development section recalls the songs Erstarrung and Der Lindenbaum; the second movement and the finale recall the songs Das Wirtshaus, Gefrorne Tranen, Gute Nacht, Auf dem Flusse, Der Wegweiser, and Einsamkeit. These allusions to Winterreise retain the alienated, lonely atmosphere of its songs.|$|E

As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght.

After school, he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction <b>and</b> <b>homelessness.</b> At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E
