50|$|<b>Atacamite</b> is polymorphous with botallackite, clinoatacamite, and paratacamite. <b>Atacamite</b> is a {{comparatively}} rare mineral, formed from primary copper minerals in the oxidation or weathering zone of arid climates. It {{has also been}} reported as a volcanic sublimate from fumarole deposits, as sulfide alteration products in black smokers and as alteration of ancient bronze and copper artefacts. It occurs in association with cuprite, brochantite, linarite, caledonite, malachite, chrysocolla and its polymorphs.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} an {{uncommon}} oxidation mineral in vanadium bearing hydrothermal copper ores. It {{is associated with}} brochantite, malachite, <b>atacamite,</b> tangeite, chrysocolla, baryte and gypsum.|$|E
50|$|Botallackite, {{chemical}} formula Cu2(OH)3Cl is a secondary copper mineral, {{named for its}} type locality at the Botallack mine, St Just in Penwith, Cornwall. It is polymorphous with <b>atacamite,</b> paratacamite and clinoatacamite.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} Cu2(OH)3Cl {{polymorph}} is <b>atacamite.</b> It is an oxidation product of other copper minerals, especially under arid, saline conditions. It {{was found in}} fumarolic deposits, and a weathering product of sulfides in subsea black smoker deposits. It was named for the Atacama Desert in Chile. Its color varies from blackish to emerald green. It is the sugar-like coating of dark green glistening crystals found on many bronze objects from Egypt and Mesopotamia. It has also been found in living systems such as the jaws of the marine bloodworm Glycera dibranchiate. The stability of <b>atacamite</b> is evidenced by its ability to endure dynamic regimes in its natural geologic environment.|$|E
50|$|Diaboleite {{occurs in}} {{manganese}} oxide ores, as a secondary mineral in lead and copper oxide ores, and in seawater-exposed slag. Diaboleite {{has been found}} in association with <b>atacamite,</b> boleite, caledonite, cerussite, chloroxiphite, hydrocerussite, leadhillite, mendipite, paratacamite, phosgenite, and wherryite.|$|E

Plášilite is secondary in origin, being the product of weathering of the primary uranium mineral, uraninite.|$|E
50|$|Copper(II) {{chloride}} occurs naturally as {{the very}} rare anhydrous mineral tolbachite and the dihydrate eriochalcite. Both are found near fumaroles.

50|$|Iyoite is a {{very rare}} {{manganese}} copper chloride hydroxide mineral with the formula MnCuCl(OH)3. Iyoite is a new member of the <b>atacamite</b> group, and it an analogue of botallackite characterized in manganese and copper ordering. Iyoite is monoclinic (space group P21/m). It is chemically similar to misakiite. Both minerals come from the Ohku mine in the Ehime prefecture, Japan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atacamite</b> and paratacamite crystal {{forms of}} Cu2(OH)3Cl {{have been found}} to be active species in {{supported}} CuCl2 catalyst systems for the oxidative carbonylation of methanol to dimethyl carbonate. A number of supported Cu2(OH)3Cl catalysts have also been prepared and studied in such conversion. Dimethyl carbonate is an environmentally benign chemical product and unique intermediate with versatile chemical reactivity.|$|E
50|$|Paramelaconite is a {{very rare}} mineral; many {{specimens}} purported as such are in fact mixtures of cuprite and tenorite. Paramelaconite forms as a secondary mineral in hydrothermal deposits of copper. It occurs in association with <b>atacamite,</b> chrysocolla, connellite, cuprite, dioptase, goethite, malachite, plancheite, and tenorite. The mineral {{has been found in}} Cyprus, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E
50|$|The nickel sulfides {{within the}} {{regolith}} have been oxidised into a complex series of weathering fronts including a rare {{expression of a}} carbonate front which {{has resulted in a}} host of unusual nickel carbonate, arsenate and silicate minerals such as gaspeite, <b>atacamite,</b> annabergite, carrboydite, glaucospaerite, hydrohonessite, kambaldaite, népouite, nullaginite, pecoraite, olivenite, otwayite, reevesite, retgersite, takovite and of course widgiemoolthalite.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1935 from alluvium near bismuth-bearing pegmatites in South Africa. [...] It {{has been found}} in association with granite pegmatite and in greisen. Associated minerals include bismutite, mica, jarosite, alunite, cerussite, <b>atacamite,</b> connellite. Occurrences include the type locality at Jackals Water, SW of Prieska, South Africa; Bygoo, Australia; the Tintic district in the East Tintic Mountains of Utah; and from Dalbeattie, Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{polymorph}} of Cu2(OH)3Cl {{family is}} clinoatacamite. It was found and identified around in Chuquicamata, Chile in 1996. It was named in allusion to its monoclinic morphology and relationship to <b>atacamite.</b> It too is pale green but has monoclinic crystals. Clinoatacamite {{can be easily}} confused with the closely related paratacamite. It is believed that clinoatacamite should replace most previously reported occurrences of paratacamite in the conservation literature.|$|E
50|$|Thermodynamic data {{based on}} the free energy of {{formation}} indicates that the order of stability of these polymorphs is clinoatacamite>atacamite> botallackite. Spectroscopic {{studies show that the}} strength of hydrogen bonding in these polymorphs is in the order paratacamite >atacamite> botallackite. Studies on the formation of basic copper chloride indicate botallackite is a key intermediate and crystallizes first under most conditions; subsequent recrystallization of botallackite to <b>atacamite</b> or paratacamite depends on the nature of reaction medium.|$|E
50|$|The {{animals are}} {{unique in that}} they contain a lot of copper without being poisoned. Their jaws are unusually strong since they too contain the metal {{in the form of}} a copper-based {{chloride}} biomineral, known as <b>atacamite.</b> And unlike the clamworm (Nereis limbata), whose jaws contain the metal zinc, the copper in the mineral in the jaws of Glycera is actually present in its crystalline form. It is theorized that this copper is used as a catalyst for its poisonous bite.|$|E
