5|$|The Boeing 747 is a large, {{wide-body}} (two-aisle) airliner {{with four}} wing-mounted engines. The wings {{have a high}} sweep angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast, efficient cruise of Mach0.84 to 0.88, depending on the variant. The sweep also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to use existing hangars. Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3–3 seat <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> economy class and a 2–2 <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> first class.|$|E

5|$|Adrian {{previously}} converted their downtown {{streets to}} one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> the routings {{of the two}} state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009.|$|E
5|$|An {{example for}} the fission and fusion {{mechanism}} {{can be found in}} nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases. These are membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a hydride ion between NAD(H) and NADP(H) in a reaction that is coupled to transmembrane proton translocation. They consist of three major functional units (I, II, and III) that can be found in different <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> bacteria, protozoa, and higher eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three groups of domain arrangements were acquired and fused independently.|$|E

5|$|Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to {{sectional}} rank in his 1856 classification, {{and divided}} it into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Dryandroideae. When George Bentham published his 1870 <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles {{together in a}} section that he named Oncostylis. This arrangement would stand for over a century.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.brownii in series Spicigerae, placing it in B.subser. Occidentales along with B.occidentalis (red swamp banksia), B.seminuda (river banksia), B.verticillata (granite banksia) and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} on 22 March 2013 that West Ham {{had signed a}} 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra million towards the costs of converting the site. The club's plan was {{to move into the}} stadium {{prior to the start of}} the 2016–17 season. Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the <b>arrangement.</b> <b>In</b> September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> the orangutans' hands {{produces}} two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E

However, the stations were not consolidated, and maintain their own studio facilities, news departments and staff. WEAR and WPMI also produce competing 9:00 p.m. newscasts for their respective duopoly partners.|$|E

5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> early 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Kclass was {{designed}} to be mechanically similar to the SECR Nclass 2-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. The class was one of the earliest to use the 2-6-4 wheel <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> Britain. Production began {{towards the end of the}} First World War, and the prototype rolled out of Ashford Works three years after design work was completed due to wartime production constraints. The class replaced obsolete 4-4-0 passenger locomotives in an SECR fleet standardisation programme.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recordings}} {{were made}} during the European leg of Garbage's Version 2.0 world tour. After listening to the orchestral demo, the band worked on the key and tempo. Garbage used a portable studio {{from a number of}} European cities to record material for Arnold, keeping in touch by phone as he produced the song's string <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> London. Since the strings carried the structure of the song, they had to be finalised and recorded before Manson could sing her parts. Arnold recorded the strings with a 60-piece orchestra in one day at London's Metropolis Studios.|$|E

5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact <b>arrangement.</b> <b>In</b> baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below the}} target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber to protect them from the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E
5|$|Brown's 1810 {{monograph}} did {{not include}} an infrageneric classification of Dryandra, and neither did his Prodromus, published later that year. In 1830, however, he introduced the first taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra, placing D.floribunda in section Dryandra verae along with most other species, because its follicles contain a single seed separator. Dryandra verae was renamed Eudryandra by Carl Meissner in 1845. Eleven years later Meissner published a new arrangement, retaining D.floribunda in D.sect. Eudryandra, and further placing it in the unranked subgroup § Ilicinae, because of the similarity of its leaves to those of Ilex (holly). In 1870, George Bentham published a revised <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> his Flora Australiensis. Bentham retained section Eudryandra, but abandoned almost all of Meissner's unranked groups, including § Ilicinae. D.floribunda was instead placed in D.ser. Floribundae along with four other species with small, mostly terminal flowers, left exposed by their having unusually short floral leaves.|$|E
5|$|Greenland {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{constituent}} countries of the Kingdom of Denmark, with Queen Margrethe II as the reigning sovereign. The territory first came under monarchical rule in 1261, when the populace accepted the overlordship of the King of Norway; by 1360, Norway had entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark, which became more entrenched with the union of the kingdoms into Denmark–Norway in 1536. After the dissolution of this <b>arrangement</b> <b>in</b> 1814, Greenland remained as a Danish colony, and, after its role in World War II, was granted its special status within the Kingdom of Denmark in 1953. The monarch is represented in the territory by the Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner), Mikaela Engell.|$|E
