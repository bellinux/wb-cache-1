5|$|In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road {{known today as}} the Sag Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line opened in the 1880s.

NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with a girder bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same location.|$|E

5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him {{that he is not}} ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E
