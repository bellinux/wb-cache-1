40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm based on integrating genetic algorithms, tabu search and simulated annealing methods {{to solve the}} unit commitment problem. The core of the proposed algorithm is based on genetic algorithms. Tabu search is used to generate new population members in the reproduction phase of the genetic algorithm. A simulated annealing method is used to accelerate the convergence of the genetic algorithm by applying the simulated <b>annealing</b> <b>test</b> for all the population members. A new implementation of the genetic algorithm is introduced. The genetic algorithm solution is coded as a mix between binary and decimal representation. The fitness function is constructed from the total operating cost of the generating units without penalty terms. In the tabu search part of the proposed algorithm, a simple short-term memory procedure is used to counter the danger of entrapment at a local optimum, and the premature convergence of the genetic algorithm.

40|$|A {{fine-grain}} and high-strength Nb-IF steel under {{hot rolling}} {{was employed to}} {{study the effects of}} cold rolling reduction on cold rolling texture and formation of recrystallization texture. The results show that the main texture of the cold rolled steel is { 112 }, { 111 }, { 111 }, { 001 }. With the increasing reduction, texture components of the tested steel are not changed, and strength of the components increases. Ferrite grain size of the <b>annealed</b> <b>test</b> steel is refined, and its strength increases. The texture on the α-line of the <b>annealed</b> <b>test</b> steel weakens, and even some of the textures have gradually disappeared. With the increasing cold rolling reduction, the texture peak gradually moves from { 001 } to { 111 }. For the line of γ-orientation, texture peak moves from { 111 } orientation to { 111 } orientation, eventually the density of { 111 } orientation is stronger than that of { 111 } orientation. Recrystallization mechanism of the experimental steel is both oriented nucleation and selection growth, and with the increasing cold rolled reduction, the intensity of { 111 } surface texture increases, so the r value increases, and deep drawing performance is improved. ©, 2015, Editorial Office of Transactions of Materials and Heat Treatment.

To develop reliable dating methods using different stimulation light sources for feldspars, {{it is important}} to understand the sources of the traps associated with the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and blue light stimulated luminescence (BLSL) and their relationship. In this study, we explored the luminescence characteristics of IRSL and BLSL at different stimulation temperatures (from 60 °C to 200 °C) and their relationship based on five sets of experiments, i. e. post-IR BLSL, post-BL IRSL experiments, pulse <b>annealing</b> <b>test,</b> dose–response test and laboratory fading rate test.

A dependence of {{thermal stability}} of IRSL signal on IR stimulation time and stimulation temperature were observed in pulse annealing studies. Relatively lower thermal stability is given by the initial part of the IRSL measured at 50 °C, than the later part of IRSL curve. Based on these observations, the thermal {{stability of the}} post-IR IRSL signal stimulated at elevated temperatures (100 - 200 °C) was also investigated. It was found that at least two groups of traps (shallow and deep) are associated with the IRSL and post-IR IRSL signals. The IRSL signal obtained at 50 °C is mainly from the shallow traps while the post-IR IRSL obtained at elevated temperatures is mainly from the deep traps. The kinetics parameters obtained using pulse <b>annealing</b> <b>test</b> indicate that the shallow IRSL traps are probably associated with the ∼ 300 - 350 °C TL peak and the deep traps are probably associated with the ∼ 400 °C TL peak.
