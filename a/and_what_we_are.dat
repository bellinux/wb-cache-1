Badnarik says government does not grant rights but rather acknowledges them, that they exist independently of government as part of who <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> and that, as Thomas Jefferson noted in the United States Declaration of Independence, the only legitimate function of government is to secure them.|$|E

2500|$|Anna Walton as Princess Nuala: King Balor's {{daughter}} and Nuada's twin sister. She {{is described as}} [...] "very light" [...] while Nuada is [...] "very dark", creating a yin and yang dynamic. She elaborated on the incestuous tones between her character and Prince Nuada, [...] "He's the dark side and she's the light side and they're pulled apart and pulled back together again, and she's {{trying to get away}} because she knows there is something she has to do. He can't let that go and they can't really do anything without each other so it's a really interesting thing." [...] Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien, and Walton noted their similarities, [...] "They are both slightly lost souls and they understand each other." [...] Walton spoke of her character's sense of purpose, [...] "She feels very strongly about what she has to do in the film, and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> given.

2500|$|Chang is {{currently}} the Producing Artistic Director of Pan Asian Repertory Theatre, a theatre group that she established in 1977 to help the emergence of Asian American theater. [...] She has said that [...] "the extraordinary talent and dedication of the actors [...] inspired me to formalize the group into Pan Asian Repertory Theatre." [...] The money she earned from The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel, which she starred in that year, was used to fund the establishment. Chang's main principle with Pan Asian {{has always been to}} [...] "promote opportunities for Asian-American actors to be seen in context of who we really are <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> capable of achieving as artists." [...] According to Chang, Asian Americans had difficulties finding roles in New York City before she established Pan Asian. They were usually limited to playing stereotypical Asian characters such as geisha girls and houseboys. It was easier to get roles in Los Angeles, where the East West Players theatre group had been founded in 1965. Many people in the theatre business doubted that Pan Asian would be successful and wondered if anyone would pay to come and see their plays. Chang has said that [...] "because we were considered a curiosity or something very new and unique, people did come." [...] TV Times wrote in 1981 that Pan Asian was [...] "the most respected experimental theatre group in New York City." [...] As of 2009, it is the world's largest producer of Asian American theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person you love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I {{was trying to figure out}} the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she did know that the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will get you on the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's going to be a lot more edgy than our previous stuff <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Well, {{the case}} is more the fact we let go of a certain way of songwriting how we used it in the past.
