50|$|Piero Giorgio Bordoni (Rome, 18 July 1915 - 19 September 2009) was an Italian physicist, {{who first}} {{measured}} the anelastic relaxation effect (dissipation of elastic energy and softening of the elastic modulus), named after him, {{due to the}} stress induced motion of dislocations in metals. That experiment, together with a similar one by T.S. Kê, opened {{the way to the}} study of the dynamics of dislocations in solids. Those were also the first experiments of <b>anelasticity</b> in solids, a branch of physics studying defects, excitations and phase transitions in condensed matter, first systematised by Clarence Zener.|$|E
5000|$|After {{an initial}} {{activity}} on electroacoustic transducers, he started measuring the complex dynamic elastic modulus of metals at low temperature, so {{carrying out the}} earliest researches of <b>anelasticity</b> in solids. During a stay in 1948 in the laboratory of John C. Slater at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of Boston, where liquid helium for reaching very low temperatures was available, he discovered an anelastic relaxation process in Pb immediately recognized as due to the stress induced motion of dislocations. That type of relaxation, due to the motion of dislocations without the participation of mobile point defects, is known as [...] "Bordoni relaxation"’ or [...] "Bordoni peak", since it appears as a peak in the elastic energy dissipation versus temperature. Bordoni pursued this type of investigations, extending it to other metals with face-centered cubic structure, like copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum [...] but also body-centered cubic structure, like niobium, and with anisotropic hexagonal structure, where the simple change of temperature causes plastic phenomena. Models of increasing sophistication {{have been developed to}} explain the complex phenomenology of the Bordoni relaxation, but there is not yet general consensus on the detailed microscopic mechanisms, and this is still now a field of active research,.|$|E
50|$|Anderson {{began his}} {{scientific}} career while {{serving in the}} U.S. Air Force. In Greenland, he studied the properties of sea ice. Anderson was charged with determining whether the ice {{was strong enough to}} withstand the landing of heavy aircraft. In working with his colleague, Dr. Wilford Weeks, on scientific papers resulting from the research, it became clear to Anderson that he needed more education. He chose to attend Caltech in geophysics. Anderson’s thesis focused on the anisotropic, or directionally dependent, properties of the mantle. It analyzed wave propagation in layered complex media. Prior to Anderson’s work, seismologists had assumed that the Earth’s interior behaved like glass, and was isotropic. After completing his Ph.D. in 1962, Anderson joined the faculty at Caltech and moved on to other areas of study, writing papers on the composition, physical state, and origin of the Earth as well as other planets. Much later in his career, he returned to the effects of anisotropy and partial melting and the presence of fluids in the upper mantle. He and his colleagues developed methods for taking into account anisotropy and the non-elastic behavior of seismic waves to explain how the Earth works. The technical terms for the subjects of his studies are anharmonicity, asphericity, <b>anelasticity,</b> as well as anisotrophy. In other words, the Earth is not an ideal, elastic sphere.|$|E

40|$|The paper models {{the effects}} of mantle <b>anelasticity</b> on luni-solar nutations, on tidal deformation, on tidal {{variations}} in rotation rate, and on the eigenfrequency of the free core nutation.

40|$|In this PhD thesis, {{we propose}} a {{theoretical}} framework for studying referential and spatial evolutions in nonlinear elasticity. We use the referential evolution [...] considering an evolving reference configuration [...] to formulate a geometric theory of <b>anelasticity.</b> Indeed, an <b>anelasticity</b> source (such as temperature, defects, or growth) can manifest itself such that the body would fail to find a relaxed state in the Euclidean physical space. However, a reference configuration should by essence be stress-free so that one can properly quantify the strain with respect to it [...] and the stress {{by means of a}} constitutive equation. Identifying the reference configuration with an abstract manifold [...] material manifold [...] allows for a rational construction of such a stress-free state which can further accommodate the evolution of the source of <b>anelasticity</b> by allowing the material manifold to have an evolving geometry. In this work, we formulate a general geometric theory of <b>anelasticity</b> for three-dimensional bodies that we apply to the particular case of thermoelasticity; and we also formulate a general theory of anelastic shells that we apply to the particular case of morphoelastic shells, i. e., those subject to growth and remodeling. In the context of <b>anelasticity,</b> as well as in nonlinear elasticity, most exact solutions are obtained by assuming some restrictive class of symmetry for the solution. We propose a theory of small-on-large <b>anelasticity,</b> that is analogous to the small-on-large theory of Green et al. in classical elasticity. It can be used to find exact solutions for non-symmetric distributions of <b>anelasticity</b> sources that are small perturbations of symmetric ones. Finally, motivated by gaining further insights on the theory of nonlinear elasticity as well as the case of a continuum deforming in an evolving ambient space, we formulate a theory of nonlinear elasticity where the geometry of the ambient space is time-dependent.

Similar changes are additionally caused by the presence of a secondary solid component (chemical effect). The similitude that was observed in the <b>anelasticity</b> of melt-free systems when scaled by the Maxwell frequency for temperature and grain size effects was observed, too, in that of melt-bearing systems when scaled by the Maxwell frequency for melt and chemical effects.

40|$|Anelastic {{materials}} exhibit gradual {{full recovery}} of deformation once a load is removed, leading to dissipation of internal mechanical energy 1. As a consequence, anelastic materials are being investigated for mechanical damping applications. At the macroscopic scale, however, <b>anelasticity</b> is usually very small or negligible, especially in single-crystalline materials 2, 3. Here, {{we show that}} single-crystalline ZnO and p-doped Si nanowires can exhibit anelastic behaviour that is up to four orders of magnitude larger than the largest <b>anelasticity</b> observed in bulk materials, with a timescale {{on the order of}} minutes.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{anelastic}} properties of the Earth characterized by a ‘Q’ structure will affect the periods of free oscillation. It is generally considered that the effect is negligible {{compared to the other}} perturbing effects due to rotation, ellipticity, and lateral inhomogeneities. Nevertheless, it is of some interest to investigate the precise magnitude of this effect for the observed free oscillation modes since it could provide us with another constraint in the determination of the Q structure of the Earth. An application of perturbation theory provides us with a good estimate of the magnitude of the changes in the periods of an elastic model due to inclusion of anelastic effects. Calculations based on currently accepted mean elastic and anelastic models for the Earth show that the shift in period due to <b>anelasticity</b> is at most 0 · 023 per cent for the toroidal modes from _ 0 T_ 2 to _ 0 T_(99), the maximum occurring near _ 0 T_(60). For more extreme Q models, which may be locally applicable, period shifts of the order 0 · 1 per cent occur, with the maximum again near _ 0 T_(60), corresponding to a period of approximately 150 s. Observational accuracy for the toroidal oscillations is around 0 · 1 per cent so that anelastic shifts in toroidal oscillation periods are at the present limit of observational accuracy. Viewed in terms of propagating surface waves, the dispersion due to <b>anelasticity</b> results in at most 0 · 005 - 0 · 01 km s^(− 1) variations in the phase and group velocities. Such shifts are within the observational resolution of surface dispersion measurements using narrow band filtering techniques. Compared to other perturbing effects, <b>anelasticity</b> is significant for the toroidal oscillation only in the 50 - to 300 -s period range. In this range, lateral variations in structure generally cause larger perturbations. However, when viewed in terms of propagating surface waves in selected homogeneous regions, <b>anelasticity</b> becomes the dominating effect. Further, the frequency shift due to <b>anelasticity</b> is scaled by (1 /Q) ^ 2, so that the anelastic effect can be well within observational accuracy and comparable to any perturbing effect for more extreme, yet acceptable, Q models. In particular, when applied to surface waves propagating across a tectonic region with a strong low velocity zone in the upper mantle, the <b>anelasticity</b> induced dispersion on frequency shift can be significant and measurable. In such cases a joint inversion of elastic and anelastic properties is appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Sustained {{accurate}} measurements of earth rotation {{are one of}} the prime goals of Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS). We here concentrate on the fortnightly (Mf) tidal component of earth-rotation data to obtain new results concerning <b>anelasticity</b> of the mantle at this period. The study comprises three parts: (1) a new determination of the Mf component of polar motion and length-of-day from a multi-decade time series of space-geodetic data; (2) the use of the polar-motion determination as one constraint {{in the development of a}} hydrodynamic ocean model of the Mf tide; and (3) the use of these results to place new constraints on mantle <b>anelasticity.</b> Our model of the Mf ocean tide assimilates more than fourteen years of altimeter data from the Topex/Poseidon and Jason- 1 satellites. The polar motion data, plus tide-gauge data and independent altimeter data, give useful additional information, with only the polar motion putting constraints on tidal current velocities. The resulting ocean-tide model, plus the dominant elastic body tide, leaves a small residual in observed length-of-day caused by mantle <b>anelasticity.</b> The inferred effective tidal 0 of the anelastic body tide is 90 and is in line with a omega-alpha frequency dependence with alpha in the range 0. 2 [...] 0. 3...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{measurement}} of G which {{will use a}} torsion pendulum in the ‘dynamic’ (time-of-swing) mode, measuring the influence of field source masses on the pendulum’s oscillation period, is being prepared at UC Irvine. Features of the design include: (i) operation at cryogenic temperature (2 K) to reduce thermal noise and increase frequency stability and for ease of magnetic shielding, (ii) large pendulum oscillation amplitudes to increase signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the effect of amplitude-determination error, (iii) use {{of a pair of}} source mass rings to produce an extremely uniform field gradient; and (iv) use of a thin quartz plate as a torsion pendulum to minimize sensitivity to pendulum density inhomogeneity and dimensional uncertainties. The ‘dynamic ’ method to be used has the great advantage of requiring no angular displacement measurement or calibrating force, but, as pointed out by Kuroda, the method is subject to systematic error associated with the anelastic properties of a torsion fibre. We demonstrate that, for the linear <b>anelasticity</b> discussed by Kuroda, the fractional error introduced by <b>anelasticity</b> in such measurements of G is bounded by 0 6 G=G 6 12 Q− 1, where Q is the torsional oscillation quality factor of the pendulum.

At the early stages of deformation, prior to the onset of extensive prismatic slip, the anelastic strain is less dependent on strain rate but varies between the alloys. Upon the activation of extensive prismatic slip, the anelastic strain starts to saturate at a maximum. The maximum increases with increasing strain rate and varies between alloys. The strain-rate dependence of the maximum anelastic strain can be interpreted in terms of solid solution softening/hardening of slip planes and their influence on twinning.
