5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker <b>asphalt</b> <b>pavement</b> that was largely impervious to water.|$|E

A binding agent may be mixed in to form a base course for the new pavement, or it may be left unbound to form a subbase course.

25|$|There {{are also}} other methods and {{materials}} to create pavements that have appearance of brick pavements. The first method to create brick texture is to heat an <b>asphalt</b> <b>pavement</b> and use metal wires to imprint a brick pattern using a compactor to create stamped asphalt. A similar {{method is to}} use rubber imprinting tools to press over {{a thin layer of}} cement to create decorative concrete. Another method is to use a brick pattern stencil and apply a surfacing material over the stencil. Materials that can be applied to give the color of the brick and skid resistance can be in many forms. An example is to use colored polymer-modified concrete slurry which can be applied by screeding or spraying. Another material is aggregate-reinforced thermoplastic which can be heat applied to the top layer of the brick-pattern surface. Other coating materials over stamped asphalt are paints and two-part epoxy coating.|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} of solar energy using <b>asphalt</b> <b>pavements</b> {{has got a}} wide importance in the present energy scenario. <b>Asphalt</b> <b>pavements</b> subjected to solar radiation can reach temperature up to 70 °C because of their excellent heat absorbing property.

By 1964, there were new <b>asphalt</b> <b>pavement</b> platforms on both the northbound main track and the southbound team track, crossing gates had been installed and the paint scheme was fading to a darker green.
