H 577 P CEE 2015 WangDxii, 193 pages :color illustrationsThe number {{concentration}} and size-resolved properties of acidic ultrafine particles (AUFPs) {{have been observed}} to more closely associate with adverse health effects than do indices of total particulate mass. However, no reliable measurement techniques are currently available to quantify the {{number concentration}} and the size distribution of ambient AUFPs. In this study, a method {{with the use of}} iron nanofilm detectors for enumeration and size measurement of acid aerosols was developed and refined. An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was improved and a diffusion sampler (DS) was designed as short-term and long-term collection system respectively with iron nanofilm detectors to measure the number concentration and size distribution of airborne AUFPs. Field campaigns were undertaken in rural and urban environments in Hong Kong to validate the method. Then the number concentration and size distributions of airborne AUFPs were quantified, the formation and growth processes of airborne AUFPs at these two different sites were investigated. The main contents and results are summarized as follows: (1) A method with the use of iron nanofilm detectors for enumeration and size measurement of acid aerosols was developed and refined. Standard sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) or ammonium hydrogen sulfate (NH₄HSO₄) droplets and sulfuric acidcoated particles were generated and deposited on the detectors causing reaction spots. The dimensions of the reaction spots were examined with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to establish the correlations between the diameter of the particle {{and the size of the}} reaction spot. To validate this method, a field measurement was conducted from 06 September to 30 November, 2010 at Mt. Tai Mo Shan, a rural site in Hong Kong. Scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) were utilized as the collection system. A commercially available online measurement system, i. e., SMPS+CPC (condensation particle counter) was simultaneously used in the field measurement. The results indicated that the particle number (PN) concentrations obtained from the AFM scanning of the exposed detectors via SMPS+ESP collection system were comparable to those derived from the SMPS + CPC measurements (p > 0. 05). The average geometric mean diameter of particles measured by the SMPS + CPC and the detectors scanned by the AFM was 52. 3 ± 6. 9 nm and 51. 9 ± 3. 1 nm, respectively, showing good agreement. It is suggested that the iron nanofilm detectors could be a reliable tool for the measurement and analysis of acidic particles in the atmosphere. (2) Besides the ESP, a diffusion sampler (DS) with iron nanofilm detectors was designed for long-term collection of airborne AUFPs. The developed DS was made of stainless steel with a flat and rectangular channel with 1. 0 mm height, 50 mm width and 500 mm length. The iron nanofilm detectors were deployed on rectangular recesses inside the sampler at three different locations along the length of the channel to collect the ultrafine particles. The exposed detectors were then scanned using an AFM to numerate and distinguish the AUFPs from the non-acidic UFPs. Prior to sampling, the semi-empirical equations for the diffusive deposition efficiency of particles at the different detector locations in the sampler were obtained based on theoretical diffusive mechanism and modified by the experimental data. After calibration, the DS + AFM method and SMPS+CPC system were simultaneously used in a one-month field measurement conducted from 22 December 2010 to 20 January 2011 at an urban site. Both methods showed very good agreement in terms of total PN concentration and size. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the number concentration and size distribution of acidic particles estimated by the DS+AFM method were reliable. (3) At the rural site, the potential formation and growth processes of new particles were investigated. New particle formation (NPF) events were found on 12 out of 35 days with the estimated formation rate J 5. 5 from 0. 97 to 10. 2 cm⁻³ s⁻¹, and the average growth rates from 1. 5 to 8. 4 nm h⁻¹. The events usually began at 10 : 00 ~ 11 : 00 local time characterized by the occurrence of a nucleation mode with a peak diameter of 6 ~ 10 nm. Solar radiation, wind speed, sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and ozone (O₃) concentrations were on average higher, whereas temperature, relative humidity and nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentration were lower on NPF days than on non-NPF days. Back trajectory analysis suggested that in majority of the NPF event days, the air masses originated from the northwest to northeast directions. The observed associations of the estimated formation rate J 5. 5 and the growth rate GR 5. 5 - 25 with gaseous sulfuric acid and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) suggested the critical roles of sulfuric acid and biogenic VOCs (e. g., αpinene and βpinene) in the new particle formation. (4) At the urban site, the potential causes and factors influencing <b>acidic</b> <b>particle</b> number concentrations were investigated. Northeastern monsoon prevailed during the sampling period. Apart from PN peaks appeared in traffic rush hours (i. e., 08 : 00 - 09 : 00 and 17 : 00 - 18 : 00), a distinct peak of PN concentrations in the afternoon (11 : 00 - 16 : 00) was observed during the sampling period. Concurrent measurement data of PSD, O₃ and SA concentrations revealed that the afternoon peaks observed were likely due to NPF via photochemical reactions. These NPF events were frequently observed under clean and dry weather in Hong Kong. Besides the NPF events, we also found four nucleation mode particle burst events, typically with increased number concentrations of nucleation mode particles (Nnuc) without growth to larger size particles. These burst events were generally accompanied by high-level primary air pollutants, i. e., sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO), low SR and high CS conditions. The very different characteristics of the burst events from those of the NPF events indicated that these nucleation mode particle burst events were not caused by the photochemical reactions, but by the primary emission from the local combustion source(s). Overall, this study developed a novel method to quantify the number concentration of acidic ultrafine particles in the air, and improved the understanding of the sources and formation of acidic ultrafine particles in the rural and urban environments. These results, besides their scientific values, will have direct implications for the local and regional control efforts for reducing <b>acidic</b> <b>particle</b> pollution.

In this work, acid-catalyzed reactions of gas-phase MVK with ammonium sulfate (AS), ammonium bisulfate (ABS), and sulfuric acid (SA) particles were investigated in a flow reaction system at relative humidity (RH) of 40 % and 80 %. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-TOFMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) are utilized to identify particle-phase products for developing the reaction mechanisms. High-order oligomers such as dimers and tetramers were detected when ABS and SA particles were used, while no oligomeric products were found when AS particles were used. Particle-phase oligomeric products were formed via i) acid-catalyzed aldol reaction with or without dehydration and/or ii) acid-catalyzed hydration followed by oligomerization. Reactions on SA particles yield more abundant and higher-order oligomers up to hexamers than on ABS particles. Moreover, aldol reaction occurred only on SA particles, but hydration followed by oligomerization occurred in both ABS and SA particles. The high RH condition with {{the same type of}} <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> was found to favor hydration and facilitate the subsequent oligomerization, while the low RH condition with the same type of <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> was found to favor aldol reaction with dehydration (aldol condensation).

40|$|Dimethylamine (DMA) has a {{stabilizing}} {{effect on}} sulfuric acid (SA) clusters, and the SA and DMA molecules and clusters likely play {{important roles in}} both aerosol particle formation and growth in the atmosphere. We use the monodisperse particle growth model for acid-base chemistry in nanoparticle growth (MABNAG) together with direct and indirect observations from the CLOUD 4 and CLOUD 7 experiments in the cosmics leaving outdoor droplets (CLOUD) chamber at CERN to investigate the size and composition evolution of freshly formed particles consisting of SA, DMA, and water as they grow to 20 nm in dry diameter. Hygroscopic growth factors are measured using a nano-hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (nano-HTDMA), which combined with simulations of particle water uptake using the thermodynamic extended-aerosol inorganics model (E-AIM) constrain the chemical composition. MABNAG predicts a particle-phase ratio between DMA and SA molecules of 1. 1 – 1. 3 for a 2 nm particle and DMA gas-phase mixing ratios between 3. 5 and 80 pptv. These ratios agree well with observations by an atmospheric-pressure interface time-of-flight (APi-TOF) mass spectrometer. Simulations with MABNAG, direct observations of the composition of clusters < 2 nm, and indirect observations of the particle composition indicate that the acidity of the nucleated particles decreases as they grow from ∼ 1 to 20 nm. However, MABNAG predicts less <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> than suggested by the indirect estimates at 10 nm diameter using the nano-HTDMA measurements, and less <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> than observed by a thermal desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometer (TDCIMS) at 10 – 30 nm.

40|$|High-resolution {{continuous}} profiles {{were obtained}} on the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) ice core using two different electrical methods. After correction for temperature and density, the electrical conductivity method (ECM) technique responds only to acidity, while dielectric profiling (DEP) responds to acid, ammonium, and chloride. Detailed chemistry on {{a section of}} glacial-age ice allows us to confirm the calibration factor for chloride in DEP. Acidity dominates the DEP variability in the Holocene, Allerod/Bolling, and larger interstadials; ammonium dominates in the Younger Dry as, while chloride is the major contributor in cold periods including smaller interstadials. From the electrical signals plotted on a linear timescale we can deduce the background (nonvolcanic) acidity of the ice, varying from always acidic in the Holocene to always alkaline in the cold periods. In the interstadials, the ice is close to neutral, with most of it acidic in larger interstadials, most of it alkaline in smaller ones, and rapid alternations within interstadials. It {{is not clear whether}} neutralization of individual <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> occurred in the atmosphere or whether acid and alkaline particles coexisted until deposition in the snowpack. The changes in acidity observed at GRIP apply at least to all of Greenland and probably to much of North America.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to explore structure-property relationships to develop the understanding needed for introduction of superior PEM materials. Polymer electrolyte membranes based on sulfonated poly(ether ketone ketone) (SPEKK) were fabricated using N-methyl pyrrolidone as casting solvent. The membranes were characterized in terms of properties that were relevant to fuel cell applications, such as proton conductivity, methanol permeability, and swelling properties, among others. It was found in this study that the proton conductivity of neat SPEKK membranes could reach the conductivity of commercial membranes such as Nafion®. However, when the conductivity of SPEKK was comparable to Nafion®, the swelling of SPEKK in water was quite excessive. The swelling problem was remedied by modifying the microstructure of SPEKK using different techniques. One of them involved blending of lightly sulfonated PEKK with highly <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> (sulfonated crosslinked polystyrene-SXLPS). Low sulfonation level of SPEKK was used to reduce the swelling of the membrane in water {{and the role of the}} highly <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> was to enhance the proton conductivity of the membrane. Because of the residual crystallinity in SPEKK with low sulfonation levels (IEC 3 ̆c 1 meq/g), the composite membranes exhibited excellent dimensional stability in water at elevated temperatures (30 - 90 °C). Also, the resistance to swelling of these composite membranes in methanol-water mixtures was far better than Nafion®, and so was the methanol permeability. Another technique explored was blending with non-conductive polymers (poly(ether imide) and poly(ether sulfone)) to act as mechanical reinforcement. It was found that miscibility behavior of the blends had a significant impact on the transport and swelling properties of these blends, which could be explained by the blend microstructure. The miscibility behavior was found to be strongly dependent on the sulfonation level of SPEKK. The conductivities of the blends were enhanced by as much as two orders of magnitude when the morphology was modified by electric field. The last approach was ionic crosslinking of the sulfonate groups in SPEKK using divalent cations, specifically barium ions. The crosslinking treatment has greatly improved the thermal stability of the membranes in both dry and wet conditions. ...|$|R

Inhalation toxicological studies were conducted, exposing laboratory animals, at rest and during exercise, to multicomponent atmospheric mixtures under conditions {{favorable to the}} formation of acidic reaction products. Effects of acid and ozone mixtures on early and late clearance of insoluble radioactive particles in the lungs of rats appeared to be dominated by the oxidant component (i. e., the mixture did cause effects that were significantly different from those of ozone alone). Histopathological evaluations showed that sulfuric acid particles alone did not cause inflammatory responses in centriacinar units of rat lung parenchyma (expressed in terms of percent lesion area) but did cause significant damage (cell killing followed by a wave of cell replication) in nasal respiratory epithelium, as measured by uptake of tritiated thymidine in the DNA of replicating cells. Mixtures of ozone {{and nitrogen}} dioxide, which form nitric acid, caused significant inflammatory responses in lung parenchyma (in excess of effects seen in rats exposed to ozone alone), but did not damage nasal epithelium. Mixtures containing <b>acidic</b> sulfate <b>particles,</b> ozone, and nitrogen dioxide damaged both lung parenchyma and nasal epithelia. In rats exposed at rest, the response of the lung appeared to be dominated by the oxidant gas-phase components, while responses in the nose were dominated by the <b>acidic</b> <b>particles.</b> In rats exposed at exercise, however, mixtures of ozone and sulfuric acid particles significantdy (2. 5 -fold) elevated the degree of lung lesion formation over that seen in rats exposed to ozone alone under an identical exercise protocol...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric aerosols, {{exposed to}} various {{dispersing}} gases, undergo evolution of chemical composition and subsequent growth/ shrinkage. The model developed considers a multi-component aerosol particle situated within a smelter plume. The particle evolves {{with respect to}} size and composition due to the absorption of gases, both emitted and ambient. Processes {{to be considered in}} this absorption are: diffusion of gases to the particle surface, gas/liquid interfacial equilibrium, and liquid phase chemistry. The gases in the plume undergo advection, turbulent diffusion, settling, and gas-to-particle conversion, dispersing eventually into a low humidity environment. The conversion mechanism was first considered a simple first-order removal term, then considered to be a function of liquid phase chemistry. The model is applied to consider secondary sulfate formation within a copper smelter plume in an arid environment. Sulfate formation is found to occur early in the plume trajectory, where SO 2 levels are highest, and is a strong function of ambient ammonia levels.

40|$|An {{electrodynamic}} balance {{was used}} to investigate the uptake of octanal vapor by single sulfuric acid droplets levitated under various relative humidity (RH) conditions and gas-phase octanal concentrations. In the high octanal concentration experiments (200300 ppm), we observed that the organic mass yield depended on the acidity of the sulfuric acid droplets and significant uptake of octanal only occurred when the RH was about 10 % (H 2 SO 4 wt% similar to 64 %). Furthermore, repartitioning of {{only a portion of}} condensed organic compounds was observed after active dilution with octanal-free compressed air, indicating that low-volatility products had formed and that repartitioning is important in affecting the organic mass fraction and chemical composition of atmospheric organic aerosols. When a relatively lower octanal concentration (700 - 900 ppb) was used, no significant uptake of octanal vapor by the sulfuric acid droplets was observed even at 10 % RH with long exposure time (> 25 h). Our findings suggest that both particle acidity and gas-phase octanal concentration are the critical factors that influence the organic mass yield of levitated acidic droplets. Because of the severe conditions of low RH and high octanal conditions required to effect the reactions, the reactive uptake of aldehydes, especially those that have chemical structures and properties very similar to octanal, into <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> may not be an important pathway in secondary organic aerosol formation under actual atmospheric conditions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{relationship}} between air pollutants, particularly <b>acidic</b> <b>particles,</b> and metallic material corrosion. An atmospheric corrosion test {{was carried out in}} spring-summer 2012 at a polluted urban site, i. e., Tung Chung in western Hong Kong. Nine types of metallic materials, namely iron, Q 235 steel, 20 # steel, 16 Mn steel, copper, bronze, brass, aluminum, and aluminum alloy, were selected as specimens for corrosion tests. Ten sets of the nine materials were all exposed to ambient air, and then each set was collected individually after exposure to ambient air for consecutive 6, 13, 20, 27, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, and 70 days, respectively. After the removal of the corrosion products {{on the surface of the}} exposed specimens, the corrosion rate of each material was determined. The surface structure of materials was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after the corrosion tests. Environmental factors including temperature, relative humidity, concentrations of gaseous pollutants, i. e., sulfur dioxide (SO?), nitrogen dioxide (NO?), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O?), and particulate-phase pollutants, i. e., PM?. ? (FSP) and PM?? (RSP), were monitored. Correlation analysis between environmental factors and corrosion rate of materials indicated that iron and carbon steel were damaged by both gaseous pollutants (SO? and NO?) and particles. Copper and copper alloys were mainly corroded by gaseous pollutants (SO? and O?), while corrosion of aluminum and aluminum alloy was mainly attributed to NO? and particles.

40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of {{epidemiological}} studies have concluded that ambient particulate exposure is associated with increased mortality and morbidity at PM concentrations well below those previously thought to affect human health. These {{studies have been conducted}} in several different geographical locations and have involved a range of populations. While the consistency of the findings and the presence of an apparent concentration response relationship provide a strong argument for causality, epidemiological studies can only conclude this based upon inference from statistical associations. The biological plausibility of a causal relationship between low concentrations of PM and daily mortality and morbidity rates is neither intuitively obvious nor expected based on past experimental studies on the toxicity of inhaled particles. Chronic toxicity from inhaled, poorly soluble particles has been observed based on the slow accumulation of large lung burdens of particles, not on small daily fluctuations in PM levels. Acute toxicity from inhaled particles is associated mainly with <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> and is observed at much higher concentrations than those observed in the epidemiology studies reporting an association between PM concentrations and morbidity/mortality. To approach the difficult problem of determining if the association between PM concentrations and daily morbidity and mortality is biologically plausible and causal, one must consider (1) the chemical and physical characteristics of the particles in the inhaled atmospheres, (2) the characteristics of the morbidity/mortality observed {{and the people who are}} affected, and (3) potential mechanisms that might link the two...|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis aims {{to improve}} the {{knowledge}} on the processes and chemical species in the gas- and particle-phases {{that are involved in}} the production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from monoterpene oxidation in the atmosphere. A denuder/filter technique that enabled the simultaneous sampling of gaseous and particulate compounds was applied in the present study. The sampling technique was comprehensively characterised and optimised using twelve atmospherically relevant carbonyl compounds. The present study improved the denuder coating procedure and the sampling performance. An additional coating with the derivatisation reagent, 2, 4 ‑dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), reduced the break-through potential (e. g., from 98 % to 0. 9 % for methyl vinyl ketone) and the fraction of carbonyl compounds on the filter material (e. g., from 8. 7 % to 0 % for acetone). Calibration experiments against an aerosol chamber were performed to reduce the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the calibration points in the denuder measurements. The RSDs were reduced by half for acetone, acetaldehyde, methyl vinyl ketone, glyoxal, benzaldehyde and campholenic aldehyde using a XAD‑ 4 /DNPH denuder, and the quantification error was also reduced. This sampling technique was then applied to a series of α- and β-pinene ozonolysis experiments. The present study examined the influence of an OH radical scavenger (CO), and hence the HO 2 /RO 2 ratio, on the SOA formation, product distribution and partitioning behaviour of selected oxidation products in conjunction with different seed particle acidities. It was shown that SOA yields increased by about 8 % in α-pinene ozonolysis when CO and <b>acidic</b> seed <b>particles</b> co-existed, whereas only a marginal difference was observed (increase of 2 %) for β-pinene compared to neutral seed particles. From the denuder/filter sample analysis, it was possible to tentatively identify a new compound from the α-pinene ozonolysis, i. e., terpenylic aldehyde. Gas- and particle-phase yields were estimated for the first time for this compound (i. e., 1 % and 0. 4 %, respectively). The atmospheric relevance of terpenylic aldehyde was demonstrated based on ambient filter measurements and a possible formation pathway was suggested. Furthermore, the present study provided an additional explanation for enhanced SOA formation when <b>acidic</b> seed <b>particles</b> are used in monoterpene ozonolysis. It was demonstrated that the isomerisation of monoterpene oxides on <b>acidic</b> seed <b>particles</b> leads to the formation of highly reactive SOA precursors, whose subsequent reaction with ozone contributes significantly to SOA formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the miniature Versatile Aerosol Concentration Enrichment System (m-VACES; Geller et al., 2005) was investigated in laboratory and field studies using online instruments. Laboratory tests focused {{on the behavior of}} monodisperse ammonium sulfate (AS) or dioctyl sebacate (DOS) particles in the m-VACES measured with the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). The ambient measurements were conducted at an urban site in Helsinki, Finland, where the operation of the m-VACES was explored in conjunction with a Soot Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS) in addition to the SMPS. In laboratory tests, the growth of particles in water vapor produced a stable droplet size distribution independent of the original particle size. However, when the droplets were dried with the goal of measuring the original size distribution, a shift to larger particles was observed for small particle sizes (up to ~ 200 nm in mobility diameter). That growth was probably caused by water-soluble organic compounds absorbed on the water droplets from the gas phase, but not evaporated in the drying phase. In ambient measurements, a similar enrichment was observed for nitrate and sulfate in the m-VACES whereas the presence of <b>acidic</b> ambient <b>particles</b> affected the enrichment of ammonium. Gaseous ammonia was likely to be absorbed on <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> in the m-VACES, neutralizing the aerosol. For organics, the enrichment efficiency was comparable with sulfate and nitrate but a small positive artifact for hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing organic compounds was noticed. Ambient and concentrated organic aerosol (OA) was analyzed further with positive matrix factorization (PMF). A three-factor solution was chosen for both of the data sets but the factors were slightly different for the ambient and concentrated OA, however, the data set used for the PMF analysis was limited in size (3 days) and therefore had substantial uncertainty. Overall, the operation of the m-VACES was not found to lead to any severe sampling artifacts. The effect of acidity could be an issue in locations where the aerosol is acidic, however, in those cases the use of a denuder (which was not used in this study) is recommended. Further ambient tests are needed for the characterization of the m-VACES as the time period for the ambient measurements was only 5 days in this study. Especially for OA additional tests are important as the chemical properties of organics can differ widely depending on time and location...|$|R

Apparent partitioning coefficients (K-p,K-rxn) were estimated from the GP experiments by including the reaction products. Only under extremely low RH conditions (RH < 5 %) did the values of K-p,K-rxn (similar to 5 x 10 (- 6) m(3) /mu g for limonene and similar to 2 x 10 (- 5) m(3) /mu g for terpineol) substantially exceed the physical partitioning coefficients (K-p = 6. 5 x 10 (- 8) m(3) /mu g for limonene and = 2. 3 x 10 (- 6) m(3) /mu g for terpineol) derived from the absorptive partitioning theory.

The exposed detectors were then scanned using an atomic force microscope (AFM) to numerate and distinguish the AUFPs from the nonacidic UFPs. Prior to sampling, the semi-empirical equations for the diffusive deposition efficiency of particles at the different detector locations in the sampler were obtained on the basis of theoretical diffusive mechanism and modified by the experimental data using polystyrene latex (PSL) standard particles. After calibration, the DS + AFM method and a commercially available online measurement system, i. e., scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) incorporated with a condensation particle counter (CPC), were simultaneously used in a 4 -week field measurement.

As part of the on-going Harvard Study on the Health Effects of Sulfur Dioxide and Respirable Particulates, we have developed monitoring equipment for <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> {{that can be used}} in multiple field settings. Preliminary data suggest that these strong acid aerosol measurements may correlate with respiratory symptoms more closely than similar measurements of particulate matter less than 15 microns in size. These results have led to the beginning of a U. S. -Canadian cooperative study to assess the chronic effects of acid aerosols on the health of North American children. Communities are being selected on the basis of anticipated levels of H 2 SO 4 in ambient air along with predicted levels of ozone and nitrates. Each community will undergo a 1 -year period of every other day, 24 -hr monitoring with newly developed monitoring equipment that will allow for quantification of H+ ion concentrations, as well as for specific measures of ozone and acid fractions. At the end of the 1 -year period, while measurements are still being made, approximately 600 children aged 7 to 11 in each of up to 24 communities will be assessed with standardized questionnaires completed by parents, and pulmonary function will be measured in the children while in school. By estimating chronic exposure from the year-long measurement of acid aerosols and consideration of specific criteria for selecting communities to study, we hope to minimize potential confounding to allow us to assess the chronic impact of strong acid in the atmosphere on the respiratory health of these children...|$|R
40|$|The uptake of halogen and nitric acids into <b>acidic</b> {{sulphate}} <b>particles</b> {{has important}} implications for volcano monitoring and the environmental geochemistry of volcanic emissions. Using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) for HCl, HBr and HNO 3, combined with a simple three-parameter model for HF and HI, we show that equilibrium partitioning of halogen and nitric acids into sulphate particles is maximised at high relative humidity (RH), low temperature, low plume dilution (i. e., near-source) and high SO 42 −/SO 2. The addition of metal chlorides (i. e., NaCl) enhances acidic gas partitioning at high RH, but diminishes acidic gas partitioning at low RH due to a decrease in the water content of particles and the formation of Na sulphate salts. We predict that acidic gas partitioning is quantitatively significant (> 1 %) only in cool humid conditions (e. g., > 80 % RH at 298 K), adding confidence to spectroscopic and/or electrochemical determinations of gas ratios (e. g., SO 2 /HCl, HCl/HF) for volcano monitoring. However, acidic gas partitioning remains environmentally important over a wide range of conditions because of the significant variability in the amounts of <b>acidic</b> gases in <b>particle</b> form (Cl−(aq), Br−(aq), I−(aq), NO 3 −(aq), HF(aq)). This may result in diurnal and seasonal changes in acidic gas deposition downwind of the volcano...|$|R
40|$|A light-scattering module was {{coupled to}} an airborne, compact {{time-of-flight}} aerosol mass spectrometer (LS-AMS) to investigate collection efficiency (CE) while obtaining nonrefractory aerosol chemical composition measurements during the Southeast Nexus (SENEX) campaign. In this instrument, particles scatter light from an internal laser beam and trigger saving individual particle mass spectra. Nearly {{all of the}} single-particle data with mass spectra that were triggered by scattered light signals were from particles larger than ∼[*] 280  nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter. Over 33   000 particles are characterized as either prompt (27  %), delayed (15  %), or null (58  %), according to the time and intensity of their total mass spectral signals. The particle mass from single-particle spectra is proportional to that derived from the light-scattering diameter (d va-LS) but not to that from the particle time-of-flight (PToF) diameter (d va-MS) {{from the time of}} the maximum mass spectral signal. The total mass spectral signal from delayed particles was about 80  % of that from prompt ones for the same d va-LS. Both field and laboratory data indicate that the relative intensities of various ions in the prompt spectra show more fragmentation compared to the delayed spectra. The particles with a delayed mass spectral signal likely bounced off the vaporizer and vaporized later on another surface within the confines of the ionization source. Because delayed particles are detected by the mass spectrometer later than expected from their d va-LS size, they can affect the interpretation of particle size (PToF) mass distributions, especially at larger sizes. The CE, measured by the average number or mass fractions of particles optically detected that had measurable mass spectra, varied significantly (0. 2 – 0. 9) in different air masses. The measured CE agreed well with a previous parameterization when CE[*]>[*] 0. 5 for <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> but was sometimes lower than the minimum parameterized CE of 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|Biomass burning {{represents}} a major global source of aerosols impacting direct radiative forcing and cloud properties. Thus, {{the goal of}} a number of current studies involves developing {{a better understanding of how}} the chemical composition and mixing state of biomass burning aerosols evolve during atmospheric aging processes. During the Ice in Cloud Experiment – Layer Clouds (ICE-L) in fall of 2007, smoke plumes from two small Wyoming Bureau of Land Management prescribed burns were measured by on-line aerosol instrumentation aboard a C- 130 aircraft, providing a detailed chemical characterization of the particles. After ~ 2 – 4 min of aging, submicron smoke particles, produced primarily from sagebrush combustion, consisted predominantly of organics by mass, but were comprised primarily of internal mixtures of organic carbon, elemental carbon, potassium chloride, and potassium sulfate. Significantly, 100 % of the fresh biomass burning particles contained minor mass fractions of nitrate and sulfate, suggesting that hygroscopic material is incorporated very near or at the point of emission. The mass fractions of ammonium, sulfate, and nitrate increased with aging up to ~ 81 – 88 min and resulted in <b>acidic</b> <b>particles,</b> with both nitric acid and sulfuric acid present. Decreasing black carbon mass concentrations occurred due to dilution of the plume. Increases in the fraction of oxygenated organic carbon and the presence of dicarboxylic acids, in particular, were observed with aging. Cloud condensation nuclei measurements suggested all particles > 100 nm were active at 0. 5 % water supersaturation in the smoke plumes, confirming the relatively high hygroscopicity of the freshly emitted particles. For immersion/condensation freezing, ice nuclei measurements at − 32 °C suggested activation of ~ 0. 03 – 0. 07 % of the particles with diameters greater than 500 nm...|$|R

The physicochemical properties of aerosol particles are complex. They are often irregular in shape, and can contain complex mixtures of liquids and solids. By measuring multiple properties of a particle, {{it is possible}} to describe it more completely than is possible if only one property is evaluated. This is the principle behind the theme of this chapter: tandem aerosol measurements. The Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer carries out tandem measurements of a particle's vacuum aerodynamic diameter and its composition. I describe here the use of the ATOFMS in series with instruments that measure other properties so as to provide still more information. These additional properties include particle mobility, mass, and "brightness" (i. e., the amount of light that it scatters when illuminated by a laser). In addition, we show that when the ATOFMS is used downstream of tandem differential mobility analyzer systems (TDMA), new information can be gained about species that affect a particle's hygroscopicity (HTDMA) or volatility (VTDMA). These novel instrument combinations yield information regarding the dependence of particle effective density, volatility, and hygroscopicity on particle composition. Additional information is presented about the relationship between particle mobility size and vacuum aerodynamic size for assorted particle types and about the unanticipated difficulties that I encountered when using the ATOFMS for tandem measurements. I discovered that the rotating seals in the aerosol particle mass analyzer (APM) contain compounds that volatilize and react with <b>acidic</b> <b>particles.</b> The ATOFMS is exceedingly sensitive to these reaction products, so much so that {{it is not possible to}} obtain meaningful information about the composition of the particles under investigation. This sensitivity may provide a sensitive means, however, to assess the particle acidity...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometers (AMS) {{have been}} used in many {{locations}} around the world to study the size-resolved, nonrefractory chemical composition of ambient particles. In order to obtain quantitative data, the mass or (number) of particles detected by the AMS relative to the mass (or number) of particles sampled by the AMS, i. e., the AMS collection efficiency (CE) must be known. Previous studies have proposed and used parameterizations of the AMS CE basedontheaerosol composition and sampling line relative humidity. Here, we evaluate these parameterizations by comparing AMS mass concentrations with independent measurements of fine particle volume or particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS) ion chromatography measurements for 3 field campaigns with different dominant aerosol mixtures: (1) <b>acidic</b> sulfate <b>particles,</b> (2) aerosol containing a high mass fraction of ammonium nitrate, and (3) aerosol composed o...|$|R

Due to the nano-property superparamagnetism the particles are switchable magnets and can be separated together with their load from water by an external magnetic field gradient.

40|$|Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) {{formation}} from photooxidation of α -pinene {{has been}} investigated in a photochemical reaction chamber under varied inorganic seed particle acidity levels at moderate relative humidity. The effect of particle acidity on SOA yield and chemical composition was examined under high- and low-NO x conditions. The SOA yield (4. 2 – 7. 6  %) increased nearly linearly {{with the increase in}} particle acidity under high-NO x conditions. In contrast, the SOA yield (28. 6 – 36. 3  %) was substantially higher under low-NO x conditions, but its dependency on particle acidity was insignificant. A relatively strong increase in SOA yield (up to 220  %) was observed in the first hour of α -pinene photooxidation under high-NO x conditions, suggesting that SOA formation was more effective for early α -pinene oxidation products in the presence of fresh <b>acidic</b> <b>particles.</b> The SOA yield decreased gradually with the increase in organic mass in the initial stage (approximately 0 – 1  h) under high-NO x conditions, which is likely due to the inaccessibility to the acidity over time with the coating of α -pinene SOA, assuming a slow particle-phase diffusion of organic molecules into the inorganic seeds. The formation of later-generation SOA was enhanced by particle acidity even under low-NO x conditions when introducing <b>acidic</b> seed <b>particles</b> after α -pinene photooxidation, suggesting a different acidity effect exists for α -pinene SOA derived from later oxidation stages. This effect could be important in the atmosphere under conditions where α -pinene oxidation products in the gas-phase originating in forested areas (with low NO x and SO x) are transported to regions abundant in acidic aerosols such as power plant plumes or urban regions. The fraction of oxygen-containing organic fragments (C x H y O 1 + 33 – 35  % and C x H y O 2 + 16 – 17  %) in the total organics and the O ∕ C ratio (0. 52 – 0. 56) of α -pinene SOA were lower under high-NO x conditions than those under low-NO x conditions (39 – 40, 17 – 19, and 0. 61 – 0. 64  %), suggesting that α -pinene SOA was less oxygenated in the studied high-NO x conditions. The fraction of nitrogen-containing organic fragments (C x H y N z + and C x H y O z N p +) in the total organics was enhanced with the increases in particle acidity under high-NO x conditions, indicating that organic nitrates may be formed heterogeneously through a mechanism catalyzed by particle acidity or that acidic conditions facilitate the partitioning of gas-phase organic nitrates into particle phase. The {{results of this study suggest}} that inorganic acidity has a significant role to play in determining various organic aerosol chemical properties such as mass yields, oxidation state, and organic nitrate content. The acidity effect being further dependent on the timescale of SOA formation is also an important parameter in the modeling of SOA...|$|R
40|$|Given {{significant}} challenges with available {{measurements of}} aerosol acidity, proxy methods are frequently {{used to estimate}} the acidity of atmospheric particles. In this study, four {{of the most common}} aerosol acidity proxies are evaluated and compared: (1) the ion balance method, (2) the molar ratio method, (3) thermodynamic equilibrium models, and (4) the phase partitioning of ammonia. All methods are evaluated against predictions of thermodynamic models and against direct observations of aerosol–gas equilibrium partitioning acquired in Mexico City during the Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Objectives (MILAGRO) study. The ion balance and molar ratio methods assume that any deficit in inorganic cations relative to anions is due to the presence of H + and that a higher H + loading and lower cation / anion ratio both correspond to increasingly <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> (i. e., lower pH). Based on the MILAGRO measurements, no correlation is observed between H + levels inferred with the ion balance and aerosol pH predicted by the thermodynamic models and NH 3 –NH 4 + partitioning. Similarly, no relationship is observed between the cation / anion molar ratio and predicted aerosol pH. Using only measured aerosol chemical composition as inputs without any constraint for the gas phase, the E-AIM (Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model) and ISORROPIA-II thermodynamic equilibrium models tend to predict aerosol pH levels that are inconsistent with the observed NH 3 –NH 4 + partitioning. The modeled pH values from both E-AIM and ISORROPIA-II run with gas + aerosol inputs agreed well with the aerosol pH predicted by the phase partitioning of ammonia. It appears that (1) thermodynamic models constrained by gas + aerosol measurements and (2) the phase partitioning of ammonia provide the best available predictions of aerosol pH. Furthermore, neither the ion balance nor the molar ratio can be used as surrogates for aerosol pH, and previously published studies with conclusions based on such acidity proxies may need to be reevaluated. Given the significance of acidity for chemical processes in the atmosphere, the implications of this study are important and far reaching...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} are {{a complex}} mixture of inorganic and organic compounds from different sources. They exert {{a variety of}} effects on our macro- and micro-environments, including those to the global climate, regional visibility and human health. These effects are not very well understood because of the formation processes of atmospheric aerosols, especially organic aerosols, remain poorly constrained. For better prediction of organic aerosol formation using modeling approaches, studies of the formation processes of organic aerosols in mechanistic details are in great need. In this study, we investigated two chemical processes {{that can lead to}} formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), which are defined as organic aerosols involving chemical reactions after emissions as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The first process is the gas-phase oxidation of biogenic VOCs. A sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene, {{which is one of the}} most abundant sesquiterpenes emitted by plants, was used as a model compound. The gas-phase oxidation was conducted in a continuous-flow chamber that allows steady-state equilibrium of the gas-phase oxidation and gas-to-particle partitioning, forming SOA. Particles were characterized by an ultra performance liquid chromatograph-time of flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-ToF-MS). Results show that highly oxygenated compounds are formed under ozone-rich conditions. Multi-functional products with 3 to 5 oxygen atoms, with one up to 7, were identified. In contrast to products from previous studies that focused on first-generation reactions, these second-generation products are less volatile and are predicted to be predominantly in the particle phase. The second process is the particle-phase acid-catalyzed reactions of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). An aliphatic aldehyde (octanal) and biogenic alkenes (limonene and terpineol) were used as model compounds to study the sulfuric acid-catalyzed reactions of two types of functional groups (C=O and C=C). A flow cell reactor with <b>acidic</b> <b>particles</b> deposited on a substrate and gas-phase organics passing through the reactor was used to perform the reactions. Product identification and semi-quantification were carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Multiple steps of aldol condensation reactions were observed for octanal under extremely acidic conditions, i. e., low relative humidity (RH), while no significant uptake was observed under high RH conditions. For biogenic alkenes, the reactive uptake was also strongly dependent on RH, with large amounts of dimers and trimers formed under low RH conditions and only hydroxylated products under high RH conditions...|$|R
