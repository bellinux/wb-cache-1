5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of the BBC's Shetland (TV series) {{was filmed}} on {{mainland}} Scotland, {{the cast and}} crew did work in Shetland on occasion, particularly in and near Lerwick.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of {{the first}} film's cast {{returned}} for the sequel, Anne Hathaway was replaced by Hayden Panettiere {{in the role of}} Red and Jim Belushi was replaced by Martin Short in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of the {{industry}} that dominated Worsley was in decline, in 1937 Sir Montague Maurice Burton opened a clothing factory along the East Lancashire Road. Built in the Art Deco style, in 1938 the factory employed 3,000people.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of Stanford's {{music is}} {{neglected}} in the concert hall, {{a considerable amount}} has been recorded. Complete cycles of the symphonies have been recorded for the Chandos and Naxos labels, under the conductors Vernon Handley and David Lloyd-Jones. Other orchestral works recorded for CD include the six Irish Rhapsodies, the Clarinet Concerto, the Second Piano Concerto and the Second Violin Concerto.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of Thoughts {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of {{his life}} remains obscure, Nerva was {{considered}} a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians. Nerva's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death by selecting Trajan as his heir, thus founding the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of the SSSI is {{in private}} hands, {{considerable}} areas are managed by large conservation organisations. As {{well as the}} two NNRs, there is an RSPB reserve at Titchwell Marsh, and Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserves are at Cley and Salthouse Marshes. The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR. In addition to Blakeney Point, the National Trust owns land at Brancaster Staithe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of {{the upper}} reaches are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept the navigation profitable for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of {{this work}} has focused on {{independent}} sets in sparse graphs, a case {{that does not make}} sense for the complementary clique problem, there has also been work on approximation algorithms that do not use such sparsity assumptions.|$|E

5|$|As Part III progresses, the {{narrative}} switches to describing their upper-class {{life on the}} island, and filling details of the lifestyle the family was born into. The story of the voodoo practicing Haitian family maid is elucidated: she escaped Trujillo's massacre of Haitians and came to work for Laura, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> of her family was not so lucky.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} that there were 10,000 foxes in London. City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{have speculated}} that a {{contributor}} to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation. By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} {{assigned}} as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913, {{only to have}} its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915, falling through the roof. General de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 6 April 1921 at the cathedral. The building experienced extensive damage during World War II, and was partially rebuilt, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> of the old altar and furnishings were not replaced.|$|E
5|$|The most similar European thrush {{species is}} the redwing (T. iliacus), but that bird {{has a strong}} white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a red underwing in flight. The mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) is much larger and has white tail corners, and the Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis), <b>although</b> <b>much</b> more similar in plumage, has black face {{markings}} and does not overlap in range.|$|E

5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. <b>Although</b> <b>much</b> of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|Additional optical {{effects were}} {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. Meyer and the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, as had {{been done in the}} original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> of the matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. At {{least some of the}} rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, <b>although</b> <b>much</b> of the route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E
