5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty {{chocolate}} milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} toaster while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost. The next morning <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table,</b> Lisa asks if there could ever be any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range of Simpson families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, Gardner's {{official}} biography, entitled Gerald Gardner: Witch, was published. It {{was written}} by a friend of his, the Sufi mystic Idries Shah, but used {{the name of one}} of Gardner's High Priests, Jack L. Bracelin, because Shah was wary about being associated with Witchcraft. In May of that year, Gardner travelled to Buckingham Palace, where he enjoyed a garden party in recognition of his years of service to the Empire in the Far East. Soon after his trip, Gardner's wife Donna died, and Gardner himself once again began to suffer badly from asthma. The following year he, along with Shah and Lois Bourne, travelled to the island of Majorca to holiday with the poet Robert Graves, whose The White Goddess would play a significant part in the burgeoning Wiccan religion. In 1963, Gardner decided to go to Lebanon over the winter. Whilst returning home on the ship, The Scottish Prince on 12 February 1964, he suffered a fatal heart attack <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table.</b> He was buried in Tunisia, the ship's next port of call, and his funeral was attended only by the ship's captain. He was 79 years old.|$|E

Karen died of a brain tumor in January 1962, and the couple's second son Mark was born in 1963. [...] Armstrong's first wife, Janet, divorced him in 1994, after 38 years of marriage. He had met his second wife, Carol Held Knight (b. 1945), in 1992 at a golf tournament, where they were seated together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table.</b> She said little to Armstrong, but two weeks later she {{received a call from}} him asking what she was doing—she replied she was cutting down a cherry tree; 35 minutes later Armstrong was at her house to help out. They were married on June 12, 1994, in Ohio, and then had a second ceremony, at San Ysidro Ranch, in California. He lived in Indian Hill, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|Seeking {{to spend}} time with her family, Lois decides to take them out to the ballet Swan Lake, on a late school night. The next morning, Chris is seen {{studying}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table</b> for an upcoming exam at school. After first being told not to study at the table by Lois, Brian notices that Chris's history textbook is hopelessly out of date. Upset by this, Lois goes to a PTA meeting to complain about the textbook. Responding to her grievances, Principal Shepherd explains that the school cannot afford new textbooks due to the school's loss of federal funding under the No Child Left Behind Act {{as a result of their}} low test scores. Forced to make a decision on how to improve the scores and the school's overall performance, Principal Shepherd decides to expel the school's [...] "dumbest" [...] student, who is revealed to be Chris Griffin.|$|E
500|$|When Homer is mowing {{his lawn}} with obvious frustration, his next-door {{neighbor}} Ned Flanders invites {{him into his}} basement rumpus room for a beer. Upon seeing Ned's house and observing his exaggeratedly perfect relationships {{with his wife and}} son, Homer erupts at Ned, accusing him of showing off. Ned angrily asks Homer to leave in response. Later, however, he feels guilty and writes a letter to Homer saying that he is really sorry and that he loves him as a brother. [...] Homer is amused by Ned's sentimentality and reads the letter to the family <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table.</b> Marge is not happy with the family's reaction, despite being unable to control her laughter, and chastises Homer for making light of Ned's sincere apology. Afterward, Homer takes Bart and Maggie to Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre for a round of miniature golf. They unexpectedly run into Ned and his son Todd and end up going golfing together.|$|E

60|$|The {{officers}} {{were invited to}} take their morning's repast <b>at</b> <b>the</b> family <b>breakfast</b> <b>table,</b> and having made their arrangements without, the invitation was frankly accepted. None of the watchfulness, which was so necessary to their situation, was neglected by the wary partisan. Patrols were seen on the distant hills, taking their protecting circuit around their comrades, who were enjoying, {{in the midst of}} danger, a security that can only spring from the watchfulness of discipline and the indifference of habit.|$|R

500|$|... "Peterotica" [...] {{was written}} by Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by Kurt Dumas. The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show's producers. For instance, the original title of the episode was [...] "A Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Butt", but broadcasting standards objected. A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version; one entitled Catcher in the Eye {{was removed from the}} television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover, which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation. The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing, although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it, as it is the second semen joke of the episode. When Lois' father, Carter, sits down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table,</b> Lois states: [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean up?" [...] Originally, she was meant to say, [...] "Daddy, did you remember to wipe yourself?", but broadcasting standards objected, so it was modified to [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean yourself?" [...] However, standards still objected, so it was changed to its current version.|$|E
2500|$|Both of the Fitzgeralds {{had their}} own radio {{programs}} on WOR when Pegeen {{had the idea that}} it might be interesting to broadcast a family's talk <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table.</b> [...] WOR officials initially believed a show like this would fail. The program was originally broadcast from the WOR studios, but Pegeen's illness brought about the temporary need to broadcast the show from the Fitzgerald's apartment. After the couple became the owners of their program, they elected to continue broadcasting from their home.|$|E
2500|$|Paul McCartney {{wrote the}} song while the Beatles were in Rishikesh, India, {{studying}} Transcendental Meditation. The title parodied Chuck Berry's [...] "Back in the U.S.A.," [...] while the chorus and background vocals were a humorous {{take on the}} Beach Boys' [...] "California Girls". Mike Love of the Beach Boys also attended the retreat in Rishikesh {{at the same time}} and he has stated in interviews that, in order to make the song sound more like a Beach Boys number, he encouraged McCartney to [...] "talk about the girls all around Russia, the Ukraine and Georgia" [...] in the lyrics. In 2013, Love noted, [...] "I was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table</b> when Paul McCartney came down with his acoustic guitar playing [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R.". I said, [...] "You ought to put something in about all the girls around Russia," [...] and he did." ...|$|E
