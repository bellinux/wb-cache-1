5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall <b>adjustment</b> <b>is</b> similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or <b>adjustment</b> <b>is</b> required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time <b>adjustment</b> <b>is</b> changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E

25|$|Spinal {{adjustments}} {{were among}} many chiropractic techniques invented in the 19th century by Daniel David Palmer, {{the founder of}} Chiropractic.

This paper generalizes the harmonic adjustment rule by explicitly taking into account measurement and adjustment costs. The generalization is static, in that <b>adjustments</b> <b>are</b> performed at predetermined points. An optimal model and a near-optimal approximation, in which <b>adjustments</b> <b>are</b> spaced roughly according to a geometric sequence, are presented. Skipping small adjustments dynamically may oer further savings, but dynamic models require further research. 1...|$|R

25|$|Olivier Blanchard {{suggests}} that a fiscal union in the EZ can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the EZ peripheral countries. But he adds that the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness <b>adjustment</b> <b>is</b> not tackled. The problem is, since the EZ peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, {{they are forced to}} adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.|$|E
25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no <b>adjustment</b> <b>is</b> required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|E

25|$|Algorism {{comprises}} all of {{the rules}} for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value9, the result is represented with two digits. The rightmost digit is the value for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by {{the value of the}} second (leftmost) digit, which is always one. This <b>adjustment</b> <b>is</b> termed a carry of the value1.|$|E
25|$|The principal, {{anterior}} median, {{eyes have}} high resolution (11 min visual angle), but {{the field of}} vision is narrow, from 2 to 5°. The central region of the retina, where acuity is highest, {{is no more than}} six or seven receptor rows wide. However, the eye can scan objects off the direct axis of vision. As the lens is attached to the carapace, the eye's scanning movements are restricted to its retina through a complicated pattern of translations and rotations. This dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>is</b> a means of compensation for the narrowness of the static field of vision. It is analogous to the way most primates move their eyes to focus images of interest onto the fovea centralis. Such movements within the jumping spider's eyes are visible from outside when the attention of the spider is directed to various targets.|$|E
500|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, {{analogue}} recording was being replaced by digital recording and all forms of electronic entertainment began to converge. For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas [...] "success or failure used {{to be determined by}} the first weekend of its run. Today,... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits." [...] Part of the industry's <b>adjustment</b> <b>is</b> its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well. It is also [...] "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups". Globalisation and cultural imperialism are two of the cultural consequences of convergence. Others include fandom and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods. The [...] "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" [...] also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways for example, audiences can [...] "watch highlights, call up statistics", [...] "order tickets and merchandise" [...] and generally [...] "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>adjustments</b> <b>are</b> cap, fee, {{participation}} rate {{or a combination}} of the three. Other <b>adjustments</b> <b>are</b> less common.

When they were over Mexico, Jim Lovell, the Houston capsule communicator, told them they needed one last correction, a 2.6 ft/s speed addition.|$|R
30|$|The {{frequency}} of wage adjustments initially {{depended on the}} pace of inflation, but has not varied in recent years. <b>Adjustments</b> <b>were</b> made quarterly during 1995 – 96 when inflation was high.
