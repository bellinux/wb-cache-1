However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately.

5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>and</b> the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E

5|$|Sisler {{was solid}} {{for much of}} the first half of the season, not {{allowing}} an earned run until May19, and by June5 he had an ERA of 0.74, a 1–0record with seven saves. It was at the point that his effectiveness declined rapidly, allowing runs to score in four of his next five appearances. In a game against the Red Sox on June18, he relieved starter Carl Mathias, and immediately gave up bases on balls to the first two batters he faced, which forced in two runs, then gave up a grand slam to Jim Pagliaroni. He followed with another base on balls, and was relieved without having recording an out. Over the course of the next couple months, with his ERA steadily rising, his playing time was lessened, making just six appearances in the month of July, and five in August. He made his last major league start on August31 against the Tigers, giving up seven hits and six earned runs for the loss. In 45total appearances in 1961, he had a 2–8win-loss record and finished sixth in AL with 11saves. On September16, the Senators agreed to send $75,000 ($ current dollar <b>adjustment)</b> <b>and</b> a player to be named later to the Cincinnati Reds of the NL for pitcher Claude Osteen. To complete the transaction, Washington sent Sisler to the Reds as that player named on November28.|$|E
