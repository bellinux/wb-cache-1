Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops.

5|$|As he was {{completing}} work on Dubliners in 1906, Joyce considered {{adding another}} story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom {{under the title}} Ulysses.

The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).|$|E

A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane. No beryllium silicide has been identified.|$|E

5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, <b>and</b> <b>Basic</b> Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E
