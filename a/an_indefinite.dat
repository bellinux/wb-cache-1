The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E

5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting <b>an</b> <b>indefinite</b> colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E

40|$|Locative {{sentences}} containing <b>a</b> <b>indefinites</b> exhibit <b>a</b> {{variety of}} non-existential interpretations. This understudied phenomenon is especially problematic for traditional theories that treat indefinites as denoting existential quantifiers. We propose <b>a</b> solution where <b>indefinites</b> denote properties and are assigned locations similarly to other spatial descriptions. This property-based analysis accounts for new observations about {{the correlation between}} non-existential interpretations of locative indefinites and similar geometrical effects with entity-denoting NPs. Thereby, the proposal opens up a new empirical domain for property-based theories of indefinites, with implications {{for the analysis of}} generics, collective descriptions, negative polarity items and part-whole structure. ...|$|R

5|$|Arsenal {{competed in}} the UEFA Cup in the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons and {{departed}} {{in the first and}} second round to FC Winterslag and Spartak Moscow respectively. The Heysel Stadium disaster of May 1985, during the 1985 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus resulted in UEFA, and later FIFA, imposing a 'worldwide' ban on English teams from participating in European club competitions, initially for <b>an</b> <b>indefinite</b> period. Under George Graham, Arsenal returned to the European Cup in the 1991–92 season, having won the league championship a season earlier. They went out in the second round to Portuguese team Benfica in November 1991. The ban arising from the Heysel disaster had prevented Arsenal from competing in the European Cup when they won the league title two years previously, as well as preventing them from competing in the UEFA Cup on two occasions.|$|E
5|$|Braham's {{return to}} Britain {{was not a}} welcome one. His family found him {{exceptionally}} difficult to live with. His short temper and aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family's home in Leicestershire searching for a war-story to print. Braham, who despised publicity, physically ejected them from his property. His decision to shut the media {{out of his life}} likely explains why, even {{as one of the most}} successful aces, he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF. Braham had also become despondent about the political climate in a country that reduced Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition, where the black market was rife and rationing was set to become <b>an</b> <b>indefinite</b> feature of post-war Britain into the 1950s.|$|E
