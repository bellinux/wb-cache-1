Macromolecule polymers as soil amendment provide new territory for studying China's agricultural practices and for soil and water conservation, because polymers {{have the ability to}} improve soil structure, increase rainfall penetration and control slope runoff. Through indoor laboratory experiments and outdoor artificial rainfall simulations, this study applied different consistencies of three amendments; polypropylene acid (PPA), polythene alcoholic (PTA) and urea-formaldehyde poly-condensate (UR) to China's Loess and determined their effects on soil physical properties and on runoff-sediment yield. The results indicate {{that as a result of}} applying the amendments, (1) the water-stable soil aggregates content increases by 17. 3 %, the soil permeability increases by 41. 8 %, the soil density decreases by 11. 2 % and the soil water content increases by 28. 0 % compared to the control; (2) three amendment applied on sloping land can delay runoff and decrease runoff velocity; decrease erosive forces of raindrop impact and flowing water, reduce surface crusting and improve water infiltration, delay runoff engenderation and decrease runnoff velocity and soil erosion yield. Finally, this study also ascertained optimal <b>application</b> <b>quantities</b> and the most effective sort in three amendments, which PPA is most effective at lowering surface runoff, reducing soil loss and increasing soil penetration. These three amendments have broad potential for soil and water conservation; however, the duration of their effect and the optimal <b>application</b> <b>quantities</b> need to be researched further...|$|E
30|$|Effect of {{pesticides}} on the terrestrial life phase (Carsten Brühl, University of Koblenz-Landau Several amphibian species like the fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) or the common spadefoot (Pelobates fuscus) inhabit the agricultural landscape during their summer activity period, resulting in possible terrestrial exposure [2]. Owing to {{the biology of}} the species, {{it is to be}} expected that dermal exposure is the major route of exposure [17, 18]. The skin of amphibians has a unique structure and function that is not comparable to that of mammals. Since it is considerably more permeable, amphibians are more vulnerable to PPPs than other terrestrial vertebrates. The susceptibility of terrestrial amphibians has not yet been described to any great extent, although some studies have shown that PPPs at environmentally relevant concentrations can be toxic for terrestrial life stages of amphibians [19]. Postmetamorphic juvenile European common frogs were directly sprayed with different PPPs in a laboratory study. The mortality of the animals in the case of all seven PPP formulations investigated (4 fungicides, 2 herbicides and 1 insecticide) was high, reaching 100  % at field application rates and 40  % at 10  % field application rate, despite the fact that products and <b>application</b> <b>quantities</b> authorised in Germany and Switzerland have been tested [19]. The authors have noted that in addition to the active substance, co-formulants can also decisively influence the toxicity of PPPs to amphibians.|$|E

It is the important research direction of the energy saving of forklift to improve the working state of engine by means of hybrid technology. Based {{on the study of}} energy distribution, the schemes of parallel and series hybrid systems are evaluated, according to their fuel consumption, equipped power of working components and working parameters. The parallel hybrid system with the capacitor as energy accumulator and the project of energy regeneration with hydraulic motors are explored in detail, combining theoretical analysis. Finally, the energy regeneration,with hydraulic motor, is presented and synthetically evaluated. Foreword Based on the super capacitor hybrid truck and future research is the focus of international research on the forklift, with the frequency control and the continuous development of energy storage devices, hybrid forklift application has also been more technical support. Hybrid forklift key core technology is a hybrid system, its performance is directly related to hybrid forklift vehicle performance.

40|$|Effective {{evaporation}} suppression by a monolayer film is largely {{dependent on the}} maintenance of that film over {{as much of the}} water surface as practically possible. Hence, an autonomous system capable of adaptive re-application of monolayer according to the prevailing wind conditions in order to satisfy this requirement is highly desirable. Key to the design and functioning of a system of this nature is a fundamental understanding of the spatial movement/distribution characteristics of the monolayer material. To ‘bridge’ between centimeter-scale, clean room laboratory experimentation (e. g. with a Petri dish) and field conditions (i. e. hectare-scale open water storages), the spreading rate and dispersion behavior of different <b>application</b> <b>quantities</b> of octadecanol monolayer (in water-emulsion) was investigated on 0. 3 m, 2 m and 6 m diameter laboratory water tanks under zero wind stress. A standard formula for spreading is shown to be applicable to ‘bulk’ monolayer from a center point on circular, open water surfaces of scale 0. 3 m, 2 m and 6 m diameter. Under still conditions, monolayer spread (as expected) in a uniform circular pattern outwards, centered on the point of application. ‘Bulk’ application involved the placement of enough material to form layers 1 ×, 3 × or 6 × monomolecular. Hitherto this has not been demonstrated with either these ‘overdosed’ (3 ×, 6 ×) material quantities or at these scales, scales which come closer to those required for monolayer application for the evaporation mitigation of practical open water storages. An empirical relationship for spreading rate has been developed as a function of both time and storage size...|$|E
40|$|Soybean {{production}} {{can contribute}} to the nitrogen economy of smallholder farming systems, but our understanding of factors explaining variability in nitrogen fixation and rotational benefits across farms and regions is limited. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) was quantified with the natural abundance method in 150 farmer-managed soybean plots under different varieties and inputs in Dowa, Mchinji and Salima districts of Malawi. Soybean yielded on average 1. 2 tha- 1 grain and the above-ground biomass at mid pod filling (R 5. 5) was 2. 8 tha- 1 and contained in total 63 kgha- 1 nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa). Locally sourced varieties obtained a larger %Ndfa (65 %) than the 'improved' variety Nasoko (53 %). The %Ndfa was positively associated with soil sand content, sowing date, plant population and biomass accumulation, but it was not affected by inoculation with rhizobia or the combination of inoculation and NPK fertiliser <b>application.</b> <b>Quantities</b> of N 2 fixed differed between regions and years, and was enhanced by applying inoculant and fertiliser together, leading to more biomass accumulation and larger grain yields. Soil available P and exchangeable K contents also increased the total amount of N 2 fixed. In a related trial, continuous maize yields were compared with maize following soybean in 53 farmer-managed fields. Average yield in continuous maize was 2. 5 tha- 1, while maize after soybean produced 3. 5 tha- 1 (139 % of continuous maize). Farmers with higher maize yields, who applied external nutrient inputs, and with a larger value of household assets achieved greater yield responses to rotation with soybean. A relative yield increase of more than 10 % was observed on 59, 90 and 77 % of the fields in Dowa, Mchinji and Salima respectively. We conclude that fields of soybean and maize that receive adequate nutrient inputs and good management to ensure good yields benefit most in terms of quantities of N 2 fixed by the legume and the yield response of the following maize crop. The results suggest that the promotion of soybean-maize rotations should be done through an integrated approach including the promotion of appropriate soil and crop management techniques. Furthermore, they suggest that wealthier households are more likely to apply adequate nutrient inputs and good crop management practices and are likely to receive larger maize yield responses to the incorporation of soybean...|$|E
