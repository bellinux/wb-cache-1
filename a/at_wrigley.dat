5|$|On July 25, 2015, in {{what would}} be his final start for the Phillies before being traded, Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs 5–0 <b>at</b> <b>Wrigley</b> Field, {{striking}} out 13 and only giving up two walks, both to Dexter Fowler and besting the Cubs' Jake Arrieta—himself a no-hit pitcher a month later, on August 30 of that season. It was the first no-hitter against the Cubs since Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965, and first <b>at</b> <b>Wrigley</b> since the Cubs' Milt Pappas in 1972. Hamels also joined Vida Blue, Mike Witt, Kent Mercker and Kevin Millwood as no-hit pitchers who also pitched in a combined no-hitter.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Winter Classic and its predecessor, outdoor games have been held during {{subsequent}} seasons, and the Winter Classic has become an annual NHL tradition. The next Winter Classic was held on January 1, 2009, <b>at</b> <b>Wrigley</b> Field in Chicago, matching the Detroit Red Wings against the Chicago Blackhawks. Winter Classics have been held in every year since, except for 2013, which was interrupted by the 2012–2013 NHL lockout. Three Heritage Classics, one in 2011, one in 2014, and one in 2016 have been held since. The league expanded its offerings of outdoor games with the introduction of the NHL Stadium Series in 2014. Since the inaugural Winter Classic, the NHL has held 13 additional outdoor games.|$|E

5000|$|Like his father, P.K. was {{a strong}} believer in maximizing media coverage. Starting in the 1920s, the Cubs' games were covered {{extensively}} on the radio, sometimes by competing stations at the same time, for minimal fees. In the post-World War II era, when baseball was booming, Wrigley continued this practice, allowing WGN-TV to carry all the home games {{as well as a}} significant number of road games. Some owners were aghast <b>at</b> <b>Wrigley's</b> [...] "giving away the product", but it paid manifold dividends in the long run, as the evolution of WGN-TV into a superstation developed a truly nationwide fan base for the Cubs, which has resulted in nearly constant sellout crowds <b>at</b> [...] "Beautiful <b>Wrigley</b> Field", regardless of the fortunes of the team at a given time.|$|R

The Sabres hosted the 2008 NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day 2008, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of 71,217 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The second Winter Classic was held January 1, 2009 <b>at</b> <b>Wrigley</b> Field in Chicago between the Blackhawks and Red Wings. The third NHL Winter Classic was held in Fenway Park on January 1, 2010, between the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers. The home team Bruins won.|$|E
5|$|Tittle {{returned}} to the Giants in 1963 and, at age 37, supplanted his single-season passing touchdowns record by throwing 36. He broke the record in the final game with three touchdowns against the Steelers, three days after being named NFL MVP by the AP. The Giants {{led the league in}} scoring by a wide margin, and {{for the third time in}} as many years clinched the Eastern Conference title. The Western champions were George Halas' Chicago Bears. The teams met in the 1963 NFL Championship Game <b>at</b> <b>Wrigley</b> Field. In the second quarter, Tittle injured his knee on a tackle by Larry Morris, and required a novocaine shot at halftime to continue playing. After holding a 10–7 halftime lead, The Giants were shutout in the second half, during which Tittle threw four interceptions. Playing through the knee injury, he completed 11 of 29 passes in the game for 147 yards, a touchdown, and five interceptions as the Bears won 14–10.|$|E
5|$|Wilson had a combative {{streak and}} {{sometimes}} initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a near-riot {{broke out in}} the ninth inning <b>at</b> <b>Wrigley</b> Field against the St. Louis Cardinals when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan. An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate the combatants and restore order. The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in his favor. The following year he took offense at a remark by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ray Kolp, and – upon reaching first base after hitting a single – he charged into the Reds dugout, punching Kolp several times before they could be separated. Later that evening at the train station, Wilson exchanged words and blows with Cincinnati player Pete Donohue. In late 1929 he signed a contract to fight Art Shires of the Chicago White Sox in a boxing match, but reneged after Cubs president William Veeck, Sr. enlisted Hack's wife Virginia to dissuade him, and then Shires lost a fight to George Trafton of the Chicago Bears. There was nothing to gain, Wilson said, by fighting a defeated boxer.|$|E
