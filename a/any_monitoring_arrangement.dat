40|$|The recent {{pursuit of}} {{regional}} planning agendas in England has {{coincided with a}} strong push from the government towards an evidence-based, information-intensive approach to policymaking, with {{the increased use of}} statistical indicators to inform and evaluate emerging regional policies. In this paper we aim to examine the <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and the way indicators are used, in the development and monitoring of key regional strategies (Regional Planning Guidance, Regional Economic Strategies). The idea is to examine indicator usage and <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangements</b> from a political – managerial perspective through an exploration of the realm of rational – technocratic activities of monitoring within the institutional environment of Regional Planning Bodies and Regional Development Agencies. Following a review of academic literature, we explore the regional intelligence management and the <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangements</b> of the two key regional strategies in each of the English regions. The analysis is based on documentary and web-based reviews as well as in-depth interviews conducted with key regional actors. ...|$|R

40|$|This report studies {{whether the}} peer <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangement</b> in the Stability Growth Pact (SGP) can {{decrease}} {{negative effects of}} moral hazard. Theory argues that peer monitoring can reduce moral hazard issues, because peers {{have the same kind}} of knowledge and expertise. Peers are therefore less hampered by information asymmetry as apposed to a vertical regulator. Moreover, peers are argued to be willing to regulate one another, as they share risks. However, based on an institutional analysis and a case study, this research project shows that these assumptions are not true for the case of the SGP. Strategic behaviour of peers reduces the willingness and creates information asymmetry. As a result, the peer <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangement</b> in the SGP has a limited ability to decrease the negative effects of moral hazard. To improve the effectiveness of this peer <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangement</b> this reports argues to implement more checks and balances so that peers have less opportunity to replace regulatory procedures with political games.

40|$|This article {{examines}} why British firms adopted diversification strategies and multi-divisional {{structures in the}} middle of the twentieth century and why this strategy and structure was reversed towards the end. Corporate governance mechanisms and the impact on information costs of such <b>monitoring</b> <b>arrangements</b> are considered in conjunction with strategy and structure to explain these changes. Diversification and multi-divisional adoption were associated with ineffective governance, poor monitoring and poor performance, whilst refocusing and divestment after 1980 were associated with more effective monitoring and improved performance. The evidence suggests important relationships between governance, strategy and business performance that help explain the development of British business institutions in the second half of the twentieth century. ...|$|R

The study found that the daytime limit could be reduced by 1 dBA, but larger reductions would lead to a high rate of infringements for some of the older Chapter 3 aircraft types currently operating at the London airports. Similarly, the night limit could only be reduced, by 3 dBA, if a ban on QC/ 4 departures were to be imposed.
