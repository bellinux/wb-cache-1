5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> that simple radar reflectors could be {{launched}} {{along with the}} warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of the {{benefits}} of retaining the canal. The Inland Waterways Association produced a report, entitled The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal - Waterway with a Future, suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear Country Park, and the County Planning Officer for Somerset County Council produced a second report, suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration, which the County Council duly adopted. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such a course of action. By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the County Council. Funding for towpath maintenance and weed cutting was also provided.|$|E

25|$|The horizons of American {{art in the}} late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century {{expanded}} rapidly, {{fueled by}} major artistic advances in Europe. Before 1920, French Impressionism {{was one of the}} most important influences at work in cutting-edge American art circles. With <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of Impressionism as a valid approach to depicting nature, many prominent artists in the eastern United States adopted its tenets, leading to a recognized school of American Impressionism. The ACMAA collection contains several examples of American Impressionism by some of the genre’s most accomplished painters.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{principles}} of classical liberalism were challenged by downturns in economic growth, <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of poverty and unemployment present within modern industrial cities and also by the agitation of organized labour. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialisation and laissez-faire capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although socialism later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers—including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold—became early influential critics of social injustice.|$|E
25|$|The Royal College of Chemistry was {{established}} by private subscription in 1845 as there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> that practical aspects of the experimental sciences were not well taught {{and that in the}} United Kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in Germany. As a result of a movement earlier in the decade, many politicians donated funds to establish the college, including Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone and Robert Peel. It was also supported by Prince Albert, who persuaded August Wilhelm von Hofmann to be the first professor.|$|E
5|$|Changing {{demographics}} and <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> social <b>awareness</b> led to increased political and architectural interest in providing cost-effective, sanitary, and comfortable residential {{space to the}} growing urban population {{in general and the}} working class in particular.

50|$|During the 1970s, major world events—including the OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) oil embargoes of 1973 and 1979, {{uncertainty}} in the chemical process industry with respect to feedstock supplies, increasing opposition {{to the use of}} nuclear power, and <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> public <b>awareness</b> of environmental issues—brought difficulties as well as new business opportunities for Stone & Webster.|$|R

25|$|Despite their similarities, works {{produced}} by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was omnidirectional, growing {{like a tree}} with many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists would not necessarily fall under one another's influence. Despite <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness,</b> a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group unity that would attain a maxima circa 1912, deep-seated differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a {{redevelopment}} {{plan in the}} West district, to widen Haian Rd and build an underground plaza proved a failure as lack of geological surveying and overall planning meant that the works ran into a layer of groundwater. The development destroyed part of the historic Go-tiau-kang area. As a consequence, the Zhongzheng Road district, previously the most popular shopping precinct in Tainan since Japanese rule, went into decline due to the poor quality of the environment. By the mid-1990s, there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> {{of the need to}} protect Tainan's historical and cultural treasures. Since then, the government and civil societies have worked to protect Tainan's heritage. It is an ongoing issue for Tainan to protect its past while reviving its old business center.|$|E
25|$|As the war continued, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> in the British Army {{that a more}} {{permanent}} body needed be organized to care for British war graves after the war. In January 1916, the prime minister H. H. Asquith appointed a National Committee for the Care of Soldiers' Graves to take over this task. Edward, Prince of Wales agreed {{to serve as the}} committee's president. The committee's membership reflected all members of the British Commonwealth (with a special representative from India). Over the next year, members of the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers' Graves began to feel that their organization was inadequate to the task, and that a more formal organization, with a broader mandate, should be created. The idea was broached at the first Imperial War Conference in March 1917, and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) was chartered. Lord Derby was named its chair, and the Prince of Wales its president.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the films}} {{received}} international theatrical release, and the soundtrack albums enjoyed commercial success worldwide, all of which generated considerable international awareness of the original shows, together with <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> grassroots <b>awareness</b> of Amnesty International and the human rights issue.

40|$|The {{purpose in}} {{this paper is to}} examine the {{background}} and development of state care for the mentally ill in Ireland. Today, with <b>a</b> rapidly <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of the needs of people with psychiatric problems, many agencies, state and voluntary, are doing excellent work; and in Ireland the recommendations of the Commission of inquiry on mental illness, published in 1966, did much to bring into focus the strength and weakness of this facet of the social services...|$|R
25|$|A {{sense of}} {{complacency}} fell upon {{those in charge}} of developing tanks in the U.S. Army because the M4 Sherman, in 1942, was considered by the Americans to be superior to the most common German tanks: the Panzer III and early models of the Panzer IV. Even through most of 1943, the 75-mm M4 Sherman was adequate against the majority of German armor, although the widespread appearance of the German 7.5 cm KwK 40 tank gun during this time had led to <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> that the M4 was becoming outgunned. There was insufficient Intelligence data processing and forward thinking {{to understand that there}} was an ongoing arms race in tanks and that the U.S. needed to anticipate future German tank threats. The Tiger I and Panther tanks that appeared in 1943 were seen in only very limited numbers by U.S. forces and hence were not considered as major threats. The end result was that, in 1943, the Ordnance Department lacking any guidance {{from the rest of the}} army, concentrated its efforts in tank development mainly on its major project, the electrical transmission T23. By contrast, the Russians and British were engaged in a continuous effort to improve tanks; in 1943, the British begin development of what became the 51-ton Centurion tank (although this tank would reach service just too late to see combat in World War II) and, on the Eastern Front, a full-blown tank arms race was underway, with the Soviets responding to the German heavy tanks by starting development work on the T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks.|$|E

500|$|As late as 1972–1973, {{it was a}} {{commonly}} held belief, {{both within and outside}} Cambodia, that the war was essentially a foreign conflict that had not fundamentally altered the nature of the Khmer people. By late 1973, there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> among the government and population of the fanaticism, total lack of concern over casualties, and complete rejection of any offer of peace talks which [...] "began to suggest that Khmer Rouge fanaticism and capacity for violence were deeper than anyone had suspected." ...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "turn to technology" [...] {{helped to}} cement <b>an</b> already <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of {{underlying}} unity {{among the various}} emerging STS programs. More recently, {{there has been an}} associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as Carl May, Annemarie Mol, Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as Bruno Latour, Sheila Jasanoff, Matthias Gross, S. Lochlann Jain, and Jens Lachmund).|$|R
50|$|Many food banks don't accept fresh produce, preferring canned or {{packaged}} food due {{to health and}} safety concerns, though some have tried to change this as part of <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> worldwide <b>awareness</b> {{of the importance of}} nutrition. As an example, in 2012, London Food Bank (Canada) started accepting perishable food, reporting that as well as the obvious health benefits, there were noticeable emotional benefits to recipients when they were given fresh food.|$|R
500|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of {{geography}} and political boundaries in this period. Scotland was extensively mapped {{for the first}} time. In {{the last quarter of}} the sixteenth century, Timothy Pont created a series of sketch maps of Scotland and recorded the names and details of 20,000 places he visited or noted. His work became the basis for the set of maps of Scotland published the following century by Willem and Johannes Blaeu. In the eighteenth century, there was a [...] "militarisation of cartography", by which the armed forces took over the business of mapping. One response to the Jacobite risings in 1715 and 1745 was the Ordnance Survey, from which over 800 military plans survive for Scotland. The new generation of cartographers were engineers and military surveyors.|$|E
500|$|Publishers Weekly {{reviewed}} {{the book and}} compared McLeod's tactic of following his trademarked phrase with [...] "®" [...] as a satire of [...] Fox Network's registration of the phrase [...] "fair and balanced" [...] as a trademark. The reviewer wrote, [...] "While McLeod's arguments aren't original, his entertaining examples and punchy writing nicely amplify the concerns voiced by {{an increasing number of}} intellectual property scholars, such as Lawrence Lessig." [...] The reviewer said of the author's tone, [...] "Although he evokes dark, almost Orwellian images throughout, McLeod manages an upbeat spin, citing the 'egalitarian' nature of the new technologies and <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of the need to return to a place where 'freedom of expression' is once again 'a meaningful concept that guides our political, social and creative lives.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Author Harry Joe Brown {{commented that}} the protest against Resistance does not {{represent}} [...] "just another protest by cultural conservatives against videogame violence"; he {{described it as a}} new form of video game criticism. He added that the people involved were not [...] "so uninformed that they mistake science fiction for simulated murder", a notion which he stated was present in gamers' reactions and implied in Sony's apology. He elaborated that the controversy came from the use of assault weaponry in a place of worship, one that plays host to a yearly candlelight vigil for victims of gun violence. He wrote that the [...] "jarring image of an American supersoldier spraying their church with bullets may indeed seem less like a meaningless violation of 'whiny dogma' than a sick joke." [...] He added that, the controversy, while [...] "ridiculous to Sony and the videogame community", demonstrates <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of religion in a [...] "virtual place", even among the [...] "severest critics of videogames".|$|E
40|$|The legal {{position}} {{of those who}} wish to end their own lives with assistance from another person has been consistently ambiguous, with politicians unable to come to a unified position, and the courts reluctant to take the initiative.

500|$|Two {{additional}} national marches {{were held}} in 1934 and 1936. By this time the country had made a substantial recovery from the worst depression years of 1929–32. Unemployment was significantly down, annual growth was averaging 4%, and {{many parts of the}} country were enjoying a substantial boom in housing and consumer goods. The increasing prosperity was not, however, uniformly spread, and there were sharp contrasts between economic conditions in the south and those in the north-east, South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere, where the rate of recovery was much slower. At the same time, the national mood was changing; external factors such as the rise of fascism in Europe helped to unify the British left, and there were more supportive voices in parliament on behalf of the unemployed. The idea of marching as a means of expressing political or social grievances had by now become an accepted and well-established tactic, and there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of the problems complained of, which counterbalanced their exploitation by the Communists. The historian A. J. P. Taylor considered that the hunger marchers had [...] "displayed the failure of capitalism in a way that mere figures or literary description could not. Middle-class people felt the call of conscience".|$|E
500|$|Music was {{originally}} created by Brian Johnston (Scott's younger brother), who sampled bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, {{but at that}} point there was <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>awareness</b> of music copyright. Psygnosis asked Tim Wright to replace the offending tracks, who often used arrangements and reworkings of classical and traditional music to avoid copyright problems. Music tracks in the game include: [...] "Galop Infernal" [...] from Orpheus in the Underworld (the music by Offenbach often used for the can-can), [...] "Rondo alla Turca" [...] from Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11, [...] "Dance of the Reed Flutes" [...] from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite, [...] "Dance of the Little Swans" [...] from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, [...] "Ten Lemmings" [...] (a track that uses melodies from traditional song [...] "Ten Green Bottles"), Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 (the part used as funeral march), Wagner's [...] "Bridal Chorus" [...] (popularly known as [...] "Here Comes the Bride"), [...] "London Bridge is Falling Down", the English folk tune [...] "Forest Green" [...] (adapted into the hymn [...] "All Beautiful the March of Days"), the carol [...] "O Little Town of Bethlehem" [...] mixed with the melody from the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, [...] "She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain" [...] and [...] "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?".|$|E
