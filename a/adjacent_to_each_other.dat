5|$|In {{computer}} science, the clique {{problem is}} the computational problem of finding cliques (subsets of vertices, all <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> also called complete subgraphs) in a graph. It has several different formulations depending on which cliques, and what information about the cliques, should be found. Common formulations of the clique problem include finding a maximum clique (a clique with the largest possible number of vertices), finding a maximum weight clique in a weighted graph, listing all maximal cliques (cliques that cannot be enlarged), and solving the decision problem of testing whether a graph contains a clique larger than a given size.|$|E
5|$|Radstock had {{a second}} railway station on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway {{extension}} to Bath, which closed to passengers in 1966. The stations were <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in {{the centre of the}} town, and each had level crossings across the busy A367 road, causing long tailbacks at busy periods. The S line also carried substantial coal traffic. A spur from the Great Western line on to the S and continuing to Writhlington Colliery remained open for a few years after the railway's closure to passenger traffic, until the colliery closed in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Major urinary {{proteins}} (Mups), {{also known}} as α2u-globulins, are a subfamily of proteins found in abundance in the urine and other secretions of many animals. Mups provide a small range of identifying information about the donor animal, when detected by the vomeronasal organ of the receiving animal. They belong to a larger family of proteins known as lipocalins. Mups are encoded by a cluster of genes, located <b>adjacent</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> on a single stretch of DNA, that varies greatly in number between species: from at least 21 functional genes in mice to none in humans. Mup proteins form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a ligand-binding pocket that accommodates specific small, organic chemicals.|$|E

40|$|Force {{transmission}} from skeletal {{muscles to}} bone {{is a key}} element in the control of limb movements. Several in situ studies have now shown that connective tissues linking <b>adjacent</b> muscles <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and <b>to</b> other surrounding structures can bear substantial forces. However, there is little data available to indicate if such epimuscular myofascial pathways are important during normal in vivo movements. Therefore, it remains unclear if the actuators commanded by the central nervous system within an intact body are mechanically inter- or independent. This chapter will review some earlier and the most recent experiments on mechanical interactions between muscles in physiological and pathological muscle conditions. In addition, the potential role of epimuscular myofascial force transmission (MFT) in neuromuscular control will be addressed...|$|R

The latter process occurred either by simple apposition of <b>adjacent</b> lamellae <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> or through epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia.

40|$|Abstract. Chromatic {{induction}} {{is observed}} whenever the perceived colour {{of a target}} surface shifts towards the hue of a neighbouring surface. Some vivid manifestations {{may be seen in}} a white background where thin coloured lines have been drawn (assimilation) or when lines of different colours are collinear (neon effect) or <b>adjacent</b> (watercolour) <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> This study examines a particular colour induction that manifests in concomitance with an opposite effect of colour saturation (or anti-spread). The two phenomena can be observed when a repetitive pattern is drawn in which outline thin contours intercept wider contours or surfaces, colour spreading appear to fill the surface occupied by surfaces or thick lines whereas the background traversed by thin lines is seen as brighter or filled of a saturated white. These phenomena were first observed by Bozzi (1975) and Kanizsa (1979) in figural conditions that did not allow them to document their conjunction. Here we illustrate various manifestations of this twofold phenomenon and compare its effects with the known effects of brightness and colour induction. Some conjectures on the nature of these effects are discussed...|$|R
