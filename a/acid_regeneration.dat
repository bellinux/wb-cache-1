25|$|As {{there is}} low risk from the sulfuric acid itself, {{the choice to}} {{regenerate}} on-site the acid ot elsewhere is based on consideration of economic nature. Of course, even this relatively minor risk is eliminated with on-site sulfuric <b>acid</b> <b>regeneration</b> equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of a suitable catalyst {{is also an important}} factor in deciding whether to build an alkylation plant. If sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used, significant volumes are needed. Access to a suitable plant is required for the supply of fresh acid and the disposition of spent acid. If a sulfuric acid plant must be constructed specifically to support an alkylation unit, such construction will {{have a significant impact on}} both the initial requirements for capital and ongoing costs of operation. Alternatively it is possible to install a WSA Process unit to regenerate the spent acid. No drying of the gas takes place. This means that there will be no loss of acid, no acidic waste material and no heat is lost in process gas reheating. The selective condensation in the WSA condenser ensures that the regenerated fresh acid will be 98% weight, even with the humid process gas. It is possible to combine spent <b>acid</b> <b>regeneration</b> with disposal of hydrogen sulfide by using the hydrogen sulfide as a fuel.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{selection system}} for apple transformation {{is based on}} the selectable marker gene, nptII, encoding antibiotic resistance against kanamycin. We tested an alternative selection system based on the use of D-amino acids using the gene, D-amino acid oxidase 1 (dao 1) as the selectable marker, {{in order to avoid the}} presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the resulting transgenic apple plants. In addition, dao 1 allowed the selection as well as the elimination of dao 1 -transgenic plants, based on differences in the toxicity of different D-amino <b>acids.</b> <b>Regeneration</b> experiments using apple leaf explants revealed that 2 mM D-serine or D-alanine inhibited shoot regeneration. We performed transformation experiments using the apple cultivars ‘Gala’, ‘Holsteiner Cox’, and a progeny of the apple cultivar ‘Pinova’, and the vector p 35 S::dao 1 -intron, containing the dao 1 and nptII selectable marker genes. Several shoots regenerated successfully on selection media containing various concentrations of D-serine or D-alanine, but transgenic shoots were not obtained. However, three dao 1 /nptII transgenic apple lines were obtained after selection with kanamycin, indicating that the vector was functional. Furthermore, we showed that 20 mM D-serine could be used to select dao 1 -transgenic shoots from non-transgenic in vitro shoots, whereas 13 mM D-isoleucine had the opposite effect. Selection procedures greatly facilitate theidentification of transformed cells among non-transgenic cells. The co-transferred selectable marker gene provides transgenic cells with a growth advantage over non-transformed cells under selective conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{potential}} for regeneration of intracellular pyridine nucleotide levels from different precursors, after peroxide-induced NAD depletion, in cultured glial cells was investigated. Cultured murine glial cells showed {{a decrease in}} intracellular NAD levels of> 40 % after treat-ment with H 202 (100 pM). Removal of the H 202 followed by a 2 -h incubation {{did not result in}} NAD recovery in the absence of precursors. However, NAD levels increased significantly in these cells after the following substrate additions, at minimum effective concentrations of 1 mM for quinolinic acid (QUIN), 500 p~Mfor nicotinamide, and 2 ~uMfor nicotinic <b>acid.</b> The <b>regeneration</b> of significant amounts of NAD from nicotinic acid at doses 250 and 500 times lower than either nicotinamide or QUIN indicates a preferred route for NAD biosynthesis in glial cells in vitro, probably via nicotinic acid phosphoribosylation.

40|$|Decolorization of {{azo dyes}} by dilute nitric acid as acid rain model was pursued spectrophotometrically at 30 ℃. In the {{reaction}} of 4 -arylazo- 1 -naphthols or 4 -arylazoaniline, an induction period and then {{an increase in the}} rate were observed. Quantitative analysis of nitrogen dioxide by the Jacobs' method showed that the concentration of nitrogen dioxide increased remarkably as the decolorization reaction proceeded. The addition of a catalytic amount of sodium nitrite (source of nitrogen dioxide) to the dye-dilute nitric acid solution caused enhanced decolorization. Furthermore, 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -naphthol (19 % yield), 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (19 % yield), and aryl diazonium salt (89 % yield) were identified as main decomposition products of 4 -arylazo- 1 -naphthols. From these results, the mechanism for the abnormal decolorization reaction was elucidated from autocatalyzed reactions by nitrogen dioxide as follows: (1) nitroso-dediazotization by nitrogen dioxide, (2) oxidation of the nitroso compounds by nitric <b>acid,</b> and <b>regeneration</b> of nitrogen dioxide...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{of the performance of}} polyelectrolyte-modified nanofiber membranes was undertaken to determine their efficacy in the rapid uptake and recovery of heavy metals from impaired waters. The membranes were prepared by grafting poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(itaconic acid) (PIA) to cellulose nanofiber mats. Performance measurements quantified the dynamic ion-exchange capacity for cadmium (Cd), productivity, and recovery of Cd(II) from the membranes by regeneration. The dynamic binding capacities of Cd(II) on both types of nanofiber membrane were independent of the linear flow velocity, with a residence time of as low as 2 s. Analysis of breakthrough curves indicated that the mass flow rate increased rapidly at constant applied pressure after membranes approached equilibrium load capacity for Cd(II), apparently due to a collapse of the polymer chains on the membrane surface, leading to an increased porosity. This mechanism is supported by hydrodynamic radius (Rh) measurements for PAA and PIA obtained from dynamic light scattering, which show that Rh values decrease upon Cd(II) binding. Volumetric productivity was high for the nanofiber membranes, and reached 0. 55 mg Cd/g/min. The use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic <b>acid</b> as <b>regeneration</b> reagent was effective in fully recovering Cd(II) from the membranes.
