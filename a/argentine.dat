5|$|As {{a former}} <b>Argentine</b> president, {{his body was}} {{displayed}} at the Blue Hall of the Palace of the <b>Argentine</b> National Congress. He also set three days of national mourning, from March 31 to April 2. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires Province (birthplace of Alfonsín), also announced a provincial mourning. Almost a thousand people attended, and at some moments they sang the <b>Argentine</b> National Anthem.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two <b>Argentine</b> bishops at the Holy See held a {{mass for}} Alfonsín as well. It {{was at the}} Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, and was {{attended}} by the <b>Argentine</b> ambassador Juan Pablo Cafiero, the Italian monsignor Giuseppe Laterza and the <b>Argentine</b> monsignor Guillermo Karcher. The bishops met Pope Benedict XVI the following day.|$|E

25|$|<b>Argentines</b> in Israel are {{the largest}} {{immigrant}} group from Latin America {{and one of the}} fastest growing groups. The vast majority of <b>Argentines</b> in Israel are Jewish <b>Argentines</b> who make Aliyah but there is also an important group of non-Jewish <b>Argentines,</b> having, or being married to somebody who has, at least one Jewish grandparent, who choose Israel as their new home. There are about 50,000 <b>Argentines</b> residing in Israel although some estimates put the figure at 70,000.|$|R
50|$|In Brazil and Uruguay, <b>Argentines</b> are stereotyped as , proud, narcissistic and racist. To this <b>Argentines</b> {{are also}} known for being gossipy, full of grandeur, liars (chantas), envious, quick and exaggerated in Uruguay. Chileans also often depict <b>Argentines</b> as arrogant. In {{addition}} to the above, <b>Argentines</b> have also been labeled as lazy, vain, and pedantic, but also kind and carefree, in scientific polls.|$|R
5|$|After {{the two new}} dreadnoughts {{were awarded}} to Fore River, Moreno was {{subcontracted}} out to the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey as {{called for in the}} final contract. Morenos keel was laid on 9 July 1910, and construction was overseen by the <b>Argentine</b> Naval Commission. After the completion of the hull, it was launched on 23 September 1911. Isabel Betbeder, wife to the chief of the <b>Argentine</b> Naval Commission, sponsored Moreno. The ship was then moored to a dock to commence fitting-out, which was finished on 15 February 1915. It was commissioned into the <b>Argentine</b> Navy nine days later.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{surrendered}} on 14 June, and Cardiff {{was required}} to accept the surrender of a 700-strong <b>Argentine</b> garrison in the settlement of Port Howard on West Falkland a day later. Five members of Cardiffs crew were used to man a captured <b>Argentine</b> patrol boat, renamed , in Stanley. Cardiff {{spent the rest of}} June acting as the Landing Area Air Warfare Controller (LAAWC) around San Carlos.|$|E
5|$|Argentina was a {{fragmented}} nation (since the 1852 downfall of <b>Argentine</b> dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas), with the <b>Argentine</b> Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires each vying for supremacy. Flores approached the Buenos Aires Minister of War, Bartolomé Mitre, agreeing {{to throw the}} support of the Colorados behind Buenos Aires in exchange for subsequent <b>Argentine</b> assistance in their fight against the fusionist government in Montevideo (the Uruguayan capital). Flores and his Colorado units served Buenos Aires with fierce determination. They played a decisive role in the Battle of Pavón on 17 September 1861, in which the Confederation was defeated and all Argentina was reunited under the government in Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, <b>Argentine</b> airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how many of them were initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, <b>Argentine</b> air forces will occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on the map. The map also displays terrain details, including rivers and mountains. If troops are situated on top of a mountain, they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to enter an enemy-controlled zone, the move will instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an <b>Argentine</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} four weeks, while the ship was dry-docked, Bruce negotiated with the <b>Argentine</b> government {{over the future of}} the weather station. He was assisted by the British resident minister, the British Consul, and Dr W. G. Davis who was director of the <b>Argentine</b> Meteorological Office. When contacted by cable, the British Foreign Office registered no objection to this scheme. On 20 January 1904, Bruce confirmed an agreement whereby three scientific assistants of the <b>Argentine</b> government would travel back to Laurie Island to work for a year, under Robert Mossman, as the first stage of an annual arrangement. He then formally handed over the Omond House building, its furnishings and provisions, and all magnetic and meteorological instruments, to the <b>Argentine</b> government. The station, renamed Orcadas Base, has remained operational ever since, having been rebuilt and extended several times.|$|E

2500|$|Thousands of <b>Argentines</b> held {{a street}} protest against their {{government}} in Buenos Aires in November 2012, waving signs that read: [...] "Stop {{the wave of}} <b>Argentines</b> killed by crime, enough with corruption and say no to constitutional reform." [...] The Guardian noted that <b>Argentines</b> were plagued by [...] "increasingly bold home robberies, in which armed bands tie up families until victims hand over the cash that many <b>Argentines</b> have kept at home since the government froze savings accounts and devalued the currency in 2002. The {{vast majority of the}} crimes are never solved, while the death toll is rising." ...|$|R
50|$|Costa Rica is {{the country}} with the most <b>Argentines</b> in Central America. According to the census of 2012, there were 3,600 <b>Argentines</b> living in Costa Rica. Historically there were two migratory waves of {{refugees}} running away from military dictatorships that Argentina lived through between 1976 and 1983. A second wave occurred during Argentina's economic crisis (1999-2002), when many <b>Argentines</b> professionals decided to migrate to Costa Rica to develop in their professional areas. Most <b>Argentines</b> in Costa Rica come from Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Rosario. Most of them reside in the provinces of San José, Cartago, Limón and Guanacaste.|$|R
5|$|Encouraged by the {{sluggish}} response of Brazil, infuriated by the {{mockery of the}} Buenos Aires press and impatient at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign <b>Argentine</b> territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small <b>Argentine</b> naval vessels moored in the port of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the <b>Argentine</b> province of that name, making Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} battle of San Lorenzo is {{acknowledged}} in <b>Argentine</b> historiography as an important battle for <b>Argentine</b> independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought in it, as {{the size of the}} forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the <b>Argentine</b> War of Independence. This victory did nothing to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 and yet another one at San Fernando on August 22. William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, game three {{saw another}} thriller as Argentina barely stayed undefeated with a 74 - 72 victory over Australia. Australia led {{by as many}} as seven points in the fourth quarter before the top-ranked <b>Argentines</b> fought back for a late lead. Down four in the closing seconds, Australia's Joe Ingles hit a long {{two-point}}er and Hernán Jasen threw away the ensuing inbounds pass for the <b>Argentines.</b> Adam Gibson then had a wide-open three-pointer for the Aussies off the inbounds pass, but his shot rimmed out at the buzzer, giving the <b>Argentines</b> the two-point victory. [...] Luis Scola scored a game-high 31 points for the <b>Argentines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Today, most German <b>Argentines</b> do {{not speak}} German at home because {{of the decline of}} the language; however, some {{estimates}} suggest that 1.8 million http://www.sippo.ch/files/news/press_06ra.pdf <b>Argentines</b> of non-German descent have some knowledge of German. It is a language that can be heard all over the country, and this is partly maintained by the continued existence of German-speaking <b>Argentines</b> and some business connections.

5|$|In Argentina, {{the disease}} is known as mal de Chagas-Mazza, in honor of Salvador Mazza, the <b>Argentine</b> {{physician}} who in 1926 began investigating the disease {{and over the years}} became the principal researcher of this disease in the country. Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of Trypanosoma cruzi in Argentina in 1927, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and <b>Argentine</b> government policy makers.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, Kirchner {{decided to}} {{liquidate}} the <b>Argentine</b> {{debt to the}} IMF in a single payment, without refinancing, {{for a total of}} $9.8 billion. The payment was partly financed by Venezuela, who bought <b>Argentine</b> bonds for US$1.6 billion. As of mid-2008 Venezuela hold an estimated US$6 billion in <b>Argentine</b> debt. In 2006, Argentina re-entered international debt markets selling US$500 million of its Bonar V five-year dollar denominated bonds, with a yield of 8.36%, mostly to foreign banks and Moody's boosted Argentina's debt rating to B from B-.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007 Fernández de Kirchner became president.

Official <b>Argentine</b> statistics {{are believed to have}} significantly underreported inflation since 2007, and independent economists publishing their own estimates of <b>Argentine</b> inflation have been threatened with fines and prosecution.|$|E
50|$|Italian <b>Argentines</b> (italo-argentini, ítalo-argentinos) are Argentine-born {{citizens}} of Italian descent or Italian-born people who reside in Argentina. Italians {{are the first}} largest ethnic origin of modern <b>Argentines,</b> followed by Spaniards. It is estimated up to 25 million <b>Argentines</b> have some degree of Italian descent (up to 62.5% of the total population), Italians began arriving in Argentina in great numbers from 1857 to 1940, totaling 44.9% of the entire post-colonial immigrant population; more than from any other country (including Spain at 31.5%).|$|R

2500|$|Strikingly, {{at those}} times, the {{national}} population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured {{in the popular}} saying [...] "los argentinos descienden de los barcos" [...] (<b>Argentines</b> descend from the ships). Therefore, most <b>Argentines</b> are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the great immigration wave to Argentina (1850–1955), with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries. The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy and Spain. The majority of <b>Argentines</b> descend from multiple European ethnic groups, primarily of Italian and Spanish descent (over 25 million individuals in Argentina, almost 60% of the population have some partial Italian origins), while 17% of the population also have partial French origins. There is also a sizeable number of <b>Argentines</b> of German descent.|$|R
