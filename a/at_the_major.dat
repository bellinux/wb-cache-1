5|$|Because {{the minor}} league team that last held Jim Thorpe's {{contract}} had disbanded in 1910, {{he found himself}} in the rare position of being a sought-after free agent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> league level during the era of the reserve clause, and thus had a choice of baseball teams for which to play. In January1913, he turned down a starting position with the American League cellar-dwelling St. Louis Browns, choosing instead to join the 1912National League champion New York Giants, who, with Thorpe playing in 19 of their 151games, would repeat as the 1913National League champions. Immediately following the Giants' October loss in the 1913 World Series, Thorpe and the Giants joined the Chicago White Sox for a world tour. Barnstorming across the United States and then around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour. Thorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance and gate receipts for the tour. He met with Pope Pius X and Abbas II Hilmi Bey (the last Khedive of Egypt), and played before 20,000 people in London including King George V.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, the Athens Airport {{charged a}} 25% higher landing fee for those {{aircraft}} arriving between 11:00 and 17:00 during the high tourism season during summer. Hong Kong charges an additional flat fee {{to the basic}} weight charge. In 1991–92 peak pricing at London's main airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was implemented; airlines were charged different landing fees for peak and off-peak operations depending on the weight of aircraft. For example, {{in the case of}} a Boeing 757, the peak landing fee was about 2.5 times higher than the off-peak fee in all three airports. For a Boeing 747 the differential was even higher, as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge. Though related to runway congestion, the main objective of these peak charges <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> British airports was to raise revenue for investment.|$|E

5|$|Narayan {{performed}} in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received in both countries. His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall, Mumbai, {{was cut short}} when an impatient audience, waiting for performances by famous artists, drove him from the stage. Narayan pondered giving up the sarangi and becoming a singer. He later regained confidence, performed solo for smaller crowds, and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956. He has since performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> music festivals of India. Narayan later gave up accompaniment; this decision carried a financial risk because interest in solo sarangi was not yet substantial.|$|E
