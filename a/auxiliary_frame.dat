Conventional multi-image SR algorithms incorporate <b>auxiliary</b> <b>frames</b> into the model by a registration process using subpixel block matching algorithms that are computationally expensive. This becomes increasingly important as super-resolving UHD video content with existing sparse-based SR approaches become less efficient. In order to fully utilize the spatio-temporal information, we propose a novel multi-frame video SR approach that is aided by a low-rank plus sparse decomposition of the video sequence. We introduce a group of pictures structure where we seek a rank- 1 low-rank part that recovers the shared spatio-temporal information among the frames in the GOP. Then we super-resolve the low-rank frame and sparse frames separately. This assumption results in significant time reductions, as well as surpassing state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively...|$|R

40|$|Airborne and {{spaceborne}} line cameras allow a very economic {{acquisition of}} high- resolution and wide swath {{images of the}} Earth. They generate two-dimensional images while rotating or translating, which causes a non-rigid image geometry. Non- uniform motion of the camera can negatively affect the image quality. Due to this, a key requirement for line cameras is that fast orientation changes have to be avoided or measured with a very high rate and precision. Camera stabilization is not always possible and can often only be achieved with very high effort. In such cases {{it is essential to}} measure the camera‚Äôs orientation accurately to ensure that the resulting imagery products can be geometrically corrected in a later processing step. Ade- quate high-end measurement systems are large and expensive and their angular and temporal resolution can be still too low for many possible applications. Due to these reasons there is great interest in approaches to support the orientation measurement by using optical information received through the main optics or telescope. In this thesis two different approaches are presented that allow the determination of a line camera‚Äôs orientation changes optically. In addition to this the determined orientation changes can be used to derive the precise absolute orientation of an unstabilized airborne line camera. One approach to determine fast orientation changes is based on small <b>auxiliary</b> <b>frame</b> image sensors, mounted on the focal plane of the main camera or behind separate optics. The optical flow on these sensors is determined by tracking suitable image features through a series of images. It is shown that this can be performed onboard and in real time using a standard CPU. From the optical flow the orientation changes of any remote sensing system can be derived. The second approach does not require any additional sensors to determine orien- tation changes. It relies only on the images of a line camera and a rough estimate of its trajectory by taking advantage of the typical eometry of multi-spectral line cameras. In a first step homologous points are detected within the distorted Images of different spectral bands. These points are used to calculate the orientation changes of the camera with a high temporal and angular resolution via bundle adjustment. Finally it is shown how the absolute exterior orientation of an airborne line camera can completely be derived from the optically determined orientation changes. The orientation changes are used to pre-correct the line images, in which homologous points can reliably be determined using an image feature detection and description algorithm. Together with position measurements these points are used to determine the precise absolute orientation via bundle adjustment of a block of overlapping line images...|$|E

The required C 1 conformity is then enforced in a weak sense trough an <b>auxiliary</b> displacement <b>frame</b> {{defined in terms of}} nodal and side mode parameters. While thus far the standard approach consisted in using three parameters (one displacement and two rotations) at corner nodes and an optional number of side mode parameters associated with mid-side nodes, other alternative formulations are also possible wherein the number of corner mode parameters is either inferior or superior to three. As compared to the standard frame, such alternative formulations may exhibit some advantages and some shortcomings with respect to accuracy, convergence rate, error distribution, computational efficiency and/or ease of use. The paper surveys and critically assesses some of such formulations and reports the results of extensive numerical studies involving regular and singular plate bending applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|Summary. In {{recent years}} the hybrid-Trefftz finite element (hT-FE) model, which {{originated}} in the work by Jirousek and his collaborators and makes use of an inde-pendently defined <b>auxiliary</b> inter-element <b>frame,</b> has been considerably improved. It has indeed become a highly efficient computational tool for the solution of difficult boundary value problems In parallel and {{to a large extent}} independently, a general and elegant theory of Domain Decomposition Methods (DDM) has been developed by Herrera and his coworkers, which has already produced very significant numeri-cal results. Theirs is a general formulation of DDM, which subsumes and generalizes other standard approaches. In particular, it supplies a natural theoretical frame-work for Trefftz methods. To clarify further this point, it is important to spell out in greater detail than has been done so far, the relation between Herrera‚Äôs theory and the procedures studied by researchers working in standard approaches to Trefftz method (Trefftz-Jirousek approach). As a contribution to this end, in this paper the hybrid-Trefftz finite element model is derived in considerable detail, from Herrera‚Äôs theory of DDM. By so doing, the hT-FE model is generalized to non-symmetric systems (actually, to any linear differential equation, or system of such equations, independently of its type) and to boundary value problems with prescribed jumps. This process also yields some numerical simplifications. ...|$|R

Power steering was standard. The prototype (carrying a late body by Seddon's Pennine Coachcraft subsidiary) had a Self-Changing Gears semi-automatic gearbox, but production variants were initially to be fitted with a four-speed ZF synchromesh unit, coach versions having a higher ratio final drive allowing a 76 mph maximum speed, 56 mph being the designed maximum for bus versions, better acceleration and more flexible performance ensuing with the low ratio back axle.|$|R

40|$|Pizzo Mondello is a ca. 500 m thick pelagic-hemipelagic {{succession}} cropping out in Sicily {{consisting of}} a nodular cherty limestone facies association of late Carnian to late Norian age. The uppermost portion was attributed to the Rhaetian and {{is represented by the}} plane-bedded Portella Gebbia Limestone. The section has been proposed as the stratotype for the base of the Norian stage. The calcareous nannofossil content of limestones was studied with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in two portions of the Pizzo Mondello section, one within 'La Cava' that encompasses all the proposed horizons for the base of the Norian, and one within the Portella Gebbia Limestone in the uppermost part of the section. Calcareous nannofossil assemblages of the first portion display low diversity, being constituted exclusively by calcispheres, that may constitute up to 40 % of the sediment volume. Species richness increases in the upper portion. Initially, samples are dominated by Prinsiosphaera triassica, a nannolith of unknown taxonomic affinity. Rare calcareous dinocysts (Thoracosphaera cf. geometrica) and coccoliths are present in few samples. Uppermost samples are still dominated by "calcispheres" comparable to Thoracosphaera, but also yield a variety of coccoliths and nannoliths. Calcareous nannofossil distribution was calibrated with conodont and radiolarian biostratigraphy. On the basis of this integrated work, specimens attributed to cf. Thoracosphaera, observed in the lower portion of the section, are late Carnian to early Norian, while samples dominated by Prinsiosphaera, with rare Thoracosphaera and coccoliths are Rhaetian. The calcareous nannofossil assemblage of the uppermost samples, along with radiolarians and the absence of conodonts, point to a Jurassic age (Pliensbachian) for the uppermost Portella Gebbia Limestone at Pizzo Mondello. In conclusion, the age of the uppermost part of the Pizzo Mondello section is Jurassic, i. e., younger than previously thought. Calcareous nannofossils are present from the base of section and exhibit a significant taxonomic diversity, thus providing an <b>auxiliary</b> biostratigraphic <b>frame</b> for the Rhaetian - Jurassic interval in this area. ¬†</p...|$|R

One important NPP safety system application is an emergency diesel generating (EDG) system that operates as an on-site emergency power supply system for the NPP. Its main purpose is to generate and supply electricity to NPP‚Äôs necessary safety and control systems (safety auxiliaries) in case of regular power supply from an off-site electricity grid fails (loss-of-offsite power, LOOP) and during other critical emergency events. The EDG system consists of a large diesel engine, a generator, a common base <b>frame,</b> <b>auxiliary</b> systems, and control and instrumentation equipment that all ensure proper function of the entire system. The main goal {{of this study is}} to examine and discover what are the most important performance requirements specific for the nuclear EDG system. In order to achieve this aim, this thesis carries out a comprehensive review of the EDG system‚Äôs components and their functions based on W√§rtsil√§‚Äôs technology. In addition, it investigates topics such as the role of the EDG system operating with the NPP, applicable nuclear regulations, standards and frameworks, applicable qualification procedures and possible factors influencing the EDG system‚Äôs performance. Instead of numerical and calculation based approach, the performance of the EDG system is studied mainly from functional side. This study indicates that the necessary safety functions of the EDG system form a foundation for the most important performance requirements such as fast start-up in response to emergency demand, accepting and accelerating heavy motor loads in rapid succession to constant rotational speed, maintain load within acceptable frequency and voltage limits, etc. even under abnormal operating conditions. In order to achieve demanded capability for the nuclear service, the EDG system must successfully pass rigorous qualification programs such as performance testing, analysis, and environmental qualification.
