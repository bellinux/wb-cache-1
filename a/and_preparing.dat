5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided {{to throw a}} feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals <b>and</b> <b>preparing</b> them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E
5|$|After the Indonesian film {{industry}} crashed in 1992 Umboh directed two television serials: Pahlawan Tak Dikenal (Unknown Hero; 1994) and Apsari. The crash, {{along with his}} long illness, led his finances to destabilise, {{to the point where}} he lived in government housing. In 1994 Suara Pembaharuan (now Suara Pembaruan), inaccurately reported him having died, a claim which Umboh publicly refuted. Umboh died at 4:45am WIB (UTC+7) on 24January 1996 in Jakarta of complications from diabetes and a stroke. He was buried in Jeruk Purut Cemetery, South Jakarta. Three weeks before his death, he was reportedly in good health <b>and</b> <b>preparing</b> to film a new serial entitled Gejolak Kampus Muda (Symptoms of a Youth Campus).|$|E
5|$|Alice, heavily {{pregnant}} with her third child, saw Louis depart to command the Hessian cavalry against the Prussians, and sent her children to stay with Queen Victoria in England.

On 11 July, {{she gave birth to}} Princess Irene; Prussian troops {{were on the verge of}} entering Darmstadt, she begged the Grand Duke to surrender on Prussia's terms. This provoked fury from the fiercely anti-Prussian Prince Alexander, but Alice realised that the conquered German states would likely form a union which she, like her sister Victoria, supported.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, <b>and</b> <b>preparing</b> a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments.

5|$|During May 1809, the frigates Félicité and Furieuse {{remained}} at Guadeloupe, taking on stores <b>and</b> <b>preparing</b> for their eventual return journey to France. Although {{they were both}} large frigates, they had been largely disarmed in France to create space for cargo: Furieuse was provided with only 20 cannon (including 12 carronades) and a crew of just 200, while Félicité had even fewer defences, carrying just 14 cannon and 174 men. Watching these ships was a small British blockade force led by Hugh Pigot in Latona with a few brigs and sloops, Cochrane's invasion fleet having been dispersed.|$|E
5|$|In 1294 the French king {{declared}} the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and {{war broke out}} between the two countries.

When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's subjects were not obliged to serve abroad if not {{in the company of}} the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.|$|E

5|$|The ITS-Davis {{study also}} found that a small but {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better meet the needs of plug-in customers.
