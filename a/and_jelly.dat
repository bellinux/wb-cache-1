5|$|The {{two most}} popular Hannukah foods are potato pancakes, levivot, also known by the Yiddish latkes; <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> doughnuts, known as sufganiyot in Hebrew, pontshkes (in Yiddish) or bimuelos (in Ladino), as these are deep-fried in oil.

Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand crank, drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> filled doughnuts.|$|E

40|$|Soft {{homemade}} jams <b>and</b> <b>jellies</b> can be {{an unfortunate}} occurrence and are often the result of using overripe fruit, fruit lacking the appropriate acidity, using the wrong amount of sugar, increasing the recipe, not bringing the product up to a full rolling boil, using old pectin or not enough pectin, or numerous other causes. Both canned (cooked) and freezer (uncooked) jams <b>and</b> <b>jellies</b> can be remade if the products are too soft. This publication outlines how to remake soft jams <b>and</b> <b>jellies</b> that were cooked using powdered pectin, liquid pectin, and no pectin. It also outlines how to remake freezer jams <b>and</b> <b>jellies</b> made with both powdered and liquid pectin...|$|R

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice <b>and</b> <b>jelly.</b> It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E

25|$|The format {{remains largely}} {{unchanged}} from previous seasons. HouseGuests are sequestered in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to or from}} the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food, luxuries, and power in the House. The winner of the weekly Head of Household competition is immune from nominations and must nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. After a HouseGuest becomes Head of Household, {{he or she is}} ineligible {{to take part in the}} next Head of Household competition. HouseGuests also take part in competitions to earn food for the week. The losing team will be forced to eat Big Brother Slop for the week. This is the second season to feature Slop as the punishment food, as it was originally peanut butter <b>and</b> <b>jelly.</b> The winner of the Power of Veto competition wins the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction. If the Veto winner exercises the power, the Head of Household must then nominate another HouseGuest for eviction.|$|E

25|$|After 1966, McWilliams's artworks and {{performances}} were often realized {{in collaboration with}} Moorman. He composed numerous works for her, including Ice Music (1972), in which she used a file, a saw, a long strip of plexiglass, and other tools to play a cello made of ice until it melted; Candy (1973), in which she and her instrument were covered with chocolate fudge while seated in a gallery whose floor was covered with Easter grass <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> beans; and C. Moorman in Drag (1973), in which she wore a tuxedo and Pablo Casals mask while miming a performance of a Bach suite for solo cello. During the 1970s, the pieces he wrote for her became increasingly spectacular. In A Water Cello for Charlotte Moorman (1972), she and her cello were submerged in a tank of water pumped in from the Hudson River. Flying Cello (1974) had Moorman attempt {{to make contact with}} her cello as they swung on separate trapezes, and in Cambridge Special for Charlotte, Elephant, and Cello (1978) she rode through the streets of Cambridge on the back of an elephant while dressed as Cleopatra.
