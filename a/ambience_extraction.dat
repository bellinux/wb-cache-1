40|$|A {{supervised}} learning approach to <b>ambience</b> <b>extraction</b> from onechannel audio signals is presented. The extracted ambient signals are {{applied for the}} blind upmixing of musical audio recordings to surround sound formats. The input signal is processed by means of short-term spectral attenuation. The spectral weights are computed using a low-level feature extraction process and a neural network regression method. The multi-channel audio signal is generated by feeding the computed ambient signal into the rear channels of a surround sound system. 1...|$|E
