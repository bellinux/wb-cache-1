6000|$|... "Did he? Well now, the rascal {{invariably}} looks quite blank when I mention Marizano's name, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head, {{as if he}} {{had never}} heard of it before." ...|$|E
60|$|The Major looked piteously at Benjamin, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head. Benjamin looked piteously at the Major, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R
60|$|He pointed almost due north. The captain smiled <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head. Bladud {{looked at}} Maikar, who also smiled <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R

6000|$|But {{he never}} heard me. He had forgot me and {{everything}} else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head; then sighs again, and says: ...|$|E

60|$|Suddenly Boris stepped forward, <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> fist in Tommy's face.|$|R
60|$|How are {{you going}} to stop it? Mr. Watling climbs up on the {{platform}} <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fist in General Doby's face, and General Doby tearfully appeals for an honest ballot--to the winds.|$|E
6000|$|CHRIS--[Turns {{suddenly}} <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fist {{out at the}} sea--with bitter hatred.] Dat's your dirty trick, damn ole davil, you! [Then in {{a frenzy}} of rage.] But, py God, you don't do dat! Not while Ay'm living! No, py God, you don't! ...|$|E
60|$|CUTHBERTSON. I'm {{not ashamed}} of it, Dan. It has done me good. (He goes {{up to the table}} <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fist at the bust over the mantelpiece.) It would do you good too if you had eyes and ears to take it in.|$|E

6000|$|The doctor {{feels the}} pulse of the woman, or rather lays an inquiring finger where the {{slightest}} thread of vital current is scarcely throbbing, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head mournfully.

60|$|MURRAY (holding {{her hand}} for a moment--earnestly). Don't mind your first {{impressions}} here. You'll look on everything {{as a matter of}} course in a few days. I felt your way at first.

60|$|I too picked and ate a few {{berries and}} made the remark that it was late to eat such fruit in November. The Devil in these parts, I told him, flies abroad in October to spit on the bramble bushes and spoil the fruit. It was even worse further north, in Norfolk and Suffolk, where they say the Devil goes out at Michaelmas <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> verminous {{trousers}} over the bushes.|$|E
60|$|The old butler, who was {{formerly}} footman, and a rejected admirer of hers, {{used to tell}} the anecdote now and then, at those little cabals that will occasionally take place among the most orderly servants, arising from the common propensity of the governed to talk against administration; but he has left it off, of late years, since he has risen into place, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head rebukingly when it is mentioned.|$|E

6000|$|King. The event, {{the event}} will shew us what we were; For, like a blazing meteor hence he shot, And drew a {{sweeping}} fiery train along.-- O Paris, Paris, once my seat of triumph, But now the scene of all thy king's misfortunes; Ungrateful, perjured, and disloyal town, Which by my royal presence I have warmed So long, that now the serpent hisses out, <b>And</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> forked tongue at majesty, While I-- ...|$|E
60|$|The Antiquary is a {{frequent}} visitor at Knockwinnock and Glenallan House, ostensibly {{for the sake of}} completing two essays, one on the mail-shirt of the Great Earl, and the other on the left-hand gauntlet of Hell-in-Harness. He regularly inquires whether Lord Geraldin has commenced the Caledoniad, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head at the answers he receives. En attendant, however, he has completed his notes, which, we believe, will be at the service of any one who chooses to make them public without risk or expense to THE ANTIQUARY.|$|E
60|$|RICHARD (turning to her). What! Have they {{forgotten}} {{to save your}} soul in their anxiety about their own bodies? Oh yes: you may stay. (He turns excitedly away again <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> fist after them. His left fist, also clenched, hangs down. Essie seizes it and kisses it, her tears falling on it. He starts and looks at it.) Tears! The devil's baptism! (She falls on her knees, sobbing. He stoops goodnaturedly to raise her, saying) Oh yes, you may cry that way, Essie, if you like.|$|E
