He was entitled to take up ecclesiastic office or duties that did not interfere overly with his job as principal; the fellows were required to be resident for ten months of each year. Entrants to the college would have been only 11 or 12 years old, with an intake both from those whose income was very low, alongside those from gentlemanly backgrounds. Fellows had a high degree of autonomy, but received only board and lodging as reward.|$|E

5|$|The Shaiva Puranas, {{particularly}} the Shiva Purana and the Linga Purana, present the {{various aspects of}} Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (Tirtha) associated with him. The Shiva-related Tantra literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as Sruti. Dualistic Shaiva Agamas which consider soul within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, dvaita), are the foundational texts for Shaiva Siddhanta. Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, advaita), and that Shiva is the soul, the perfection and truth within each living being. In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts <b>and</b> <b>sixty</b> four monism Agama texts.|$|E
5|$|Vessels from Silla, Balhae and Hizen Province of Japan {{were all}} {{involved}} in the Yellow Sea trade, which Silla dominated. After Silla and Japan reopened renewed hostilities in the late 7th century, most Japanese maritime merchants chose to set sail from Nagasaki towards {{the mouth of the}} Huai River, the Yangzi River, and even as far south as the Hangzhou Bay in order to avoid Korean ships in the Yellow Sea. In order to sail back to Japan in 838, the Japanese embassy to China procured nine ships <b>and</b> <b>sixty</b> Korean sailors from the Korean wards of Chuzhou and Lianshui cities along the Huai River. It is also known that Chinese trade ships traveling to Japan set sail from the various ports along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{torpedo boat}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Benbow {{and the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further {{significant}} action in the battle. This was, in part, due to poor communication between Jellicoe and his subordinates over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. Benbow fired briefly at a group of torpedo boats at about 21:10, with a salvo of 6-inch shells and a single 13.5-inch round. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, Benbow had fired forty 13.5-inch armour-piercing, capped shells <b>and</b> <b>sixty</b> 6-inch rounds.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling {{in the case}} of Dunn v. Blumstein that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was {{resident}} in that state and thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county <b>and</b> <b>sixty</b> days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a refinement of congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment. All of these measures passed.|$|E
5|$|The Act also {{extended}} the franchise. In county constituencies, {{in addition to}} forty-shilling freeholders, franchise rights were extended to owners of land in copyhold worth £10 and holders of long-term leases (more than sixty years) on land worth £10 and holders of medium-term leases (between twenty <b>and</b> <b>sixty</b> years) on land worth £50 and to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. In borough constituencies all male householders living in properties worth at least £10 a year were given {{the right to vote}} – a measure which introduced to all boroughs a standardised form of franchise for the first time. Existing borough electors retained a lifetime right to vote, however they had qualified, provided they were resident in the boroughs in which they were electors. In those boroughs which had freemen electors, voting rights were to be enjoyed by future freemen as well provided their freemanship was acquired through birth or apprenticeship and they too were resident.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) -associated colitis, a known {{complication}} of colon and rectal surgery, can increase perioperative morbidity and mortality, leading to increased hospital stay and costs. Several contributing factors, including advanced age, mechanical bowel preparation, and antibiotics, have {{been implicated in}} this condition. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the clinical features of and factors responsible for C. difficile-associated colitis after colorectal cancer surgery. Methods: The medical records of patients who had undergone elective resection for colorectal cancer from January 2008 to April 2010 were reviewed. Cases that involved procedures such as transanal excision, stoma creation, or emergency operation were excluded from the analysis. Results: Resection with primary anastomosis was performed in 219 patients with colorectal cancer. The rate of postoperative C. difficile-associated colitis was 6. 8 % in the entire study population. Preoperative metallic stent insertion (P = 0. 017) <b>and</b> aged <b>sixty</b> <b>and</b> older (≥ 60, P = 0. 025) were identified as risk factors for postoperative C. difficile-associated colitis. There were no significant differences in variables such as preoperative oral non-absorbable antibiotics, site of operation, operation procedure, and duration of prophylactic antibiotics. Conclusion: Among the potential causative factors of postoperative C. difficile-associated colitis, preoperative metallic stent insertion <b>and</b> aged <b>sixty</b> <b>and</b> older were identified as risk factors on the basis of our data. Strategies to prevent C. difficile infection should be carried out in patients who have undergone preoperative insertion of a metallic stent <b>and</b> are aged <b>sixty</b> <b>and</b> older years...|$|R
