However, in those games he took only 14 wickets and failed entirely with the bat, compiling just 81 runs in his 11 innings.|$|E
25|$|Early on, it was {{believed}} that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.|$|E
25|$|Yardy {{made his}} Sussex debut in an early-season NatWest Trophy game against Hertfordshire in May 1999, {{although}} it was not a very successful way to begin his career: opening the batting, he was lbw for nought and went for 14 from two wicketless overs. He also played a one-day game against Sri Lanka A, again with little success, and though he played a few games the following year it was only in 2001 that he became <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> regular in the side. He played ten games in 2002, but only seven in total over the next two years, before returning with a vengeance in 2005.|$|E

25|$|After {{the civil}} {{engineer}} {{looked over the}} site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the agrimensores went to work surveying the road bed. They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a groma, which helped them obtain right angles. The gromatici, the Roman equivalent of rod men, placed rods and put down a line called the rigor. As they did not possess <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> transit, a civil engineering surveyor tried to achieve straightness by looking along the rods and commanding the gromatici to move them as required. Using the gromae they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road.|$|E
25|$|William Henry Scotton (15 January 1856 in Nottingham, England – 9 July 1893 in St John's Wood, London, England) was a cricketer {{who played}} for Nottinghamshire and England. Scotton played his first match at Lord's for Sixteen Colts of England against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 11 and 12 May 1874, scoring on that {{occasion}} 19 and 0. He was engaged as a groundman by the MCC in that year and in 1875, and after an engagement at Kennington Oval returned {{to the service of}} the MCC, of whose ground staff he was a member {{at the time of his}} death. His powers were rather slow to ripen, and he had been playing for several years before he obtained <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> first-rate position. At one period of his career, however, and more particularly during the seasons of 1884 and 1886, he was beyond all question the best professional left-handed batsman in England.|$|E
25|$|Solon's {{laws were}} inscribed on large wooden slabs or {{cylinders}} {{attached to a}} series of axles that stood upright in the Prytaneion. These axones appear to have operated on the same principle as a Lazy Susan, allowing both convenient storage and ease of access. Originally the axones recorded laws enacted by Draco in the late 7th Century (traditionally 621 BC). Nothing of Draco's codification has survived except for a law relating to homicide, yet there is consensus among scholars that it did not amount to <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> constitution. Solon repealed all Draco's laws except those relating to homicide. During his visit to Athens, Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer reported that the inscribed laws of Solon were still displayed by the Prytaneion. Fragments of the axones were still visible in Plutarch's time but today the only records we have of Solon's laws are fragmentary quotes and comments in literary sources such as those written by Plutarch himself. Moreover, the language of his laws was archaic even {{by the standards of the}} fifth century and this caused interpretation problems for ancient commentators. Modern scholars doubt the reliability of these sources and our knowledge of Solon's legislation is therefore actually very limited in its details.|$|E

500|$|However, Toby E. Huff {{writes that}} Shen Kuo's [...] "scattered set" [...] of {{writings}} lacks clear-cut organization and [...] "theoretical acuteness," [...] that is, scientific theory. Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen's originality stands [...] "cheek by jowl with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities" [...] that provide little insight. Donald Holzman writes that Shen [...] "has nowhere organized his observations into <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> general theory." [...] Huff writes {{that this was}} a systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in European works such as the Concordance and Discordant Canons by the lawyer Gratian of Bologna (fl. 12th century). In regard to an overarching concept of science which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo [...] "do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant." ...|$|E
500|$|A fast bowler who {{operated}} from a {{very short}} run-up, Mold bowled extremely quickly, releasing the ball with his arm very high in his early years, although later in his career, his arm was lower in delivery. Unusually for a bowler of his pace, he could make the ball deviate from straight, either through seam movement or cutting his fingers over it before release, but most of his wickets were taken through sheer speed. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that {{he was among the}} fastest bowlers of all time and his bowling action was [...] "beautiful" [...] and possessed [...] "fine grace". If the pitch was uneven or otherwise difficult for batting, he was extremely difficult to bat against: in 1892, Wisden noted: [...] "On <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rough or bumpy wicket [...] he is, beyond all question, the most difficult and dangerous bowler of the day, the ball getting up from the pitch so high and so fast as to intimidate all but the very pluckiest of batsmen." [...] The Times later noted that he was very successful for Lancashire and a difficult bowler to face. In combination with Briggs, he bowled a very high proportion of Lancashire's overs. At times, he struggled with a knee injury but continued to bowl with little opportunity to rest.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} Rain Man, Zimmer {{was asked to}} compose the score for Bruce Beresford's Driving Miss Daisy which, like Rain Man, won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Driving Miss Daisy’s {{instrumentation}} consisted entirely of synthesizers and samplers, played by Zimmer. According to an interview with Sound on Sound magazine in 2002, the piano sounds heard within the score come from the Roland MKS–20, a rackmount synthesizer. Zimmer joked: [...] "It didn't sound <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> piano, but it behaved like a piano." ...|$|E

50|$|The same lack of {{experience}} flying the Mosquito applied to his navigator, Squadron Leader Warwick, who had never flown in one operationally.

2500|$|In Being and Time, Heidegger {{criticized the}} {{abstract}} and metaphysical character of traditional ways of grasping human existence as rational animal, person, man, soul, spirit, or subject. Dasein, then, {{is not intended}} {{as a way of}} conducting a philosophical anthropology, but is rather understood by Heidegger to be the condition of possibility for <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> philosophical anthropology. Dasein, according to Heidegger, is care. In the course of his existential analytic, Heidegger argues that Dasein, who finds itself thrown into the world (Geworfenheit) amidst things and with others, is thrown into its possibilities, including the possibility and inevitability of one's own mortality. The need for Dasein to assume these possibilities, that is, the need to be responsible for one's own existence, is the basis of Heidegger's notions of authenticity and resoluteness—that is, of those specific possibilities for Dasein which depend on escaping the [...] "vulgar" [...] temporality of calculation and of public life.|$|E
2500|$|The {{opposition}} view in {{that time}} was presented by William Andrew Paton and Russell Alger Stevenson in their Principles of Accounting (1919). To these writers, interest charges, whether contractual or non-contractual, are distribution-of-income, not expense, items. But, they say, if these charges are to be made at all, the logical procedure would be to distribute among the factory products the normal return on all the capital invested, not that on the fixed assets only. With this last contention, at least, the reviewer is inclined to agree. But Professors Paton and Stevenson appear {{to believe that the}} problem in hand is being solved on other than logical ground. For they say: [...] "The use of interest charges in cost accounts on <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rational basis is a procedure which faces almost insurmountable practical obstacles. It is probably this fact rather than the logic of the case that is causing cost accountants to begin to recover from the interest obsession" ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his radio}} career, he {{performed}} entirely without scripts. His friend and WOR colleague Barry Farber marveled at {{how he could}} talk so long with very little written down. Yet during a radio interview, Shepherd once claimed that some shows took several weeks to prepare, but this {{would probably have been}} in the thinking and outlining stage rather than in <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> script. On most of his Fourth of July broadcasts, however, he would read one of his most enduring and popular short stories, [...] "Ludlow Kissel and the Dago Bomb that Struck Back," [...] about a neighborhood drunk and his disastrous fireworks escapades. In the 1960s and 1970s, his WOR show ran from 11:15pm to midnight, later changed to 10:15pm to 11pm, so his [...] "Ludlow Kissel" [...] reading was coincidentally timed to many New Jersey and New York local town fireworks displays, which would traditionally reach their climax at 10pm. It was possible, on one of those July 4 nights, to park one's car on a hilltop and watch several different pyrotechnic displays, accompanied by Shepherd's masterful storytelling.|$|E
50|$|The {{sex ratio}} is {{the ratio of}} males to females in a population. In most sexually {{reproducing}} species, the ratio tends to be 1:1. This tendency is explained by Fisher's principle. For various reasons, however, many species deviate from <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> even sex ratio, either periodically or permanently. Examples include parthenogenic species, periodically mating organisms such as aphids, some eusocial wasps such as Polistes fuscatus and Polistes exclamans, bees, ants, and termites.|$|R

2500|$|Marinetti {{sought to}} make Futurism the {{official}} state art of Fascist Italy but failed to do so. [...] Mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements {{in order to keep}} artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the Novecento Italiano group in 1923, he said, [...] "I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> state art. [...] Art belongs to the domain of the individual. [...] The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view." [...] Mussolini's mistress, Margherita Sarfatti, who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as Marinetti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento group, and even persuaded Marinetti to sit on its board. [...] Although {{in the early years of}} Italian Fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced, towards the end of the 1930s, right-wing Fascists introduced the concept of [...] "degenerate art" [...] from Germany to Italy and condemned Futurism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{directors}} {{changed their}} minds, and sent secretary Alf Jones and player Jack Oliver to Scotland on a recruitment mission. Their only purchase {{was greeted with}} suspicion by the Dart: the 19-year-old Adam Fraser [...] "is {{said to be a}} most capable half-back. Whether he is worth all the trouble the club have gone through to secure him remains to be seen, but if he is <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 'class' player it is strange that he has never been heard of before." [...] It was reported that the Cambridge University and England full back Lewis Vaughan Lodge had agreed to play for the club, but he did appear until February. Meanwhile, after a casual start, Small Heath came back from a three-goal deficit to beat Leyton 8–3 in a friendly. Winning ways continued in the League as they beat Nottingham Forest with a goal in the first five minutes, scored by Hands from a Hallam centre. Roach's performance in goal suggested he was the best of the four tried thus far, and Frank Lester made a promising debut at back, but both teams' forwards were disappointing.|$|E
2500|$|On release, Billboard {{magazine}} listed [...] "Māya Love" [...] {{among the}} [...] "best cuts" [...] on an album that was [...] "far more energetic" [...] than its predecessor, Living in the Material World (1973), and provided [...] "lots of FM potential". In another review that compared Dark Horse favourably with Harrison's acclaimed All Things Must Pass, Michael Gross of Circus Raves described the song as [...] "a soft, funky rocker spiced by superb Billy Preston piano riffs" [...] and noted {{its role as}} {{an answer to the}} [...] "chanted desperation" [...] of [...] "Bye Bye, Love". As with the tour, a number of reviews for the album were unfavourable, however. In one of the most scathing of these, the NMEs Bob Woffinden wrote: [...] "No one track [...] has <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> memorable melody. 'Maya Love' almost sounds like 'My Sweet Lord', though without the positive direction, and by then (the end of side one) George is turning in the same overworked licks quite relentlessly." [...] Woffinden found the album's lyrics [...] "objectionable" [...] and dismissed those on [...] "Māya Love" [...] as part of [...] "the whole oriental mysticism deal we've come to expect from the George we know and are beginning not to love".|$|E
