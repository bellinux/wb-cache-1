60|$|While we {{were talking}} she herself came down <b>and</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> She <b>was</b> just as unnaturally {{composed}} in Sir Percival's presence {{as she had been}} in mine. When breakfast was over he had an opportunity of saying a few words to her privately, in a recess of one of the windows. They were not {{more than two or three}} minutes together, and on their separating she left the room with Mrs. Vesey, while Sir Percival came to me. He said he had entreated her to favour him by maintaining her privilege of fixing the time for the marriage at her own will and pleasure. In reply she had merely expressed her acknowledgments, and had desired him to mention what his wishes were to Miss Halcombe.|$|R

According to one report: [...] "He also tracked down the person who stole “most of” eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes’ money, chased James Earl Ray all over the South and into Canada after he shot the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr." [...] According to Aynesworth, he was asked to serve as a pallbearer for Jack Ruby and played basketball with Fidel Castro. He said that he was playing outside of Havana: “And all of a sudden, this Jeep drives up and a bearded gentleman gets out and puts on his tennis shoes <b>and</b> <b>joins</b> <b>us.</b> I’d <b>been</b> having trouble getting an interview, and after that, it came a little easier.

6000|$|... "The three {{hunters and}} ten of our men with muskets are up there; they started three hours ago, {{as they would}} have to go, Jumbo said, five miles along the face of the cliff before they reached a point where they could make an ascent so as to gain the edge of the ravine. They will keep along {{parallel}} with us, and their fire would clear both sides; it is not usual to take any precaution of this sort, but after our attack of the other day, and the attitude of the chief and his people, we cannot be too cautious. After passing through the first three miles of the defile, the ravine widens into a valley a hundred yards wide; here they will come down <b>and</b> <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> There <b>are</b> two other ravines, similar to the first, to be passed through, but the country there is so wild and broken that it would be impossible for them to keep along on the heights, and I doubt whether even the natives could find a point from which to attack us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not known}} yet. It is {{possible}} that {{when we get to}} a place named Korti, where the river makes a tremendous bend, some of us may cross the desert to Metemmeh, where Gordon's steamers will meet us. If we do I expect that will be the work of the three Camel Corps, and all the boats will go right round the river <b>and</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> there; that <b>is,</b> if they can get up the cataracts. I know the Egyptians say the water will be too low for the boats to go up. That may be true enough as to the native boats, but ours draw so little water that I believe there must always be depth enough for them, for there is always a good lot of water coming down here even at the driest season." ...|$|R

I know,—I can see it—you have, among other ways, been used to managing people with your eyes, letting your moral courage speak out through them, as it were. You have already managed me with your eyes, commanded me with them. But don’t try it on Wolf Larsen. You could as easily control a lion, while {{he would make a}} mock of you.

But I knew, and his genius and my judgment were vindicated when he made that magnificent hit with his ‘Forge.’” ...|$|R
5000|$|Nomads do {{not have}} a mini or colts section, so they have forged links with the Flying Kukris RFC. In 2005 Kay-Russell said [...] "we entered an {{agreement}} with the Kukris at the beginning of last season and it has gone from strength to strength, some of our players are going up to Sheung Shui to help coach the Kukris and, eventually, we aim to see Kukris players progress up the ladder <b>and</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> when they <b>are</b> old enough. The long-term plan is that we give them the opportunity to move seamlessly between the two clubs. The association with the Kukris will hopefully bring in new blood, along with other recruitment. There {{has been a lot of}} discussion at Nomads about how the club should grow but, essentially, we should be concentrating on bringing through players at the grassroots level, so we need to utilise the local talent that is available. We will also consider starting up an U18s team at some stage. If we can get the foundations right then we will look to develop upwards as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--For her health's sake Mrs. Clemens {{must try}} baths somewhere, and this {{it is that}} has {{determined}} {{us to go to}} Europe. The water required seems to be provided at a little obscure and little-visited nook up in the hills back of the Rhine somewhere and you get to it by Rhine traffic-boat and country stage-coach. Come, get [...] "sick or sorry enough" [...] <b>and</b> <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> We shall <b>be</b> a little while at that bath, {{and the rest of the}} summer at Annecy (this confidential to you) in Haute Savoie, 22 miles from Geneva. Spend the winters in Berlin. I don't know how long we shall be in Europe--I have a vote, but I don't cast it. I'm going to do whatever the others desire, with leave to change their mind, without prejudice, whenever they want to. Travel has no longer, any charm for me. I have seen all the foreign countries I want to see except heaven and hell, and I have only a vague curiosity as concerns one of those.|$|R
60|$|During our {{ride the}} Countess recounted {{to me the}} {{extraordinary}} circumstances which had brought her so strangely to my side in the chancel of St. George's chapel. When last she had taken leave of Idris, as she looked anxiously on her faded person and pallid countenance, she had suddenly been visited by a conviction that she saw her for the last time. It was hard to part with her while under the dominion of this sentiment, {{and for the last}} time she endeavoured to persuade her daughter to commit herself to her nursing, permitting me to join Adrian. Idris mildly refused, and thus they separated. The idea that they should never again meet grew on the Countess's mind, and haunted her perpetually; a thousand times she had resolved to turn back <b>and</b> <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> again and again restrained by the pride and anger of which she was the slave. Proud of heart as she was, she bathed her pillow with nightly tears, and through the day was subdued by nervous agitation and expectation of the dreaded event, which she was wholly incapable of curbing. She confessed that at this period her hatred of me knew no bounds, since she considered me as the sole obstacle to the fulfilment of her dearest wish, that of attending upon her daughter in her last moments. She desired to express her fears to her son, and to seek consolation from his sympathy with, or courage from his rejection of, her auguries.|$|R
60|$|The battle had {{now become}} a mélée. The savages went leaping and {{whooping}} forward in the darkness, and heavy blows were given and taken. Guert's clear, manly voice was heard, rising above the clamour, encouraging his companions to press through the throng of their assailants, in tones full of confidence. Both the Trackless and myself discharged our rifles at the foremost of the Hurons, and each certainly brought down his man; {{but it was not}} easy to see what we could do next. To stand aloof and see my friends borne down by numbers was impossible, however, and Susquesus and myself fell upon the enemy's rear. This charge of ours had the appearance of a sortie, and it produced a decided effect on the result, opening a passage by which Dirck and the two settlers issued from the throng, <b>and</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> This <b>was</b> no sooner done, than we all had to stand at bay, retreating little by little, as we could. The result would still have been doubtful, even after we had succeeded in reaching the south-western angle of the building, {{had it not been for}} a forward movement on the part of Herman Mordaunt, at the head of half-a-dozen of his settlers. This reinforcement came into the affair with loaded rifles, and a single discharge, given as soon as we were in a line with our friends, caused our assailants to vanish, as suddenly as they had appeared. On reflecting on the circumstances of that awful night, in after-life, I have thought that the force in the rear of the Hurons began to melt away, even before Herman Mordaunts support was received, leaving their front weak and unsustained. At any rate, the enemy fled to their covers, as has just been related, and we entered the gate in a body, closing and barring it, as soon as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so it {{was that}} I became the nineteenth member of the Santa Rosa Tribe. There were only two outsiders added after me. One was Mungerson, descended from the Magnates, who wandered alone in the wilds of Northern California for eight years before he came south <b>and</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> He it <b>was</b> who waited twelve years more before he married my daughter, Mary. The other was Johnson, the man who founded the Utah Tribe. That was where he came from, Utah, a country that lies very far away from here, across the great deserts, to the east. It was not until twenty-seven years after the plague that Johnson reached California. In all that Utah region he {{reported}} but three survivors, himself one, and all men. For many years these three men lived and hunted together, until, at last, desperate, fearing that with them the human race would perish utterly from the planet, they headed westward on the possibility of finding women survivors in California. Johnson alone came through the great desert, where his two companions died. He was forty-six years old when he <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> he married the fourth daughter of Isadore and Hale, and his eldest son married your aunt, Hare-Lip, who was the third daughter of Vesta and the Chauffeur. Johnson was a strong man, with a will of his own. And it was because of this that he seceded from the Santa Rosans and formed the Utah Tribe at San José. It is a small tribe--there are only nine in it; but, though he is dead, such was his influence and the strength of his breed, that it will grow into a strong tribe and play a leading part in the recivilization of the planet.|$|R
