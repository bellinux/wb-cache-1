40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test {{different}} sealer removal protocols following root canal filling before <b>adhesive</b> <b>seal</b> of access cavities. Material and methods: Forty single root teeth were selected for the study, prepared to size 60 taper. 02, and filled with AH plus and a single gutta-percha cone size 55 taper. 02. Excess sealer was removed with: ethanol-moisturised foam pellet (group 1), pellet and additional etch-and-rinse procedure (group 2), pellet and additional preparation with a water-cooled diamond bur (group 3) or by etch-and-rinse following temporary filling for one week (group 4). Syntac and Tetric flow were used as a secondary protective seal. A dye penetration test (centrifugation 3 min / 30 G; 5 % methylene blue) was carried out. Results were analyzed statistically using PASW 18. 0 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test, Kruskal-Wallis-test, Mann-Whitney-test;p < 0. 05). Results: Groups 2, 3 and 4 revealed less leakage than group 1 (p < 0. 05; Mann-Whitney-tests) and displayed no coloration exceeding the <b>adhesive</b> <b>seal.</b> Teeth with immediate (group 2) or delayed (group 4) <b>adhesive</b> <b>seal</b> showed similar results.

40|$|The <b>adhesive</b> <b>seal</b> between {{membranes}} {{and their}} housing has {{a vital role}} to play in any membrane application, as it ensures the product and feed streams do not mix and that pressure can be maintained. In many applications, the <b>adhesive</b> <b>seal</b> is a major source of membrane module failure and can dictate the operational life of a module. Hence, understanding adhesives in membrane systems is fundamental in ensuring both separation performance and durability; however, this field has been widely overlooked in the literature. This paper attempts to rectify this by discussing in depth adhesive theory and factors that will maximize the adhesion strength, relative to membrane technology. Also highlighted are specific membrane factors that lead to adhesive failure, important when designing a module. The performance of different adhesives is then presented, based on their ability to adhere to different substrates and their resistance to environmental factors. They are discussed and compared relative to the wide range of polymeric and inorganic membrane systems that are currently commercialized or under research. The conclusion raises the possibility of future research in membrane adhesives, as membrane specific developments in the adhesion field have the potential to increase the durability and environmental resistance of membrane modules...|$|E

40|$|Polyurethane-type {{compositions}} were devel-oped as adhesive liners for poly(methyl methacrylate) restorations. Several poly-glycol-diisocyanate mixtures had excellent adhesion {{to human}} dentin {{when applied to}} moist teeth in vitro. Conventional acrylic restorations became durably bonded when applied on top of these urethane liners within 15 to 30 minutes. The need for an adhesive dental restoration material for use in anterior teeth is widely recognized. An adhesive polymeric resin restoration could eliminate marginal leakage, currently the most serious limitation of resin restorations. It {{has been shown that}} cold-curing acrylics, the most widely used poly-meric restorations, have poor marginal adaptation, 1 - 3 which fosters recurrent caries in many patients. The poor marginal seal is aggravated by shrinkage during polymeriza-tion, which can be only partially compen-sated for by the incorporation of acrylic polymers or inorganic fillers. 4 ' 5 Thermal changes also cause these restorations to change dimensions at seven times the rate of tooth substance. 6 Accordingly, thermal cycling causes the margin to act as a pump that can imbibe oral fluids into regions beneath the restoration. Because acrylics have many desirable characteristics from a clinical viewpoint, a rapid method for forming an <b>adhesive</b> <b>seal</b> between an acrylic restoration and dentin would effectively improve the quality of anterior restorations. A polymeric liner, ad-hesive to dentin, in itself could provide a protective barrier and prevent caries develop-ment. Adhesion of the liner to the acrylic restoration would be required for a complet...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} sealing {{properties of}} root canal fillings {{with an additional}} composite barrier. The null hypothesis tested was that different sealers and different methods of sealer removal did not influence microleakage. Material and methods: Eighty extracted human molars with fully mature apices had root canal prepared to size 60 taper. 02 and divided into eight groups: three experimental groups for each sealer and negative/positive control (n = 10 each). Teeth of experimental groups were mounted into the molar region of a training puppet to simulate clinical conditions. Root canals were filled with AH Plus or GuttaFlow and gutta-percha. Excess sealer was removed with: ethanol-moistened foam pellet only, additional preparation with a water-cooled diamond bur or additional etch-and-rinse procedure (37 % phosphoric acid gel). All procedures were carried out until clean as judged by the naked eye. In all groups except the positive control Syntac {{was applied to the}} access cavity. Tetric flow was applied in two increments of 1 mm each. A dye penetration test was carried out by centrifugation for 3 min at 30 G within 5 % methylene blue dye. Statistical evaluation was carried out with PASW 18. 0 (α = 0. 05). Results: Although the two sealers had different chemical composition, sealer exhibited no influence on the results, whereas technique of sealer removal did (Two-way-ANOVA, p < 0. 001). Groups with “foam pellet” or “bur preparation” showed significantly more leakage than groups with “etch-and rinse” (SNK, p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Applying an etch-and-rinse procedure prior to Syntac may be beneficial for the <b>adhesive</b> <b>seal</b> over root canal fillings...|$|E

This ASV not only enables automatic, but also manual closure of the valve. A multicenter, prospective clinical study in 40 laryngectomized patients was conducted. Participants were asked to use the FlexiVoice for 26 weeks. The primary outcome measure was long-term compliance. Secondary outcome measures were: patient preference, hours of FlexiVoice use, device life of adhesive, voice and speech quality, and quality of life. After 26 weeks, 15 patients (37. 5 %) were using the FlexiVoice on a daily basis, for a mean of 12. 64 h/day (SD +/- 5. 03). Ten patients (25 %) were using the device on a non-daily basis, for a mean of 3. 76 h/day (SD +/- 2. 07). The remaining 15 patients (37. 5 %) discontinued using the FlexiVoice. Sixty percent of the 25 long-term users applied both automatic and manual closure of the valve. Unpredictable fixation of the adhesive was {{the main reason for}} discontinuing or not using the FlexiVoice on a daily basis. Overall, 18 patients (45 %) preferred the FlexiVoice, 16 patients (40 %) their usual HME, 3 patients (7. 5 %) their usual ASV, 1 patient (2. 5 %) preferred no device at all, and in 2 patients preference was not recorded. The minor technical issues identified could be corrected.

40|$|PEEK is a polymer {{that is used}} in many {{orthopaedic}} implants because of its favourable mechanical properties and its biocompatibility. High-reliability electronic implants such as pacemakers have ‘hermetic’ enclosures with the electronic components in dry gas. This type of package, generally made of metal or ceramic, guarantees a very long lifetime, but is also expensive. PEEK can be easily machined or injection-moulded, it is an attractive material for implant manufacturers {{and it may be}} that by novel design based on established material properties, PEEK may be used in some applications. This thesis examines the case of PEEK as a packaging material for applications which only require a more limited lifetime (less than three years). The process of moisture ingress through polymers is analysed, and a novel calculation method to quantify it is developed. A telemetry system is designed, which allows measuring the relative humidity inside a PEEK capsule. Diagrams, PCB layouts, microcontroller program and component lists are provided, making this design easily reproducible. The lifetime of PEEK packages is investigated, as well as the contribution of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>seal</b> vs. the package walls. In order to prolong this lifetime, the use of desiccant and thin film coating is suggested. The calculation method we developed is extended to the case of the use of desiccant. This model is found accurate in predicting the time constant when silica gel is used (Type IV isotherm), but not in the case of molecular sieve (Type I isotherm), because of the type of isotherm characterising the desiccant behaviour. Thin film coating of PEEK is also investigated as a means to reduce permeability. It is found that most PVD techniques do not provide a significant improvement, due to high residual stress and the porous morphology of the films. Nevertheless, applying a coating prior to deposition proves effective in mitigating these, and improves the time constant of the package by a factor of 2. 3. Atomic Layer Deposition also shows an improvement in time constant of similar magnitude. Finally, guideline graphs and tables combining calculations and experimental results are presented, providing a quick way for the implant designer to evaluate which size package is required for their application. It is found that time constants in excess of 2. 5 years are achievable, using the right combination of coating and desiccan...|$|E

The underlying objectives of the USSP include becoming more proactive than reactive in addressing safeguards equipment needs, helping the IAEA to maintain an inventory of cost-effective, reliable, and effective safeguards equipment, establishing a long-term planning horizon, and securing IAEA ownership in the process of effective requirements definition and timely transitioning of new or improved systems for IAEA use. At an initial workshop, seals, their functions, performance issues, and future embodiments were discussed in the following order: <b>adhesive</b> <b>seals,</b> metal seals, passive and active loop seals, ultrasonic seals, tamper indicating enclosures (including sample containers, equipment enclosures, and conduits). Suggested improvements to these technologies focused largely on a few themes: (1) The seals must be applied quickly, easily, and correctly; (2) Seals and their associated equipment should not unduly add bulk or weight to the inspectors load; (3) Rapid, in-situ verifiability of seals is desirable; and (4) Seal systems for high risk or high value applications should have two-way, remote communications. Based upon these observations and other insights, the participants constructed a skeletal approach for seals technology planning. The process begins with a top-level review of the fundamental safeguards requirements and extraction of required system features, which is followed by analysis of suitable technologies and identification of technology gaps, and finally by development of a planning schedule for system improvements and new technology integration. Development of a comprehensive procedure will require the partnership and participation of the IAEA.
