40|$|The linear {{polarization}} and reflection of visible light by wheat {{as a function}} of sun-view directions, crop development stage, and wavelength were examined. Two-hundred spectra were taken continuously in wave-lengths from 0. 45 to 0. 72 Micron in 33 view directions using an Exotech model 20 C spectroradiometer six meters above two wheat canopies in the boot and fully headed maturity stages. The analysis results show that the amount of linearly polarized light from the wheat canopies is greatest in the blue spectral region and decreases gradually with increasing wavelength. The results also show that the linearly polarized light from the canopies is generally greatest in the azimuth direction of the Sun and tends toward zero as the view direction tends toward the direction of the hot spot or <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point.</b> It is demonstrated that the single, angle of incidence of sunlight on the leaf, explains almost all of the variation of the amount of polarized light with Sun-view direction...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for simulating the atmospheric dynamics of the close-in giant planet HD 209458 b that allows for the decoupling of radiative and thermal energies, direct stellar heating of the interior, and {{the solution of the}} full 3 D Navier Stokes equations. Simulations reveal two distinct temperature inversions (increasing temperature with decreasing pressure) at the sub-stellar point due to the combined effects of opacity and dynamical flow structure and exhibit instabilities leading to changing velocities and temperatures on the nightside for a range of viscosities. Imposed on the quasi-static background, temperature variations of up to 15 % are seen near the terminators and the location of the coldest spot is seen to vary by more than 20 degrees, occasionally appearing west of the <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point.</b> Our new approach introduces four major improvements to our previous methods including simultaneously solving both the thermal energy and radiative equations in both the optical and infrared, incorporating updated opacities, including a more accurate treatment of stellar energy deposition that incorporates the opacity relevant for higher energy stellar photons, and the addition of explicit turbulent viscosity.

40|$|We {{explore the}} science power of space telescopes used to {{estimate}} the true masses of known radial-velocity exoplanets by means of astrometry on direct images. We translate a desired mass accuracy (+/ 10 % in our example) into a minimum goal for the signal-to-noise ratio, which implies a minimum exposure time. When the planet is near a node, the mass measurement becomes difficult if not impossible, because the apparent separation becomes decoupled from the inclination angle of the orbit. The combination of this nodal effect with considerations of solar and <b>anti-solar</b> <b>pointing</b> restrictions, photometric and obscurational completeness, and image blurring due to orbital motion, severely limits the observing opportunities, often to only brief intervals in a five-year mission. We compare the science power of four missions, two with external star shades, EXO-S and WFIRST-S, and two with internal coronagraphs, EXO-C and WFIRST-C. The star shades out-perform the coronagraph in this science program by about a factor of three. For both coronagraphs, the input catalog includes 16 RV planets, of which EXO-C could possibly observe 10, of which 6 would have a 90 % guarantee of success. Of the same 16 planets, WFIRST-C could possibly observe 12, of which 9 are guaranteed. For both star-shade missions, the input catalog includes 55 planets, of which EXO-S could possibly observe 37, of which 20 are guaranteed. Of the same 55, WFIRST-S could possibly observe 45, of which 30 are guaranteed. The longer spectroscopic exposure times should be easily accommodated for the RV planets with guaranteed success...|$|R
40|$|In {{the clear}} sky {{there are three}} {{commonly}} known loci, the Arago, Babinet, and Brewster neutral points, where the skylight is unpolarized. These peculiar celestial points, bearing {{the names of their}} discoverers, {{have been the subject of}} many ground-based investigations, because their positions are sensitive indicators of the amount and type of atmospheric turbidity. According to theoretical considerations and computer simulations, there should exist an additional neutral point approximately opposite to the Babinet point, which can be observed only at higher altitudes in the air or space. Until now, this anonymous "fourth" neutral point has not been observed during air- or space-borne polarimetric experiments and has been forgotten, in spite of the fact that the neutral points were a basic tool in atmospheric research for a century. Here, we report on the first observation of this fourth neutral point from a hot air balloon. Using 180 degrees-field-of-view imaging polarimetry, we could observe the fourth neutral point at 450, 550, and 650 nm from different altitudes between 900 and 3500 m during and after sunrise at approximately 22 degrees - 40 degrees below the <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point</b> along the anti-solar meridian, depending on the wavelength and solar elevation. We show that the fourth neutral point exists at the expected location and has characteristics similar to those of the Arago, Babinet, and Brewster points. We discuss why the fourth neutral point has not been observed in previous air- or space-borne polarimetric experiments...|$|E
40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation {{reviews the}} use of optical telescopes to observe space debris.. It will present {{a brief review of}} how the survey is conducted, and what some of the significant results encompass. The goal is to characterize the population of debris objects at GEO, with emphasis on the faint object population. Because the survey observations extend over a very short arc (5 minutes), a full six parameter orbit can not be determined. Recently we have begun to use a second telescope, the 0. 9 -m at CTIO, as a chase telescope to do follow-up observations of potential GEO debris candidates found by MODEST. With a long enough sequence of observations, a full six-parameter orbit including eccentricity can be determined. The project has used STK since inception for planning observing sessions based on the distribution of bright cataloged objects and the <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point</b> (to avoid eclipse). Recently, AGI's Orbit Determination Tool Kit (ODTK) has been used to determine orbits, including the effects of solar radiation pressure. Since an unknown fraction of the faint debris at GEO has a high area-to-mass ratio (A/M), the orbits are perturbed significantly by solar radiation. The ODTK analysis results indicate that temporal variations in the solar perturbations, possibly due to debris orientation dynamics, can be estimated in the OD process. Additionally, the best results appear to be achieved when solar forces orthogonal to the object-Sun line are considered. Determining the A/M of individual objects and the distribution of A/M values of a large sample of debris is important to understanding the total population of debris at GE...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of inteferometric observation {{of carbon monoxide}} from three planetary atmospheres. The observations address specific questions about the state and structure of each atmosphere. The analysis and results for each planetary body are contained within individual chapters of the thesis and the abstract for each is reproduced below. Titan: Evidence for Well-Mixed Vertical Profile We report on new millimeter heterodyne observations of the ^(12) CO J(1 - 0) rotational transition from the stratosphere of Titan made in October 1994 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. The spectrum obtained clearly exhibits a strong emission core over the 600 MHz bandwidth of the upper sideband spectrometer. The lineshape, referenced to the flat spectrum simultaneously observed in the lower sideband was inverted to determine a best fit CO mixing ratio profile consistent with the observations. The bet fit profile is a constant mixing ratio of 5 ± 1 x 10 ^(- 5) over the altitude range of 60 - 200 km. Combined with IR observation of tropospheric CO (ƒco = 6 x 10 ^(- 5), Lutz et al. 1983) this provides strong evidence that CO is well mixed from the surface to at least 200 km in Titan’s atmosphere. Mars: Thermal Structure from 0 - 70 km Millimeter-wave heterodyne observations of the ^(12) CO J (l - 0) rotational transition from the atmosphere of Mars were made on three dates in February 1993 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. These observations yielded high-quality spectra with a spatial resolution of 4. 2 " on a 12. 5 " diameter Mars. The spectra were numerically inverted for profiles of the local atmospheric temperature from 0 to 70 km, assuming a constant CO mixing ratio for the atmosphere. The derived average low latitude atmospheric temperature profile is approximately 20 K cooler than reference temperature profiles compiled during the Viking era. This new temperature profile is well-matched by cooler profiles determined from whole disk CO measurements, suggesting very little dust loading of the atmosphere {{at the time of}} the observations (Clancy et al. 1990). In addition, the revealed thermal structure shows variation with latitude, and these temperature profiles compare well with profiles derived from Mariner 9 IRIS observations (Leovy 1982, Santee and Crisp 1993) and calculated thermal structure from the Mars General Circulation Model (Haberle et al [...] 1993). The temperature profiles were averaged in local time and the resulting cross-section of temperature as a function of pressure and latitude used to infer the mean zonal circulation of the atmosphere. These wind results are somewhat compromised by the relatively low spatial resolution of the observation but do qualitatively match both inferred zonal winds from the Mariner 9 IRIS observations and Mars GCM calculations. These initial observations point toward the desirability of further interferometric measurements. Venus: Temporal Variations of the Mesophere Millimeter-wave heterodyne observations of the ^(12) CO J(1 - 0) rotational transition from the mesosphere of Venus were made in early November and early December 1994 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. The spatial resolute ion for each day was about 1000 km at the sub-earth point. The high quality CO spectra were numerically inverted for profiles of the local CO mixing ratio from 80 to 105 km, assuming a Pioneer Venus mean temperature profile for the atmosphere. For each day the revealed CO distribution shows a nightside maximum centered at low latitudes and shifted from the <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point</b> toward the morning terminator. Both clays show a clear latitudinal falloff in the CO abundance. In November the maximum was centered at roughly 2 ^h local time at 100 km, while in December the maximum was at roughly 4 – 4. 5 ^h local time at 100 km. In addition, CO abundances were slightly higher in November. The changes in the CO distribution are examined in the context of the mesospheric circulation model of Clancy and Muhleman (1985 b). The increased shift away from the <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point</b> and decreased CO abundance for the December observations both point toward increased zonal and/or decreased sub-solar to anti-solar circulation within the mesosphere during the month between observations. ...|$|E
40|$|Venus is {{a unique}} planet because its {{atmospheric}} dynamics are mainly driven by thermal heating and its very low rotation rate. Many details of {{the middle and upper}} atmospheric dynamics can be determined from observing nightside airglow emissions, which serve as effective tracers of Venus' middle and upper atmosphere global wind system. The purpose of this dissertation is to use the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Venus Thermospheric General Circulation Model (VTGCM) to examine the underlying processes that control the thermospheric circulation of Venus by comparing simulations to observations. Most recently, Venus Express (VEX) has been monitoring key atmospheric features (O 2 IR nightglow, NO UV nightglow, and nightside temperatures) of Venus. Statistical maps have been created utilizing these nightglow observations from VEX. Moreover, the O 2 IR statistical map has been used to deduce a three-dimensional atomic oxygen density map, which is used to examine the implications of atomic oxygen density distributions below 140 km on the nightside. The VTGCM model has been reconstructed and revised in order to address these key nightglow observations and provide diagnostic interpretation. Specifically, the VTGCM simulations capture the statistically averaged mean state of these three key observations. The correlation between the simulation results and the VEX data sets implies a weak retrograde superrotating zonal flow (RSZ) from ~ 80 km to 110 km with the emergence of modest RSZ winds approaching 60 m s- 1 above ~ 130 km. This RSZ flow is superimposed upon a strong subsolar-antisolar flow from day-to-night. VTGCM sensitivity tests were subsequently performed using two tunable parameters (nightside eddy diffusion and wave drag) to examine corresponding variability within the VTGCM and these nightglow distributions. The VTGCM also reproduces a nightside atomic oxygen density map and vertical profiles across the nightside. Both the simulated map and vertical profiles are in close agreement with VEX observations within a ~ 30 degree contour of the <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point.</b> The atomic oxygen vertical profiles are comparable to the data above 90 km, consistent with the corresponding O 2 IR nightglow intensities. The research performed for this dissertation has determined the parametric sensitivity of the thermospheric flow around Venus...|$|E
40|$|N and O atoms {{produced}} by photo-dissociation of CO 2 and N 2 {{on the day}} side of Venus are transported to the night side in the thermospheric circulation. When the air parcel is descending, the recombination N+O→ NO produces the famous γ and δ bands of NO emission. Pioneer Venus (1978) suggested that the statistical center of the emission is off from the <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point,</b> about one- two hours in Local time after midnight. This is confirmed from SPICAV/VEX results, and the explanation generally accepted is the influence of retrograde super rotation. However, the emission takes place at 115 km, while VIRTIS/VEX, with maps of O 2 emission (peak altitude 95 km) in the night side of Venus (recombination of O+O coming from the day side), {{has shown that the}} maximum of emission is statistically centered on the antisolar point. Therefore, there is no influence of super-rotation at 95 km. One way to explain this paradox is that the cause of the super rotation is different at 115 km and in the lower atmosphere. Alternately, some gravity waves could propagate from below, crossing the altitude 95 km with minimal interaction, and breaking around 115, depositing their momentum. Another consideration is that the altitude of N 2 photo-dissociation is higher in the thermosphere than CO 2, therefore the thermospheric circulation pattern may be different for the transport of N atoms, and O atoms. We have started building maps of the NO emission by moving around the spacecraft along its orbit on the night side. The idea is that NO emission is concentrated generally in rather well defined patches of light. Therefore, by comparing maps taken at 1 hour or 24 hr interval, we can make a “bright patch tracking”, and derive directly the velocity of the moving air parcel containing N and O (we are aware that a part of the motion could be due to a phase shift of a gravity wave, if it has some influence on the NO emission). Preliminary results from this exercise with Venus Express will be presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop the indicatri es of reflected solar radiation from different natural surfaces and to show comparisons between values sensed in space of emergent radiation to ground values obtained from accounting for anisotropic reflection and estimating the effect of the intervening atmosphere. Thus, this study demonstrated that a prior knowledge of the angular distribution of reflected radiation allows determining the true hemispherical reflected radiation from a narrow field of view instrument such as found on a flying platform. Measurements for determining the indicatrices were made from a tower-mounted Nimbus MRIR and, in one case, with a hand-held TIROS five-channel radiometer. Anisotropy of reflected radiation was found for all surfaces examined and increased with decreasing solar angle. Different surfaces showed different degrees and patterns of fonvard and backscatter. A clearly defined <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point</b> was found for plowed field, various agricultural crops and vegetated desert surfaces, while snow, the Alkali Flats, and Bonneville Salt Flats showed a broad pattern of backscatter. As a consequence of surfaces exhibiting well-defined antisolar points the anisotropic correction factors relating normal reflectances to 2 π reflected values were less than 100 percent for solar angles greater than approximately 60 °. All surfaces examined showed anisotropic correction factors increasing with decreasing solar angles. The albedo over the White Sands dune field decreased with decreasing solar angles due to large shadow patterns which are produced at low solar angles. The sand dunes values were derived from aircraft measurements. Comparisons were made between estimated emergent radiation {{from the top of the}} earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere accounting for anisotropy of the ground reflection pattern and estimates of atmospheric attenuation to values of reflected radiation obtained from the MSS subsystem of the ERTS program for the lava beds region and White Sands area in New Mexico. Also comparisons were shown between the estimated emergent radiation from the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface for the same features and spectral bands to the values sensed in space. Under high albedo conditions as found in the White Sands area there was a decrease in emergent radiation to space while with low surface albedo, such as the lava beds region, the extra-terrestrial radiation increased from the ground values...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{demands on}} the forest {{resource}} will necessitate increasingly more intensive management in the future. In order to achieve this goal, reliable and timely information over large geographic areas will be required. Remote sensing techniques offer much potential for the procurement of such information. This research, then, was pointed toward study of that potential. Four objectives were established as follows: 1) to determine the optimum number of the available twelve multispectral scanner (MSS) wavelength bands to use for forest cover mapping with automatic data processing (ADP) techniques; 2) to determine the current capability to map basic forest cover using MSS data and ADP techniques; 3) to determine the relative utility, to forest cover mapping, of the four spectral regions available in the twelve-channel MSS data (i. e. visible, and near, middle and thermal infrared); and 4) to compare the accuracy of digitized color infrared photography with that of MSS data for forest cover mapping using ADP techniques. In attaining the first objective, statistics defining the six cover type classes of interest (deciduous forest, coniferous forest, water, forage, corn, and soybeans) were calculated and used by the computer {{as a basis for}} the selection of 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 wavelength band combinations ranging in size from one through ten wavelength bands each. With the spectral information contained in each of these combinations, and with all twelve channels, the entire test area was classified into the six defined classes, using the LARSYS programs. Tests of the computer 2 ̆ 7 s performance indicated that the use of five wavelength bands would fulfill the dual requirements of adequate accuracy and moderate computer time. In fulfilling the second objective, the automatically selected 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 combination of five channels (one each from the green and red visible wavelengths, and the near, middle and thermal infrared wavelengths) produced classification accuracies in excess of 90 percent for deciduous and coniferous forest. When these two classes were grouped, the accuracy for combined forest was in excess of 95 percent. The use of all twelve channels caused only a slight increase in overall accuracy. In satisfying the third objective, the LARSYS feature selection processor was allowed to consider wavelength bands constituting only various subsets of the four spectral regions. On this basis, it selected a number of five-channel combinations. Classifications performed by these various channel combinations indicate that the visible wavelengths are sufficiently accurate for classifying combined forest, but inadequate for differentiating between deciduous and coniferous forest. The infrared channels separated the two forest classes with reasonable accuracy, but allowed confusion between forest and the agricultural classes. The deletion of either the near or the middle infrared individually, did not reduce accuracies, but, when both were deleted, accuracies dropped drastically. The deletion of the thermal infrared had little effect on forest cover mapping but did allow considerable confusion among the agricultural cover types. These results indicate that the thermal infrared is desirable, but not necessary, for basic forest cover mapping, and that accurate classification of deciduous and coniferous forest cover can be achieved with the visible plus either the near or middle infrared spectral regions. To meet the fourth objective, small-scale color infrared photography, acquired the same day over the test site, was color separated, digitized in three wavelength bands and, automatically classified. In general, the digitized photography was inadequate for automatic forest cover mapping and compared poorly to the MSS data results when similar wavelength bands were used. These results were apparently caused by the narrower dynamic range, poorer spectral resolution, and uneven illumination (due to vignetting and the <b>anti-solar</b> <b>point)</b> of the photographic data...|$|E
