40|$|Underwood and Underwood’s 'Rome {{through the}} Stereoscope' of 1902 was a {{landmark}} in stereoscopic photography publishing, {{both as an}} intense, visually immersive experience and as a cognitively demanding exercise. The set consisted of a guidebook, forty-six stereographs, and five maps whose notations enabled the reader/viewer to precisely replicate the location and orientation of the photographer at each site. Combined with the extensive narrative within the guidebook, the maps and images guided its users through the city via forty-six sites, whether {{as an example of}} <b>armchair</b> <b>travel</b> or an actual travel companion. The user’s experience is examined and analyzed within the following parameters: the medium of stereoscopic photography, narrative, geographical imagination, and memory, bringing forth issues of movement, survey and route frames of reference, orientation, visualization, immersion, and primary versus secondary memories. 'Rome through the Stereoscope' was an example of virtual travel, and the process of fusing dual images into one — stereoscopic synthesis — further demarcated the experience as a virtual environment...|$|E

40|$|Taking a 1906 {{advertising}} for a tourist trip as starting point, the author explores the possible {{uses of the}} term ‘event’ for discussions of tourist imagery {{at the time of}} early cinema. On first sight, traveling – be it <b>armchair</b> <b>travel</b> or “real” travel – seemed to be a domain to which the concept of event can be applied, at least insofar as the extraordinary experience and thereby the experience-as-event is highlighted. When looking deeper into the use that is made of the “eventness” and the function the extraordinary plays in tourism, tourist imagery, and tourist events, it becomes apparent that “event” needs to be conceptualized other than when used to describe extraordinary news incidents or ceremonies. “Event” then needs to be conceptualized as a qualitative category rather than a temporal one. If applied to research on tourism and travelogues, a careful conceptualization of the term “event” is needed that renders justice to the repetitive logic of these domains...|$|E
