5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they <b>are</b> <b>rolling.</b> Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

25|$|The {{western part}} of the county {{consists}} largely of spread-out flood-prone farms with spotty marshes along the Wabash and White Rivers. There <b>are</b> <b>rolling</b> hills around Owensville, and large forest and marshland tracts lie near the Gibson Generating Station and the three river settlements of Crawleyville, East Mount Carmel, and Skelton. The northern part is near the White River and is more given to hills and forest. The eastern part contains many hills and is also dotted with strip pits and active coal mines. The southern part is more given to valley and marshland, drained by the Pigeon Creek which flows south through Evansville.|$|E

2500|$|Democritus {{held that}} {{originally}} {{the universe was}} composed of nothing but tiny atoms churning in chaos, until they collided together to form larger units—including the earth and everything on it. He surmised {{that there are many}} worlds, some growing, some decaying; some with no sun or moon, some with several. He held that every world has a beginning and an end and that a world could be destroyed by collision with another world. To epitomize Democritus's cosmology, Russell calls on Shelley: [...] "Worlds on worlds <b>are</b> <b>rolling</b> ever / From creation to decay, / Like the bubbles on a river / Sparkling, bursting, borne away".|$|E
2500|$|The Umatilla Dissected Uplands {{ecoregion}} {{consists of}} dissected, hilly uplands with a terrace-like appearance, where the dry grasslands of the Columbia Plateau meet the forested Blue Mountains ecoregion. Slopes <b>are</b> <b>rolling</b> to very steep. Elevation varies from 1,600to4,400feet (490to1,340m). The hills and uplands {{are covered with}} Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass. Near the Blue Mountains, some north-facing slopes have Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, with snowberry, pinegrass, and ninebark. The region is mostly used as rangeland because it lacks the thick, arable loess deposits that cover the agricultural Umatilla Plateau. Scablands, composed of arrays of earth mounds surrounded by rock polygons, are relics of Pleistocene glacial periods. The region covers [...] in Eastern Oregon, in a narrow band along {{the northern edge of}} the Umatilla National Forest, mostly outside the national forest's boundaries.|$|E

Harlan Huckleby added 89 yards, and quarterback Rick Leach {{completed}} only three of 14 passes and threw three interceptions. [...] Commenting on Leach's passing, one sportswriter noted: [...] "hen the Wolverines <b>are</b> <b>rolling</b> up a shutout, and 340 yards rushing, hardly anybody notices the passing.

2500|$|During {{a severe}} period of {{national}} economic {{recession in the}} early 1890s, labor unrest was at its height. A volatile situation in Chicago in August 1893 caused the city’s then mayor, Carter Henry Harrison, to warn that the preponderance of the unemployed would lead to riots that would “shake the country” unless Congress interceded. In late August 1893, Gompers addressed 25,000 unemployed workers who had massed {{on the shore of}} Lake Michigan. [...] As reported in the Chicago Tribune on August 31, Gompers inveighed against the controllers of capital and the titans of industry and finance. “Why should the wealth of the country be stored in banks and elevators while the idle workman wanders homeless about the streets and the idle loafers who hoard the gold only to spend it on riotous living <b>are</b> <b>rolling</b> about in fine carriages from which they look out on peaceful meetings and call them riots?” ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the longitudinal}} input shaft (or prop shaft) to the pinion, which in turn drives the transverse ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an axle housing, or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the engine crankshaft and the gearbox shafts transverse, and with the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel. A differential consists of one input, the drive shaft, and two outputs which are the two drive wheels, however the rotation of the drive wheels are coupled to each other by their connection to the roadway. [...] Under normal conditions, with small tire slip, the ratio of the speeds of the two driving wheels is defined by the ratio of the radii of the paths around which the two wheels <b>are</b> <b>rolling,</b> which in turn is determined by the track-width of the vehicle (the distance between the driving wheels) and the radius of the turn.|$|E
