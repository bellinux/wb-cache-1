5|$|While {{over the}} South China Sea on October12, a United States Air Force WC-130H Hercules {{reconnaissance}} <b>aircraft</b> (<b>call</b> <b>sign</b> Swan 38), {{with a crew}} of six, went missing while collecting data on the cyclone. The plane took off from Clark Air Base during the night on October12 and made its final contact six hours later roughly 95km (60mi) north of Manila. A rescue team of five Air Force aircraft and the USS White Plains was dispatched to look for survivors. Search and rescue missions for the crew only found pieces of debris, such as an aircraft survival radio, soundproofing material, and orange cushion-like material. All six crewmen were never found and are presumed dead. Following the incident, the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron established the Swan 38 Memorial Scholarship for outstanding students in the 403d Wing.|$|E

40|$|Communication errors {{involving}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> were {{portrayed in}} reports of 462 hazardous incidents voluntarily {{submitted to the}} ASRS during an approximate four-year period. These errors resulted in confusion, disorder, and uncoordinated traffic conditions and produced the following types of operational anomalies: altitude deviations, wrong-way headings, aborted takeoffs, go arounds, runway incursions, missed crossing altitude restrictions, descents toward high terrain, and traffic conflicts in flight and on the ground. Analysis of the report set resulted in identification of five categories of errors involving call signs: (1) faulty radio usage techniques, (2) <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> loss or smearing due to frequency congestion, (3) confusion resulting from similar sounding <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> (4) airmen misses of <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> leading to failures to acknowledge or readback, and (5) controller failures regarding confirmation of acknowledgements or readbacks. These error categories are described in detail and several associated hazard mitigating measures that might be aken are considered...|$|R

5000|$|The presidential {{call sign}} was {{established}} for security purposes during {{the administration of}} Dwight D. Eisenhower. The change stemmed from a 1953 incident where an Eastern Airlines commercial flight (8610) had the same call sign as the flight the president was on (Air Force 8610). The airliner accidentally entered the same airspace, and after the incident, the unique presidential <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Air Force One" [...] was introduced. The first official flight of Air Force One was in 1959, during the Eisenhower administration.|$|E

Navigator Jerry Pitzl made hourly sextant sightings over the next two days to confirm their location. On the morning of April 20, the party journeyed somewhat less than four miles to account for ice drift, and signaled a United States Air Force C-135 weather reconnaissance aircraft using a handheld radio.

5000|$|Nixon was {{the first}} {{president}} to use this Air Force One, dubbing it and its sister plane, SAM 26000, the [...] "Spirit of '76;" [...] President Nixon had that phrase painted on {{the nose of the}} two aircraft (later removed by President Carter). Although SAM 27000 replaced SAM 26000 as Nixon's primary mode of aerial transportation, he chose to ride SAM 26000 when his family flew with him. Nixon garnered much attention for his frequent flying aboard Air Force One, usually flying to his homes in California and Florida, but also made many trips abroad, such as his trip to China in 1972. Top presidential aides and cabinet ministers used the plane as well, including Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. When President Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, he flew to his home in Orange County, California aboard SAM 27000. While flying over Missouri en route to their destination, Colonel Ralph Albertazzie, the pilot, contacted Kansas City Center and had the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> changed from Air Force One to SAM 27000 due to Gerald Ford being sworn in.|$|R
2500|$|Air Traffic Control (ATC) grants special {{treatment}} to air ambulance operations, {{much like a}} ground ambulance using lights and a siren, only when they are actively operating with a patient.

5000|$|In most countries, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> or [...] "tail number"/"tail letters" [...] (also {{known as}} {{registration}} marks) {{are linked to}} the international radio call sign allocation table and follow a convention that aircraft radio stations (and, by extension, the aircraft itself) receive call signs consisting of five letters. For example, all British civil aircraft have a five-letter call sign beginning with the letter G. Canadian aircraft have a call sign beginning with C-F or C-G, such as C-FABC. Wing In Ground-effect vehicles (hovercraft) in Canada are eligible to receive C-Hxxx call signs, and ultralight aircraft receive C-Ixxx call signs. In days gone by, even American aircraft used five letter call signs, such as KH-ABC, but they were replaced prior to World War II by the current American system of civilian aircraft call signs (see below).|$|E
5000|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{the helicopters}} were not equipped with armor. The crew would wear the [...] "flak vest" [...] and place another flack vest under the pilot seats to provide personal protection.

5000|$|... 22 Wing/CFB North Bay has {{continued}} as the centre {{for the air}} defence of the country, and partner with the United States in NORAD guarding the air sovereignty of the continent. In the late 1990s plans were enacted for a new air defence facility to replace the aging Underground Complex. The complex's air defence electronic, communications and computer systems—the leading edge of early 1980s technology—had become antiquated, struggling {{to cope with the}} demands and crises of an Internet Age world. Moreover, the cost of operating the decades-old, shopping centre-size subterranean complex was rapidly becoming prohibitive. On 20 August 2003, Prime Minister the Right Honourable Jean Chrétien turned soil inaugurating {{the construction of a new}} above ground complex. Three years later, 12 October 2006, 43 years and 11 days after the Underground Complex's birth, a brand new, state-of-the-art surface installation was opened by Minister of National Defence, the Honorable Gordon O'Connor, officially taking the baton of air defence operations from the Underground Complex. The new installation was named the Sgt David L. Pitcher Building, in honour of a Canadian Forces Air Defence Technician who was killed in the crash of an Boeing E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) <b>aircraft,</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> Yukla 27, at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on 22 September 1995. The aircraft ingested birds into two of its four engines during takeoff; all 24 crew members were killed.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{variations}} of <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> exist to express safety concerns to all operators and controllers monitoring the transmissions. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{will use the}} suffix [...] "heavy" [...] for heavy aircraft, to indicate an aircraft {{that is going to}} cause significant wake turbulence, e.g. United Two-Five Heavy; All aircraft capable of operating with a gross take-off weight of more than 136 tonnes. must use this suffix {{whether or not they are}} operating at this weight during a particular phase of flight. These are typically Boeing 747, some models of the 757, 777, or 767, Airbus A340, A330, A350 and A300, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 or MD-11, or Lockheed L-1011 aircraft. The suffix [...] "super" [...] is used for the Airbus A380. For air ambulance services or other flights involving the safety of life (such as aircraft carrying a person who has suffered a heart attack), [...] "lifeguard" [...] is added to the <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> For flights in which life is not in direct danger (such as transporting organs for transplant), the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> prefix [...] "Pan-Pan-Medical" [...] is used before the normal <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> e.g. Pan-Pan-Medical Three-Three-Alpha, Pan-Pan-Medical Northwest Four-Five-Eight, or Pan-Pan-Medical Singapore Niner-Two-Three. Pan Pan (pronounced [...] "pahn-pahn") is the voice radio signal for [...] "urgent", while Mayday is the voice radio signal for [...] "distress". The word may be omitted for air ambulance services with assigned <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> especially when they have notified air traffic control operators that they are on an air ambulance mission at the beginning of their flight and do not change from one controller to another. The Life Flight air ambulance service, for example, might simply identify as Life-Flight Three. An aircraft that has declared an in-flight emergency will sometimes prefix the word Mayday to its <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{air traffic}} control the voice {{communication}} between a controller and all pilots in a delimited airspace are handled on a single VHF frequency. To identify a speaking aircraft, pilots have to start all verbal communications with the <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> For automatic identification, it is desirable to transmit additional hidden aircraft identification data in time with this voice message over the VHF channel. That means the additional digital data has to be embedded into the speech signal. Such watermarking systems are used e. g. for CD-audio copyright protection, where copyright data is embedded into the music without any audible distortion. A system for speech watermarking in an {{air traffic control}} environment is developed. The system uses spread spectrum technology with linear pre-diction for spectral shaping of the watermark to achieve perceptual hiding. Error control coding is done using the BCH-code, which can both detect and correct errors. Results show that, for 12 bits/s, the watermark can be transmitted at a level which is hardly audible with very low error rate (0 : 1 %). For the transmission of 24 and 36 bits/s the watermark level has to be increased to an audible but not annoying level so as {{to stay in a}} low error rate region. 1...|$|E

The <b>aircraft,</b> using the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> Swan 38, was sent to investigate Typhoon Bess after it passed over the Philippines and continued to the northwest. The crew departed Clark Air Base on the island of Luzon in the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|After an {{aircraft}} has {{made contact with}} an air traffic control facility, the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> may be abbreviated. Sometimes the aircraft make or model is used {{in front of the}} full or abbreviated <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> for instance, the Americ{{an aircraft}} mentioned above might then use Cessna Eight-Charlie-Papa. Alternatively, the initial letter of the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> can be concatenated with the final two or three characters, for instance a British aircraft registered G-BFRM may identify as Golf-Romeo-Mike while the American aircraft might use November-Eight-Charlie-Papa. The use of abbreviated <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> has its dangers, in the case when <b>aircraft</b> with similar <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are in the same vicinity. Therefore, abbreviated signs are used only so long as it is unambiguous.|$|R
