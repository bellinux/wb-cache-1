40|$|The study {{investigated}} how knowledge sharing process takes place among communities {{in rural areas}} in Tanzania. Specifically, the study determined how knowledge was created; assessed how rural people <b>shared</b> knowledge; <b>and</b> evaluated the impacts of social-cultural practices, individual and institutional factors on knowledge creation <b>and</b> <b>sharing.</b> The study also assessed how ICTs were used in knowledge creation <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> among rural people. The study employed a meta-analysis where studies on knowledge acquisition <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> among rural people in Tanzania were critically analysed. The findings reveal that rural people created <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> knowledge in need for their day to day activities. Knowledge was created through observations, personal experiences and social interactions <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> mainly through discussions and conversations held on several occasions. Individual, institutional, social-cultural practices and technological factors influenced the knowledge creation <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> process. It was further established that rural people consulted some knowledge sources more <b>and</b> <b>shared</b> knowledge through formal and informal groups. Decisions on sources consulted were influenced by socio-economic, demographic and geographical factors surrounding rural people. However, the poor link between the knowledge-rich and knowledge-poor units limited the knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> creation processes. It is recommended that the link between units creating knowledge and those using it should be improved so that rural communities can easily acquire <b>and</b> <b>share</b> it. Because rural people depend on exogenous knowledge from other institutions, institutional knowledge creation <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> capacities should be improved to enhance knowledge sharing in rural communities. Rural communities should try to eliminate the individual factors and social-cultural practices hindering knowledge creation <b>and</b> <b>sharing</b> process...|$|R
