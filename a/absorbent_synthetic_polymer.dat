30|$|During {{the past}} years wound {{dressing}} has been modernized which now mainly consist of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> for wound management. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> dressings {{can be classified}} as passive and interactive. Passive <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> dressings are non-occlusive, used for covering wound and help in restoring function under the polymer film. Example of such passive <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> is gauze and tulle. Interactive <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> dressings are occlusive or semi-occlusive which provide a barrier against bacterial penetration to the wound. They {{can be in the}} form of films, foams, hydrogel or hydrocolloids (Dhivya et al. 2015).|$|R

25|$|Two main {{groups of}} <b>polymers</b> exist: <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> and biopolymers. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> are artificially manufactured, and are {{commonly}} referred to as industrial polymers. Biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural environment, or without human intervention.|$|R
25|$|A <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> may be loosely {{described}} as crystalline if it contains regions of three-dimensional ordering on atomic (rather than macromolecular) length scales, usually arising from intramolecular folding and/or stacking of adjacent chains. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> may consist of both crystalline and amorphous regions; {{the degree of}} crystallinity may be {{expressed in terms of}} a weight fraction or volume fraction of crystalline material. Few <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> are entirely crystalline.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> was {{synthesized}} {{and used}} {{for the improvement of}} dyeing properties as well as decolorization of textile waste water. Two dyes were selected having anthraquinone based Remazol Blue R and azo based Remazol Red RB. It was observed that the <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> can be used as fixer for the fixation of dye by crosslinking between dye and fibre, which not only improves the dyeing properties but also helpful to coagulate the colour after dyeing. By single point method the concentrations of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> were calculated in residual after dyeing. It was examined that the residual <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> is helpful in colour removal efficiency by coagulation of polymer with dye to form heavy molecules which settle down and decolorization occurred. Colour removal efficiency was found dependents on pH, concentration of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> and inorganic coagulant...|$|R
40|$|Enzyme {{technology}} has progressed from the biotransformation of small substrates to biotransformation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers.</b> Important breakthroughs {{have been the}} isolation and design of novel enzymes with enhanced activity on <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> substrates. These were made possible by efficient screening procedures and genetic engineering approaches based on an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of enzymes on <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers.</b> Enhancement of the hydrophilicity of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> is a key requirement for many applications, ranging from electronics to functional textile production. This review focuses on enzymes that hydrolyse polyalkyleneterephthalates, polyamides or polyacrylonitriles, specifically on the polymer surface thereby replacing harsh chemical processes currently used for hydrophilisation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> have {{transformed}} society {{in many areas}} of science and technology, including recent breakthroughs in medicine. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> now offer unique and versatile platforms for drug delivery, as they can be “bio-tailored” for applications as implants, medical devices, and injectable polymer-drug conjugates. However, while several currently used therapeutic proteins and small molecule drugs have benefited from <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers,</b> the full potential of polymer-based drug delivery platforms has not yet been realized. This review examines both general advantages and specific cases of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> in drug delivery, focusing on PEGylation in the context of polymer architecture, self-assembly, and conjugation techniques that show considerable effectiveness and/or potential in therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|Nineteen {{samples of}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> were {{evaluated}} for relative toxicity {{in the course}} of characterizing materials intended for aircraft interior applications. The generic polymers included ABS, chlorinated PVC, polycarbonate, polyphenylene oxide, polyphenylene sulfide, polysulfone, polyaryl sulfone, polyether sulfone, polybismaleimide, and polyvinyl fluoride. Test results are presented, and compared in relative rankings with similar results on cellulosic materials and other <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers.</b> Under these test conditions, the samples of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> were either comparable to or significantly less toxic than the samples of commercial cellulosic materials...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} which often require extensive characterization to determine chemical composition and structure. Mass spectrometric techniques have greatly enhanced the quantity, {{as well as}} the quality, of data {{that can be used to}} characterize <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers.</b> Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry, ESI-MS, is capable of providing a wealth of information on biomolecules, inorganic compounds, and small <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> (molecular weight less than 3, 000 g/mol). While ESI-MS has proven to be a powerful characterization technique for small <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> its tendency to generate multiply charged ions results in very complex data for higher molecular weight <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> and yields data that is too complicated for complete analysis. A means to simplify the data obtained for ESI-MS characterization of large <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> by reducing multiple charging and increasing signal to noise ratio of the singly charged analyte ions would be of substantial use.   Singly charged poly (methyl methacrylate) ions with weight average molecular weights 4, 000, 8, 000 and 12, 000 g/mol were observed by adding a surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) and changing critical ESI conditions. Altering these parameters, as well as others, has played an important role of reducing the overall charging that the analyte may gain during the desolvation process.   M. S...|$|R

40|$|The {{conjugation}} of peptides/proteins and <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> is {{a useful}} strategy to overcome some of the limitations related {{to the use of}} the individual components. This review will highlight two aspects: enhanced structural control at the nanometer level and improved performance, in particular with respect to biomedical applications. In the former case, peptide sequences are mainly used to mediate self-assembly of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers.</b> In the latter case, conjugation of an appropriate <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymer</b> to a pharmaceutically active peptide/protein can, for example, prevent premature enzymatic degradation and enhance blood circulation times, which is therapeutically advantageous...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> and {{polymeric}} products {{used in the}} Swedish painting conservation field. The aim has been to accumulate and systematize facts about the <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> used in conservation: to describe the chemistry of the products, their manufacture and their field of uses. Thereby, I hope that the thesis also will function as a practical user-guide to synthetic products used in the field. The research questions {{used in the study}} are: How is the chemistry of these conservation products? What kind of <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> are used? What additives are used? Do the polymers and the products affect the original material and how do they degrade? Are they reversible? How toxic are they? The thesis consists of two parts. The first part concerns polymeric chemistry in general. It is manly based on textbooks in polymeric chemistry and techniques, and research from the field of conservation. The second part is based on a questionnaire sent to Swedish conservation institutes in order to acquire information about what products are used in conservation. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> are then listed with reference to their product type, as it is described in materials safety data sheets from the producers and articles describing <b>synthetic</b> <b>polymers</b> used in conservation.
