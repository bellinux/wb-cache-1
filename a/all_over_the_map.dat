25|$|As in Peace Walker, The Phantom Pain {{features}} a base-building {{system that allows}} players to develop weapons and items from their home base. Recruitment of enemy soldiers and prisoners has also returned for this purpose, allowing the base to grow through organization. The player is given the option to access their base from their real-life smartphones and other devices via a companion app. Unlike in Peace Walker where players can only see Mother Base from the air, they can control Snake as he explores the complex on foot. The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, an item introduced into gameplay in Peace Walker, returns as well, with players able to transport captured soldiers and other objects such as animals and vehicles back to Mother Base. Money for upgrading Mother Base's defenses and technology can be collected from objects found <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> such as diamonds, shipping containers, and special blueprint boxes, as well as sending recruited soldiers on combat missions around the world. The income is invested on upgrades to the appearance and abilities, weapons and equipment of Snake, his AI companions, and vehicles. For example, Snake's prosthetic arm can be modified with a taser, echolocation function, or remote controls that allow it to fly as a drone.|$|E

[...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it [...] "bitch slapped the Bush administration" [...] that would later badmouth The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it [...] "has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with Reading Digest. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall." ...|$|E

[...] Chris Moran of Punknews.org complemented the range of Travis' vocals and the musicianship as [...] "extremely tight", but felt that the songs went in too many musical directions to give the band a firm identity: [...] "This record is just <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> One minute we've got some Goth Bay hardcore, the next we've got Morrissey ...

After they had recorded four demos {{in a garage}} and a nursery that displayed their style of alternative, hard and Christian rock music. Rauch, who had worked as an intern in the same Nashville studio as Graves and supplied them with free equipment, invited Graves {{to listen to their}} music for his opinions. Graves recalled: [...] "It was really rough, <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> but I could hear the elements were there ... I told them it was really good, it had potential". Graves took them under his wing, and paid for studio time and the production of their first demos at Paragon Studios which happened across two years. Graves then signed Red to a development contract with his independent production company Six Feet Over, which led to a recording deal with Provident Label Group which then assigned them to its Christian label Essential Records after they liked their demo. Essential gave Red the green-light on a full length album. Speaking on their Christian influence, Barnes said: [...] "We are Christians in a band, but if people feel more comfortable and say that we are a Christian band, we do not to shy away from that". Hendrix parted ways with Red before recording began; he was replaced by drummer Hayden Lamb.|$|E

A constant reminder {{in times of}} extreme political turbulence never to forget the reality around us. How can art play a role in social and political struggles? Can it be a tool with which to shape the world rather than just a reflection of it? Following steirischer herbst festival’s twenty-four hour, seven-day marathon camp of the same name, Truth is Concrete: A Handbook for Artistic Strategies in Real Politics takes the possibility of concrete truth as a working hypothesis for both art and activism, and looks for direct action and concrete knowledge. For an art that not only represents and documents but engages performatively in specific political and social situations. And for an activism that not only acts for the sake of acting but searches for intelligent, creative means of self-empowerment.
