2500|$|Stephen Sundlof, {{director}} of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, says [...] "Melamine is not very toxic as a chemical, so we're wondering why {{we are seeing the}} kinds of serious conditions, especially the kidney failure, that we're seeing in cats and dogs... We <b>are</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> the melamine right now because we believe that, even if melamine is not the causative agent, it is somehow associated with the causative agent, so it serves as a marker". Even at the highest observed concentrations found in wheat gluten, the melamine exposure is much smaller than the rat and mouse doses for which effects were seen. Instead, the FDA has suggested a second contaminant may be responsible for the ill effects and melamine, as the most easily identifiable contaminant, may serve as a biomarker, or indicator, for contaminated wheat gluten.|$|E

Agni V gives you the boosting capability and the 'kill vehicle', with advanced seekers, {{will be able to}} home into the target satellite, DRDO chief, VK Saraswat said. The defence ministry in 2010 had even drafted a 15-year [...] "Technology Perspective and Roadmap", which held development of ASAT weapons [...] "for electronic or physical destruction of satellites in both LEO (2,000-km altitude above earth's surface) and the higher geosynchronous orbit" [...] as a thrust area in its long-term integrated perspective plan under the management of DRDO. Consequently, defence scientists <b>are</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> [...] "space security" [...] to protect India's space assets from electronic or physical destruction. Another spin-off from Agni V test is that the DRDO feels it can work towards launching mini-satellites for battlefield use if an adversary attacks the country's main satellites.|$|E
