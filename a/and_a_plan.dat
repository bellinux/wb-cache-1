5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.|$|E

This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council. However, after {{the murder of a}} Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls, the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard. Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on the south and east sides of the city, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> of attack was formulated.|$|E

5|$|When Rooke {{arrived in}} the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the {{inhabitants}} of Barcelona to revolt against Philip V failed, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to assault the French naval base at Toulon was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take Cádiz had failed. Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of demobilization, the major naval nations of the globe began {{programmes}} for increasing the size and number of their capital ships. Wilson's plan for a world-leading set of capital ships led to a Japanese counter-programme, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> by the British to build sufficient ships to maintain a navy superior to either. American isolationist feeling and the economic concerns of the others led to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. The outcome of the conference included the Washington Naval Treaty (also known as the Five-Power treaty), and limitations on the use of submarines. The Treaty prescribed a ratio of 5:5:3:1:1 for capital ships between treaty nations. The treaty recognized the U.S. Navy as being equal to the Royal Navy with 525,000 tons of capital ships and 135,000 tons of aircraft carriers, and the Japanese as the third power. Many older ships were scrapped by the five nations to meet the treaty limitations, and new building of capital ships limited.|$|E
5|$|Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was {{introduced}} from 1962–1964, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, {{who said that}} they would damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).|$|E

5|$|The Spanish fleet arrived off Roatán at 6am on March 13, {{and after}} its {{defenders}} fired several ineffectual cannon shots, the Santa Maltilda {{and the other}} ships anchored out of range. At 8am Gálvez sent his second-in-command on the 'Santa Matilda' Enrique MacDonell, who spoke English, in to request the surrender of the island's defenders. The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options, which Gálvez granted. After that time had elapsed MacDonell came back with word that the defenders refused to surrender and were prepared to stand their ground 'to the death'. The Spanish were not surprised as their sailors had noticed the English appeared to be preparing defenses during grace period. An Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so Gálvez then held council of his eleven officers, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> of attack was formulated.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} of the Russian Pacific squadron, Bogatyr under Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov, officially made {{a friendly}} visit to Melbourne in early 1863.

Popov had {{in the first half}} of the year 1863 received orders <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> of attack on the British naval ships positioned near the Australian shore. The plan also included shelling and destruction of the Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart coastal batteries. The information was attributed to the Polish lieutenant Władysław Zbyszewski of the Bogatyr, who had deserted from service in Shanghai soon after Bogatyr left Australia, and found his way to Paris to join the Polish January Uprising. This information about Popov's plans was forwarded by a fellow Pole, a certain S. Rakowsky. Similar attack orders are known to have been given to the Atlantic squadron under Rear Admiral Lessovsky, that was sent to New York at the same time.|$|E
