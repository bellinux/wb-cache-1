25|$|Many {{argue that}} Los Angeles paid an unfairly low price to the farmers of Owens Valley for their land. Gary Libecap of the University of California, Santa Barbara {{observed}} that the price that Los Angeles {{was willing to pay}} to other water sources per <b>acre-foot</b> of water was far higher than what the farmers received. Farmers who resisted the pressure from Los Angeles until 1930 received the highest price for their land; most farmers sold their land from 1905 to 1925, and received less than Los Angeles was actually willing to pay. However, the sale of their land brought the farmers substantially more income than if they had kept the land for farming and ranching. None of the sales were made under threat of eminent domain.|$|E

The plant is expected to use over 17,000 reverse osmosis racks. The project includes $80 million in San Diego Water Authority upgrades to its own facilities. A [...] pipeline is being built to deliver desalinated water into its Twin Oaks Valley Water Treatment Plant near San Marcos. The developer Poseidon Resources is building the plant and pipeline in a joint venture with contractor Kiewit Shea Desalination. The project will deliver up to 50 million gallons a day of drought-proof, highly reliable water that will become a core, day-to-day resource for the region. It is projected to meet about 7% of San Diego County's demand in 2020. The total cost is projected at $1,849 to $2,257 per <b>acre-foot.</b> The additional cost of desalinating seawater will add $5 to $7 per month to ratepayers' bills—about a 10% increase.|$|E

To replace this [...] "overdraft" [...] of water into the aquifer, they have flotation ponds that catch rain runoff water, and supplement with other water they either buy or recycle, then let the water soak into the ground (spreading water) to help replenish {{the water in the}} aquifer(s). In addition they buy Colorado River water that is shipped via the Colorado River Aqueduct, and they accept part of the treated municipal wastewater of the about 4,000,000 people in their district and treat it to additional purity and sanitation levels by using reverse osmosis and advanced filtering.

The water out of this facility is better than the water that comes out of the [...] "average" [...] municipal water treatment facility. To finance their water recycling projects WRD charges $268 per <b>acre-foot</b> of water pumped out, which generates about $65,000,000/year.

Although the overall average cost of SWP water is $147 per <b>acre-foot</b> ($119 per 1,000 m3), agricultural users pay far less than their urban counterparts for SWP water. The Kern County Water Agency (the second largest SWP entitlement holder) pays around $45-50 per <b>acre-foot</b> ($36-41 per 1,000 m3) of SWP water, which is mostly used for irrigation. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (the largest entitlement holder) pays $298 per <b>acre-foot</b> ($241 per 1,000 m3).
