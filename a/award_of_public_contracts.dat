40|$|In this essay, {{after an}} {{examination}} of the regulatory framework about compensation claims on public contracts (art. 124 Code of Administrative Process), we will focus on some important and recent judgments on the liability for unlawful procedures for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>contracts.</b> The study outlines a particularly aggravated liability. On the one hand, the Court of Justice of the European Union clearly declares that the liability for the violation of rules on the procedures for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> must leave out of consideration the guilt requisite, thus turning it into an objective liability. On the other hand, the Court of Cassation recognises the possibility to compensation for damages also to the enterprises to which unlawful procedures for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>contracts</b> have been annulled, since the P. A. has violated the general behaviour duties, such as skilfulness, prudence, diligence, as well as correctness, advancing that in such cases the sphere of jurisdiction lies with ordinary courts. However, the legal assessment of the Supreme Court on jurisdiction cannot be shared, since – without considering the rest – it seems that an irreconcilable contrast occurs with the rules of the Code of Administrative Process on exclusive jurisdiction of the administrative courts and compensation for damage.

The traditional method, which is widely used, {{has been criticized for}} its non-performance in projects execution and delivery. To avoid the adverse effects of the current contract procurement methods, Due Process mechanism was introduced. This study, therefore investigated the level of importance of due process by parties involved in the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>contracts,</b> the performance of Due Process and factors that may affect its functions. The survey was carried out by administering structured questionnaires and interviews on the practitioners in the construction industry that were in the private and public sectors. The data collected were analysed with the use of both descriptive and inferential statistics. The study showed that Due Process has become a new initiative being widely embraced by parties in public contract and has helped in saving public fund by corrupt practices that usually characterize award of contracts.

40|$|This chart {{compares the}} EC Procurement Directives and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods, Construction and Services. Most {{central and eastern}} European {{countries}} used the Model Law {{as the basis of}} their public procurement laws in the early 1990 s. Now that many countries of the region are candidates for EU accession, they must adapt their laws to EC Directives. The aim of the chart is to assist in that process. The EC Procurement Directives were introduced into the European Union to further the EU’s policy of enabling enterprises from all EU states to compete fairly in public procurement markets. The most important objective of this policy is to prevent discrimination by procuring entities in favour of their own national enterprises. The EC Directives support this by, inter alia, requiring major contracts to be advertised, open to competition, and awarded through transparent procedures. These conditions make it difficult to disguise discrimination. The UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods, Construction and Services sets out procedures for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>contracts.</b> It is designed for the use of countries introducing procurement laws, or reforming their procurement systems, with the aims of achieving economy and efficiency in public procurement and reducing corruption. The Model Law also seeks to promote international competition in public procurement markets. States should in general seek these objectives by advertising and holding a competition for procurements, and awarding contracts through transparent procedures. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{presenting}} the draft EU regulation on public services requirements (current legal framework, reasons for updating it, main {{content of the}} new regulation) and analysing the consequences on local public transport, providing examples of various types of organisations. Prior to present the new proposal and to analyse the consequences on authorities and operators, the paper will first describe the current legal framework ruling public transport in Europe with a specific focus on financial compensations and granting of exclusive rights for operators. The paper will then describe how several legal disputes have been raised in the public transport sector {{and led to a}} strong expectation for a new regulation. The EU Commission released in July 2005 its third proposal for a “regulation on action by Member States concerning public service requirements and the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> service <b>contracts</b> in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway”. EMTA, association of European Metropolitan Transport Authorities bringing together 32 authorities responsible for public transport, has analysed possible consequences of this regulation on the <b>awarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> service <b>contracts</b> in Europe with a focus on its member cities. The level of change expected by this draft regulation depends mainly on the institutional framework and on the status of operating companies. However, rules applying for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> service <b>contracts</b> can have substantial impacts on all public transport authorities. Impacts of the draft regulation can be evaluated through three items: the organisational impacts, the consistence <b>of</b> <b>public</b> transport networks and the provision of services. A political agreement has been reached on this text in June 2006 by the Transport Council. The Council should then adopt a common position and publish the updated text for transmission to the European Parliament in Autumn 2006 for the second reading. Despite a high probability of being adopted, the final content of the regulation is not determined yet.
