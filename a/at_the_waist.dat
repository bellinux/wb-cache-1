5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, a {{judge of}} first {{instance}} prohibited a poster that advertised the film Ave Maria by Jacques Richard. The poster showed a young woman, covered only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> {{with her arms}} and feet tied to a cross. No appeal was made.|$|E

25|$|The exaggerated walk, {{with one}} hand on {{the small of his back}} and his torso bent almost 90 degrees <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Roman infants {{were usually}} swaddled. Apart from those few, {{typically}} formal garments reserved for adults, most children wore a scaled-down {{version of what}} their parents wore. Girls often wore a long tunic that reached the foot or instep, belted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> and very simply decorated, most often white. Outdoors, they might wear another tunic over it. Boy's tunics were shorter.|$|E

40|$|Laguerre-Gaussian {{modes of}} various order are {{frequency}} doubled. The azimuthal phase {{structure of the}} second-harmonic light is measured directly by interfering the beam with its mirror image. We show that the orbital angular momentum per photon is doubled, so conserving the orbital angular momentum in the light beam. The frequency-doubled output beam is shown to have a Gegenbauer-Gaussian amplitude distribution <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beam <b>waist.</b> <b>The</b> beam {{can be described as}} a summation of Laguerre-Gaussian modes that interfere so that it changes form with propagation, but <b>the</b> distribution <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beam <b>waist</b> is reproduced in the far field.

50|$|The {{reign of}} <b>the</b> Empire <b>waist</b> was short. In the 1830s, {{shoulders}} widened (with puffy gigot sleeves or flounces), skirts widened (layers of stiffened petticoats), and <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> narrowed and migrated towards its natural position. By the 1850s, exaggerated shoulders {{were out of}} fashion and waistlines were cinched <b>at</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>waist</b> above a wide skirt. Fashion had achieved what {{is now known as}} the Victorian silhouette.|$|R
25|$|In China, a loose silk bodice tied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> {{and tied}} or looped {{around the neck}} called the dudou (lit."belly cover") came into fashion among wealthy women during the Ming dynasty of the 14th–17th centuries. It {{remained}} popular under the succeeding Qing dynasty (17th–20th centuries). It was adopted into Vietnamese culture as the yếm and remains in traditional use among the two cultures.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, all Tanala men {{and women}} {{regardless}} of social class wore clothing made from woven or beaten mats made from harefo reeds (Eleocharis plantagines). Mat clothing (tafitsihy) for women consisted of several rectangular pieces stitched together into a tube that was worn drawn up at the shoulder or belted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> while men wore a beaten bark loincloth and a mat jacket or tunic with longer sleeves for older men.|$|E
25|$|As the corset became shorter {{during the}} later 1910s, it {{provided}} less {{support to the}} bust. By 1920 the corset started <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> and bust containment yielded entirely to the bra. A low, sloping bustline became more fashionable. Brassieres from the late 1910s and early 1920s were merely slightly shaped bandeaus (bandeaux) style, holding the bust in and down {{by means of a}} clip attached to the corset.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> plackart stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>waist,</b> {{and metal}} plates, {{much like a}} skirt, were {{attached}} {{to the bottom of}} the plackart. These were called faulds, and protected the hip and the groin.|$|R

25|$|Except {{for very}} long huipils, they are {{generally}} worn with other items of clothing such as a skirt or slip. Most huipils hang loose but some can be tied <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> or can be tucked into a skirt like a blouse. In some cases, such as in San Juan Copala, Oaxaca, the extra length of the huipil is rolled up onto the waist when worn with a skirt.|$|E
25|$|The {{recumbent}} bicycle moves the cranks {{to a position}} forward of the rider instead of underneath, generally improving the slipstream around the rider without the characteristic sharp bend <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> used by racers of diamond-frame bicycles. Banned from bicycle racing in France in 1934 to avoid rendering diamond-frame bicycles obsolete in racing, manufacturing of {{recumbent bicycle}}s remained depressed for another half century, but many models {{from a range of}} manufacturers were available by 2000.|$|E
25|$|The fotă is a richly-ornamented {{wrap-around}} skirt {{made out}} of a rectangular piece of woolen fabric worn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist.</b> Alternately, {{it can be made}} of two pieces of woven material that cover the front of the body (like an apron) and the back. The fotă has several names, according to the ethnographic region: pestelcă (in Muntenia), opreg, vălnic and zăvelcă (in Oltenia), catrință or cretință (in Moldavia), păstură and zadie (in Transylvania), peștiman (in Bessarabia).|$|E

50|$|Princess seams in {{the front}} or back run from the {{shoulder}} or armscye to <b>the</b> hem <b>at</b> <b>the</b> side-back or side-front. Princess seams shape the garment to the body's curves and {{eliminate the need for}} darting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bust, <b>waist,</b> and shoulder.|$|R
25|$|Corsets were shorter to {{suit the}} new bodices, and might have a very stiff busk in the center front {{extending}} to {{the depth of the}} stomacher. Skirts were held in the proper shape by a padded roll or French farthingale holding the skirts out in a rounded shape <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> falling in soft folds to the floor. The drum or wheel farthingale was worn at the English court until the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619.|$|E
25|$|Debagging, {{also known}} as depantsing and just known as pantsing in the United States, is the pulling down of a person's {{trousers}} or underwear mostly against their wishes, typically as a practical joke, but in other instances as a (somewhat common) sexual fetish. The most common method is to sneak up behind the intended victim, grab the trousers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist,</b> and apply a quick downward tug before the victim {{is aware of the}} assailant's presence.|$|E
25|$|Pendulous breasts {{can make}} it {{difficult}} for a person to properly fit a bra. For best results, the breasts should be measured twice: once when standing upright, once bending over <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>waist</b> with the breasts hanging down. If the difference between these two measurements is more than 10cm, then the average is chosen for calculating the cup size. A number of reports, surveys and studies in different countries have found that between 80% to 85% of women wear incorrectly fitted bras.|$|E
