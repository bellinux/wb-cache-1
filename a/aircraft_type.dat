5|$|Aircraft are {{inspected}} during {{maintenance operations}} either outdoors on an airport between flights, or in a hangar for longer-duration inspections. These inspections are conducted mainly by human operators, visually and sometimes using tools to assess defects. The project aims to improve inspections of aircraft and traceability. A database dedicated to each <b>aircraft</b> <b>type,</b> containing images and three-dimensional scans, will be updated after each maintenance. This allows for example {{to assess the}} propagation of a crack.|$|E
5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on ground speed), a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on <b>aircraft</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine <b>aircraft</b> <b>type</b> with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E

5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the <b>aircraft</b> <b>type</b> went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to this accident, American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures.|$|E

25|$|During {{go around}} the Captain {{commanded}} to retract the flaps to 5. The FCOM stated a go around with two engines operation initiated from flaps 30, in which the flaps should be set to 15, and remain at 15 until above 400 feet and the speed reaches 135 knots. There is a strong indication that the PIC reverted to a procedure for a previous <b>aircraft</b> <b>type</b> he had flown when he asked for “Flap 25”, which does not exist on the MA60 <b>aircraft</b> <b>type.</b> Another action was to set flaps position to 5 during the go around. This procedure was a typical action in the Fokker <b>aircraft</b> <b>type.</b> The Captain had 6,982 hours flying time of the Fokker 100 <b>aircraft</b> <b>type,</b> which does have a Flap 25 setting. In contrast, he had flown the MA60 for only 199 hours. Stress and workload can {{increase the likelihood of}} regressing to earlier well-learned habit patterns.|$|E
