5|$|The L'Enfant Plaza Metro station {{opened an}} {{escalator}} entrance in the structure's north arcade on July 1, 1977. The entrance {{was one of}} two which opened that day (Metro Blue Line's opening day). The third entrance (inside the L'Enfant Promenade underground shopping center at L'Enfant Plaza) opened in October 1977. In June 1992, Virginia Railway Express opened the $1.1 million VRE L'Enfant Station on Virginia Avenue SE (<b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> block north of Constitution Center).|$|E
5|$|The tidal {{acceleration}} of the Moon slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the Earth-Moon distance. Friction effects—between the core and mantle and between the atmosphere and surface—can dissipate the Earth's rotational energy. These combined effects are expected to increase {{the length of the}} day by more than 1.5hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the obliquity by <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> degree. The distance to the Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth radii during the same period.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} of Route 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In this portion of the route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of State Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E
5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> a mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense. Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when {{darkness}} would prevent the British from attacking his defenses {{on the south side}} of Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E

5|$|Now {{following}} the Wayne–Macomb county line, M-102 separates Warren from Detroit. The highway also runs parallel to, and <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile (0.8km) north of Outer Drive, the original beltway highway proposed in 1918 to encircle Detroit. The road passes the Mound Road Engine facility, a former Chrysler plant {{next to the}} Mound Road intersection. East of the plant, the highway crosses a branch line of the Conrail Shared Assets Operations {{on the east side}} of the plant complex before intersecting M-53 (Van Dyke Road). Further east, 8Mile Road passes north of the Bel Air Center Shopping Center before crossing another Canadian National Railway line next to the intersection with M-97 (Groesbeck Highway).|$|E
5|$|Past the Bay City Road interchange, US10 {{continues}} {{due east}} through Bay County. It intersects {{the northern end}} of the M-47 freeway. Further east, there are a pair of interchanges for Auburn as the freeway runs through a landscape that is a mix of suburban residential subdivisions and farm fields. The freeway is paralleled to the south by segments of Fisher Road in spots; <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile (0.8km) north is Midland Road. There is one last interchange for Mackinaw Road along the freeway before US10 ends at the cloverleaf interchange with I-75/US23 {{on the west side of}} Bay City. This junction is both the eastern terminus of US10 both in the state of Michigan and nationally.|$|E
5|$|The show is {{a lavish}} event with {{elaborate}} costumed lingerie, varying music by leading entertainers, and set design according to the different themes running within the show. The show attracts hundreds of celebrities and entertainers, with special performers and acts every year. Each year, twenty to forty of the world's top fashion models are selected to perform in the fashion show. In a typical year, this includes <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> dozen women under contract to the company, known as Victoria's Secret Angels, who help publicize the event. The giant angel wings worn by the models, {{as well as other}} wings of various forms and sizes such as butterfly, peacock, or devil wings, have become emblematic of the Victoria's Secret brand.|$|E

5|$|M-54 {{starts at}} exit109 along I-75 and follows Dort Highway northward through {{suburban}} Grand Blanc Township. The {{area near the}} southern end is mostly residential, but north of Reid Road, there is the Grand Blanc Metal Center plant for GM {{to the east of}} the highway. M-54 intersects Hill and Saginaw roads in the unincorporated community of Whigville as the trunkline passes out of the industrial area surrounding the plant. North of the Maple Road intersection, Dort Highway crosses into Burton, and the suburban residential neighborhoods give way to commercial properties along the roadway. There is a rail line owned by CSX Transportation that runs parallel to the highway <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile (0.8km) to the east. North of Atherton Road, M-54 crosses into Flint and runs through the city's east side. The trunkline intersects I-69 near the Amtrak station in the city, and a crossing with a line of the Canadian National Railway. Between Robert T. Longway Boulevard and Davison Road, Dort Highway passes another industrial area. North of Leith Street, the highway turns to the northwest, and the parallel railroad, still part of the CSX line, follows suit.|$|E
5|$|Old Business Spur I-96 (Old BS I-96) is {{the section}} of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the {{intersection}} with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in downtown Detroit and an unsigned state trunkline highway. It was previously a business spur of I-96. Picking up where M-5 ends at the interchange with I-96, Old BS I-96 follows Grand River Avenue southeasterly. The road itself is bounded by businesses as it passes through residential neighborhoods on Detroit's West Side. About a mile and three-quarters (2.8km) along, the highway crosses I-96 again, and I-96 from here into the downtown area parallels Grand River Avenue. Old BS I-96 here is mostly residential. It passes Bishop Park near Grand Boulevard and then crosses I-94. In the North Corktown neighborhood, Grand River Avenue crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MotorCity Casino. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile (0.7km) past M-10, Old BS I-96 crosses I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and enters Downtown Detroit's Foxtown neighborhood. State maintenance ends at the five-way intersection between Grand River Avenue, Cass Avenue, and Middle Street. Grand River Avenue continues another five blocks to Woodward Avenue and another four blocks as it curves in an arc around Grand Circus Park.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} phenomenon {{that took place}} within the lands of Poland in the Early Middle Ages, {{as well as other}} parts of central and eastern Europe, was the arrival and permanent settlement of Slavic peoples. The Slavic migrations in the area of contemporary Poland started {{in the second half of}} the 5th century AD, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> century after these territories were vacated by Germanic tribes. The first waves of the incoming Slavs settled the vicinity of the upper Vistula River and elsewhere in the lands of present southeastern Poland and southern Masovia. Coming from the east, from the upper and middle regions of the Dnieper River, the immigrants would have had come primarily from the western branch of the early Slavs known as Sclaveni, and since their arrival are classified as West Slavs. Their early archeological traces belong to the Prague-Korchak culture, which is similar to the earlier Kiev culture.|$|E

5|$|To stop this, the Spartan {{commander}} ordered {{some of his}} men {{to charge}} the Athenians, but the peltasts fell back, easily outrunning the hoplites, and then, when the Spartans turned {{to return to the}} regiment, the peltasts fell upon them, flinging spears at them as they fled, and inflicted casualties. This process was repeated several times, with similar results. Even when a group of Spartan cavalrymen arrived, the Spartan commander made the curious decision that they should keep pace with the hoplites in pursuit, instead of racing ahead to ride down the fleeing peltasts. Unable to drive off the peltasts, and suffering losses all the while, the Spartans were driven back to a hilltop overlooking Lechaeum. The men in Lechaeum, seeing their predicament, sailed out in small boats to as close as to the hill as they could reach, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile away. The Athenians, meanwhile, began to bring up their hoplites, and the Spartans, seeing these two developments, broke and ran for the boats, pursued by the peltasts all the way. All in all, in the fighting and pursuit, 250 of the 600 men in the regiment were killed.|$|E
5|$|Starting at the {{intersection}} between Van Dyke Avenue and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue), M-53 runs north-northwesterly along Van Dyke {{in the city of}} Detroit. The four-lane roadway passes through residential neighborhoods on the city's east side. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile (0.8km) north of its start, M-53 meets I-94 at the latter's exit218. On {{the opposite side of the}} freeway interchange, Van Dyke Avenue turns due north and continues through a mix of residential and industrial areas near Coleman A. Young International Airport. In this area, the highway crosses branch lines for both the Conrail Shared Assets Operations and the Canadian National Railway. M-53 continues northward through residential areas north of 6Mile Road and crosses from Detroit into Warren at the junction with 8Mile Road; that road also marks the Wayne–Macomb county line. The highway passes through the middle of Center Line, an enclave surrounded by Warren. On the northern edge of Center Line, M-53 meets exit23 along I-696, the Walter Reuther Freeway. North of this interchange, Van Dyke Avenue crosses back into Warren and continues northward. The highway is paralleled by a Conrail line as they both pass through the northern Detroit suburbs. Between 12Mile and 14Mile roads, M-53 passes next to the General Motors Technical Center and through the center of a suburban shopping district. The roadway widens out into a divided highway as it continues northward, crossing into Sterling Heights at 14Mile Road. The highway is bounded by additional commercial and light industrial properties as it intersects Metropolitan Parkway (16Mile Road).|$|E
