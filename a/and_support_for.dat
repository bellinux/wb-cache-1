40|$|BACKGROUND - Parental {{support is}} a key {{influence}} on children's health behaviours; however, no previous investigation has simultaneously explored the influence of mothers' <b>and</b> fathers' social <b>support</b> on eating <b>and</b> physical activity in preschool-aged children. This study evaluated the singular and combined effects of maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable consumption (FV) on preschoolers' PA and FV. METHODS - A random sample comprising 173 parent-child dyads completed validated scales assessing maternal <b>and</b> paternal instrumental <b>support</b> <b>and</b> child PA and FV behaviour. Pearson correlations, controlling for child age, parental age, and parental education, were used to evaluate relationships between maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>and</b> child PA and FV. K-means cluster {{analysis was used to}} identify families with distinct patterns of maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> PA <b>and</b> FV, and one-way ANOVA examined the impact of cluster membership on child PA and FV. RESULTS - Maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> PA were positively associated with child PA (r = 0. 37 and r = 0. 36, respectively; P < 0. 001). Maternal but not paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> FV was positively associated with child FV (r = 0. 35; P < 0. 001). Five clusters characterised groups of families with distinct configurations of maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> PA <b>and</b> FV: 1) above average maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> PA <b>and</b> FV, 2) below average maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> PA <b>and</b> FV, 3) above average maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> PA but below average maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> FV, 4) above average maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> FV but below average maternal <b>and</b> paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> PA, <b>and</b> 5) above average maternal support but below average paternal <b>support</b> <b>for</b> PA <b>and</b> FV.
