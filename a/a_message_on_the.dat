5|$|Massive {{flooding}} in the Midwest {{resulted in the}} Sounds and the Iowa Cubs played a game with an official attendance of zero on June 14, 2008. Though downtown Des Moines was under a mandatory evacuation, team officials received permission from the city {{to play the game}} as long as no fans were allowed into Principal Park. In order to keep fans away, the lights and scoreboard were not turned on, the game was not broadcast in the local market, and <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team's website announced that the game was postponed. PCL Commissioner Branch Rickey III believed that {{this was the first time}} such actions were taken out of necessity.

She attempts to get into her right desk drawer, when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> machine. She mentions the murder to Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that {{it would be difficult to}} miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E

500|$|Groening {{developed}} a lengthy opening sequence {{to cut down}} on the animation necessary for each episode, but devised two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. In the first gag, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the [...] "chalkboard gag". The other gag is known as a [...] "couch gag", in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. The theme, which plays over the sequence, was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a [...] "retro-style" [...] theme. The piece, which took two days to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.|$|E
500|$|After a crazy New Year's Eve, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{realizes that}} {{while under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol, he left <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> answering machine of Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), his high school sweetheart. He and NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) immediately travel to Massachusetts and break into Nancy's home while she is on vacation, hoping to erase the message. While Kenneth fumbles with the computer, Jack examines the house and finds evidence that Nancy's marriage is reaching its end. They eventually play the message, after Jack finds the voicemail code, in which Jack reminisces about their times in high school German class. In that class, [...] Jack had the name [...] "Klaus" [...] and Nancy had the name [...] "Greta"—and Jack says that he took the class to be with her. Jack decides not to erase the message, but Kenneth does so anyway. When they return to New York, Kenneth realizes that Nancy's voicemail code (55287) stands for [...] "Klaus", which means that Nancy does have feelings for Jack.|$|E

500|$|In the lyrics, Farmer [...] "is {{angry with}} men and the song {{is a form of}} feminist anthem". According to Ouest-France, the {{combination}} of an acoustic guitar, electronic beats and synths {{in the second part of}} the song, evoke very strongly what Madonna had produced in previous years, and the ethereal song is typical of Farmer. A rap interlude sung in English launches a few insults sometimes thrown at women, before the final refrain. To Marc Bitton of Public who wrote his article before the single release, [...] "lyrics are both crude and colorful", including [...] "sex and vulgarity", and said that the song was likely to be censored, which was, at his point of view, the real purpose of the singer. According to the psychologist Hugues Royer, the song is [...] "an artistic utopia" [...] and a call to feminists, including the novelist Catherine Breillat, but is not a [...] "political project". Novak said that lyrics surprised many fans, as although Farmer has always been a feminist, she had never expressed so direct <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject.|$|E
500|$|After a game, {{a player}} is awarded or penalized skill points based on {{performance}} {{relative to the}} computer's skill level, though some games do not calculate points during multiplayer sessions. The game keeps track of these points by charting them on a graph, as well as increasing {{the size of the}} crowd in Tennis and Boxing single-player modes. After obtaining 1000 skill points in a sport, a player is awarded [...] "pro" [...] level, along with a cosmetic feature for their Mii in Bowling and Boxing. A Mii newly turned pro will receive <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wii Message Board notifying them. Wii Sports also features a fitness test that calculates a player's fitness age (ranging from 20 to 80 years old, 20 being the best possible). The test gauges the player's performance in three randomly chosen challenges in each test from the training mode that have been played at least once, and can only be taken once a day per Mii. Calculating the fitness age takes into account a player's balance, speed, and stamina. Fitness age results are graphed over one, two, or three months, with daily results posted on the Wii Message Board.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature the series' full title sequence. Creator Matt Groening {{developed}} the lengthy sequence in order {{to cut down on the}} animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. In the first gag, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the [...] "chalkboard gag". The other gag is known as a [...] "couch gag", in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed. The episode also introduced the characters Martin Prince and his parents, Richard, Bart's teacher Edna Krabappel and Dr. J Loren Pryor.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} {{sequence}} of many Simpsons episodes, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart {{can be seen}} writing <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, {{has become known as}} the [...] "chalkboard gag". Chalkboard messages may involve political humor such as [...] "The First Amendment does not cover burping", pop culture references such as [...] "I can't see dead people", and meta-references such as [...] "I am not a 32 year old woman" [...] and [...] "Nobody reads these anymore". The animators are able to produce the chalkboard gags quickly and in some cases have changed them to fit current events. For example, the chalkboard gag for [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] (season four, 1992) read, [...] "I will not defame New Orleans." [...] The gag had been written as an apology to the city for a controversial song in the previous week's episode, [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge", which called the city a [...] "home of pirates, drunks and whores". Many episodes do not feature a chalkboard gag because a shorter opening title sequence, where the chalkboard gags are cut, is used to make more room for story and plot development.|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 2008, Radar Online {{reported}} that the Church of Scientology asked the U.S. Attorney General's office in Los Angeles, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department to start a criminal investigation of possible criminal activity related to the DDoS attacks. An unnamed source told Radar that the Church of Scientology argued to law enforcement that the Internet attacks are a form of [...] "illegal interference with business."

500|$|The band members' {{main goal}} was to reinvent the group's sound from scratch, {{creating}} what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band," [...] which focuses more on pop. Sessions were not without difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material. Walker had doubts about the band's volatility, feeling the record would not get made following [...] "meltdown after meltdown." [...] The entire album was recorded in secrecy from the music industry, critics, and fans of the band. While specifically denying that the group's announcement was a reunion because [...] " [...] never broke up", the band announced a reunion tour and details of Save Rock and Roll on February 4, 2013. The quartet's announcement included {{a photo of the}} group that had been taken earlier that morning of the band members huddled around a bonfire tossing copies of their back catalog into flames at the original location of Comiskey Park, the location of 1979's Disco Demolition Night, a baseball promotional event which involved destroying disco records. <b>A</b> <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> group's website read [...] "when we were kids the only thing that got us through most days was music.

The future of Fall Out Boy starts now. Save rock and roll..." [...] Save Rock and Roll debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 154,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The arrival of Save Rock and Roll posted the quartet's third-biggest sales week, and earned the group's second career number one on the chart. The band's chart success was best described as unexpected by music journalists.
