5|$|I {{set to work}} to slap him as hard <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> After a moment, my father's eyelids moved {{slightly}} over his glazed eyes. He was breathing weakly.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|Through a {{fortunate}} {{combination of}} circumstances I escaped from prison before my trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner I felt that I was ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, {{with them}} to get as exact a History <b>as</b> {{possibly}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn of their places of Generation or finding, and to enquire after as many circumstances that tended to the Illustrating of this Enquiry, <b>as</b> possibly <b>I</b> <b>could</b> observe.|$|R
6000|$|It was Sammy Jay's turn to grin, [...] "Just <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{tell you}} any news, Reddy Fox! Just <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell you any news!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Why, {{everybody}} knows that you are so smart that you find out everything {{as soon as it}} happens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we don't make {{it better}} by fancying it nothing," [...] said Rachel. [...] "Let us try to meet it like your uncle. Oh, Alick, it seemed all this time <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pray again, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> since those sad times. He seemed so sure, such a rock to help and lean on." ...|$|R
25|$|When Dr Johnson and I were by {{ourselves}} at night, I observed of our host, aspectum generosum habet. Et generosum animum, he added. For {{fear of being}} overheard in the small Highland houses, I often talked to him in such Latin <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak, and with {{as much of the}} English accent <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> assume, {{so as not to be}} understood, in case our conversation should be too loud for the space.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew how}} to teach, but I wanted access to current {{information}}, and as much information <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get my hands on, {{in order to be}} able to better help my students.|$|E
25|$|I {{have given}} such {{descriptions}} of engines for wheel carriages <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do in the}} time and space I could allow myself; {{but it is very}} defective and can only serve to keep other people from similar patents.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} look <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be, but in her case would not.|$|R
60|$|I obeyed, {{rendering}} {{all that}} she had said into the Zulu idiom <b>as</b> best <b>I</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} his questions <b>as</b> best <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> {{trying to make}} out a good case for them.|$|R
25|$|It was as hard-hitting a {{memorandum}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make it. Butler {{accused me of}} overstating the lack of resolve in both Washington and London. But my argument over {{the need to get}} a concealment-based inspection on track did resonate with him. He authorized me to put together an updated inspection plan to take place following his August visit to Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was my}} task to survive this crisis, as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E
25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E
60|$|Phil pointed {{over his}} left shoulder. I peered through the gloom <b>as</b> best <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but could see nothing.|$|R
60|$|The {{world was}} itself again, and I was {{listening}} quietly {{and with a}} mild interest which, try <b>as</b> <b>I</b> would, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not make any stronger. I had exhausted my emotion on the essential fact: the details were an anticlimax.|$|R
60|$|She {{compressed}} {{her lips}} with an angry glance at me <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help her wrinkles, then she sighed.|$|R
500|$|... "I scooped {{it out of}} {{the sink}} and threw it into the bin. I was so lucky I didn't put my fingers into my mouth, or scratch my eye <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have got this poison inside me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of Oasis, Gallagher did not use pedals: [...] "I used to just turn up the amps as full <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get them". Since then, he has begun using a large number of effects, but singled out the Ibanez Tube Screamer.|$|E
500|$|Hughes {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} {{in less than}} a week. Filming began in September 1985 and finished in November 1985. Featuring many landmarks, including the Sears Tower and the Art Institute of Chicago, the film was Hughes' love letter to Chicago: [...] "I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Not just in the architecture and landscape, but the spirit." ...|$|E
60|$|This was true, for I found that, strive <b>as</b> <b>I</b> would, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not move}} a limb {{or even an}} eyelid. I was frozen to that spot {{and there was nothing}} for it except to curse my folly and say my prayers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} would assist me rather. He would help me, perhaps, to find some place where I might still earn my bread by such skill <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possess;--where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do so without {{dragging}} in aught of my domestic life, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{have been forced to}} do here." ...|$|R
60|$|HONOURED MADAM,--Your kind letter welcomed me, yesternight, to Ayrshire. I am, indeed, seriously {{angry with}} you at the quantum of your luckpenny; but, vexed and hurt <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help {{laughing}} very heartily at the noble lord's apology for the missed napkin.|$|R
500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, we were expecting {{to be able to}} gain our objectives... without making any concessions though, only 'if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.' I very much doubted that this was the case." ...|$|E
500|$|For the film, Hughes got {{the chance}} to take a more {{expansive}} look at the city he grew up in. [...] "We took a helicopter up the Chicago River. This is the first chance I'd really had to get outside while making a movie. Up to this point, the pictures had been pretty small. I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> not just the architecture and the landscape, but the spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know—only <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> talk {{straight}} off without arranging—like birds, {{without knowing what}} note is coming next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O gin <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see a {{mountain}} top again, <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> lay {{me down and}} die content. What garred ye come daundering to these weary flats of France?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, your slave,' {{replied the}} Princess. 'Why, he blushes. Were he not deaf as well <b>as</b> dumb, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost believe he {{understood}} me.' ...|$|R
500|$|Kinsler signed quickly, {{and broke}} in as a shortstop in 2003. He batted [...]277 in 188 at-bats in his pro debut for the Spokane Indians in the Short-season Northwest League, while leading {{the team in}} steals (11) and triples (6). He then spent the 2003–04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' {{strength}} and conditioning coaches. He said: [...] "I was probably 170 pounds, and I decided I needed to lift, put on some weight, and eat as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> And I learned how to hit." ...|$|E
500|$|... "get {{it out of}} here, get it {{away from}} the guys and myself. And I reached over, leaned over to the right, grabbed it with my hand, and I threw it as hard <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> what I thought was at the time. And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|E
500|$|Dave Gibbons {{became an}} adviser on Snyder's film, but Moore {{has refused to}} have his name {{attached}} to any film adaptations of his work. Moore has stated he {{has no interest in}} seeing Snyder's adaptation; he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008 that [...] "here are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can't". While Moore believes that David Hayter's screenplay was [...] "as close <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> imagine anyone getting to Watchmen", he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made.|$|E
60|$|Try <b>as</b> <b>I</b> might, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get no {{more than}} that out of our stupid young housemaid.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know. I {{like people}} to be so kind, that <b>I</b> can't feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> would pay them off, but <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do nothing but love them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, that am <b>I.</b> <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> eat {{a buffalo}} alive. Why, it's my 'pinion we've tasted nothin' since daybreak this mornin'." ...|$|R
