Previously located at Browning Barracks near Aldershot, the museum opened at Duxford on 8 December 2008. The opening ceremony was led by Prince Charles, the Parachute Regiment's Colonel-in-Chief. The museum chronicles the history of British airborne forces from the Second World War to current operations in Afghanistan and cost £3 million.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{were transported}} to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for {{security}} reasons. However, {{the troops were}} not briefed on the operation until {{a few hours before}} it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man gliders that would deliver the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> were complete.|$|E
5|$|Operation Rösselsprung was a coup de main operation, {{involving}} {{direct action}} {{by a combined}} parachute and glider-borne assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and a planned subsequent link-up with ground forces of the XV Mountain Corps converging on Drvar. The <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> was preceded by heavy bombing of the town by the Luftwaffe. The ground forces included Home Guard forces of the Independent State of Croatia. Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of}} the <b>airborne</b> <b>assault.</b> The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location and the lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans {{to protect the}} installation from a seaborne raid, {{it was believed that}} a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar set. It was therefore decided that an <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E
5|$|Imperial War Museum Duxford is {{a branch}} of the Imperial War Museum near Duxford in Cambridgeshire, England. Britain's largest {{aviation}} museum, Duxford houses the museum's large exhibits, including nearly 200 aircraft, military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibition buildings. The site also provides storage space for the museum's other collections of material such as film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates several British Army regimental museums, including those of the Parachute Regiment (named <b>Airborne</b> <b>Assault)</b> and the Royal Anglian Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Operation Biting, {{also known}} as the Bruneval Raid, was the codename for a raid by Combined Operations in 1942. Their {{objective}} was a German Würzburg radar installation at Bruneval in France. Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the array, it was thought a commando raid from the sea would incur heavy losses, and give the garrison sufficient time for the radar equipment to be destroyed. It was therefore decided that an <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> followed by sea-borne evacuation would be the ideal way to surprise the garrison and seize the technology intact.|$|E

5|$|Operation Market Garden was an <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> {{by three}} {{divisions}} in the Netherlands in September 1944, including the British 1st and the American 82nd and 101st, to secure key bridges and towns along the expected Allied axis of advance. Farthest north, 1st Airborne, supported by the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade, landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn. Initially expecting an easy advance, XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, to reach the airborne force at Arnhem within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|Operation Overlord was the codename for the Battle of Normandy, the Allied {{operation}} that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II. The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune, {{commonly known as}} D-Day). A 1,200-plane <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> preceded an amphibious assault involving more than 5,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June, and {{more than two million}} Allied troops were in France by the end of August.|$|E
5|$|The Z-3 {{was to be}} a {{reconnaissance}} {{version and}} would have had additional fuel tanks, increasing its range to 6,000km (3,730mi). Production was due to take place in 1944, just as bomber production was being abandoned. The long-range variants failed to come to fruition. The He 111Z was to have been used in an invasion of Malta in 1942 and as part of an <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> on the Soviet cities of Astrakhan and Baku in the Caucasus in the same year. During the Battle of Stalingrad their use was cancelled due to insufficient airfield capacity. Later in 1943, He111Zs helped evacuate German equipment and personnel from the Caucasus region, and during the Allied invasion of Sicily, attempted to deliver reinforcements to the island.|$|E

5|$|After {{advancing}} to the Seine, the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn to England in September 1944, but briefly served in the Ardennes in December during the Battle of the Bulge. Hill then commanded 3rd Parachute Brigade during Operation Varsity, the Allied <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> over the River Rhine, where he was nearly killed by a glider containing his own personal Jeep. He then commandeered a motorcycle and rode alongside the brigade as the 6th Airborne Division advanced from the Rhine to the River Elbe, {{at the end of}} which he was awarded a second Bar to his DSO as well as the American Silver Star. After the war, he was briefly military governor of Copenhagen, for which he was awarded the King Haakon VII Liberty Cross, and also raised and commanded the 4th Parachute Brigade (Territorial Army). Retiring from the British Army in 1949, he became involved in a number of charities and businesses. He died on 16 March 2006, aged 95.|$|E
5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation.

The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} <b>airborne</b> <b>assault.</b> The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar.

5|$|During the Normandy {{landings}} of 6 June 1944, {{the brigade}} {{took part in}} Operation Mallard, holding the southern flank of the Normandy bridgehead over the River Orne. In August 1944, during {{the final stages of}} the Battle of Normandy, {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Airborne Division, the brigade took part in the advance to the River Seine. Withdrawn to England in September, the brigade, with the rest of the division, returned to mainland Europe in December to counter the German Army's surprise offensive in the Ardennes, better known as the Battle of the Bulge. Their final airborne mission of the war was Operation Varsity in March 1945, an <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> crossing of the Rhine, after which they advanced through Germany, reaching the Baltic Sea at Wismar by the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{before the}} Axis {{surrender}} in April 1943, the 1st Airborne Division, now commanded by Major-General George F. Hopkinson, arrived in North Africa, and the 1st Parachute Brigade once again came under their command for further operations in Sicily. The invasion of Sicily {{was to be}} carried out by General Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army landing in the east and Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Seventh Army coming ashore in the west. These seaborne landings were to be supported by airborne assaults whereby the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division would support the Americans and the 1st Airborne Division the British. The British <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> was divided into brigade-sized operations: Operation Ladbroke by the 1st Airlanding Brigade took place on the night of 9/10 July, and Operation Fustian by the 1st Parachute Brigade on the night of 13/14 July. A third operation to drop 2nd Parachute Brigade beside Augusta on the night of 10/11 July (Operation Glutton) was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June, Iraqi {{government}} forces launched an <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> on Tikrit {{with three or}} four commando helicopters flown into a stadium at the University of Tikrit. One of the helicopters was shot down and crash-landed at the stadium, while another had to conduct an emergency landing after suffering a mechanical failure. The crew of the second helicopter, which included a Lebanese pilot, was then captured by insurgents. Fierce fighting then ensued around the university compound, while army snipers positioned themselves on tall buildings in the university complex. In {{the early hours of the}} assault, a helicopter gunship struck the city's hospital compound. By the next day, sporadic clashes continued at the university as Iranian-trained Shiite militiamen were dispatched and managed to seize control of tall buildings in the university area.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no clear}} {{solution}} to combating Britain from the air. Göring {{had not given}} up hope of winning a victory by <b>airborne</b> <b>assault.</b> He discussed the possibility of invading Ireland (Fall Grün, or Operation Green) with Kurt Student in January 1941, in order to surround Britain by land, sea and air. The operation was shelved. Instead, the Luftwaffe, {{with varying degrees of}} success, carried out the strategic bombardment of British industrial cities. The lack of RAF night defences in this stage of the war enabled the German bombers to inflict extensive damage without suffering the heavy losses of the daylight campaign. It is estimated that the Luftwaffe lost around 500 aircrews during the Blitz in comparison to the Battle of Britain in which it lost around 2,800 killed, 340 wounded, 750 captured. Overall losses were cut by one-third of daylight operations.|$|E

5|$|By {{this period}} of the conflict, the number of German {{divisions}} remaining on the Western Front was rapidly declining, both in numbers and quality, a fact in the Allies' favour. By the night of 23 March, Montgomery had the equivalent of more than 30 divisions under his command, while the Germans fielded around 10 divisions, all weakened from constant fighting. The best German formation the Allied airborne troops would face was the 1st Parachute Army, although even this formation had been weakened from the losses it had sustained in earlier fighting, particularly when it had engaged Allied forces in the Reichswald Forest in February. First Parachute Army had three corps stationed along the river; 2nd Parachute Corps to the north, 86th Corps in the centre, and 63rd Corps in the south. Of these formations, 2nd Parachute Corps and 86th Corps had a shared boundary that ran through the proposed landing zones for the Allied airborne divisions, meaning that the leading formation of each corps — these being 7thParachute Division and 84thInfantry Division — would face the <b>airborne</b> <b>assault.</b> After their retreat to the Rhine both divisions were under-strength and did not number more than 4,000 men each, with 84thInfantry Division supported by only 50 or so medium artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Following the German <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> on 20 May, the 2/7th became heavily engaged {{fighting}} German parachute troops around Canea. It then {{undertook a}} local counter-attack at 42nd Street {{during which the}} 2/7th launched a ferocious bayonet charge {{in concert with the}} New Zealand Maori Battalion that resulted in heavy German casualties. The 2/7th later covered the withdrawal to Sphakia where the Royal Navy attempted to evacuate the garrison by the sea, undertaking a three-day stand in the hills, before they were ordered down to the evacuation beaches. As Allied naval losses mounted the operation was called off before the 2/7th could embark. As a result, most of the battalion – over 400 personnel – was taken prisoner. Several 2/7th soldiers later escaped captivity; one of them, John Peck, became part of a Special Operations Executive team responsible for helping Allied prisoners of war escape. The battalion's commanding officer, Walker, was one of those captured, giving up his position on one of the last evacuation ships when it became apparent {{that the rest of the}} battalion would not have time to get clear. Walker remained in captivity until the end of the war, along with many others of the battalion who went to prisoner of war camps in Greece, Germany, Austria and Poland.|$|E
5|$|Having {{received}} {{permission to}} conduct the raid, Mountbatten and his staff studied the Bruneval installation and its defences, rapidly coming {{to the conclusion that}} due to the extensive coastal defences in the area around the installation it was too well-guarded to permit a seaborne commando raid. They considered that such a raid would result in high casualties among the attacking troops and would not be fast enough to capture the Würzburg radar before it was destroyed by the Germans. Believing that surprise and speed were to be the essential requirements of any raid against the installation to ensure the radar was captured, Mountbatten saw an <b>airborne</b> <b>assault</b> as the only viable method. On 8 January 1942, he therefore contacted the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division and 38 Wing RAF, asking if they were able {{to conduct the}} raid. The division's commander, Major-General Frederick Browning, was particularly enthusiastic, as a successful operation would be an excellent morale boost to the airborne troops under his command, as well as a good demonstration of their value.|$|E
