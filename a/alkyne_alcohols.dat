40|$|Dinuclear gold {{complexes}} {{and their}} use in catalysis have received significant recent attention, but there are few critical comparisons of mono- versus dual gold-catalysed pathways. Herein we study the hydroalkoxylation and hydrophenoxylation of alkynes using density functional theory calculations, and compare two possible mechanisms that have been proposed previously {{on the basis of}} theoretical and experimental studies, which unravel different preferences because of both the nature of the <b>alkyne</b> and <b>alcohol,</b> as well as the non-innocent role of the counter-anion of the dual gold based catalyst. Entropy is found to have a significant effect, rendering the nucleophilic attack of the monoaurated intermediate [Au(L) (η 2 -alkyne) ]+ difficult both kinetically and thermodynamically; this mechanism cannot easily form only the trans-alkene product that is observed experimentally. Instead, reaction via a dual gold catalysed mechanism presents much lower barriers. In addition, for the sake of direct comparison with recent results by Belanzoni, Zuccaccia, oversimplification of the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand in the calculations might decrease the enthalpy barrier and lead to results that are not directly applicable to experiment.

The goal of improving the efficiency of existing methodologies can be fulfilled by use of metal catalysts.

Chapter 1 summarises the properties of gold and ligand-supported gold(I) complexes and demonstrates how a detailed understanding of its reactivity and possible bonding interactions with various substrates facilitates the {{development of}} well-defined catalytic systems. Particular attention is given to N-heterocyclic carbenes, highly tunable ligands that stabilise a wide range of different transition metal complexes. Three chapters describe syntheses and studies of known and new complexes. Chapter 2 discusses expedient syntheses of key NHC-gold(I) complexes and catalysts. Chapter 3 constitutes studies to the behaviour of the commonly used tetrafluoroborate counterion in a particular IPrCl -gold(I) complex.

40|$|A bondingness term {{is further}} {{developed}} {{to aid in}} heat of formation (ΔfHº) calculations for C, N, O and S containing molecules. Bondingness originated from qualitative investigations into the antibonding effect in the occupied MOs of ethane. Previous work used a single parameter for bondingness to calculate ΔfHº in an alkane homologous series using an additivity scheme. This work modifies the bondingness algorithm and uses the term to parameterise a test group of 345 molecules consisting of 17 subgroups that include alkanes, alkenes, <b>alkynes,</b> <b>alcohols,</b> ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amines, amides, diazenes, nitriles, nitroalkanes, nitrates, thiols and benzenoids. Comparing experimental with calculated ΔfHº values, a standard deviation for the residuals of 6. 3 kJ mol 1 can be achieved using bondingness with a simple steric repulsion term (SSR) in a bond additivity scheme, and {{a standard deviation of}} 5. 2 kJ mol 1 can be achieved using a Lennard-Jones potential. The method is compared with the group method of Pedley, which for a slightly smaller set of 338 molecules, a subset of the test set of 345 molecules, gives a standard deviation of 7. 0 kJ mol 1. Bondingness, along with SSR or a Lennard-Jones potential, is parameterised in the lowest level of ab initio (HF-SCF) or semiempirical quantum chemical calculations. It therefore may be useful in determining the ΔfHº values for the largest molecules that are amenable to quantum chemical calculation. As part of our analysis we calculated the difference between the lowest energy conformer and the average energy of a mixture populated with higher energy conformers. This is the difference between the experimental ΔfHº value and the ΔfHº calculated for a single conformer.

40|$|Medicinal {{chemistry}} is {{the application of}} chemical research techniques to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. During this PhD project, we tried to synthesize small molecules based on terminal <b>alkyne</b> and propargyl <b>alcohols.</b> These molecules were prepared by departing from a simple aldehyde and by doing reactions like Bestmann-Ohira in order to prepare terminal alkynes or reaction with ethynylmagnesium bromide to prepare propargyl alcoholsB. These prepared small molecules were then subjected into the 1, 3 -dipolar Huisgen cycloaddition reaction {{in the presence of}} organic azides in order to prepare small triazolic derivatives. Cytotoxicity property of these small triazoles was then tested against B 16 melanoma cell lines. Primary results showed some activities for some of our synthesized molecules that need more study like adding functionalities on the structure to improve their activities. In the last part of this dissertation, a methodology study on the synthesis of propargyl ethers from their corresponding propargyl esters under microwave irradiations has been described. To {{the best of our knowledge}} preparation of propargyl ethers from propargyl esters or nucleophilic substitution of propargyl esters in order to find propargyl ethers has been reported in the literature only by use of catalysts such as Lewis acids or metal complexes. The advantage of our method was the absence of such catalysts and the time of the reaction which was less than 1 h in comparison with the reported synthesis. Synthesis of such molecules can also be interesting in the synthesis of natural products. La chimie médicinale est l’application des techniques de recherche en chimie pour synthétiser les molécules pharmaceutiques. Au cours des premiers stades de développements de chimie médicinale, les scientistes ont été principalement concernés par l’isolement des agents médicinaux présents dans les plantes, mais aujourd’hui, ils sont également impliqués dans la création et la synthèse de nouveaux composés pharmaceutiques, parfois basées sur des mécanismes récemment découverts...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years {{ruthenium}} tetroxide is increasingly being used in organic synthesis. Thanks to the fine tuning of the reaction conditions, including pH control of the medium {{and the use of}} a wider range of co-oxidants, this species {{has proven to be a}} reagent able to catalyse useful synthetic transformations which are either a valuable alternative to established methods or even, in some cases, the method of choice. Protocols for oxidation of hydrocarbons, oxidative cleavage of C-C double bonds, even stopping the process at the aldehyde stage, oxidative cleavage of terminal and internal <b>alkynes,</b> oxidation of <b>alcohols</b> to carboxylic acids, dihydroxylation of alkenes, oxidative degradation of phenyl and other heteroaromatic nuclei, oxidative cyclization of dienes, have now reached a good level of improvement and are more and more included into complex synthetic sequences. The perruthenate ion is a ruthenium (VII) oxo-species. Since its introduction in the mid-eighties, tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) has reached a great popularity among organic chemists and it is mostly employed in catalytic amounts in conjunction with N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) for the mild oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds. Its use in the oxidation of other functionalities is known and recently, its utility in new synthetic transformations has been demonstrated. New processes, synthetic applications, theoretical studies and unusual transformations, published in the last eight years (2006 - 2013), in the chemistry of these two oxo-species, will be covered in this review with the aim of offering a clear picture of their reactivity. When appropriate, related oxidative transformations mediated by other metal oxo-species will be presented to highlight similarities and differences. An historical overview of some aspects of the ruthenium tetroxide chemistry will be presented as well...|$|R
