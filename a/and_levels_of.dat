Beginning with Denmark, Booth explains the Danish concept of hygge ("cosy times"), which he sees as conformism.

Moving to Iceland, Booth details the banking practices that led to the collapse of the country's largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the popular belief among Icelanders in the existence of Huldufólk (elves).|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was intended to formulate the model of poor familiy Empowerement by determining both the <b>level</b> <b>and</b> the influencing factors <b>of</b> social responsibility <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> empowerment. Survey <b>and</b> interview techniques were implemented among 276 selected samples, started Nopember 2006 until April 2007. Data was analyzed by using both correlation and path analysis. The results indicated that a number of respondent had a high social responsibility <b>and</b> medium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> empowerment. The increase <b>of</b> social responsibility <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> empowerment were influenced by implementation of good government of local organization, income, and formal education.

5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
5|$|Stace {{was praised}} for his clarity and ambitious aims in Time and Eternity by Abraham Kaplan who {{believed}} {{the book was}} one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> being in the manner of Samuel Alexander. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.|$|E
5|$|Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which Project M modifies, is a {{fighting}} game with an unconventional battle system. Players battle in arenas of varying sizes <b>and</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> complexity, controlling characters {{with a variety}} of play styles. They can attack one another with their own repertoires of special moves, or with a basic attack. Attacks can be avoided by jumping or using a short-lived shield move. Unlike most fighting games, Brawl does not include standard health gauges, but a percentage counter; there is no point at which a character is automatically knocked out from the counter getting too high, but they will be knocked farther with increasing damage. Being knocked off the screen—or falling off oneself—causes a knock-out. Players may use items for offensive purposes, such as guns and swords, or for healing purposes, such as food and heart containers. The stages, characters, and items are drawn from Nintendo's video game franchises such as Mario, Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, along with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series and Konami's Metal Gear series. The victor of a match has no standard determining factor. Rather, depending on the settings, victory may be reached, for example, by being the last player alive using a stock system, or by achieving the most KOs after a set amount of time.|$|E
