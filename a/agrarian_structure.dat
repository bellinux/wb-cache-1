PETTCR includes a proactive regularization of water rights based on water availability.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, the cooperatives {{had very}} mixed success; {{and the majority}} were converted into individual private holdings during the 1980s. The conversions were authorized in 1980 by changes in the basic land reform legislation and were put into effect after majority votes of the cooperative members in each case. The preferences {{of the people involved}} at that point clearly went contrary to the intent of the original reform. But the whole set of changes was not a reversion to the pre-reform <b>agrarian</b> <b>structure.</b> In fact, the conversions left Peru with a far less unequal pattern of landownership than it had prior to the reform and with a much greater role for family farming than ever before in its history.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{reproduction}} {{of the information that}} is {{as close as possible to}} reality, we have established a procedure for analyzing images based on visual interpretation and digital processing. In digital processing, supervised classification by maximum likelihood, based on a fieldwork allowed to discriminate elements of land. Recovery of geometric shapes by scanning fallow and bare soil from panchromatic Spot image yielded the map of <b>agrarian</b> <b>structures.</b> Different queries and statistical operations performed were used to assess the areas of <b>agrarian</b> <b>structures.</b> The analysis of the dynamics of <b>agrarian</b> <b>structures</b> showed that the period 1986 - 2000 was marked by environmental degradation, while the period 2000 - 2004 has seen a regeneration of the natural environment. Treatments applied to images and ensuing results indicate the feasibility of monitoring by remote sensing of agricultural structures in northeastern area of Côte d'Ivoire.

25|$|The PSI entered {{government}} in 1963. During {{the first year}} of the new Centre-Left Government, a wide range of measures were carried out which went some way towards the Socialist Party's requirements for governing in coalition with the Christian Democrats. These included taxation of real estate profits and of share dividends (designed to curb speculation), increases in pensions for various categories of workers, a law on school organisation (to provide for a unified secondary school with compulsory attendance up to the age of 14), the nationalisation of the electric-power industry, and significant wage rises for workers (including those in the newly nationalised electric-power industry), which led to a rise in consumer demand. Urged on by the PSI, the government also made brave attempts to tackle issues relating to welfare services, hospitals, the <b>agrarian</b> <b>structure,</b> urban development, education, and overall planning. For instance, during the Centre-Left Government's time in office, social security was extended to previously uncovered categories of the population. In addition, entrance to university by examination was abolished in 1965. Despite these important reforms, however, the reformist drive was soon lost, and the most important problems (including the mafia, social inequalities, inefficient state/social services, North/South imbalance) remained largely untackled.|$|E

Comparison with surplus labour economies of Asia highlights the constraints posed by the prevailing <b>agrarian</b> <b>structures</b> for capital accumulation and industrialization in post colonial sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is to analyse and compare <b>agrarian</b> <b>structures</b> in several EU countries, {{analysed}} separately according to their degree of economic consolidation. The study points out that, in order to characterize the <b>agrarian</b> <b>structures</b> of a country, is not sufficient to determine the average size of farms. Such averages are the result of different distributions of farmland according to size categories, which are valuable sources of analysis in terms of the impact of agricultural structures on the modernization of production processes as well as for achieving substantial economic performance. An important objective of the paper is to evaluate the numerical influence of farm size on the economic results, using regression and correlation methods. The study reveals that size is a necessary condition for the achievement of economic performance, but it is not sufficient. A causalities comparison between countries with a consolidated economic situation and the ones economically precarious confirm this fact, concluding also that, in addition to size, farms must provide a substantial capitalization as well as modern technical equipment. The paper underlines also the fact that the precarious capitalization of farms, along with feudal <b>agrarian</b> <b>structures,</b> causes paradoxal situations, the economic effect being found in an inverse relationship to size...|$|R
