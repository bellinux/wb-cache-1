40|$|An {{adaptive}} control algorithm for the spacecraft attitude tracking {{problem for the}} case when the spin <b>axis</b> <b>directions</b> of the flywheel actuators are uncertain is developed. The spacecraft equations of motion in this case are fully nonlinear and can be represented as a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) system. Adaptive tracking control is therefore challenging for this problem. In this paper the second-order equation of motion of the spacecraft plus the actuators is initially converted to a first-order state space form, and subsequently an {{adaptive control}}ler is designed based on Lyapunov stability theory. A smooth projection algorithm is then applied to keep the parameter estimates inside a singularity-free region. The controller successfully deals with unknown misalignments of the <b>axis</b> <b>directions</b> of the flywheel actuators. It is noted that the proposed design procedure can also be easily applied to more general MIMO dynamical systems. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{dragging}} of the <b>axis</b> <b>directions</b> of local inertial frames by a weighted average of the energy currents in the universe is exact for all linear perturbations of any Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with K = (+ 1, - 1, 0) and of Einstein's static closed universe. This includes FRW universes which are arbitrarily close to the Milne Universe, which is empty, and to the de Sitter universe. Hence the postulate formulated by E. Mach about the physical cause for the time-evolution of the <b>axis</b> <b>directions</b> of inertial frames is shown to hold in cosmological General Relativity for linear perturbations. The time-evolution of <b>axis</b> <b>directions</b> of local inertial frames (relative to given local fiducial axes) is given experimentally by the precession angular velocity of gyroscopes, {{which in turn is}} given by the operational definition of the gravitomagnetic field. The gravitomagnetic field is caused by cosmological energy currents via the momentum constraint. This equation for cosmological gravitomagnetism is analogous to Ampere's law, but it holds also for time-dependent situtations. In the solution for an open universe the 1 /r^ 2 -force of Ampere is replaced by a Yukawa force which is of identical form for FRW backgrounds with $K = (- 1, 0). $ The scale of the exponential cutoff is the H-dot radius, where H is the Hubble rate, and dot is the derivative with respect to cosmic time. Analogous results hold for energy currents in a closed FRW universe, K = + 1, and in Einstein's closed static universe. Comment: 23 pages, no figures. Final published version.

The recovery algorithm of star energy distributing for star sensor {{is presented in the}} paper. The quaternion of next frame is calculated with the previous continuous quaternion. All the ideal star coordinates of star image in the FOV is calculated with the quaternion of next frame. Then the angle between the two previous continuous <b>axis</b> <b>directions</b> is calculated with the previous continuous <b>axis</b> <b>directions</b> calculated with the previous continuous quaternion. The radius of threshold scan window of star image is calculated according to the angle. Finally, within the star image radius of the threshold scan window, shift the original star image to make the shifted star energy distribution continuous. So the star image distribution subjects to 2 -D Gaussian distribution, and the star coordinates is obtain with centroiding algorithm.

High-resolution anisotropy-aware P wave receiver function analysis and multiple-layer core-refracted SKS waveform modeling favor {{more than one}} layer of anisotropy beneath all sites.
