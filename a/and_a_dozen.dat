5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{the entire}} Austrian force, {{including}} Klenau's column, withdrew into Ulm {{and its environs}} and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, {{as he had been}} at Mantua, Klenau was caught in a siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry. Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until exchanged, an agreement to which they held.|$|E
5|$|Captain Ichiro Ono assumed command on 15 November 1934 and Ryūjō {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Hideho Wada's First Carrier Division. The following month {{the ship was}} chosen to evaluate dive-bombing tactics using six Nakajima E4N2-C Type 90 reconnaissance aircraft, six Yokosuka B3Y1 Type 92 torpedo bombers, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> A2N1 Type 90 fighters. The reconnaissance aircraft proved to be unsuitable after several months' testing. Ryūjō participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 where she {{was attached to the}} IJN Fourth Fleet. The fleet was caught in a typhoon on 25 September and the ship was moderately damaged. Ryūjō arrived at Kure on 11 October 1935 for repairs, modifications, and a refit that lasted until 31 May 1936. On 31 October Ono was relieved by Captain Shun'ichi Kira.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, at {{the urging}} of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{traveled}} with their husbands <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E

On seeing her dedication and commitment in helping the poor and sick, Ursula bought her a 0.6-hectare piece of land at Jalan Payoh Lai in 1965, so that Hsu could open the first home for the aged sick in Singapore. The two sisters ran the Home for the Aged Sick for five years.

5|$|No. 3 Aircraft Depot (No.3AD) {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, on 16March 1942. It {{came under the}} control of No.5 (Maintenance) Group. The depot's first, temporary, {{commanding}} officer was Squadron Leader W.H. Nicholson. On establishment, No.3AD's main purpose was the assembly and despatch of combat aircraft manufactured in the United States. In its first six weeks of operation, it assembled 123 Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The depot was also responsible for the inspection of RAAF CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons. A further role was salvaging damaged aircraft from units in the local area, and despatching them to No.5 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Wagga, New South Wales, for repair.|$|E
5|$|The Allied force {{successfully}} {{reached the}} Solomon Islands without being detected by the Japanese because of thick fog and haze. Saratoga launched 24 Dauntlesses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> Wildcats early on 7 August to attack targets on Guadalcanal. Her air group commander, Commander Harry D. Felt, coordinated the attack over the island, which also included eight Wildcats from Enterprises VF-6. The aircraft {{focused on the}} nearly complete airfield at Lunga and dispersed the two construction battalions building it. This allowed the 1st Marine Division to capture it (renaming it Henderson Field) without resistance. For {{the rest of the}} day, the carriers provided a combat air patrol (CAP) over the transports and themselves while their other aircraft provided air support for the Marines as needed.|$|E

5|$|The Specialized Training Program was {{dissolved}} in early 1944, as {{the progress of}} the war tipped in favor of the Allies; many of the CCNY classmates were transferred to the infantry, while Koval <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> others were selected for the Special Engineer Detachment. The Detachment was part of the covert project to design, engineer, and fabricate an atomic bomb—an American, Canadian and British initiative known as the Manhattan Project. Koval was assigned to Oak Ridge, Tennessee; at the time, Project scientists were researching enriched uranium and plutonium-based bombs, with the Oak Ridge laboratories central to the development of both. The Project suffered from a lack of human resources, and asked the Army for technically qualified men.|$|E
5|$|The state {{historic}} site at the Apple River Fort Site {{was set to}} close October 1, 2008 because of cuts in the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency's budget by Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Supporters of the {{historic site}} in Elizabeth, led by the Apple River Fort Foundation, appealed in protest to legislators and the governor against the closing, lamenting the economic impact the fort's closing {{will have on the}} community. After delay, the proposal to close seven state parks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> state historic sites, including Apple River Fort, went ahead on November 30, 2008. After the impeachment of Illinois Governor Blagojevich, new governor Pat Quinn reopened the closed state parks in February.

5|$|James F. Reed {{made it out}} of the Sierra Nevada to Rancho Johnson in late October. He {{was safe}} and {{recovering}} at Sutter's Fort, but each day he became more concerned for the fate of his family and friends. He pleaded with Colonel John C. Frémont to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the company, in return for which Reed promised that he would join Frémont's forces and fight in the Mexican-American War. Reed was joined by McCutchen, who had been unable to return with Stanton, as well as some members of the Harlan-Young party. The Harlan-Young wagon train had arrived at Sutter's Fort on October 8, the last to make it over the Sierra Nevada that season. The party of roughly 30horses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> men carried food supplies, and expected to find the Donner Party on the western side of the mountain, along the Bear River below the steep approach to Emigrant Gap, perhaps starving but alive. When they arrived in the river valley, they found only a pioneer couple, immigrants who had been separated from their company and were near starvation.|$|E
5|$|O'Donnell {{attempted}} {{to probe the}} Viet Cong flank, and after locating it on the high ground he committed 1 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Rod Smith—to conduct a right flanking attack. Beginning at 11:30 the Australian assault soon ran into another Viet Cong platoon conducting a similar manoeuvre, and they became involved in an intense battle at close quarters with each side blocking the manoeuvre of the other. A heavy monsoon rain began, drenching the men as they faced each other at a range of just , with seven Viet Cong machine-guns facing six Australian machine-guns {{at the height of}} the battle as the two Viet Cong platoons clashed with two Australian platoons. The Australians suffered heavily, losing two section commanders killed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> men wounded in the first few minutes. The fighting continued for another two hours as both forces traded shots, with neither the Australians nor the Viet Cong able to achieve a decisive advantage.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists in the trenches, {{equipped}} with outdated rifles and makeshift ammunition, designed {{to wait until}} Hunter's forces were well within range to open fire. The entrenched Mahdists weathered the continual barrage of the advancing forces until the distance shrunk to one hundred yards.

Two British officers, Brevet-Major Henry Sidney and Lieutenant Edward Fitzclarence, three Egyptian officers, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> regular soldiers {{were killed in the}} volleys. Over fifty were wounded across the brigade. Following this exchange, the battalions abandoned their orderly approach and charged the trenches with their bayonets. A furious melee ensued, wherein soldiers of MacDonald's brigade poured into the trenches and through the town, engaging in vicious hand-to-hand combat with Mahdists wherever they were {{to be found in the}} winding alleyways and narrow houses of Abu Hamed. In several places artillery was used to dislodge particularly stalwart defenders, while the Mahdist cavalry, looking on as Hunter's battalions swept through the town, turned to flee south towards Berber.|$|E

5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet, together with , under the command of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta. She was tasked to support Operation AL, an attack planned to seize several Aleutian Islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while {{the main body of the}} American fleet was occupied defending Midway. Jun'yō carried 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this operation. At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 Zeros <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> D3As to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. They had to turn back due to bad weather, although an American PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by a Zero. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. As the aircraft from Jun'yō were regrouping after the attack, they were attacked by 8 Curtiss P-40 fighters that shot down 2 Zeros and a pair of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and failed to make it back to the carrier. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E
