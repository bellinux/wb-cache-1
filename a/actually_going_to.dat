5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, instead of each Best Original Song nominee being performed separately, all five songs were performed as part of a musical number featuring actress Bernadette Peters singing brief introductions to each one. Although Goldwyn attempted to move the Documentary and Short Film Categories to a separate ceremony from the broadcast, the AMPAS Board of Governors refused to do so.|$|E

[...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and I just started talking about the story.

500|$|Dave Bautista {{was cast}} as Mr. Hinx after {{producers}} sought an actor {{with a background}} in contact sports. The character only has one line in the entire film, [...] "Shit". Sam Mendes thought the silent nature would drive Bautista away, but the lifelong Bond fan expressed interest in reviving the quiet henchmen archetype of characters such as Jaws. Bautista's performance was inspired mostly by Oddjob from Goldfinger, and said not talking created an acting challenge, “trying to find this way where I am <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have speak without speaking." [...] After casting Bérénice Lim Marlohe, a relative newcomer, as Sévérine in Skyfall, Mendes consciously sought out a more experienced actor {{for the role of}} Madeleine Swann, ultimately casting Léa Seydoux in the role. Monica Bellucci joined the cast as Lucia Sciarra, becoming, at the age of fifty, the oldest actress to be cast as a Bond girl. In a separate interview with Danish website Euroman, Jesper Christensen revealed he would be reprising his role as Mr. White from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Christensen's character was reportedly killed off in a scene intended to be used as an epilogue to Quantum of Solace, before it was removed from the final cut of the film, enabling his return in Spectre.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was the subject of {{controversy}} with the Asian community, as well as comedian Margaret Cho. In the film Full Metal Jacket, an Asian prostitute approaches US troops and offers to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. She uses terms such as [...] "Me so horny" [...] and [...] "me love you long time", which were heavily parodied and popularized. Accordingly, those terms have been used as humor at the expense of Asian people, and have been described as [...] "racial slurs" [...] by Cho. Other female acts have been known to use the phrase, such as Fergie on her track [...] "London Bridge" [...] (2006), and Nelly Furtado in [...] "Maneater" [...] (2006). In an interview with MTV News, Cho retracted her earlier comments, and expressed how if used in song, and by a female then it wouldn't be offensive: [...] "I don't mind it when it's used in songs, like when women use it," [...] Cho continued. [...] "Fergie uses it, that doesn't bother me. But when it's shouted in the street and they don't wait to hear the response? What if I was <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go, 'Oh, OK'?

500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{centered}} on Kirk Acevedo's character Charlie Francis. Acevedo explained in an interview, [...] "Charlie goes {{out on this}} call, and he gets attacked by this mythological, genetically enhanced griffin. He fights for his life throughout the episode". Acevedo suggested that his wife, actress Kiersten Warren, play his character's wife Sonia, and the producers duly cast her.

500|$|The entire storyline that {{centered}} around Quinn, Puck and Shelby was roundly criticized by reviewers. West wrote {{that it made}} her feel [...] "queasy", and she called Quinn's actions [...] "abhorrent". Bell was one of several who thought it was highly implausible that Child Protective Services would be backed up, much less for two weeks, given the gravity of Quinn's accusations. Hankinson wondered why they [...] "made Quinn a total sociopath" [...] who went from [...] "dancing on desks" [...] to [...] "framing someone for child endangerment" [...] with great ease; VanDerWerff was also critical of these actions, and called Quinn's sabotage of Shelby's apartment [...] "a move that takes a potentially good character, played by a fine actress, and just guts her". Kevin P. Sullivan of MTV had a different view, and wrote that the [...] "storyline stuck out throughout the episode as the most interesting". He also noted that it was [...] "cathartic and definitely nice to see a sweeter Puck balance out the earnest craziness of Quinn". The final scene of the episode, when Puck kissed Shelby, was characterized as [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "super awkward" [...] by Bell, as either [...] "super creepy" [...] or [...] "romantic" [...] by BuddyTV John Kubicek, as [...] "groan-inducing" [...] in the [...] "You're <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go there?"

500|$|Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News {{dismissed}} {{the fact that}} Shelby had been hired to form a second glee club at McKinley as [...] "mind-bogglingly idiotic". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times found the idea incomprehensible, and Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "Given Will's ongoing struggles to fill his own crooning baker's dozen, {{this is about as}} realistic a plan as Michele Bachmann starting a rival chapter of PFLAG at Liberty University." [...] Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger characterized the notion of [...] "Shelby deciding to give up a burgeoning Broadway career because she was missing her daughter grow up" [...] to take a part-time job in Lima as [...] "ridiculous", and the whole scenario as [...] "more than a little bizarre". Puck and Shelby's kiss in the [...] "Pot o' Gold" [...] episode was characterized as [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "super awkward" [...] by AOLTV's Crystal Bell, as either [...] "super creepy" [...] or [...] "romantic" [...] by BuddyTV's John Kubicek, and as [...] "groan-inducing" [...] in the [...] "You're <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go there?" [...] vein by IGN journalist Robert Canning. Critics were polarized by Puck and Shelby's sexual encounter in the [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] episode. Kubicek declared that [...] "the dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber," [...] MTV contributor Kevin Sullivan called it [...] "the most divisive plot line of the season", and Bell asked, [...] "Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we please get more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} most songs in Laundry Service {{are based on}} issues and themes related to love, {{as they had been}} written after Shakira began a {{relationship}} Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] is an [...] "ode" [...] to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an [...] "important side" [...] in [...] "The One", which is a song about how [...] "you love your guy so much that you’re <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> learn to cook" [...] and contains lines like [...] "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone." [...] In [...] "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is [...] "condemned" [...] to her and lists [...] "all the things your new boy can do." [...] Songs like [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and [...] "Fool" [...] also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train." [...] In the song, Shakira asserts that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers [...]" [...] "Fool" [...] discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a [...] "shitty, self-absorbed man" [...] even after suffering a [...] "soul-crushing defeat." ...|$|E
