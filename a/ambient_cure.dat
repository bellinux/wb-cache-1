The aim of these real fire tests was to complement the laboratory-based fire tests on FRP strengthened members that are currently being undertaken at various research centres. In this study, externally bonded plate and near-surface-mounted FRP strengthening were applied to the ceiling of a concrete structure. The FRP was protected using either an intumescent coating or gypsum boards, alongside FRP that was left unprotected. The tests demonstrated the vulnerability of FRP strengthening during a real compartment fire. The glass transition temperature was rapidly exceeded in the bonding adhesive for all samples.

40|$|There is {{nowadays}} {{an increasing}} demand for low VOC systems in automotive refinish industry. These systems should also cure sufficiently fast {{at ambient temperature}} {{in order to reduce}} the investment in drying equipment and the time of repair. However, matching the stringent chemical and mechanical requirements associated with medium solid systems, and reaching a VOC level < 420 g/l (from UK and Dutch legislation) is a challenge, especially if the coatings are cured at room temperature. Extensive research has been carried out on high solids resins making use of CARDURA(1) E 10 (the glycidyl ester of VERSATIC acid) in conjunction with acrylic and methacrylic monomers. The efficient use of these building blocks allowed the cost-effective production of resins matching all coating requirements at a VOC level below 420 g/l after cure at ambient as well as elevated temperatures. These <b>ambient</b> <b>cure</b> clear coat systems exhibit a very good overall performance and should therefore form a good starting point for very high solids acrylic-urethane coatings for automotive refinish applications.

The storage modulus of all samples conventionally postcured was also higher than their counterparts. The conventionally postcured samples were also found to have lower glass transition temperature than their rivals and softer material. For all percentages by weight of glass powder, the glass transition temperature for the oven cured samples was higher and {{it can be argued that}} the composite was stiffer; the opposite was true for the <b>ambient</b> <b>cured</b> sample. ...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} the {{experimental}} data on the sulphate and acid performance of geopolymer mortar containing pozzolanic materials such as fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and natural zeolite (NZ). The alkaline solution was the combination of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solution with the ratio (Na ₂SiO₃/NaOH) of 1. 0, 2. 0 and 3. 0. The molarity of sodium hydroxide was fixed as 10. The performances of geopolymer mortar were {{measured in terms of}} sodium and magnesium sulphate resistance and sulphuric and hydrochlorich acid resistance with 5 % and 10 % concentration after 24 weeks. The evaluations were measured as visual observation, measurement of weight change and residual compressive strength. It has been observed that Na ₂SiO₃/NaOH ratio is effective on residual compressive strength of geopolymer mortar in both sulphate and acid exposure. The higher ratio of Na ₂SiO₃/NaOH results in a higher residual compressive strength. The GGBS based geopolymer mortar has a very good resistance in acid media in terms of weight loss and residual compressive strength. The inclusion of FA in the GGBS based geopolymer mixture was found to be a suitable base of geopolymer mortar under <b>ambient</b> <b>curing</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the cure kinetics and cure modelling of an <b>ambient</b> <b>curing</b> unsaturated polyester (UP) resin system for its cure simulation in the vacuum infusion (VI) process. The curing of the UP resin system was investigated using {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). The dynamic DSC test measurements were conducted {{to find out the}} ultimate heat of reaction and enable experimental conversion determination for the isothermal curing. The empirical autocatalytic cure kinetics model incorporating the Arrhenius law represented the cure behaviour. The results of the cure kinetics study, the cure model, the material properties and the boundary conditions were the inputs in PAM-RTM software for the simulation of the degree of cure and the exothermic temperature during the infusion and the room temperature curing stages. The simulation results were compared with experimentally measured data. A vacuum infusion (VI) experiment involving a non-crimp glass fibre preform was performed in order to monitor the curing using thermocouples and validate the temperature simulation result. It was shown that the degree of cure and the exothermic temperature of a room temperature curing thermoset resin system during the VI process could be predicted through the steps of this study...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{this case}} study, alkaline-activated ground bottom ash {{prepared}} with low concentration of NaOH solution has demonstrated the ability to stabilize sand at the <b>ambient</b> temperature <b>curing</b> condition. In addition, {{it can also be}} observed from Fig.  5 that with 2  M of NaOH solution concentration, the compressive strength of stabilized sand is relatively high. However, a concentration of 4  M was selected for the further experiments to ensure the attainment of high strength when concentration of solution will be significantly reduced by adding water.|$|R
