5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the subculture as distinctly Japanese, {{a product of}} the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized <b>and</b> <b>nurtured,</b> catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E

40|$|This paper advocates redefining {{parenting}} {{in terms}} of commitment <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> rather than biological affinity. Legal precedents involve a geneological bias, but this is unrealistic {{in the light of}} the increasing variety of modes of reproduction now open to prospective parents. Commitment <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> favor social rather than biological affinity as the foundation of family life. Whether we can insist on commitment <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> as conditions of “parenting” is moot, hinging on whether parenting is viewed as a privilege or a right. However that question is resolved, justice demands that artificial insemination by donor and natural parents be treated alike...|$|R

According to Ragini Devi, historical evidence suggests that the Gotipuas tradition was known <b>and</b> <b>nurtured</b> in the 14th century, by Raja of Khurda.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1966, Lair {{had worked}} {{successfully}} under three chiefs of station, running his paramilitary operations {{with a relatively}} paltry annual budget of US$20 million. The money came directly from CIA headquarters, with offers of more funding available. Lair declined the extra money, and never requested a transfer from his assignment. For 15 years, he had encouraged <b>and</b> <b>nurtured</b> native martial talent, believing the covert operation was best done with the fewest Americans possible. As {{a result of his}} influence, there were fewer than 100 Americans working in northern Laos.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s-early 1980s high school clubs such as Brats, Charivari, Ciabattino, Comrades, Gables, Hardwear, Rafael, Rumours, Snobs, and Weekends created the {{incubator}} in which techno was grown. These young promoters developed <b>and</b> <b>nurtured</b> the local dance music scene by both {{catering to the}} tastes of the local audience of young people and by marketing parties with new DJs and their music. As these local clubs grew in popularity, groups of DJs began to band together to market their mixing skills and sound systems to the clubs in order to cater to the growing audiences of listeners. Locations like local church activity centers, vacant warehouses, offices, and YMCA auditoriums were the early locations where underage crowds gathered and the musical form was nurtured and defined.|$|E

40|$|Nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> {{are popular}} <b>and</b> well known {{concepts}} in both {{popular culture and}} science. The debate between nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> proponents about {{which of the two}} is the most important originator of phenotypes has been silent for decades. Instead, a compromise has been reached where everyone has agreed that most if not all phenotypes originate from a combination of nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> influences. In recent years, considerable scientific evidence suggests that during a specific timeframe in very early life, nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> interact with each other by epigenetic mechanisms. Nurture effects on the mother are shown to cause dramatically differing phenotypes in offspring. This paper proposes a model that incorporates the perinatal environment as a bridge between nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture.</b> It will be argued that this model is a better representation of reality than the existing non-dualistic model. The paper will focus on the ways changes in the perinatal environment affect the etiology of Syndrome X. With syndrome X prevalence rapidly rising, attempts to better understand its causes are very important. The first chapter will better define nature <b>and</b> <b>nurture</b> in traits <b>and</b> states and introduce the nature – PNE – nurture model. The mechanisms of epigenetic changes in gene expression will be examined thereafter. The paper concludes with a chapter providing insight into specific sites of DNA methylation (an important epigenetic mechanism) that have been associated with syndrome X etiology. ...|$|R
