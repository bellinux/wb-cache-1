40|$|ABSTRACT The 18 kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) was {{discovered}} as peripheral binding {{site for the}} benzodiazepine diazepam and initially named “Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor” (PBR). This protein is mainly located at the contact sites between the outer and the inner mitochondrial membranes, and is strictly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). It is involved in a variety of biological processes including choles-terol transport, steroidogenesis, cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis induction, and regulation of immune functions. The expression of TSPO is ubiquitary in peripheral tissues (steroid producing tissues, liver, heart, kidney, lung, immune system), and in the central nervous system is mainly located in glial cells and in neurons. Many studies have reported that the basal expression of TSPO is up-regulated in a number of neuropathologies, including gliomas and neurodegenerative disorders (Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases), in various forms of brain injury and inflammation, as well as in a variety of tumors; furthermore, a decrease in TSPO levels have been found in anxiety and mood disorders. Consequently, TSPO has been suggested as a promising diagnostic marker to image and measure the TSPO expression and distribution levels and thus for evaluation of disease progression by means of specific fluorescent or radiolabeled ligands. In particular, PET imaging using TSPO ligands to label activated microglia offers quantitative measures of inflammation and then can help to understand the regional brain distribution, stage and severity of neuroinflammation. N,N-dialkyl- 2 -phenylindol- 3 -ylglyoxylamide derivatives were designed in 2004 by Primofiore et al. as conformationally constrained analogues of the TSPO ligands indoleacetamides previously described by Kozikowski. These compounds have showed a high affinity for TSPO in the nanomolar to subnanomolar range and a high selectivity for TSPO. Successively, Da Settimo et al. refined TSPO pharma-cophore/topological model through the synthesis and the biological evaluation of novel indole derivatives. Evaluating a novel series of 2 -phenylindol- 3 -ylglyoxylamides featuring a methyl substituent on the indole nitrogen, the same research group observed that the insertion of the methyl group at the N 1 -position did not significantly influence TSPO binding. Therefore, these authors in collaboration with the research group of Pike et al. have developed novel radioligands for imaging brain TSPO with PET labeling the indole at the N 1 -position with the positron emitter carbon- 11, and have indicated these compounds as promising new chemotype for development of novel TSPO radioligands as biomarkers of neuroinflammation. The aim of this work is to refine the TSPO pharmacological/topological model through the synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of N,N-dialkyl- 2 -phenylindol- 3 -ylglyoxylamides bearing a polar group at the 4 ’-position of the 2 -phenyl ring (R 3 = NH 2, COOH, OH), and of a series of N,N-dialkyl- 2 -(3 -thienyl) indol- 3 -ylglyoxylamides. These compounds have been synthesized as symmetrical amides featuring linear alkyl chains of different length on the amide nitrogen (n-propyl, n-butyl, n-hexyl) to evaluate any changes in the interaction with the lipophilic pockets of the pharmacophore. The TSPO affinity of intermediary compounds featuring a OCH 3 and COOCH 3 substituent in 4 ’-position has also been estimated. At the same time, envisaging the possibility to develop novel TSPO radioligands, it has been evaluated the influence on the TSPO binding of the insertion of the methyl group at the N 1 -position: thus, has been prepared the N 1 -methylated indoles and compared their Ki values with those of the N 1 -unsubstitued parent compounds and the standard TSPO ligands Ro 5 - 4864 (2), PK 11195 (5), and <b>alpidem</b> (6) ...|$|E
40|$|The 18 kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) is a {{mitochondrial}} protein whose basal {{density is}} altered in several diseases, {{with the result}} that the evaluation of its expression levels by means of molecular imaging techniques represents a promising diagnostic approach. A wide number of N,N-dialkyl-(2 -phenylindol- 3 -yl) glyoxylamides have been studied as potent and selective TSPO ligands exhibiting Ki values in the nanomolar/subnanomolar range, and stimulating steroid biosynthesis in rat C 6 glioma cells to an extent similar to, or higher than that of classical TSPO ligands, such as PK 11195, Ro 5 - 4864 and <b>alpidem.</b> Starting from these derivatives, in this PhD work have been designed novel TSPO irreversible ligands bearing an electrophilic isothiocyanato group together with an irreversible NBD-fluorescent probe. The TSPO affinity of the new irreversible ligands was measured on rat tissue homogenates by [3 H]Ro 5 - 4864 radiobinding kinetic assays, all compounds showing high affinities for the target protein. In addition with the aim to further refine the TSPO pharmacophore/topological model and to investigate the role of the 1 -NH indole in the binding of these ligands to the TSPO, a novel series of N 1 -methylindole derivatives were synthesized. Within this series, the ligand N,N-di-n-propyl-(N 1 -methyl- 2 -(4 ’-nitrophenyl) indol- 3 yl) glyoxylamide ([11 C]- 29), featuring the best combination of affinity and lipophilicity, was labelled with carbon- 11 for evaluation with positron emission tomography (PET) in monkey. After intravenous injection, [11 C]- 29 entered brain to give a high proportion of TSPO-specific binding. These findings augurs well for the future application of [11 C] 29 in humans. [11 C] 29 represents a promising new chemotypes for developing novel TSPO radioligands as biomarkers of neuroinflammation. Adenosine is a physiological nucleoside which {{plays an important role in}} many patho-physiological conditions in the central nervous system (CNS), as well as in peripheral organs and tissues through modulation of specific membrane G protein-coupled receptors (ARs), currently classified into A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B, and A 3 subtypes. A 2 A ARs occur mainly on neurons in the striatum and on cholinergic interneurons, but they are also found in the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Recent evidences showed that A 2 A ARs may modulate a number of cellular processes affecting neuronal cell death in a broad spectrum of brain injury. A 2 A ARs resulted up-regulated in noxious brain conditions and their blockade confers robust brain neuroprotection. As this effect is exerted without observable peripheral effects, there is an increasing interest in the development of selective A 2 A AR antagonists as novel protective agents in neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, we have described a series of 3 -aryl-[1, 2, 4]triazino[4, 3 -a]benzimidazol- 4 (10 H) -ones (ATBIs) as potent adenosine receptors antagonists. In this PhD work, we have synthesized a novel series of ligands featuring modified substituents at the 10 position, combined with an appropriate aromatic ring at the 3 -position. Synthesis, biological evaluation and structure-activity relationships for these new derivatives ATBI will be presented. Finally, the most promising A 2 A AR ATBI antagonist was evaluated for its neuroprotective effect on PC 12 cells treated with dopamine neurotoxins: MPP+ or methamphetamine. We found a neuroprotective effect consisting of full prevention of neurotoxin-induced cell loss, as measured by combining a variety of staining techniques. These latter results, which were confirmed by combining neurotoxic models, each owing a different mechanism of action, offer a promising perspective for such a compound as a valuable tool to protect dopamine neurons...|$|E
