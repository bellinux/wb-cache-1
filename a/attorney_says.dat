5000|$|On February 23, 2015, a Texas Appeals Court {{announced}} that they had postponed Rodney Reed's execution, originally scheduled for January 14, 2015, for the 1996 murder of Stacey Stites, after his attorneys filed a petition citing the existence of new “scientific evidence” that establishes his “probable innocence." [...] It includes findings from three forensic scientists claiming their evidence shows Reed {{could not have been}} the person who killed Stites. Reed’s defense <b>attorney</b> <b>says</b> their new evidence shows she was killed hours earlier, the night before (on April 22, 1996) instead of at 3:00 a.m. on April 23, 1996. Reed's repeated appeals for freestanding actual innocence claims have been rejected outright by the courts on numerous occasions.|$|E
50|$|When an {{adjuster}} needs a New York State IME {{as quickly}} as possible due to a hearing or another urgent matter, a waiver can be signed by the claimant or their attorney, waiving their rights to 7 business days' notice of the appointment by mail (which is a law of the WCB). A common question from an IME Vendor, to a claimant or their attorney, may be to sign a waiver form. If the claimant signs this and goes to the appointment, this is okay. However, if an attorney's office refuses to sign it and won't let their client sign it, then the exam will have to be rescheduled to a later date to allow more notice time for the claimant. If a claimant attends the exam and their <b>attorney</b> <b>says</b> they'll sign the waiver, but never provides the signed waiver to the IME Vendor, the report that is dictated by the IME doctor will be precluded (meaning it is not valid because the waiver was never actually signed and returned).|$|E

40|$|ANYONE who {{has read}} the {{statement}} of facts in a large number ofbriefs of appellants and appellees is likely to conclude that any resemblancesbetween opposing accounts of the same facts are purelyfortuitous and unintentional. The impression that opposing lawyersseldom agree on the facts is strengthened if one listens to opposingcounsel in almost any trial. Now, {{as a matter of}} simple logic, two inconsistentstatements cannot both be true. At least one must befalse. And it is always possible that both are false, as, for example,when the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s <b>attorney</b> <b>says</b> the defendant speeded into thezone of the accident at sixty miles an hour and the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s counselinsists his client was jogging along at twenty miles an hour, while, infact, he was moving at forty miles an hour. Thus, a logician may concludethat either (1) at least half of our practicing lawyers utter falsehoodswhenever they open their mouths or fountain pens, or (2) that asubstantial majority of practicing lawyers utter falsehoods on a substantialnumber of such occasions. If we define a liar as a person whofrequently utters such falsehoods, 2 ̆ 7 it would seem to follow logicallythat most lawyers are liars...|$|E

5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. He testified in his own defense, {{against the advice of}} his <b>attorneys,</b> <b>saying</b> that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he never saw them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities.

[...] In March 2007 the White House had suggested that the plan came from Miers, who had left the White House in January 2007, before the dismissal received public attention.

50|$|Following Turner's {{sentencing}} in 2016, the plaintiff's {{attorneys in}} the De Anza case criticized Persky for allowing the photos into evidence. Attorneys for Doe said the photographs {{were not the}} only evidence that Persky unfairly permitted. Four of the baseball players had invoked Fifth Amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation. According to a lawyer for Doe, that was a critical juncture: it prevented their team from obtaining evidence that could have helped them pursue their case. The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could refuse to testify, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from subsequently testifying in the case. That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky after he took over the trial in 2011, a move that Doe's <b>attorneys</b> <b>say</b> undermined her case.|$|R
