50|$|The term hackney {{is used in}} Ireland {{to refer}} to a service which can only carry {{passengers}} from a pre-booked destination (or the hackney company's office) to another destination, similar to a minicab in Britain. Such vehicles are indicated by a small yellow plate above the registration plate with the word Hackney and the licence information. They normally operate for an <b>agreed</b> <b>fare.</b>|$|R
50|$|A semi-official 'system' of taxis {{operates}} on an <b>agreed</b> <b>fare</b> system. The going rate for almost anywhere within urban limits is Yuan20 (early 2016), for example {{to and from}} the railway station. These taxis will also take a visitor anywhere, such as to Badaling (Great Wall). Only rudimentary English will be spoken, enough to indicate an offered price, and bargaining is encouraged. It is helpful to have an image of the destination, and/or the address written in Chinese characters.|$|R
40|$|The leading {{economic}} {{explanation for}} tipping –that is, explanation why {{the practice is}} socially beneficial, not why individuals leave tips {{even though it is}} not narrowly advantageous to them – is that it confers an incentive to provide personal services. This fits many instances in which tipping is common but does not fit the taxicab business very well. We propose two novel explanations of tipping that do fit the taxi case. The first is that tipping might represent Lindahl pricing of the services of vacant cabs (essentially, reduced waiting time), a local public good for taxi customers. The second is that the actual fare for a cruising cab is de facto a matter of negotiation between the cab driver and the customer. Tipping thus represents a frank acknowledgment that the posted fare or regulatory determined fare is non-binding; the tip is simply the portion of the <b>agreed</b> <b>fare</b> in excess of the regulated one...|$|R
2500|$|By July {{a loss of}} £30 {{per week}} (...) was being {{incurred}} on the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company’s working, and in October it was <b>agreed</b> that the <b>fare</b> between Parliament Street and Cinderhill be reduced from 3 ½d. to 2d., the Corporation to receive half this amount, as before.|$|R
50|$|There are two taxi {{systems in}} Israel, with one {{operating}} {{as a standard}} taxi service and the other (taxi - sherut) as {{a cross between a}} taxi and a private bus system. The latter tends to run longer journeys or particular routes and is effectively a shared taxi - hence set pick up and set down locations but also potentially picking up or dropping off anywhere en route. Although fares are officially meter-based, it is quite common to <b>agree</b> the <b>fare</b> in advance with the driver. They have a directory guide for prices and will show the estimated alternative to the meter price, either to be accepted, negotiated or rejected by the traveler if the meter is preferred. The wisdom of the choice may be based on time of day and traffic and whether you have bags etc. which could cost more on the meter as each piece adds a set amount. Either way the eventual fare is not usually significantly different so many Israelis choose the meter without a thought. Tipping is not required but rounding up is common.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s an obscure rule crafted by IATA {{concerning}} the permissibility of chartering aircraft to operate flights across the North Atlantic {{for the sole}} purpose of carrying so-called [...] "affinity groups" [...] at fares below IATA's officially <b>agreed</b> minimum <b>fare</b> for any given route by the organisation's member airlines through their wholly owned, non-IATA subsidiaries (such as BEA Airtours or BOAC Charters for instance), came to the attention of a determined group of mainly non-IATA airlines, which sought to exploit these legal loopholes for themselves. This group of airlines included many leading independent British airlines of yesteryear, such as Britannia Airways, British United Airways, Caledonian Airways, Dan-Air and Laker Airways. (Some of these wholly privately owned, independent airlines - notably British United Airways - were actually IATA members themselves. However, at the time IATA was dominated by majority or wholly state-owned [...] "flag carriers", which used that organisation to frame rules that were designed to protect them from what they considered [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "unwarranted" [...] competition by independent airlines.) ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{willingness}} {{and ability to}} pay of the paratransit user. Paratransit (jitney) in this study refers to a public mode of transport of passengers that is {{owned and operated by}} private individuals or very small enterprises. The data were collected from a survey in Bandung, Indonesia, and analyzed using ordinal probit and binomial logistic regression. The findings illustrate a gap between the values of willingness and ability, and also reveal that people have different valuations regarding their related perceptions. The analysis explains the groups of users who have a tendency to assign a higher value, including the characteristics of users who <b>agree</b> with higher <b>fare</b> increments. This study also discusses the policy implications of this analysis...|$|R
2500|$|In Managua, {{those who}} commute {{to and from}} work {{generally}} travel by bus or taxi. Taxi tends to be the transportation method of choice for tourists. Taxi cabs may be hailed or called over by radio dispatch. Street cabs, those that can be hailed without calling a dispatcher, are widely available and cost somewhat less than their counterparts. However, some taxi cabs operate as collectives, and do pick up passengers as the first customer goes on their journey. Usually, passengers that wish to opt out of such practice do so by advising the driver not to pick up additional passengers. This is usually done as a safety precaution, as there have been robberies committed due to this practice of [...] "cab sharing." [...] Taxi cabs do not have meters. By custom, many Nicaraguans and tourists alike <b>agree</b> on a <b>fare</b> before embarking on the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924 {{the company}} {{expanded}} to four vehicles, {{a staff of}} seven, and larger premises in Worplesdon Road, which were further expanded in the 1930s with an impressive frontage added. A key figure in the company by this time was traffic manager Arthur Bowden, who also acted as signwriter, mechanic and handyman. By 1927, A&D were operating a high intensity Stoughton service with a flat fare of just one penny, with the clear intention of putting YBS out of business. The firm was at a low ebb but Hayter, fighting back in a [...] "make or break" [...] move, invested in 2 new Dennis 'G' buses for a route in 1928 from Guildford to Camberley, also in competition with A&D. That year a third Dennis bus enabled {{the start of a}} service from Guildford to Farnham via Compton, Puttenham and Seale. A third company, Safeguard was now competing for passengers in the same areas and, in 1928, the companies <b>agreed</b> a standard <b>fares</b> policy. By 1930, YBS had 5 modern Dennis buses in its fleet, to which two larger (32 seater) Dennis Lancet buses were added in 1933. Yellow Bus Services had weathered the storm. By 1935, the brand name [...] "Yellow Bus Services" [...] had been added to the vehicles and new Dennis Lancets delivered in 1936 carried a revised livery of creamy yellow with brown wings and flash, and bright yellow wheels. The fleet name now appeared in script within a hexagonal motif with the proprietor's name and telephone number, in gold and black.|$|R
