5|$|In Manitoba, <b>an</b> <b>urban</b> {{municipality}} may {{be named}} a town upon formation. Other than the requirements to incorporate as <b>an</b> <b>urban</b> municipality (1,000 residents and 400 people/km2), the Municipal Act has no minimum population threshold {{to limit the}} naming of them as towns. A town can alternately be named a village or urban municipality under the Municipal Act or a city {{if it has a}} minimum population of 7,500.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>urban</b> {{district}} council {{had been considered}} a year previously, {{in light of the}} expansion of areas within the parish, particularly Northwood. A report was prepared in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood—2,700 by that time, with 530 houses—compared with the largely rural character of the rest of Ruislip parish. The Metropolitan Railway extension from Harrow to Uxbridge was also discussed at the meeting on 28 October 1903, as a station was to be opened in Ruislip on the line. Kings College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish, were planning to sell some for development in light of the new line. As a result of these events, the council voted in favour of becoming <b>an</b> <b>urban</b> district.|$|E

Where trees are in short supply, as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The Eurasian tree sparrow is rural in Europe, but is <b>an</b> <b>urban</b> bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both Passer species may be found around towns and villages.
