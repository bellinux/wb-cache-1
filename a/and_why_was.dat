5|$|In 1936, SR85 was established, {{but it only}} {{extended}} as {{far north}} as Gila Bend and as far south as Ajo. By 1938, SR85 had been paved as well as the portion between Ajo and Why that would eventually become part of SR85. The portion between Why and the border with Mexico began showing up on maps at this time as a gravel road. In 1943, the portion of the highway between Ajo <b>and</b> <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> added to the state highway system, but as SR86, when it was extended west from Tucson to Ajo. In 1955, the highway was extended to Lukeville at the United States-Mexico border with an overlap with SR86 between Ajo and Why when a county road was added to SR85.|$|E
2500|$|The Talmud {{states that}} Pharaoh's {{daughter}} {{played a role}} in why Jeroboam was found worthy of becoming ruler of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. At Sanhedrin 101b it says [...] "Why did Jeroboam merit sovereignty? Because he reproved Solomon. <b>And</b> <b>why</b> <b>was</b> he punished? Because he reproved him publicly. As it is written, And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. He said thus to him: Thy father David made breaches in the wall, that Israel might come up [...] on the Festivals; whilst thou hast closed them, in order to exact toll for the benefit of Pharaoh's daughter. What is meant by And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king? [...] — R. Nahman said: He took off his phylacteries in front of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The victims' {{families}} accused Sulpicio Lines and the Philippine Coast Guard {{of negligence}} in allowing {{the ship to}} get underway despite the bad weather. They further blamed Sulpicio for not personally informing them about the tragedy, {{the details of the}} accident, and the condition of the ship and passengers. Sulpicio Lines' counsel stated that the ship was never advised by the Coast Guard that it was not safe to sail. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo demanded an explanation from port authorities: [...] "Why did you allow it to sail <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>was</b> there no ample warning? I want answers." [...] The Maritime Industry Authority (Marina) ordered the grounding of all Sulpicio Lines vessels, pending an investigation, and Vice President Noli de Castro presided over the first meeting of the newly created [...] "Task Force Princess Stars". Sulpicio Lines offered to pay the bereaved families 200,000 pesos ($4,500) each, by way of compensation.|$|E

2500|$|Georgian {{opposition}} politicians {{said that}} the incident needs to be thorough investigated. Irakli Alasania, {{one of the leaders}} of the opposition coalition Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia, said, that [...] "there is not yet enough information to make a comprehensive analysis of what has happened. One thing is clear: our borders are not protected well and an armed group of 20 persons can cross into the country without being detected by the border guard. A comprehensive investigation needs to be carried out in order to look into who was in charge of negotiations with (the armed group); what was the subject of negotiations <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>was</b> this operation planned in such a way that led to death of so many people." [...] The Georgian Dream stated: [...] "Even based on existing scarce and contradictory information, which the authorities disseminate, there is an impression that the authorities have acted in a characteristically impatient manner and launched the special operation in a condition when the possibilities of a negotiated solution were not fully exhausted and in a condition when there was still a minimal chance of avoiding casualties." ...|$|E
