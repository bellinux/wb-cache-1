5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of these}} disappointments, No. 6 Commando's first major {{action as a}} formed unit came in November 1942 when, along with No. 1 Commando, it formed part of the {{spearhead}} for the Allied landings in Algeria as part of Operation Torch. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Iain McAlpine, the commando embarked upon HMT Awatea in October 1942 in Glasgow along with some United States Army Rangers that were <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> part in the operation. Tensions were high between the British and the Vichy French at this time because {{of a number of}} clashes and as a result the decision was made for the commandos to be equipped with American weapons and uniforms in an effort to placate the defenders.|$|E

5|$|By 1973, {{construction}} was progressing {{on the western}} quadrant between I-15 in Murray and SR-201 (at the time US-40A/US-50A). Land acquisition was <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> place {{for the rest of}} the southeastern quadrant between 300 East in Murray and 4600 South in Holladay. However, a citizens' group named Cottonwood Inc. halted right-of-way acquirements due to the lack of an environmental impact statement (EIS). Also controversial was a proposed cloverleaf interchange at 2000 East. By mid-1975, an EIS was released with four main alternatives: a no-build alternative which would leave a gap in the southeast quadrant, building the road along the modern-day path (at about 6400 South), moving the southern portion southwest through Fort Union and Midvale to 7200 South, or extending the eastern portion further south to Sandy and then west along 9000 South. Cottonwood Inc. filed a lawsuit challenging the EIS. Meanwhile, I-215 from SR-201 in the western quadrant to 280 East in Murray opened in November 1976.|$|E

5|$|From about 1498, {{power in}} Moldavia quietly shifted toward {{a group of}} boyars and administrators, comprising, among others, Luca Arbore and Ioan Tăutu. Stephen's son and co-ruler, Bogdan, was <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> on princely {{responsibilities}} from his father. He conducted the negotiations with Poland about a peace treaty. The treaty, which Stephen ratified at Hârlău in 1499, {{put an end to}} Polish suzerainty over Moldavia. Stephen again stopped paying tribute to the Ottomans in 1500, although by then his health had declined. In February 1501, his delegation arrived in Venice, asking for a specialist doctor. As reported by Marin Sanudo, his envoys also discussed the possibility of Moldavia and Hungary joining the Ottoman–Venetian War. The Doge of Venice, Agostino Barbarigo, sent a physician, Matteo Muriano, to Moldavia to treat his counterpart.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, after {{a series}} of festivals where he sang {{together}} with The Blue Workers, Pascu had a solo recital at Braşov's Golden Stag Festival, and was awarded the Best Album trophy by the music magazine Actualitatea Muzicală, for Maşina cu jazzolină. He was also the opening act for Western rock groups touring Romania: the British bands Jethro Tull, Beats International and Asia, and Germany's Scorpions. As a television actor, Pascu was <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> part in the development of Romania's advertising industry.

5|$|In 2011, Sega {{noted that}} the game was {{frequently}} requested by fans as a title for re-release.

In 2010, the head of Sonic Team, Takashi Iizuka, expressed interest in developing a sequel to the game. <b>Also</b> <b>taking</b> an interest was Christian Whitehead, the developer of the 2011 remaster of Sonic CD, who said in a 2014 interview that he would possibly be open to remaking the game using the Retro Engine.|$|E

5|$|Moondram Pirai {{is about}} a school teacher, R.

The rest of the film shows how Bhagyalakshmi recovers her memory with Srinivas' help. Moondram Pirai is based on Balu Mahendra's brief relationship with actress Shoba, who died in 1980, shortly after their marriage. It was shot in Ketti, a small town situated close to Ooty, with further shooting <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> place in Bangalore. A total of 30 days was taken to complete the filming, using 36,000 feet of film negative.|$|E
5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the whole situation look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{had put a}} {{price on}} Federico Pistrucci's head, as he had prosecuted Bonapartist rebels, so the family fled Rome when the French {{advanced}} towards it, stopping in Frosinone, where the boys were again put into an academic school. Filippo satisfied his father with enough academic achievement that he was allowed to take a job with a painter named Mango. Deprived of his brother, Benedetto became despondent and was eventually allowed to work at Mango's. There, he quickly displayed his artistic talent. Mango told Benedetto of his brother Giuseppe Mango, a cameo engraver in Rome. With the Pope and the French having made peace, the family was able to return there, and Benedetto Pistrucci began his training as a cameo carver. He advanced quickly, <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> lessons from Stefano Tofanelli, and soon Giuseppe Mango was selling Pistrucci's carvings as his own. Realising that his works were being sold as counterfeit antiques, Pistrucci began placing a secret mark, the Greek letter λ (lambda) on his creations.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal.

When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shots were}} fired at 12:30 by Persanne close to the island of Pelagosa (Palagruža), but the main action did not begin for another hour, when Alceste and Pomone {{exchanged}} shots from their stern and bow guns.

At 14:00, Active had arrived in action and was also firing into Pomone, forcing Montfort to bring Pauline round to protect her outgunned colleague. By 14:20 the conflicts between Active and Pomone and Alceste and Pauline had separated into different duels, Pomone particularly suffering severely but Active <b>also</b> <b>taking</b> heavy damage, a 32-pounder carronade shot severing Captain Gordon's leg {{at the height of the}} engagement.|$|E
