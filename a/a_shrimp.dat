5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of <b>a</b> <b>shrimp</b> trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E

The Gulf Coast Film Festival annually showcases independent films from local, regional and international artists in various categories ranging from short films to documentaries.

5|$|Rainfall {{from the}} storm reached over 7inches (175mm) a short {{distance}} east of Pensacola, Florida, though impact in the state was minor. Wind gusts peaked at 38mph (61km/h) in Pensacola. In Alabama, Beryl produced sustained winds of 38mph (61km/h), with gusts to 54mph (86km/h), as well as above normal tides. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in coastal portions of Alabama, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island. Rough waves overturned <b>a</b> <b>shrimp</b> boat in Mobile Bay. A 15-year-old boy on the boat drowned, the only direct fatality {{from the storm}}. The boy's father, also on the boat, spent 24hours in the water before being rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline, with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70feet (18 to 21m) of beach.|$|E

25|$|Although {{fishing vessel}} {{designed}} increasingly began to converge around the world, local conditions still often led {{the development of}} different types of fishing boats. The Lancashire nobby was used down the north west coast of England as <b>a</b> <b>shrimp</b> trawler from 1840 until World War II. The Manx nobby was used around the Isle of Man as a herring drifter.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>shrimp</b> farm is an {{aquaculture}} {{business for}} the cultivation of marine shrimp or prawns for human consumption. Commercial shrimp farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply, particularly to match the market demands of the United States, Japan and Western Europe. The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, representing a value of nearly 9 billion U.S. dollars. About 75% of farmed shrimp are produced in Asia, in particular in China, Thailand and in the Philippines. The other 25% are produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer.

25|$|The muscular abdomen has six {{segments}} {{and has a}} thinner shell {{than the}} carapace. Each segment has a separate overlapping shell, which can be transparent. The first five segments each have a pair of appendages on the underside, which are shaped like paddles and is used for swimming forward. The appendices are called pleopods or swimmerets, {{and can be used}} for more purposes than just swimming. Some shrimp species use them for brooding eggs, others have gills on them for breathing, and the males in some species use the first pair or two for insemination. The sixth segment terminates in the telson flanked by two pairs of appendages called the uropods. The uropods allow the shrimp to swim backward, and function like rudders, steering the shrimp when it swims forward. Together, the telson and uropods form a splayed tail fan. If <b>a</b> <b>shrimp</b> is alarmed, it can flex its tail fan in a rapid movement. This results in a backward dart called the caridoid escape reaction (lobstering).|$|E
25|$|The term shrimp is used {{to refer}} to some decapod crustaceans, {{although}} the exact animals covered can vary. Used broadly, it may cover any of the groups with elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion – most commonly Caridea and Dendrobranchiata. In some fields, however, the term is used more narrowly, and may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller species of either group, or to only the marine species. Under the broader definition, shrimp may be synonymous with prawn, covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long narrow muscular tails (abdomens), long whiskers (antennae), and slender legs. Any small crustacean which resembles <b>a</b> <b>shrimp</b> tends to be called one. They swim forward by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of their abdomens, although their escape response is typically repeated flicks with the tail driving them backwards very quickly. Crabs and lobsters have strong walking legs, whereas shrimp have thin fragile legs which they use primarily for perching.|$|E
