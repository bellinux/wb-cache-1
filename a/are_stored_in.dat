5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Daucus carota is a {{biennial}} plant. In {{the first}} year, its rosette of leaves produces {{large amounts of}} sugars, which <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the taproot to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.|$|E

25|$|In the US, diesel is {{recommended}} to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a yellow container to differentiate it from kerosene and gasoline, which are typically kept in {{blue and red}} containers, respectively. In the UK, diesel <b>is</b> normally <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a black container, to differentiate it from unleaded petrol (which <b>is</b> commonly <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a green container) and leaded petrol (which <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a red container).|$|R

5|$|Ancient Trader is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} played from a two-dimensional perspective. The player controls a ship and seeks out three artifacts {{to defeat the}} game's final boss, a sea creature called the Ancient Guardian. The player explores the map to gather items, including tea, spices, and fruit, {{all of which can}} be found in wrecks. These can be exchanged for gold, which can be used to buy upgrades for the ship. The commodities <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the cargo hold, the capacity of which can be upgraded with gold.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the brain.|$|E
50|$|Bath brooms should <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a haystack. Prepared {{branches}} can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{the dark}} in winter, {{in the form}} of a sheaf, and tied up whenever needed. In both cases, the leaves are better preserved.|$|R
50|$|Require {{capabilities}} to <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{a particular area}} of memory that cannot be written to by the process that will use them. For example, the Plessey System 250 required that all capabilities <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> capability-list segments.|$|R

5|$|The game's {{energy system}} gives players 5 energy {{points at the}} start. Beginning a run in any mode costs one point, and it takes 10 minutes for a point to recharge. Players can pay to refill energy by {{spending}} ISO-8s. Players can make friends at the leaderboard; once per day they can send and request 5 energy points, which <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> their inboxes.|$|E
5|$|Vagrant Story is a solo action {{role-playing}} game, {{in which}} the player controls Ashley Riot from a third-person perspective while exploring Leá Monde and the catacombs underneath. The player may also switch into first-person perspective {{to allow for a}} 360° view using the START button or right analog stick on the game controller. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Navigation is in real-time, and areas accessed by the player <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> an in-game map menu.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the ambulance.|$|E
5000|$|The table {{used to look}} up the {{appropriate}} function <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> RAM. Then, even if the underlying code <b>was</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> ROM, it could still be overridden (patched) by replacing the ROM memory address with a RAM address.|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} should <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a cool, dry, well-ventilated {{area and}} away from any flammable or combustible substances. It should <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a container composed of non-reactive materials such as stainless steel or glass (other materials including some plastics and aluminium alloys may also be suitable). Because it breaks down quickly when exposed to light, it should <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> an opaque container, and pharmaceutical formulations typically come in brown bottles that block light.|$|R
5000|$|Imported Ammonia & Phosphoric Acid Terminal - The {{terminal}} facilitates direct unloading {{of ammonia}} and phosphoric acid from a ship. Ammonia <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a 10,000MT atmospheric pressure storage tank and Phosphoric acid <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> two tanks each of 8,000MT capacity.|$|R
5|$|Completing stages {{allow the}} player to {{progress}} through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; the first seven worlds feature an airship controlled {{by one of the}} Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths, and mini-games and bonus screens that provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a reserve until activated by the player from the map screen.|$|E
5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{inactive}} {{forms in}} plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat {{the plant and}} break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated {{in much the same way}} as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} case, the {{contents}} of Reg1 are added to {{the contents of}} a memory cell; the result <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> Reg1.

5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> significant amounts, {{mainly in the}} liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|Obsidian is an action-adventure {{presented}} in two dimensions, spread across approximately 50 game screens. Locations contrast between spaceship interior and rock surfaces. Players control a jet pack wearing astronaut who must deactivate the five engines of the titular spacestation Obsidian, {{which is located}} in the hollow centre carved out of an asteroid. Objects <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> gravity boxes on the station's ceilings, only one object can be held at a time. These are used to solve the game's puzzles and allow the player to continue further into the game. Each object's purpose must be discovered as they are not labelled.|$|E
50|$|There <b>is</b> one <b>store</b> <b>in</b> Arizona, in Window Rock. <b>In</b> Colorado, there <b>are</b> <b>stores</b> <b>in</b> Greeley {{and in the}} Denver area. <b>In</b> New Mexico, <b>stores</b> <b>are</b> found {{throughout}} the state. <b>In</b> Texas, <b>stores</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> west Texas, north Texas, the Panhandle, central Texas, and south Texas.|$|R
5000|$|Passive digital {{footprints}} can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{many ways}} {{depending on the}} situation. In an online environment a footprint may <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> an online data base as a [...] "hit". This footprint may track the user IP address, when it was created, and where they came from; with the footprint later being analyzed. In an offline environment, a footprint may <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> files, which can be accessed by administrators to view the actions performed on the machine, {{without being able to}} see who performed them.|$|R
50|$|P-selectin {{functions}} as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) on the surfaces of activated endothelial cells, which line the inner surface of blood vessels, and activated platelets.
