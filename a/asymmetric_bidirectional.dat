40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a string of}} vehicles where the local control law uses {{the states of the}} vehicle's immediate predecessor and follower. The coupling towards the preceding vehicle can be chosen different to the coupling towards the following vehicle, which {{is often referred to as}} an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> string. Further, the asymmetry for the velocity coupling can be chosen differently to the asymmetry in the position coupling. It is investigated how the effect of disturbance on the control errors in the string depends on the string length. It is shown, that in case of symmetric position coupling and asymmetric velocity coupling, linear scaling can be achieved. For symmetric interaction in both states, i. e., in symmetric bidirectional strings, the errors scale quadratically in the number of vehicles. When the coupling in position is asymmetric, exponential scaling may occur or the system might even become unstable. The paper thus gives a comprehensive overview of the achievable performance in linear, <b>asymmetric,</b> <b>bidirectional</b> platoons. The results reveal that symmetry in the position coupling and asymmetry in velocity coupling qualitatively improves the performance of the string. Extensive numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings. Comment: submitted, 10 page...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Despite of {{the fact}} that {{mammalian}} genomes are far more spacious than prokaryotic genomes, recent nucleotide sequencing data have revealed that many mammalian genes are arranged in a head-to-head orientation and separated by a small intergenic sequence. Extensive studies on some of these neighboring genes, in particular homologous gene pairs, have shown that these genes are often co-expressed in a symmetric manner and regulated by a shared promoter region. Here we report the identification of two non-homologous brain disease-related genes, with one coding for a serine protease inhibitor (SERPINI 1) and the other for a programmed cell death-related gene (PDCD 10), being tightly linked together by an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> promoter in an evolutionarily conserved fashion. This <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> promoter, in cooperation with some cis-acting elements, is responsible for the co-regulation of the gene expression pattern as well as the tissue specificity of SERPINI 1 and PDCD 10. Results While SERPINI 1 is predominantly expressed in normal brain and down-regulated in brain tumors, PDCD 10 is ubiquitously expressed in all normal tissues but its gene transcription becomes aberrant in different types of cancers. By measuring the luciferase activity in various cell lysates, their 851 -bp intergenic sequence was shown to be capable of driving the reporter gene expression in either direction. A 175 -bp fragment from nt 1 to 175 in the vicinity of PDCD 10 was further determined to function as a minimal bidirectional promoter. A critical regulatory fragment, from nt 176 - 473 outside the minimal promoter in the intergenic region, was identified to contain a strong repressive element for SERPINI 1 and an enhancer for PDCD 10. These cis-acting elements may exist to help coordinate the expression and regulation of the two flanking genes. Conclusion For all non-homologous genes that have been described to be closely adjacent in the mammalian genomes, the intergenic region of the head-to-head PDCD 10 - SERPINI 1 gene pair provides an interesting and informative example of a complex regulatory system that governs the expression of both genes not only through an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> promoter, but also through fine-tuned regulations with some cis-acting elements. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of string {{stability}} of interconnected systems with double-integrator open loop dynamics (e. g. ~acceleration-controlled vehicles). We analyze an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> linear controller, where each vehicle is coupled solely to its immediate predecessor and to its immediate follower with different gains in these two directions. We show that in this setting, unlike with unidirectional or symmetric bidirectional controllers, string stability can be recovered when disturbances act only on a small ($N$-independent) set of leading vehicles. This improves existing results from the literature with this assumption. We also indicate that string stability with respect to arbitrarily distributed disturbances cannot be achieved with this controller.

40|$|Abstract—Bidirectional {{associative}} memory (BAM) general-izes the {{associative memory}} (AM) {{to be capable}} of performing two-way recalling of pattern pairs. <b>Asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> associative memory (ABAM) is a variant of BAM relaxed with connection weight symmetry restriction and enjoys a much better performance than a conventional BAM structure. Higher-Order associative memories (HOAMs) are reputed for their higher memory capacity than the first-order counterparts, yet there are few HOAMs design schemes proposed up to date. To this end, we are concerned in this paper with designing a second-order <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> associative memory (SOABAM) with a maximal basin of attraction, whose extension to a HOABAM is possible and straightforward. First, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the connection weight matrix of SOABAM that can guarantee the recall of all prototype pattern pairs. To respect the complete recall theorem, an adaptive local training rule, which is adaptive in the learning step size and updates only the entries in the connection weight related to the most needful bit of a prototype, is formulated and it leads to better results and faster design. Then derived is a theorem, designing a SOABAM further enlarging the quantities required to meet the complete recall theorem will enhance the capability of evolving a noisy pattern to converge to its association pattern vector without error. Based on this theorem, our algorithm is also modified to ensure each training pattern is stored with a basin of attraction as large as possible. Computer simulations over the color graphics adapter (CGA) fonts have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed local training rule over other prevailing BAM schemes.

By applying the wave transfer function approach, it is shown that, if there are two integrators in the dynamics of agents, then the positional coupling must be symmetric, otherwise the system is locally string unstable. This finding holds also for a distributed system with a generalized path-graph interaction topology due to the local nature of the wave transfer function. The main advantage of the transfer function approach {{is that it allows}} us to analyse the bidirectional control with an arbitrary complex asymmetry in the controllers, for instance, the control with symmetric positional but asymmetric velocity couplings.

40|$|Abstract: Model-driven {{engineering}} (MDE) advocates the use {{of different}} domainspecific languages (DSLs) for describing different aspects of a system, which is called multi-view modeling or multimodeling. Existing metamodel-based technologies like Xtext provide good support for defining a DSL and for creating a corresponding domainspecific workbench but do not support multimodeling, yet, i. e., they do not provide means to specify (non-bijective) relations between DSLs, so that models that are created using these DSLs are synchronized automatically. We present an approach to model synchronization {{that is based on}} <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> transformations. Therefore, we implement lenses – a term-rewriting-based approach to bidirectional transformations – as an internal DSL in the Scala programming language and use lenses for model transformations. This way, our approach does not depend on special tool support and allows for seamless integration with Java-based MDE technologies. ...|$|E

Such promising technique needs to rely on a suitable physical layer in order to achieve its best performance. In this paper, we present an opportunistic packet scheduling method based on physical layer considerations. We extend channel adaptation proposed for the broadcast phase of <b>asymmetric</b> two-way <b>bidirectional</b> relaying to a generic number of sinks and apply it to a network context. The method consists of adapting the information rate for each receiving node according to its channel status and independently of the other nodes. In this way, a higher network throughput can be achieved at the expense of a slightly higher complexity at the transmitter. This configuration allows to perform rate adaptation while fully preserving the benefits of channel and network coding. We carry out an information theoretical analysis of such approach and of that typically used in network coding. Numerical results based on nonbinary LDPC codes confirm the effectiveness of our approach with respect to previously proposed opportunistic scheduling techniques. </p...|$|R

The regulation errors in spacing to the immediately preceeding and following vehicles are weighted differently by the onboard controller, which thus implements an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> control scheme. The weights can vary along the platoon. We prove that such platoons have a nonzero uniform bound on the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian matrix - the Fiedler eigenvalue. Furthermore, it is shown that existence of this bound always signals undesirable scaling properties of the platoon. Namely, the H-infinity norm of the transfer function of the platoon grows exponentially {{with the number of}} vehicles regardless of the controllers used. Hence the benefits of a uniform gap in the spectrum of a Laplacian with an asymetric distributed controller are paid for by poor scaling as the number of vehicles grows.

In particular, a robust texture representation based on image gradient orientations {{is used to}} define {{a new type of}} generative deformable model that generalizes well to variations in identity, pose, expression, illumination and occlusions and that can be fitted to images using standard CGD algorithms. Moreover, a novel Bayesian formulation of the AAM fitting problem, which can be interpreted as a probabilistic generalization of the well-known project-out inverse compositional (PIC) algorithm, is proposed along with two new types of composition, <b>asymmetric</b> and <b>bidirectional,</b> that lead to better convergent and more robust CGD fitting algorithms.

40|$|Abstract — With {{the goal}} to provide {{ubiquitous}} wireless In-ternet access, large-scale deployment of outdoor public access networks will continue {{at a rapid}} pace in the next years. In outdoor environment, connecting access points (APs) via cables is costly and {{requires a lot of}} cabling engineering work. Therefore, the multihop-augmented network architecture has become an option of upsurging interest. This paper investigates how to deploy APs in an outdoor public access network to improve throughput and quality-of-service (QoS) while extending the coverage by multihop communications. Frequency planning is suggested to improve user throughput with QoS provisioning, and to make the multihop network more scalable to facilitate cov-erage extension. To investigate the overall tradeoffs among QoS, throughput, and coverage, we develop an analytical throughput and delay model for this multihop network using the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) medium access control (MAC) protocol. This model also considers <b>bidirectional</b> <b>asymmetric</b> traffic for users operating in the unsaturated situation. Then, we apply an optimization approach to determine the optimal number of APs in a cluster and the best separation distances between APs, aiming to maximize the capacity and coverage of a cluster of APs subject to the delay requirement.

40|$|Abstract Memory-based {{collaborative}} filtering (CF) aims at predicting the rating {{of a certain}} item for a particular user based on the previous ratings from similar users and/or similar items. Previous studies in finding similar users and items have several drawbacks. First, {{they are based on}} user-defined similarity measurements, such as Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) or Vector Space Similarity (VSS), which are, for the most part, not adaptive and optimized for specific applications and data. Second, these similarity measures are restricted to symmetric ones such that the similarity between A and B is the same as that for B and A, although symmetry may not always hold in many real world applications. Third, they typically treat the similarity functions between users and functions between items separately. However, in reality, the similarities between users and between items are inter-related. In this paper, we propose a novel unified model for users and items, known as Similarity Learning based Collaborative Filtering (SLCF), based on a novel adaptive <b>bidirectional</b> <b>asymmetric</b> similarity measurement.

40|$|Next-generation access {{networks}} require provision of wireless services and {{high data rate}} to meet the huge demands for mobility and multiple services. Moreover, reusing the currently deployed optical distribution networks (ODNs) is highly beneficial and cost effective for providing the new high data rate wireless demands. In this paper, bidirectional radio over fiber passive optical network (RoF-PON) capable of handling multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) streams at low cost, high spectral efficiency and backward compatibility with currently deployed PON, is proposed. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, all the existing RoF MIMO solutions have not considered compatibility with currently deployed ODNs. Eight laser diodes (LDs) at the central office (CO) are enough for the whole system, instead of having LD or optical transmitter at each remote antenna unit (RAU), which makes a colorless and cost-effective RAU. Twenty four wavelengths are generated using optical comb technique. Each two 16 -QAM MIMO signals that have the same carrier frequency in the downstream (DS) transmission are optically combined using polarization-division-multiplexing (PDM), where each two upstream (US) MIMO signals are time division multiplexed. The PDM configuration doubles spectral efficiency with a power penalty of only 1. 5 dB. The proposed architecture is a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>asymmetric</b> RoF-PON with total 40 / 10 Gb/s for DS/US transmission.

40|$|Cooperative {{communication}} {{has been}} considered as a cost-effective manner to exploit the spatial diversity, improve the quality-of-service and extend transmission coverage. However, there are many challenges faced by cooperative systems which use relays to forward signals to the destination, such as the accumulation of multipath channels, complex resource allocation with the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>asymmetric</b> traffic and reduction of transmission efficiency caused by additional relay overhead. In this thesis, we aim to address the above challenges of cooperative communications, and design the efficient relay systems. Starting with the channel accumulation problem in the amplify-and-forward relay system, we proposed two adaptive schemes for single/multiple-relay networks respectively. These schemes exploit an adaptive guard interval (GI) technique to cover the accumulated delay spread and enhance the transmission efficiency by limiting the overhead. The proposed GI scheme can be implemented without any extra control signal. Extending the adaptive GI scheme to multiple-relay systems, we propose a relay selection strategy which achieves the trade-off between the transmission reliability and overhead by considering both the channel gain and the accumulated delay spread. We then consider resource allocation problem in the two-way decode-and-forward relay system with asymmetric traffic loads. Two allocation algorithms are respectively investigated for time-division and frequency-division relay systems to maximize the end-to-end capacity of the two-way system under a capacity ratio constraint. For the frequency-division systems, a balanced end-to-end capacity {{is defined as the}} objective function which combines the requirements of maximizing the end-to-end capacity and achieving the capacity ratio. A suboptimal algorithm is proposed for the frequency-division systems which separates subcarrier allocation and time/power allocation. It can achieve the similar performance with the optimal one with reduced complexity. In order to further enhance the transmission reliability and maintaining low processing delay, we propose an equalize-and-forward (EF) relay scheme. The EF relay equalizes the channel between source and relay to eliminate the channel accumulation without signal regeneration. To reduce the processing time, an efficient parallel structure is applied in the EF relay. Numerical results show that the EF relay exhibits low outage probability at the same data rate as compared to AF and DF schemes...|$|R

The mutations are widely spaced on the E. coli linkage map and are all easily reverted by ICR- 191. Mapping of ten independent revertants for each of five markers indicated that the reversions induced by ICR- 191 occurred near the original mutations. Exponentially and nonsynchronously growing cultures of this strain were exposed to ICR- 191 for 0. 85 generation, quickly washed free of mutagen, and resuspended in the original medium minus mutagen. Total viable cell number maintained its exponential increase both during and immediately after exposure to mutagen, whereas the number of revertants of any particular type remained constant for a characteristic period after removal of mutagen before finally assuming an exponential increase. Theoretically, the length of such a segregation lag should depend on {{the position of the}} particular reverted gene in the sequence of gene replication: the earlier a gene is replicated in the chromosome replication cycle, the longer its segregation lag should be.

In contrast to familiar photonic networks where driven two-level atoms exchange photons via 1 D photonic nanostructures, we propose and study a setup where interactions between the atoms are mediated by spin excitations (magnons) in 1 D $XX$ spin chains representing spin waveguides. While Markovian quantum network theory eliminates quantum channels as structureless reservoirs in a Born-Markov approximation to obtain a master equation for the nodes, {{we are interested in}} non-Markovian dynamics. This arises from the nonlinear character of the dispersion with band-edge effects, and from finite spin propagation velocities leading to time delays in interactions. To account for the non-Markovian dynamics we treat the quantum degrees of freedom of the nodes and connecting channels as a composite spin system with the surrounding of the quantum network as a Markovian bath, allowing for an efficient solution with time-dependent density matrix renormalization group techniques. We illustrate our approach showing non-Markovian effects in the driven-dissipative formation of quantum dimers, and we present examples for quantum information protocols involving quantum state transfer with engineered elements as basic building blocks of quantum spintronic circuits.

So far, however, any coupling across frequency in the human has only been modeled in terms of unidirectional influences, a misplaced assumption given the looped architecture of the basal ganglia, and has been considered in static terms. Here, we investigate the pattern of bidirectional coupling between mesial and lateral cortical areas and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) at rest and during movement, with and without pharmacological dopaminergic input, in patients with Parkinson's disease.

The authors examined the longitudinal relationship between autistic-like and internalizing traits across middle to late childhood in a population-representative twin sample. Method: Participants were approximately 6, 000 twin pairs born in England and Wales from 1994 to 1996. Parental reports of autistic-like and internalizing traits were analyzed at ages 7 and 8 (timepoint 1) and again at age 12 (timepoint 2). The direction and etiology of the associations between these traits were examined within a cross-lagged design. Results: Findings revealed an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> association between autistic-like and internalizing traits over time. Autistic-like traits at age 7 made a modest but {{significant contribution to the}} presence of internalizing traits at age 12. Earlier internalizing traits also influenced the development of later autistic-like traits, although this association was approximately one-half the magnitude. While both traits were moderately to highly heritable, they were largely independent with regard to their genetic influences. Stronger associations were found between the modest shared environmental influences on each trait. Of note, it was autistic-like communication difficulties, rather than social deficits, that made a significant contribution to later internalizing traits. Conclusions: The association between autistic-like and internalizing traits was attributable to reciprocal processes occurring across childhood, suggesting that these traits may serve to exacerbate each other over time. Autistic-like communication difficulties had the most notable impact. This association must now be explored within samples of children with diagnosed autism spectrum disorders and internalizing disorders, since this may help to inform the best timing and targeting of clinical intervention...|$|E

Within the time scale of the experiment (1 day) both the lipid molecules residing in the inner and outer leaflet of the magnetoliposomes participate in the exchange process, although 'flip-flop' movements have a retarding effect. In the second approach a unidirectional flux of DMPG from DMPG magnetoliposomes to distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) acceptors is noted. In this case, the outer phospholipid leaflet of the magnetoliposomes (in contrast to the inner one) can be largely stripped off; the extent of depletion is determined by the relative amount of the DSPG receiving structures. Furthermore, it is found that with a 15 -fold molar excess of receptors, the whole depletion course can be described by a single first-order rate expression. The reluctancy of the inner shell phospholipids to migrate is further illustrated by the virtual lack of transfer, observed with monolayer-coated Fe 3 O 4 colloids. In the third case, <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> PG transfer is followed between equimolar amounts of DMPG magnetoliposomes and dipentadecanoylphosphatidylglycerol vesicles. In the initial stage of the incubation period, the mmol PG/g Fe 3 O 4 ratio decreases, but progressively restores later on. By quantitatively measuring the transfer rate of each of the individual components, this complex behavior could be unravelled. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Origins of DNA {{replication}} (oris) are the genomic {{sites where}} DNA synthesis starts to duplicate a cell's genome. Although prokaryotic and yeast oris have been characterized in detail, {{the nature of}} mammalian oris is still ill-defined. In fact, of ∼ 30, 000 oris estimated to exist in mammalian genomes, only the one localized at the human lamin B 2 locus has been mapped with nucleotide resolution. This thesis describes the identification of a novel human on located around the transcriptional promoter of the DBF 4 gene. Using {{a modified version of}} the replication initiation point (RIP) mapping technique, precise leading strand initiation sites have been determined at this new ori. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have been employed to study the interaction of replication and transcription proteins within the ori region. The data presented here demonstrate that, at the DBF 4 ori, DNA replication can initiate from multiple potential start-sites which are distributed within two replication initiation zones. These zones are separated by ∼ 400 bp and are localized near binding sites for the origin recognition complex (ORC) and the Sp 1 transcription factor. Strikingly, initiation of DNA synthesis from the two zones occurs sequentially and not simultaneously: replication starts first from initiation zone I and proceeds in the direction of DBF 4 transcription, followed by activation of zone II and DNA synthesis from the complementary strand. This replication pattern, termed <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> replication (ABR), is reminiscent of initiation at oriC in Escherichia coli but greatly differs from what is observed at the lamin B 2 ori, where a single ORC-binding site and unique replication start-points have been reported. Overall, the data suggest, for the first time, that eukaryotic replication initiation can take place through either the traditional origin of bidirectional replication (OBR) model, such as is the case in budding yeast and at the human lamin B 2 ori, or through the asymmetric ABR model described here for the DBF 4 ori...|$|E
40|$|In decerebrate cats, the {{extracellular}} {{activities of}} neurons in the medial medullary reticular formation were studied during constant velocity off-vertical axis rotations (OVAR) in the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions (at 10 ° tilt). Spontaneously active neurons demonstrated sinusoidal position-dependent discharge modulations to OVAR which selectively stimulates the otoliths. Two features of neuronal responses to bidirectional OVAR were identified. Within the velocity spectrum tested (1. 75 - 15 °/s), some neurons showed symmetric bidirectional response sensitivity (δ value) to CW and CCW rotations. The {{spread of the}} δ values {{of each of these}} neurons with velocity was small. This group of reticular neurons were described as exhibiting symmetric and velocity-stable bidirectional response sensitivity. The mathematically derived gain tuning ratios of these neurons were within the range of narrowly spatiotemporal-tuned neurons. Another group of reticular neurons, however, showed <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> response sensitivity to CW and CCW rotations; a few of these neurons were responsive only to OVAR of one direction but not to both. For each of this second group of neurons, the spread of the δ values with velocity was large. These reticular neurons were described as exhibiting asymmetric and velocity-variable bidirectional response sensitivity. The gain tuning ratios of these latter neurons were found to be within the range of broadly spatiotemporal-tuned neurons. Single neurons of both groups displayed orientational tuning. Both the best response orientations of neurons that showed symmetric and velocity-stable bidirectional response sensitivity and the preferred orientations of neurons that showed asymmetric and velocity-variable bidirectional response sensitivity were found to point in all directions on the rotary plane. The response dynamics of the former group of neurons was also examined. All showed flat response gain across the entire velocity range. Some showed a flat response lead while others showed a progressive shift from small response lead at low velocity to phase close to zero at higher velocities. The functional significance of these medial medullary reticular neurons to the direction and orientation of head tilt is discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{computation}} of point-to-point shortest paths on time-dependent {{road networks}} has many practical applications which are interesting from an industrial point of view. Typically, users {{are interested in}} the path leading to their destination which has the smallest travel time among all possible paths; it is natural to model the shortest paths problem on a time-dependent graph, where the arc weights are travel times that depend on the time of day at which the arc is traversed. We study both fully combinatorial methods and mathematical formulation based methods. From a combinatorial point of view, if we impose some restrictions on the arc weights, the problem can be solved in polynomial time with the well known Dijkstra's algorithm. However, applying Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with several millions of vertices and arcs, such as a continental road network, may require several seconds of CPU time. This is not acceptable for real-time industrial applications; therefore, the need for speedup techniques arises. Bidirectional search is a standard technique to speed up computations on static (i. e. non time-dependent) graphs; however, as the arrival time at the destination is unknown, the cost of time-dependent arcs around the target node cannot be evaluated, thus bidirectional search cannot be directly applied on time-dependent networks. We propose an algorithm based on an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>bidirectional</b> search, which allows the extension to the time-dependent case of hierarchical speedup techniques, well known for static graphs. Our method deals efficiently with dynamic scenarios where arcs weights can change, so that we can take into account real-time and forecast traffic information as soon as it becomes available. We achieve average query times for time-dependent shortest paths computations that were previously only possible on dynamic graphs with static arc costs. We discuss the integration of our algorithm with an existing real-world industrial application. For general arc weight functions, the problem is not polynomially solvable; we propose a mathematical programming formulation which is a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) if the time-dependent arc weights are linear or piecewise linear functions, whereas it is a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) if the arc weights are nonlinear functions. We study efficient algorithms for both classes of problems, and test them on benchmark instances taken from the literature, as well as shortest paths instances. We propose new branching strategies {{within the context of a}} Branch-and-Bound algorithm for MILPs. Computational experiments show that, by generating good branching decisions, we enumerate on average half the nodes enumerated by traditional strategies. Our approach is also competitive in terms of total computational time. Finally, we present a general-purpose heuristic for MINLPs based on Variable Neighbourhood Search, Local Branching, Sequential Quadratic Programming and Branch-and-Bound. Experiments show the reliability of our heuristic with respect to methods proposed in the literature...|$|E
