40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{interception efficiency}} of a gully grating decreases with the steepness {{of the road}} on which it is installed. This {{can lead to a}} higher potential for flooding at the downstream area of a steep road. In this study, the hydraulic inception efficiency of several types of gully gratings on steep roads, including a new grating with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section was investigated experimentally. The experimental results for all test gratings show that the hydraulic interception efficiency varies linearly with a non-dimensional parameter expressed as a product of the Froude number, water depth to grating length ratio and flow width to grating width ratio. The empirical relationship can be easily included in numerical models for the detailed study and design of storm water drainage systems. The hydraulic performance of the grating with longitudinal bars and the new grating with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section was better than that of the existing grating. The relative increase in the efficiency increases with the flow velocity, depth and width. While gratings with longitudinal bars may induce inconvenience to cyclists, gratings with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section may be used on steep roads to enhance the hydraulic interception efficiency of gullies.

First, the variations of droplet size distribution (DSD) and liquid water content (LWC) in vertical and streamwise directions were measured. Then, variations of ice accretion on an <b>angle</b> <b>bar</b> in the same direction as the flow were measured to determine the aerodynamic forces on a tower leg as a function of ice accretion. The ice accretion experiments were carried out under two conditions with different LWCs and air velocities.

40|$|The load {{carrying}} capacity and failure mechanism of 8 square columns strengthened with high-performance ferrocement laminate (HPFL) and bonded steel plates (BSP) were analyzed {{on the basis of}} experiments on the axial compression performance of these columns. Results show that the reinforcing layer worked together with the original columns as a whole, and the load-bearing capacity significantly increased. When failure of the strengthened column occurred, the mortar and concrete were crushed and bulged outward {{in the middle of the}} columns, the <b>angle</b> <b>bars</b> and longitudinal steel bars buckled, and some stirrups were pulled out. The chamfering of <b>angle</b> <b>bar</b> momentously affected the primary damage of steel strand. The values of the strength reduction factor and pressure effective utilization coefficient of the mortar were suggested. Based on the experiments and existing tests of 35 columns strengthened with HPFL, equations for the axial compression bearing capacity were proposed and all calculation results agreed well with testing results. Therefore, the calculation method could be used in the capacity design of axial compression strengthened columns...|$|R

However, the inevitable rollers deflection induced by rolling force leads to significant decrease in radius prediction accuracy of the flange products. Therefore, the radius compensation is implemented through adjusting forming parameters {{in order to obtain}} a flange product with the designed radius. In the paper, the rolling force and rollers deflection are solved with considering the workpiece-roller interaction; on this basis, a radius compensation scheme is proposed and evaluated.

5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{downstream}} migrant silver phase American eels Anguilla rostrata to guide along various configurations of <b>angled</b> <b>bar</b> racks (25 - and 50 -mm clear spacing) and louvers (50 -mm clear spacing) was evaluated {{in a laboratory}} flume. Guidance tests were conducted with bar racks and louvers angled at 45 and 15 degrees to the approach flow at velocities of 0. 3 m/s to 0. 9 m/s. A full-depth bypass was used for all tests. Guidance efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of fish recovered from the bypass {{by the total number}} recovered downstream (bypass and entrainment combined). Mean guidance efficiency (MGE) with the 45 -degree, 25 -mm bar rack ranged from a low of 56. 8 % at 0. 6 m/s to a high of 65. 9 % at 0. 9 m/s. MGE of the 45 -clegree, 50 -mm bar rack decreased from 72. 7 % at 0. 3 m/s to 54. 5 % at 0. 9 m/s, while MGE of the 45 -clegree louver ranged from a low of 34. 9 % at 0. 3 m/s to a high of 61. 9 % at 0. 6 m/s. Guidance efficiency was considerably higher for tests with the 15 -degree structures, exceeding 88 % at all velocities during tests with a solid bottom overlay placed over the lower 30 cm of each structure. During tests without the overlay in place and at a velocity of 0. 6 m/s, guidance efficiency of both bar racks and louvers decreased to 83. 3 and 60. 7 %, respectively. The estimated guidance efficiencies indicate that <b>angled</b> <b>bar</b> racks and louvers have potential for diverting American eels away from hydro intakes, particularly if a shallow angle is employed (e. g., 15 degrees to the approach flow). However, we believe our estimates of guidance efficiency are higher than would be experienced at an actual intake due to the full depth bypass, the limited depth of the flume, and the short length of each rack configuration that we evaluated...|$|R
