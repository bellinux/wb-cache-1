5|$|For {{the series}} of Bond novels, Fleming {{realised}} that without threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought across to the screen in the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a pattern for having a main villain with <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films.|$|E

5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped that Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E

5|$|He {{had little}} impact on {{the running of the}} navy, but he was {{interested}} enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of John Flamsteed's Observations in 1704. He was not one of the most colourful political characters of his day—he was content to spend his time building model ships—but he was <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> and supportive husband to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.|$|E

5|$|In the House of Representatives, Voorhis was <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> {{supporter}} of the New Deal and compiled a liberal voting record. His major legislative achievement was the Voorhis Act of 1940 requiring registration of certain organizations controlled by foreign powers. After being re-elected by comfortable margins four times, he faced Nixon in 1946 in a bitter campaign in which Voorhis' supposed endorsement by groups linked to the Communist Party {{was made into a}} major issue. Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against Nixon in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Magnus' final {{domestic}} dispute {{was with}} the noble Sveinke Steinarsson, who refused to recognise him as king. Although Sveinke reduced piracy in Viken, he was forced into exile for three years after negotiating with Magnus' men. Since piracy increased soon after Sveinke's departure (possibly encouraged by Sveinke himself), Magnus met him in the Danish province of Halland to request his return to Norway. They reconciled; Sveinke became <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> supporter of Magnus, now the undisputed king of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{played a}} four, then a five-piece drum kit during his early career. His 1965 set {{consisted}} of Ludwig drums and Zildjian cymbals. By 1966, feeling limited {{by this setup}} and inspired by Ginger Baker's double bass drum, he switched to a larger Premier kit. This setup {{did not have a}} hi-hat, since Moon used crash and ride cymbals instead. He remained <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> customer of Premier.|$|E

5|$|The Jugurthine War of 111–104 BC {{was fought}} between Rome and Jugurtha of the North African kingdom of Numidia. It {{constituted}} the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion {{on the continent}} after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia, <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome felt compelled to intervene. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation. Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament of the United Kingdom {{presented}} <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> {{address to}} Queen Elizabeth II in 1965 {{to mark the}} 700th anniversary of Montfort's Parliament, and the Queen addressed both Houses of Parliament.

Some of these documents were displayed again in a 2015 exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The party split grew, and in 1912, Taft and Roosevelt were rivals for the Republican nomination. The 1912 Republican National Convention was bitterly divided. At Taft's request, Harding gave {{a speech}} nominating the president, but the angry delegates were not {{receptive}} to Harding's oratory. Taft was renominated, but Roosevelt supporters bolted the party. Harding, as <b>a</b> <b>loyal</b> Republican, supported Taft. The Republican vote was split between Taft, the party's official candidate, and Roosevelt, running under the label of the Progressive Party. This allowed the Democratic candidate, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, to be elected.|$|E
