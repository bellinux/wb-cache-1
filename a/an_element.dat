5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes <b>an</b> <b>element</b> of the ring and <b>an</b> <b>element</b> of the module and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal {{the structure of the}} ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes <b>an</b> <b>element</b> from each ring and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes <b>an</b> <b>element</b> {{of the group and}} <b>an</b> <b>element</b> of the set and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
5|$|At least 17,000metrictons of {{fluorine}} {{are produced}} each year. It costs only $5–8 per kilogram as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride, but many times more as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> because of handling challenges. Most processes using free fluorine in large amounts employ in situ generation under vertical integration.|$|E
40|$|Insulin {{inhibits}} {{the transcription}} of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), which plays {{a pivotal role}} in lipoprotein assembly and secretion. Here, we provide evidence that a hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding <b>element</b> (HNF 1 <b>A</b> <b>element)</b> within the MTTP promoter serves as a novel negative insulin-responsive element. Deletion/ mutation mapping of the MTTP gene promoter identified a modified HNF 1 <b>A</b> <b>element</b> that is crucial to the negative insulin effect. Chimeric promoter containing this HNF 1 <b>A</b> <b>element</b> and minimal TEAD 1 promoter also responded negatively toward insulin treatment. Gel shift assay demonstrated that HNF 1 A but not HNF 1 B binds to this element. Enforced expression of HNF 1 A was sufficient to reconstitute the negative insulin responsiveness of MTTP promoter in TM 4 SF 1 myocytes that are HNF 1 A negative. Furthermore, replacing this element with consensus HNF 1 <b>A</b> <b>element</b> preserved the negative insulin response, suggesting that negative insulin responsiveness is a generic characteristic of HNF 1 <b>A</b> <b>element.</b> Given that many genes implicated in diabetes contain HNF 1 <b>A</b> <b>element,</b> the potential regulation of these genes by insulin via HNF 1 <b>A</b> <b>element</b> may provide important clues for the manifestation and treatment of diabetic metabolic syndromes. © 2008 Society for Endocrinology. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Boron was not {{recognized}} as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> {{until it was}} isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate {{on one of the}} electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron. Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> in 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} <b>an</b> <b>element</b> between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later {{found to be the}} transuranic element dubnium.|$|E

5|$|Sulfur {{and carbon}} were known in antiquity. The {{earliest}} known use of charcoal dates to around 3750 BCE.

40|$|Matrix-associated regions may {{be useful}} for {{studying}} the role of chromatin architecture in transgene activity of trans-formed plants. The chicken lysoryme <b>A</b> <b>element</b> was shown to have specific affinity for tobacco nuclear matrices, and its influence on the variability of transgene expression in tobacco plants was studied. T-DNA constructs in which this element flanked either the P-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene or both reporter and selection gene were introduced in tobacco. The variation in GUS gene activity was reduced significantly among mature first-generation transgenic plants carrying the <b>A</b> <b>element.</b> Average GUS activity became somewhat higher, but the maximum attainable level of gene ex-pression was similar for all three constructs. Transient gene expression assays showed that the <b>A</b> <b>element</b> did not contain general enhancer functions; therefore, its presence seemed to prevent {{the lower levels of}} transgene expression. The strongest reduction in variability was found in plants transformed with the construct carrying the <b>A</b> <b>elements</b> at the borders of the T-DNA. In this population, expression levels became copy number dependent. The presence of two <b>A</b> <b>elements</b> in the T-DNA did not interfere with meiosis...|$|R

5|$|The Bohr model {{exhibits}} {{difficulty for}} atoms with atomic number greater than 137, as any element with an atomic number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be travelling faster than c, {{the speed of}} light.

5|$|The Danish {{physicist}} Niels Bohr was {{the first}} to seriously consider the possibility of <b>an</b> <b>element</b> with atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such <b>an</b> <b>element</b> would take its place in the periodic table below radon as the seventh noble gas. Following this, Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet known how to produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the island of stability had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.|$|E

40|$|The elastase I (EI) gene is {{expressed}} {{at high levels}} in the exocrine pancreas and at lower levels in {{other regions of the}} gut. The transcriptional enhancer of the EI gene, from nucleotides - 205 to - 72, recapitulates the expression of the endogenous gene in transgenic mice; it directs not only pancreatic acinar cell expression of a human growth hormone (hGH) transgene but also expression to the stomach, duodenum, and colon. This pattern of selective expression limited to the gastroenteropancreatic organ system is specified by the <b>A</b> <b>element,</b> one of three functional elements in the EI enhancer. When multimerized, the <b>A</b> <b>element</b> directed expression of a hGH reporter gene selectively to the pancreas, stomach, and intestine in transgenic mice. Immunofluorescent localization of hGH indicated that the <b>A</b> <b>element</b> multimer transgenes were expressed in the acinar cells of the pancreas as well as in Brunner's gland cells of the duodenum. The <b>A</b> <b>element</b> binds <b>a</b> pancreatic acinar cell-specific factor, PTF 1.
