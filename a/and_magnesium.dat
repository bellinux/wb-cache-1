5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of lithium shows several differences {{from that of}} the rest of the group as the small Li+ cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character. Lithium <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii, so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the alkaline earth metals (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character (e.g. LiMe and MgMe2).|$|E

The addition of yttrium to alloys generally improves workability, adds resistance to high-temperature recrystallization, and significantly enhances resistance to high-temperature oxidation (see graphite nodule discussion below).|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2007 John Libbey Eurotext - All rights reservedThe {{relationship}} between total <b>and</b> ionic serum <b>magnesium</b> in health <b>and</b> chronic disease across different ethnicities {{has not been}} well studied. Accordingly, we have examined the inter{{relationship between}} total <b>magnesium</b> <b>and</b> ionic <b>magnesium,</b> as well as ionic calcium to ionic magnesium ratio, in 286 patients made up of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, with or without diabetes. Significant correlations were noted between total <b>and</b> ionic <b>magnesium</b> in all groups (p < 0. 001). Amongst people with diabetes, the correlation coefficient (r) was 0. 81 whereas in non-diabetics, the r was 0. 66. This relationship was independent of whether the sample was from indigenous (r = 0. 71) or non-indigenous (r = 0. 81) participants. Overall the correlation between total <b>and</b> ionic <b>magnesium</b> across all participants was 0. 75. There was no correlation between serum total <b>magnesium</b> <b>and</b> serum ionic calcium (r = 0. 07), and similarly none between serum ionic <b>magnesium</b> <b>and</b> serum ionic calcium (r = 0. 26). There was, however, a significant negative correlation between the calcium: <b>magnesium</b> ratio <b>and</b> serum total <b>magnesium</b> (r = 0. 80; p < 0. 001) across all participants, irrespective of whether the sample {{was made up of}} indigenous (r = 0. 83) or non-indigenous participants (r = 0. 77), or of diabetics (r = 0. 71) versus non-diabetics (r = 0. 83). We conclude that total <b>and</b> ionic <b>magnesium</b> serum concentrations are strongly correlated, and that either gives an accurate assessment of magnesium status in health and chronic diabetes, irrespective of ethnicity.

5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium <b>and</b> <b>magnesium,</b> and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum <b>and</b> <b>magnesium,</b> {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Hydrofluoric acid is {{a contact}} poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon <b>and</b> <b>magnesium,</b> may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, <b>and</b> <b>magnesium,</b> provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E

5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance.

Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries.

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, <b>and</b> <b>magnesium</b> are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, {{especially}} in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808.
