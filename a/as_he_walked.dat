5|$|Bok finally {{escaped from}} Giemma {{when he was}} 17 years old by walking through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari. Bok went to the local police {{department}} to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving them behind <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> into the crowded marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and {{his hands and feet}} were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked,</b> creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E

5|$|As Grant {{continued}} to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led {{a group to}} meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, and Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves. The score {{had reached}} 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61, ending a partnership {{that had taken}} only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> out to bat. Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly. Hassett came in at 117/2 and Australia closed at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, and Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves. The score {{had reached}} 117 before Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The opening stand had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 6 pm {{late on the}} first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> out to bat. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Hassett came in at 117/2 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hit two hook shots from Hollies for four.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the {{overcast}} skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall {{blow to the}} shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease {{in less than an}} hour, and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement {{after the end of the}} series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> out to the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before shaking his hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large round of applause as he left the arena.|$|E
5|$|Making his Test {{debut at}} the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Craig became, {{at the age}} of 17years and 239days, the {{youngest}} ever Australian to play Test cricket. Australia batted first and Craig received a standing ovation from the 47,000-strong crowd <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> out to bat amid high expectations from the public. As South African captain Jack Cheetham stopped proceedings to set his field, the crowd jeered. Australia were comfortably positioned at 3/269 with Craig's partner Neil Harvey {{on his way to a}} double century. Craig cover drove his third ball, bowled by Percy Mansell, for four and quickly moved to 20. In an innings marked by leg glances and fine cuts, Craig progressed to 53 before the new ball was taken. He hit a ball into the covers and was caught, ending the 148-run partnership with Harvey and silencing the crowd. Australia collapsed and ended at 520 but still took a first innings lead of 85 runs. Craig top-scored in the second innings with 47, giving him exactly 100runs for the match as Australia collapsed to be all out for 209 and conceded defeat by six wickets. Given Bradman's Test average of 99.94, Craig's match aggregate prompted further press discussions of Bradmanesque similarities. However, his debut ended on a sour note as South Africa scored 4/297 to win by six wickets and level the series 2–2.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E

25|$|Pasarell won a titanic first set, 24–22, {{then with}} {{daylight}} fading, the 41-year-old Gonzales {{argued that the}} match should be suspended.

25|$|On 14 January 1921, {{during the}} Irish War of Independence, a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) {{sergeant}} was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Armagh.

25|$|Csonka claims that, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> {{away from}} the huddle, he told Pisarcik he would not take the ball if he went through with it.

25|$|Australia's brief second innings was paradoxically {{the time}} that England {{delivered}} {{some of the finest}} bowling of the series.
