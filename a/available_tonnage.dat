Construction and demolition waste (C & DW) was conservatively estimated {{to account for}} approximately 13. 1 percent of all waste produced in Ireland in 2004 (E P A, 2005 a). This was equal to 11. 2 million tonnes making it the second-highest waste producing It is recommended that the new audit tool and generated indicators be incorporated into a voluntary waste information system to facilitate the benchmarking of waste production on construction and demolition projects in Ireland sector behind agriculture. This estimate was based on construction and demolition waste collected and managed at licensed and permitted facilities throughout the country. There was no data available on construction and demolition waste production from Irish construction projects sites. An original audit tool was designed and tested on 58 construction projects throughout the country generating waste production indicators (kg/m 0) for new construction in 2005. These factors were applied to estimated construction output to benchmark national waste production in 2005. Two detailed surveys were also carried out to assess the management and collection of C&D W in 2005. A set of waste production indicators for new construction was produced: 70. 27 kg/m 2 for new residential construction. 86. 82 kg/m for new private non-residential construction. 138. 94 kg/m for new social infrastructure construction. 48. 48 kg/m 2 for new productive infrastructure construction. A compositional analysis identified inert waste (excluding excavated materials); wood; paper, plastics and packaging; and metals as the major contributors to the construction waste stream. The indicators were applied to construction output to produce a total national construction and demolition waste estimate of 20. 8 million tonnes for 2005. Construction and demolition waste accounted for 12. 3 million tonnes with soil and stones accounting for 8. 5 million tonnes (E P A, 2005 a).

500|$|In the interwar period, the Italian Navyalong {{with the}} rest of the major naval powerswas limited by the Washington Naval Treaty, which granted Italy parity with the French Navy. The Italians had [...] worth of {{battleship}} <b>tonnage</b> <b>available</b> for new vessels before they would reach their treaty limits, but they avoided new construction in the 1920s due to severe budgetary problems and to avoid a naval arms race with France. These financial limitations also forced the Italians to scrap Dante Alighieri in 1928. Nevertheless, the Regia Marina decided to make use of its excess tonnage by the early 1930s, which resulted in the four s. Two were finished early in World War II and were used extensively to escort convoys during the North African Campaign. The third ship, Roma, was finished in 1942, but was sunk in September 1943 by a German radio-controlled bomb when Italy surrendered to the Allies. The fourth ship, Impero, was never finished and was instead sunk by American bombers and scrapped after the end of the war. The two surviving ships, Littorio and Vittorio Veneto, were surrendered to the Allies and were later broken up for scrap. Of the surviving members of the Conte di Cavour class, Conte di Cavour was scrapped after the end of the war and Giulio Cesare was surrendered to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Only the two Andrea Doria-class battleships survived in Italian service for any significant length of time after the conclusion of hostilities; both served as training ships until the mid-1950s, when they too were broken up for scrap.|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explore the {{different}} factors that affect bulk storage of quarried stone and associated products {{in the day to}} day operation of a profitable business. Swedish stone producers must have accurate knowledge of available products throughout the year in order to provide customers appropriate requirements at the time of need. One difficulty in carrying stock piles of bulk stone products is allowing for variants, such as wind wastage, and water absorbing which have a direct effect on the <b>tonnage</b> <b>available.</b> Customers who order in bulk need to know the dry weight cost {{in order to get the}} correct value of material, and in the case of concrete suppliers, for instance, controlled mixing of their final product. Where volume purchases are the norm, the transport required must know the weight/volume to be safe and legal. The overall requirements then for a successful stone quarrying business are varied; in order to provide a service the range of products must fulfil the needs of customers, be able to control or understand the variations that affect their products as mentioned previously, the impact on density of particle size/density, H 2 O content, flakiness index and screening curve. Also the variations that take place when paper calculations differ from physical checks on stockpiles. In order to remain profitable and, successful, control of these factors will enable any stone quarrying enterprise to go forward successfully.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} largely on data that was accumulated during the execution of an exploration program by Iscor Ltd in the Northern Transvaal. The program included geological mapping, geophysical surveys and drilling, on Precambrian iron-formations in the Central Zone of the Limpopo Belt. The structure, stratigraphy, metamorphism, and economic importance of the magnetite quartzites and associated lithologies of the Moonlight prospect are discussed. The lithologies underlying the Moonlight prospect area consist of various pink- and grey-banded gneisses and pink granulite, together {{with a variety of}} metasedimentary supracrustal rock-types and concordant serpentinite bodies. The gneissic rock-types consist of chlorite-quartz-feldspar gneiss, chlorite-quartz-feldspar augen gneiss, hornblende-quartz-feldspar gneiss, biotite-quartz-feldspar gneiss, felsic and mafic granulite, and foliated amphibolite. The metasedimentary lithologies are represented by calc-silicates and marble, white quartz-feldspar granulite, magnetite quartzite, metaquartzite and garnet-bearing granulite and gneiss (metapelites). The concordant ultramafic bodies consist of serpentinite with lesser amphibolite, dunite, and chromitite. Intrusive pegmatites and diabase dykes are also present in the prospect area. Metamorphism reached granulite-facies, and more than one retrqgrade metamorphic event is recognized. Amphibolite-facies assemblages are present, but it is uncertain whether they represent another retrograde event. Polyphase deformation has produced intense and complex folding, resulting in irregular magnetite quartzite orebodies. The high metamorphic grades have resulted in medium- grained recrystallization of the magnetite-quartzites with a loss of prominent banding often associated with these rock-types. The magnetite quartzite occurs as three seperate but related ore zones, consisting of one or more ore-bands seperated by other lithologies. All three zones form poor outcrops and suboutcrops in a generally flat lying and sand covered area. · Although representing a low-grade iron ore (32 % total Fe), the magnetite quartzite deposits at Moonlight are regarded as potentially viable due to the large opencast <b>tonnages</b> <b>available</b> at low stripping ratios, and the relatively cheap and easy beneficiation process needed to produce a magnetite concentrate with 69 - 70 % total Fe...|$|R
40|$|A {{potential}} {{industrial process}} is profitable {{only if it}} is successfully implemented by the continuously developing chemical industry. Throughout last decades heterogeneous catalysis has opened doors to the creation of various know-how products which previously were considered unfeasible. Moreover, the use of heterogeneous catalysts allows improving existing processes to shift towards more ecological and cost efficient practices. In particular, polymer or fuel compounds could be eco-friendly produced from wood extractives, {{as an alternative to the}} conventional oil resources. This goal becomes even more attractive in light of the upcoming peak-oil. In the Nordic pulping industry turpentine is widely <b>available</b> as a <b>tonnage</b> by-product. Despite its interesting properties and promising application possibilities this fraction is commonly burned in the recovery boilers for energy. Although the chemical composition of turpentine depends strongly on the specific pulping process, α-pinene is the predominant compound and as such most studied. The general message of this thesis is the successful implementation of the heterogeneous catalysts in one-pot value-added upgrading of crude turpentine and specific terpenes, particularly α-pinene. Concepts allowing the production of fragrances, resins, plastics and pharmaceutical compounds are presented in the current study. Both commercial (Amberlyst 70) and self-prepared (Me/Al-SBA- 15 or TiO 2) catalysts were studied in several reactions including: acetoxylation, isomerization, dehydroisomerisation and oxidation. Both commercially purified α-pinene and crude thermo-mechanical turpentine were used as raw materials in the catalytic one-pot synthesis of value-added compounds. The experiments were performed in both batch and continuous reactor systems depending on the studied reaction. Successful results were obtained in case of several reactions. As an example, upon acetoxylation of α-pinene valuable fragrances – α-terpinyl and bornyl acetates – were produced with yields of 35 and 40 wt-%, respectively. Furthermore, in the dehydroisomerisation reaction of α-pinene, a yield of around 80 wt-% of an important fragrance, solvent and plastics precursor, ρ-cymene, was obtained. In the last case, thermo-mechanical turpentine was also successfully utilized. Still, some α-pinene oxidation tests leading to α-pinene oxide and verbenone fragrances were also carried out. Upon this study, further oxidation of ρ-cymene lead to the formation of ρ-methyl-acetophenone, a product essential for perfumery, pharmaceutical and pesticide industry as well as a potent polymer precursor. In addition, isomerization reactions were performed. Additionally, the catalytic materials were thoroughly characterized and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) and chemical-looping {{with oxygen}} uncoupling (CLOU) are combustion technologies where {{carbon dioxide is}} inherently obtained in pure form without any gas separation step. In the processes, fuel is introduced to the fuel reactor and combustion air is introduced to the air reactor. Circulating metal oxide particles transport oxygen from the air to the fuel reactor, and high purity CO 2 can be obtained after steam condensation. Some metal oxides {{have the ability to}} release oxygen to the gas phase, or so-called uncoupling properties, which may facilitate fuel conversion. The metal oxide, named oxygen carrier, is the cornerstone of the CLC process. Prior to this work, NiO was the benchmark oxygen carrier for gaseous fuels, like natural gas. However, the high cost, toxicity and thermodynamic limitation of Ni would likely make it difficult to up-scale a process using this type of oxygen carrier. Thus, the focus in this work is on oxygen carriers based on cheaper and more environmentally benign materials, i. e. combined manganese oxides and CuO-based oxygen carriers. Both of these types of oxygen carriers have the propensity to release gas phase oxygen in the fuel reactor, something which was deemed highly beneficial. The main focus is on the combined materials, and this work presents the first major screening of these types of oxygen carriers. All oxygen carriers were manufactured by the commercial spray-drying method and examined in a batch fluidized reactor system with respect to parameters important for chemical-looping. Several combined manganese oxide systems were investigated in this work, with the main focus on three rather promising systems: i) calcium manganites, ii) manganese-silica and iii) manganese with magnesium. For the first system, Ca-Mn-X-O (X= Fe, Ti and Mg), all materials had perovskite structure and performed very well. Clear oxygen uncoupling ability and full conversion of CH 4 were achieved in the batch testing. Adjusting the production parameters, i. e. calcination temperature, calcination time and milling time, the physical properties of the oxygen carrier can be enhanced. The oxygen carrier with molar composition CaMn 0. 775 Mg 0. 1 Ti 0. 125 O 3 -δ was produced by a wide range of Mn- and Ti-sources <b>available</b> commercially at <b>tonnage</b> scales. All materials showed similar oxygen uncoupling behaviour and had the perovskite structure. This shows that this type of oxygen carrier not only can be produced with cheap raw materials, but is simple to produce independent of the material source. Although the oxygen carriers based on Mn-Si-O had limited oxygen release at lower temperatures, there was a remarkable increase in release at temperatures above 950 C for particles with less than 45 wt% SiO 2. Similarly, the ability to convert CH 4 for these particles increased with temperature, and over 90 % combustion could be achieved at temperatures at and above 950 °C. The third promising system investigated was a combination of Mn and Mg oxides. In this system, the uncoupling reactions were more pronounced at 900 °C for the material with a molar ratio of Mn/Mg of one. Also, the methane conversion for some samples studied was high, making this material yet another interesting alternative. CuO-based materials with different support materials have a seemingly fast release rate of oxygen, approaching equilibrium at 900 °C. Most investigated materials had the ability to fully convert CH 4 at 925 °C at the experimental conditions. Some CuO-support combinations did not perform so well, for instance the Cu 36 FAl 24 sample due to formation of Cu 0. 95 Fe 1. 05 AlO 4. Several very promising oxygen carriers have been developed in this work. Some of them have been successfully tested in continuous operation at 120 kW scale. Further, the work has {{led to the development of}} calcium manganites ready to be up-scaled to large scale application. In addition to this, several other promising systems have been developed, which may not be ready for upscaling, but have great potential when optimized further...|$|R
