5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from Pomerania and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom he describes as a sadist. Despite essentially <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, a central figure in the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} embroiled leading European universities; the Qing dynasty's Kangxi Emperor {{and several}} popes (including Clement XI and Clement XIV) considered the case; {{the offices of}} the Holy See also intervened. Near the end of the 17th century, many Dominicans and Franciscans had shifted their positions in <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> the Jesuits' opinion, but Rome disagreed. Clement XI banned the rites in 1704. In 1742, Benedict XIV reaffirmed the ban and forbade debate.|$|E

Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign.

5|$|Editorially, the {{newspaper}} {{remained in the}} liberal Republican camp, both strongly anti-communist and supportive of civil rights. In April, 1963, the Tribune published Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail on its front page. The Tribune became a target of Barry Goldwater partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign. The leadership of the Tribune, while <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> Goldwater's approach to national defense, believed he pushed it to an extreme, and strongly opposed Goldwater's voting record on civil rights. After some internal debate, the Tribune endorsed Democrat Lyndon Johnson for the presidency that fall.

5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E

McCreary also changed his stance on the liquor question, now <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms their party platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself was that he would be a pawn of Beckham and his allies.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{species is}} P. lujiatunensis, {{found in the}} lowest beds of the Yixian Formation. Over 200 specimens attributed to this genus have been recovered from these and other beds of the Yixian, the age {{of which is the}} subject of much debate. Although many early studies using radiometric dating put the Yixian in the Jurassic Period, tens of millions of years outside of the expected temporal range of Psittacosaurus, most recent work dates it to the Early Cretaceous. Using argon-argon dating, a team of Chinese scientists dated the lowest beds in the formation to about 128mya, and the highest to approximately 122mya. A more recent Chinese study, using uranium-lead dating, suggests that the lower beds are younger, approximately 123.2mya, while <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> an age of 122mya for the upper beds.|$|E
5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. <b>Agreeing</b> <b>with</b> his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} did not accept the {{agreement}} and, on 30 April, relieved both Vietinghoff and his Chief of Staff, Generalleutnant Hans Röttiger, putting them at the disposition of the OKW for a possible court martial. They were replaced by General Friedrich Schulz and Generalmajor Friedrich Wenzel respectively. The next morning, 1 May, Röttinger reacted by placing both Schulz and Wenzel under arrest, and summoning Lemelsen to take Schulz's place. Lemelsen initially refused, {{as he was in}} possession of a written order from Kesselring which prohibited any talks with the enemy without his explicit authorization. By this time, Vietinghoff and Wolff had concluded an armistice with the Allied Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Theatre, Field Marshal Alexander, which became effective on 2 May at 14:00. Lemelsen reached Bolzano, and Schulz and Wenzel regained control, this time <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> the officers pushing for a quick surrender. The German armies in Italy were now utterly defeated by the Allies, who were rapidly advancing from Garmisch towards Innsbruck. Kesselring remained stubbornly opposed to the surrender, but was finally won over by Wolff on the late morning of 2 May after a two-hour phone call to Kesselring at his headquarters at Pullach.|$|E

5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending {{in their current}} budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to simply not spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> Beshear that Bevin did not have the authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E

Soon {{after the war ended}} in 1946, the town became the main hotspot for Malay nationalism in Malaya. Onn Jaafar, a local Malay politician who later became the Chief Minister of Johor, formed the United Malay National Organisation party on 11 May 1946 when the Malays expressed their widespread disenchantment over the British government's action for granting citizenship laws to non-Malays in the proposed states of the Malayan Union. An agreement over the policy was then reached in the town with Malays <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> the dominance of economy by the non-Malays and the Malays' dominance in political matters being agreed upon by non-Malays.

5|$|The station {{started to}} trial the {{co-firing}} of petcoke (petroleum coke) {{in one of}} its boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned to make the electricity more competitive as the price of running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment. The station can now burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.|$|E

5|$|While Bhattacharyya's view {{is mostly}} undisputed, some {{scholars}} such as S. Shankaranarayanan – the author of The Ten Great Cosmic Powers – attribute Chhinnamasta to Vedic (ancient Hindu) antecedents. Sukumari Bhattacharji, the author of The Indian Theogony, says that the Vedic goddess Nirrti's functions were inherited by later Hindu goddesses Kali, Chamunda, Karali, and Chhinnamasta. Hindu literature first mentions Chhinnamasta in the upapurana Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana (c.950CE) and the Devi-Bhagavata Purana (9th–12th century). ElisabethA. Benard, the author of Chinnamastā: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu Tantric Goddess, says that whatever her origins may be, {{it is clear that}} Chhinnamasta/Chinnamunda was known in the 9th century and worshipped by Mahasiddhas. Though essentially <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> Bhattacharyya's view, Karel R. vanKooij, former Professor of South Asian art history at Leiden University, goes further and associates the iconography of Chhinnamasta with the Tantric goddesses Varahi and Chamunda.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} historians {{to deal with}} the reign of Edward II – William Stubbs, Thomas Frederick Tout and James Conway Davies – added little to the {{understanding}} of Gaveston. While generally <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> the chronicles, they allotted him no importance within their own main field of interest, that of constitutional history. For later generations of historians, the focus shifted from constitutional to personal issues. From the 1970s onwards, the topic of study became the personal relations between magnates and the crown, and the distribution of patronage. It is to this school of thought that Hamilton's biography belongs, in which he argues that it was Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage that was {{the driving force behind the}} baronial animosity towards him. Chaplais, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the study of Gaveston and his place in the reign of Edward II. According to Chaplais, Edward was more or less indifferent to the practice of kingship, and essentially delegated the job to Gaveston. As an alternative to a homosexual relationship, Chaplais suggests that the bond that existed between the King and Gaveston was that of an adoptive brotherhood. This concept had a Biblical precedent in the traditionalist, platonic interpretation of the relationship between David and Jonathan, and also existed in the Middle Ages, as exemplified in The Song of Roland, the story of Roland and Olivier.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins and}} {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between the}} three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. A molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are {{more closely related to}} each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fishes. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split. Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl-origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories. The neobatrachians seemed to have originated in Africa/India, the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea. Other researchers, while <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> the main thrust of this study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. They proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the Permian, rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data. A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, {{came to the conclusion that}} Lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli. The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous, some 290 to 305 million years ago. The split between Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.|$|E
