40|$|Abstract- With {{the advance}} of high speed laser technology, optical {{interaction}} with microwave circuits has become highly viable. Such interaction is advantageous as the fiber is low-loss, lightweight, and immune to electromagnetic interference. In this paper, interaction of direct-modulated and gain-switched optical links with <b>active</b> <b>antenna</b> phased array <b>systems</b> is demonstrated. In the direct-modulated optical system, the RF signal directly modulates the DFB laser. In the gain-switched optical system, the laser is gain-switched {{to function as a}} RF frequency doubler. The modulated signal is transmitted via an optical fiber and recovered at the receiving end by a high-speed photodetector.

Through a set of diplexers, both receiver and transmitter modules use the shared feeds.

These features conflict, however, with the thermal and interconnecting issues that can arise in practical systems.

40|$|Virtual Sectorization (ViS) is {{proposed}} {{as a solution}} to cope with the exponential growth of data traffic in mobile networks. Through the use of an <b>Active</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>System</b> (AAS), two vertically separated beams (serving two distinct cells) are created within the original coverage area of a macro-cell. One of these cells, referred to as virtual cell, can be flexibly placed anywhere within the original coverage area because the large antenna array is capable of producing very narrow beams. The position of the virtual cell is done by choosing an electrical azimuth and downtilt such that the virtual cell’s footprint is as much as possible steered towards an area of relatively heavy traffic (a traffic hotspot). The key advantage of the approach is that, depending on the choice for deployment, either the spectrum or the transmit power is reused in the same geographical region, which provides an increase of traffic handling capacity. With an antenna beam directed to a specific area of high user density, more users can potentially benefit from better antenna gain and hence experience higher Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) values compared to the non-ViS case. However, the involved trade-offs make the deployment of ViS non-trivial. Using ViS implies a reduction of either transmit power or bandwidth for the macro-cell, and one additional interferer in the network, both of which can {{have a negative effect on}} performance if not addressed correctly. In order to cope with the complexity of these trade-offs, SON algorithms capable of dynamically share the spectrum or power resources between virtual and macro-cells, as the ones presented in this thesis work, are needed. The key functionality of these algorithms is to find an optimum configuration for the given resource sharing scheme which is able to maximize the network capacity while minimizing the aforementioned negative effects.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the analysis and development of an integrated receiver front-end module for high gain <b>active</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> at the K-band (20 GHz). In the design of conventional satellite receivers (such as reflector <b>antennas),</b> the <b>system</b> is usually specified by the gain/directivity, gain-to-temperature ratio (G/T) and radiation pattern requirements. The challenge in high gain <b>active</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> development, in addition to beam-forming/beam-steering requirements, is to develop transmit/receive modules which will meet the power, noise and radiation pattern requirements of the conventional antenna. In order to guarantee an optimal design, {{it is important to be}} able to translate the specifications from the system level to the transistor level. The focus is on the development of a single-channel CMOS-based integrated receiver module. The G/T requirement is analysed to derive the noise figure and gain specifications for the low noise amplifier(LNA). An LNA design in 65 nm CMOS is demonstrated to achieve a 2. 6 dB noise figure and uses only 7 mW of DC power. The digital phased shifter specifications are studied. The generation of "quantization lobes" is analysed and used to estimate the number of bits based on side-lobe level requirements. The design of a 5 -bit digital phase shifter based on quadrature signal modulation and a unique digital control logic is presented and tested at 20 GHz. The phase shifter is shown to achieve 10 dB input and output return loss between 16 - 21 GHz. The effect of pattern tapering on the side-lobe level is investigated and used to specify the minimum dynamic range for a variable gain amplifier (VGA). A VGA design is demonstrated to meet this dynamic range with low phase-frequency variation. A schematic level design of the proposed single-channel array is studied featuring a hybrid coupler and switch for polarisation requirements, as well as a low-voltage bandgap reference circuit. Simulations results verify that the receiver can be used to generate two hands of polarisation (right and left) with < 1. 1 dB axial ratio...|$|R
40|$|Vertical Sectorisation (VS) is {{a feature}} that {{exploits}} the capabilities of <b>Active</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>Systems</b> (AAS) to improve service performance and network capacity, by splitting a single cell into an inner and outer sector. The attained gains primarily depend on the suitable and timely (de) activation of VS {{in response to the}} observed/estimated traffic distribution within the cell, while further gains can be achieved by properly adjusting VS parameters such as the transmit power distribution. Considering a realistic LTE (Long Term Evolution) network environment, in this paper a SON (Self Organizing Network) algorithm is proposed and evaluated, which dynamically (de) activates the VS feature and sets the transmit power split. The results show that the (de) activation of VS through a suitably tuned SON algorithm achieves significant throughput gains, while the dynamic adaptation of the transmit power distribution is mostly beneficial when operating in interference-limited environments...|$|R
40|$|International audience—Vertical Sectorization (VS) {{consists}} in creating ver-tically separated sectors {{in the original}} cell using an <b>Active</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>Systems</b> (AAS) supporting two distinct beams with different downtilts. The total transmit power is split between the two sectors, while the frequency bandwidth can be reused by each sector, creating additional interference between the two sectors. For low traffic demand, VS may lead to performance degradation, while for high traffic demand in both sectors, VS is likely to bring about important capacity gains. Hence intelligent activation policy of VS is needed to fully benefit from this feature. In this paper, we propose an approach {{taking advantage of the}} more focused downtilted beam. A dynamic alpha fair bandwidth sharing is proposed for low and medium load. It is autonomously replaced by full bandwidth reuse for high load scenarios using a threshold-based controller. A flow-level dynamic simulator is used to numerically validate the proposed mechanisms...|$|R

A theoretical analysis as well as simulations are performed in orderto determine which quantities to look at when making the decision to apply sectorization. Based on the conclusions from these investigations, a self-optimizingalgorithm that only turns on sectorization when it increases network performanceis developed and evaluated. It is shown that large gains {{can be achieved by}} onlyturning on sectorization when the right conditions are met. Further, we show thatadditional gains can be seen if antenna parameters such as downtilt and distributionof transmission power between sectors are set properly.

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>Active</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>Systems</b> has {{provided}} new ways and features {{for increasing the}} capacity of mobile networks in order {{to cope with the}} ever increasing traffic demand. One such feature is the vertical sectorisation (VS) technique where a cell is divided into an inner and an outer sector by using a second downtilted beam from one antenna. The two sectors use the same spectrum resources but share the electrical power available. The limitation in available power per sector, raises the question whether there is gain in using VS, and if so, how much and under which circumstances. This paper presents some new numerical results on the performance gains of VS in a realistic LTE network environment, especially for the case of independent activation of the feature across cells in the network. We also present a framework for the design of a SON controller enabling the smart (de) activation of the feature based on the estimated/observed traffic distribution. The controller design follows two steps: first the functional form of the controller is derived based on analytical modelling, and then this functional form is calibrated using realistic measurements in a statistical learning fashion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>Systems</b> (AAS) {{technology}} {{is one of}} several advanced features that enable a mobile network operator to cost-efficiently increase its network capacity to cope with the exponential mobile data traffic growth and the ever more demanding performance requirements. AAS can be exploited to perform e. g. Virtual Sectorisation (ViS), i. e. using beamforming to flexibly position a virtual small cell within the service area of a macro-cell. In this paper we evaluate the performance/capacity potential of ViS in a realistic LTE (Long Term Evolution) network. We apply a planning-oriented approach for positioning virtual sectors, and develop and assess SON (Self-Organizing Networks) algorithms for the adaptive configuration of the ViS deployment. A key distinction herein is made between the cases of power sharing, where the virtual cell fully reuses the macro-cell's bandwidth and shares its transmit power; and bandwidth sharing, where the bandwidth is shared and the full transmit power is used in both cells. The results indicate that ViS offers a significant potential for performance/capacity improvement, with the highest gains observed for the case of bandwidth sharing, where it is further shown that the deployment of a SON algorithm to adapt the ViS configuration to time-varying traffic is essential to reliably achieve the potential gains. © 2016 IEEE...|$|R

Orthogonality of the transmitted waveforms is a requirement for allowing waveform separation at the receiver. In addition, signals with a large BT- product (e. g. coded signals) could be transmitted to achieve high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) due to pulse compression. This helps to radiate a larger amount of average power {{as a result of}} which range resolution (larger bandwidth) and detection capability improves.

The 8 -channel AWG block is developed on an FPGA platform. Besides the AWG, there are the RF and antenna blocks in the multi-channel transmitter. The synchronization of the multiple transmitters is the essential pre-requisite to develop the system. Similarly the individual channels of the system need to be characterized by measuring the errors within the system. The test-bed will be used as a platform for generating and testing different waveforms (binary codes, multi-phase codes, complementary waveforms, etc.) that can provide the radar with required resolutions in range, space, velocity. This could in turn be used to analyze these signals using their ambiguity function in case of space-time adaptive processing.

The proposed technique {{consists of a}} mechanical stabilization loop and a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm, {{which is based on}} electronic beamforming. Compared with other track-ing methods, the proposed method requires only one low-cost yaw rate sensor. The method utilizes electronic feedback from the phased-array antenna to compensate for the low-cost sensor irregularities. The effectiveness of the proposed tracking method is demonstrated by measured performance of a fast-moving ultra-low-profile phased-array satellite terminal, which uses the pro-posed approach. The field test results confirm that the hybrid tracking mechanism can nullify the base vehicle yaw disturbances up to 60 ◦/s and 85 ◦/s 2 and keep the azimuth angle error at less than the permissible bound of [− 1 ◦,+ 1 ◦]. Although performance of the proposed tracking system is verified {{in the context of a}} mobile satellite television reception system, the basic principles can be applied to any tracking system that employs phased-array antennas.
