5|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> {{medications}} {{are under}} study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. Canakinumab {{may result in}} better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Less antigenic versions are in development.|$|E

5|$|Although {{deregulation}} itself {{took place}} in October 1986, Kelvin received permission to introduce its new routes from 31 August. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> services were started in competition with Strathclyde Buses, running from Glasgow to Clydebank, Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Springburn. Strathclyde responded by extending its services into Clydebank, Cumbernauld, Dumbarton, Kirkintilloch and Milngavie.|$|E

5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is known of two of these men, {{and it is difficult}} to determine which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|In July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, playing <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> songs. They and Godrich {{recorded}} {{most of the}} {{new material}} in two weeks in a Los Angeles studio, {{with the rest of the}} album recorded in Oxford into the next year. The band described the recording process as relaxed, in contrast to the tense sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosthetic}} implant used in {{hip replacement}} {{consists of three}} parts: the acetabular cup, the femoral component, and the articular interface. Options exist for different people and indications. The evidence for <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> devices is not very good, including: ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, modular femoral necks, and uncemented monoblock cups. Correct selection of the prosthesis is important.|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{efficient}} <b>new</b> algorithms {{for generating}} digital pseudonoise are presented. The algorithms are efficient because <b>a</b> large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> pseudorandom bits are generated at each iteration {{of a computer}} implementation or at each clock pulse of a hardware implementation. The maximal-length shift register sequences obtained have good randomness properties. Some of the properties of p-n sequences are reviewed {{and the results of}} an extensive statistical evaluation of the pseudonoise are presented...|$|R

50|$|Chemically {{it is an}} {{aromatic}} heterocycle di-N-oxide. Its full {{chemical name}} is 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4 dioxide. Originally it was prepared in a program screening for new herbicides in 1972. Its clinical use was first described by Zeman et al. in 1986. While tirapazamine has had only limited effectiveness in clinical trials, {{it has been used}} as a lead compound to develop <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> compounds with improved anti-cancer properties.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> {{crossings}} {{have been}} proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry crossing in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council suggest that this crossing will be essential for managing congestion. A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017, though Highways England {{do not expect to}} start construction before 2026.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> sects {{appeared}} in Japan in the 12th and 13th centuries {{as a natural}} reaction to the difficult teachings of older schools and partially motivated by the notion of mappō. Growing out of an Amida cult, the Jōdo Shinshū Pure Land school was founded in 1224 by Shinran, and attracted a following from all classes and occupations. Three years later, Dōgen introduced the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism emphasizing meditation and dharma practice. The first truly Japanese school of Buddhism goes back to Nichiren's proclamation of his teachings in 1253. Nichiren Buddhism was exceptional for being militant and intolerant. The central focus of Nichiren's teaching was the veneration of the Lotus Sutra.|$|E
5|$|Abramson was {{a leading}} {{architect}} of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the Manhattan Jewish Center (1918), {{as well as the}} Brooklyn Jewish Center, the Flatbush Jewish Center, and the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush Jewish Center has been completely remodeled, the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood Jewish Center, and the Brooklyn Jewish Center in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish Center, stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans. The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood Center, and that the Building Committee completed them, in order to save money.|$|E
2500|$|These areas {{include some}} neighborhoods from the 1950s and earlier, {{as well as}} <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> subdivisions built {{as part of the}} urban sprawl that saw nearby Mason grow tremendously. Unlike Mason and other suburbs closer to Interstate 71 and Interstate 75, Loveland is {{considered}} somewhat of a [...] "bedroom community", where residential neighborhoods (and churches) seemingly outnumber businesses, and many residents make the half-hour commute to Downtown Cincinnati for work each day.|$|R
50|$|Dry-season {{cultivation}} in empty streambeds {{is practiced}} {{largely on the}} western coast and in the southwest and is called baiboho. The crops are sown after the last rising of the waters during the rainy seasons, and after the harvest fresh alluvial deposits naturally replenish the soil. Lima beans (also known as Cape peas) are raised by this system on the Mangoky River system delta, along with tobacco and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> crops.|$|R

5|$|Both the Grammar School and High School co-existed as {{voluntary}} aided schools until 1970 {{when they}} merged to become co-educational, with the Grammar School {{moving into the}} North Brink High School site under headmaster Dr. D.S. Anderson. Relations between the schools had always been close; the amalgamation had been planned for some time, and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> laboratories and classrooms had already been under construction on the North Brink site before the two schools merged. The school magazine Riverline {{was first published in}} 1971.|$|E
5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Glenn Moule, Joel Stein, and Juanita Stein {{formed the}} pop rock group Waikiki. 1:26, b 1:58}} They toured the Australian eastern {{states as a}} trio and {{released}} an EP, Presents, in 2000. In 2002, with a rhythm guitarist, they issued the Top50 album I'm Already Home. With four members, the band then toured Australia and New Zealand. Shortly thereafter, Brendan Picchio joined Waikiki as a bassist, and Juanita switched to rhythm guitar. The group soon became dissatisfied with its material, so the members chose a new direction for their music. They wrote <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> songs and made a wish list of producers with whom {{they would like to}} work. In 2004, the band changed its name to Howling Bells, as its members felt that phrase better embodied its newly adapted indie rock style.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evidence}} of bias [...] weakens {{the findings of}} our original meta-analysis.
