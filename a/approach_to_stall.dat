25|$|The Dutch Safety Board {{stated that}} the {{approach}} was not stabilized so the crew should have initiated a go around. The autopilot followed the glide slope while the autothrottle reduced thrust to idle due to a faulty radio altimeter showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the pitch attitude to increase all unnoticed by the crew until the stick shaker activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the glide slope from above and this obscured the erroneous autothrottle mode and increased the crew’s workload. The subsequent <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>stall</b> recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|E

40|$|With some {{airplanes}} the <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the <b>stall</b> {{is accompanied}} by changes in the behavior, such as tail buffeting or changes in the control characteristics of the airplane so that the pilot obtains a warning of the impending stall. Vith other airplanes it is possible <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> the <b>stall</b> without any perceptible warning other than {{the reading of the}} air-speed meter, in which case the danger of inadvertent stalling is considerably greater. Although it is not within the scope of this paper <b>to</b> discuss <b>stalling</b> characteristics, it is desired to point out that in general the danger of inadvertent stalling is greatest with those airplanes that behave worse when the stalling occurs; that is, with airplanes in which the stall starts at the wing tips.

In this paper we present several stall recovery guidance algorithms, which are implemented in the background without interfering with flight control system and altering the pilot's actions. They are using input and state constrained control methods to generate guidance signals, which are provided to the pilot in the form of visual cues. It is the pilot's decision to follow these signals. The algorithms are validated in the pilot-in-the loop medium fidelity simulation experiment...|$|E

40|$|Aerodynamic {{stability}} {{is a fundamental}} limit in the compressor design process. The development of robust techniques for increasing stability has several benefits: enabling higher loading and fewer blades, increasing safety throughout a mission, increasing tolerance to stage mismatch during part-speed operation and speed transients, and providing an opportunity to match stages at the compressor maximum efficiency point, thus reducing fuel burn. Mass injection upstream of {{the tip of a}} high-speed axial compressor rotor is a stability enhancement approach known to be effective in suppressing stall in tip-critical rotors if the injection is activated before stall occurs. This <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>stall</b> suppression requires that a reliable stall warning system be available. Tests have recently been performed to assess whether steady injection {{can also be used to}} recover from fully developed stall. If mass injection is effective in recovering from stall quickly enough to avoid structural damage or loss of engine power, then a stall warning system may not be required. The stall recovery tests were performed on a transonic compressor rotor at its design tip speed of 1475 ft/sec using four injectors evenly spaced around the compressor case upstream of the rotor. The injectors were connected to an external air source. In an actual engine application, the injected air would be supplied with compressor bleed air. The injectors were isolated from the air source by a fast-acting butterfly valve. With the injectors turned off, the compressor was throttled into stall. Air injection was then activated with no change in throttle setting by opening the butterfly valve. The compressor recovered from stall at a fixed throttle setting with the aid of tip injection. The unsteady operating characteristic of the rotor was measured during these tests using high-response pressure sensors located upstream and downstream of the rotor. The figure shows the results, where the unsteady pressure and mass flow are superimposed on the steady operating characteristic. The total injected mass flow was equal to 1. 3 percent of the compressor flow. The solid line with no solid squares on it denotes the operating point during the beginning of throttle closure and the initial drop into stall. The gray traces denote the operating point during an additional throttle closure that occurred over the next 1200 rotor revolutions (4 sec). The dashed line denotes the recovery from stall that occurred during 90 rotor revolutions (0. 3 sec) after the injectors were activated with no change in throttle setting. Tip injection not only recovers the compressor from stall, but also restores the compressor to its pre-stall level of pressure rise. In contrast, standard stall recovery schemes such as compressor bleed, stator vane actuation, or engine throttle modulation result in a loss of pressure rise across the compressor, which results in a loss of engine power...|$|E

Blade surface pressure measurements were also preformed at mid span on the blades at various Reynolds numbers.

A correlation between the experimental results and computational fluid dynamic predictions was attempted in order to determine the exact nature of the flow as the blades <b>approached</b> <b>stall,</b> <b>to</b> further assist in the development of advanced blade design.

40|$|Riparian {{vegetation}} may recover {{quickly from}} disturbance when the disturbance vector is removed or reduced. Grazing is a disturbance that removes plant biomass through herbivory, while overgrazing {{is a more}} severe disturbance that can deplete plant propagule pools and inhibit plant community recovery. We tested the hypothesis that riparian vegetation communities can shift quickly from ruderal grasslands to hydrophytic shrubs and graminoids when grazing is largely eliminated from riparian areas. We used a before-after-control study design to collect vegetation community data at six restored reaches and two grazed control reaches prior to and immediately following {{the construction of a}} cattle exclosure. We identified trends in Carex and Salix species abundance and quantified shifts in riparian vegetation community composition across time at each reach using PERMANOVA, multi-level pattern analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Vegetation composition changed rapidly in the four years following removal of grazing disturbance. Indicator species for all impact reaches shifted away from grazing tolerant graminoids and forbs, and toward hydrophytic graminoid and shrub species. Over the same timespan control reach indicator species remained grazing-tolerant graminoids and forbs. There was little change in Salix abundance over time at control or impact reaches but Carex abundance increased at restored reaches. We conclude that herbaceous plant communities may recover rapidly following the removal of grazing disturbance, but that woody species may lag in recovery without active vegetation manipulation. We postulate that low woody-species recruitment may affect the potential of the riparian zone to quickly shade stream channels and facilitate undercut bank formation, common riparian restoration objectives. To prevent halted riparian succession, designers should proactively identify potential limitations to woody vegetation colonization. We close discussing active <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> overcome <b>stalled</b> riparian ecosystem development and suggest metrics for assessing woody species recovery.

50|$|The Sabre {{dance is}} the name given to pitch-up, a {{particularly}} dangerous behaviour of swept wings, which became apparent during {{the development of the}} USAF F-100 Super Sabre. When a swept wing starts <b>to</b> <b>stall,</b> the outermost portions tend <b>to</b> <b>stall</b> first. Since these portions are behind the center of lift, the overall lift force moves forward, pitching the nose of the aircraft upwards. This leads to a higher angle of attack and causes more of the wing <b>to</b> <b>stall,</b> which exacerbates the problem. The pilot often loses control, with fatal results at low altitude because there was insufficient time for the pilot to regain control or eject before hitting the ground. A large number of aircraft were lost to this phenomenon during landing, which left aircraft tumbling onto the runway, often in flames.|$|R
