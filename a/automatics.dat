25|$|Replacing the old Dynaflow-based {{two-speed}} {{automatic transmission}} were two new Super Turbine <b>automatics.</b> The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available {{with the standard}} two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine {{as well as the}} 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed manual was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.|$|E
40|$|We study definability and {{complexity}} issues for <b>automatic</b> and #-automatic structures.

25|$|The FJ cruiser was {{primarily}} {{developed for the}} North American market but has been sold in small numbers globally since its launch. On 25 November 2010, Toyota announced sales would begin in right-hand drive form for the Japanese market.

Japanese-produced right-hand drive models have a different rear bumper to North American models with the license plate located on the bumper as opposed to under the tailgate door handle. In addition, right-hand drive versions have the side indicator markers located on the fender panels, rather than located on the side-view mirrors used for left-hand drive production FJ Cruisers.

25|$|By November, 1990, the 52/55hp (carbureted/EPI) non-turbo F6A SOHC 4-valve engine became {{available}}, {{available in}} {{a whole range of}} versions: M as three- or five-door (later only five), with manual or automatic transmissions and FWD or 4WD, a sportier S only as a three-door, and the luxurious L only as a five-door with the more powerful EPI engine - which also appeared in 4WDs equipped with <b>automatics.</b> In September 1991 the range was revised, receiving side impact protection and a high mounted brakelight. Since these were considered structural changes the car received a new set of model codes, becoming the CN22S/CP22S/CN32S/CP32S. The SR-Four now came with all-around disc brakes while the S-Turbo was discontinued. An FWD automatic MC version joined the range at the lower end, equipped with a column-mounted shifter. Other special versions abounded, with the luxurious F-Limited EPI 3-door joining in December 1991 and the somewhat cheaper, carbureted M Selection in April 1992. In July of that year, the 3-door, automatic only S Selection managed to find a slot in a pricelist now comprising a faintly ridiculous 27 variants. This didn't hinder Suzuki from adding more versions, the well-equipped LoFt (sic), in June 1994 and the A in April of that year.|$|E
