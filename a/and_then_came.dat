In the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June he finished second to Daliapour <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>came</b> fifth of the eight runners behind Giant's Causeway in the Eclipse Stakes. He was then sent to Ascot for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, where he finished second, reversing the Epsom form with Daliapour, but having no chance against the favourite Montjeu.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium {{was home}} to a rare {{baseball}} occurrence on August 6 and August 7, 1988, when Nashville and Indianapolis exchanged no-hitters on back-to-back nights. First, Indianapolis' Randy Johnson and Pat Pacillo combined for a no-hit loss against the Sounds, a 1–0Nashville win. That game was won by Nashville when Lenny Harris walked to first base, stole second base, stole third base, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>came</b> home, scoring on a groundout. The next night, Nashville's Jack Armstrong pitched a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0Sounds victory. This {{was the first time}} in American Association history that teams played in back-to-back no-hit games, and was the third no-hitter in Sounds franchise history.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré {{explained}} and demonstrated the instrument, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>came</b> back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a letter of recommendation from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ.|$|E
5|$|On August 5, 2007, {{during the}} Firestone Indy 400, Foyt was {{involved}} in a spectacular seven-car crash in which Dario Franchitti's car was sent airborne <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>came</b> down on Foyt's car. While Foyt was uninjured, Franchitti's car left visible tire marks on Foyt's helmet. Foyt's crew was able to repair the car and get him back on the track where he completed enough laps to secure an 8th-place finish. The following week at the Meijer Indy 300, Foyt's crew gave him great pit stops which allowed him to take to lead with 10 laps remaining. Even though Foyt was passed a few laps later by Tony Kanaan and Scott Dixon, he managed to hold {{on the rest of the}} way and drive to a career-best 3rd-place finish, the first Top-5 finish of his career. It was also the best finish in Vision Racing's team history, tying Tomas Scheckter's 3rd-place finish at the Milwaukee Mile in 2006.|$|E

Doughty scored 20 and put on 75 for the ninth wicket with Brian Langford, who made 56.

25|$|It was {{realized}} that activity was somehow linked to instability in solution <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>came</b> {{to the conclusion}} that the cyclic sulfenamides, formed in acidic conditions, were the active principle of the PPIs. Finally, it was understood that seemingly small alterations in the backbone of timoprazole led nowhere, and focus had to be centered on the substituents on the backbone. However, necessary intramolecular rearrangement of the benzimidazole into sulfenamide posed severe geometric constraints. Optimal compounds would be those that were stable at neutral pH but were quickly activated at low pH.|$|E
25|$|Their bowling {{was seen}} as their weakness, and indeed {{a lot of changes}} were made to the bowling attack {{throughout}} the series. It worked for the last match of the series, when Australia were kept to under 250 runs in both of their innings, but none of the bowlers - bar seam bowler Dick Pollard, who took 25 wickets in his four matches - were very consistent, or indeed selected with any regularity. George Pope took eight wickets in the second match, only to miss the third, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>came</b> back to take six in the fourth match.|$|E
