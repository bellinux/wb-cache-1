25|$|An Internet forum, or message board, is {{an online}} {{discussion}} site {{where people can}} hold conversations {{in the form of}} posted messages. They differ from chat rooms in that messages are often longer than one line of text, and are at least temporarily archived. Also, depending on the <b>access</b> <b>level</b> of a user or the forum set-up, a posted message might need to be approved by a moderator before it becomes visible.|$|E
25|$|Paris-based Montparnasse 56 Group (M56) {{announced}} in 2014 {{that it would}} open an observation deck on the 57th floor of One Liberty Place. The One Liberty Observation Deck, also called Philly from the Top, {{opened to the public}} on November 28, 2015. The observation deck is fully enclosed and offers 360-degree panoramic views of the city from 883 feet above street level, which is the highest public <b>access</b> <b>level</b> in Philadelphia as of 2016.|$|E
25|$|Level 1 of the {{terminal}} contains baggage carousels and ground transportation <b>access.</b> <b>Level</b> 2 contains ticketing/check-in, shopping and dining, {{and access to the}} concourses. The airport currently has two immigration and customs facilities (FIS), located in Concourse D, Level 3 and in Concourse J, Level 3. The Concourse D FIS can be utilized by flights arriving at all gates in Concourse E and all gates in Concourses D and some gates in Concourse F. The Concourse J FIS can be utilized by flights arriving at all gates in Concourse J and most gates in Concourse H. However, all gates in Concourse G and some gates in Concourses F and H, do not have the facilities to route passengers to any FIS, and therefore can only be used for domestic arrivals. MIA is unique among American airports in that all of its facilities are common-use, meaning that they are assigned by the airport and no one airline holds ownership or leases on any terminal space or gates, thus giving the airport much more flexibility in terminal and gate assignments and allowing it to make full use of existing facilities. The entire airport became common-use by the 1990s.|$|E

The <b>Access</b> <b>level</b> comes with black bumpers and power steering, and {{is available}} only with the 1.2-liter engine. Ambiance has body-colored bumpers, wheel covers, Eco mode function, power lock doors, front power windows or CD player, and as options there are metallic paint, fog lights and air conditioning. Laureate adds body-colored door handles, fog lights as standard and trip computer, and additionally can be ordered with metallic paint, Media Nav system, leather upholstery, parking sensors, cruise control or alloy wheels.

2500|$|Another {{even lower}} <b>access</b> <b>level</b> was driven between 1854 and 1868 {{from a point}} just above the Smelt Mill, {{near the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, [...] lower than the Low Level. This was the Lucy Tongue Level (often {{referred}} to as the Lucy Level) which later became the main entrance to the mine until it closed in 1962. The level was driven northwards following the Lucy Tongue fault, but progress was very slow. Then the miners encountered the Clay Vein, a strong barren vein with a soft clay filling, and followed it to the west. While the soft sides and fragile roof needed supporting in places with stone arches, progress was much quicker. Finally they turned north-west through solid rock, to reach the Greenside Vein [...] from the entrance, and five years ahead of schedule.|$|E
2500|$|Google Drive {{incorporates}} {{a system of}} file sharing in which the creator of a file or folder is, by default, its owner. The owner can regulate the public visibility of the file or folder. Ownership is transferable. Files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a Google account, using their @gmail.com email addresses. Sharing files with users not having a Google account requires making them accessible to [...] "anybody with the link". This generates a secret URL for the file, which may be shared via email or private messages. Files and folders can also be made [...] "public on the web", {{which means that they}} can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone. The owner may also set an <b>access</b> <b>level</b> for regulating permissions. The three access levels offered are [...] "can edit", [...] "can comment" [...] and [...] "can view".

50|$|In {{computer}} science and computer programming, <b>access</b> <b>level</b> denotes {{the set of}} permissions or restrictions provided to a data type. Reducing <b>access</b> <b>level</b> is an effective method for limiting failure modes, debugging time and overall system complexity. It restricts variable modification to only the methods defined within the interface to the class. Thus, it is incorporated into many fundamental software design patterns. In general, a given object cannot be created, read, updated or deleted by any function without having a sufficient <b>access</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} each level, {{the player}} {{was given a}} password to <b>access</b> that <b>level</b> at a later time.

50|$|Every {{database}} has {{an access}} control list (ACL) that specifies the level of access a user or a server can have to that database. A user's <b>access</b> <b>level</b> determines what tasks {{he or she can}} perform in the database. A server's <b>access</b> <b>level</b> determines what information the server can replicate. The names of access levels are the same for users and servers. Only a user with Manager access can create or modify the ACL. To set an ACL, the Manager selects the <b>access</b> <b>level,</b> user type, and <b>access</b> <b>level</b> privileges for each user or group in a database. Default entries in the ACL can be set when the Manager creates the database. The manager can also assign roles if the database designer determines this level of access refinement is needed by the application; for instance, when users within the same group must be provided different levels of access.|$|E

5000|$|Players {{are rewarded}} with AP (Action Points) for actions within the game.

The <b>access</b> <b>levels</b> are numbered 1 through 16, with 16 being the highest. Because more AP are awarded for taking over enemy portals than for maintaining your own team's, {{if a player}} is outnumbered {{by members of the}} other team, they will accumulate AP at a faster rate as a way of leveling the playing field.|$|R

50|$|In an {{emergency}} situation, the mobile network operator can implement ACCOLC onto specific mobile cell sites (that cover {{the area of}} the required restriction). Most systems allow the operator to allow/restrict specific <b>Access</b> Class <b>levels</b> to gain <b>access</b> to the cell sites. The customer's SIM card is provisioned with an <b>Access</b> Class <b>level</b> between 0 and 15. Most SIM cards will be coded with a random <b>access</b> class <b>level</b> between 0 and 9. For special case mobile customers - e.g. emergency services, government officials, civil defence, etc. they will be issued with a SIM card with a high access class value (between 10 and 15).When the mobile operator needs to implement ACCOLC restriction, they will update the configuration on the specified cell sites. The access class value is a field that is transmitted in the broadcast channel of the cell. Under normal conditions, <b>access</b> class <b>levels</b> 0 - 15 are allowed. The SIM card compares what is allowed to its own <b>access</b> class <b>level.</b> If the allowed <b>access</b> class <b>levels</b> being broadcast by the cell site does not match what is on the SIM card, then the mobile device cannot access that cell - for any services.|$|R
