25|$|In Reconstruction-era United States, {{sharecropping}} {{was one of}} {{few options}} for penniless freedmen to support themselves and their families.

500|$|In October {{that year}} Morris sold The Anvil—by then selling about 3,560copies monthly—for £1,250, plus a £200 <b>annual</b> <b>contract</b> to {{continue}} as editor. [...] Morris wanted to produce a comic the pages {{of which would be}} filled with role models whose behaviour and moral outlook he felt was socially desirable. [...] Foreigners would not be depicted as either enemies or villains, and at least one child in any group of children would be from an ethnic minority. [...] Religious values would not be imposed upon the reader, although their underlying moral tones would be made obvious on each page. [...] These were innovative but somewhat risky ideas, as nothing similar existed in the market, [...] and Hulton therefore commissioned extensive research into the new comic, which by then, inspired by the design of her church lectern, had been christened Eagle by Hampson's wife. [...] Layout and typography were designed by Morris's friend, Ruari McLean, assisted by Charles Green, and faced with an initial print run of 1million copies, Aintree printer Eric Bemrose designed and built a new ten-unit rotogravure machine in about twelve weeks. [...] The comic was heavily publicised before its release; copies were mailed direct to several hundred thousand people who worked with children, and a [...] "Hunt the Eagle" [...] scheme was launched, whereby large papier-mâché golden eagles were set on top of several Humber Hawk cars, and toured across the UK. [...] Those who spotted an eagle were offered tokens worth 3d, which could be exchanged at newsagents for a free copy of Eagle.|$|E
