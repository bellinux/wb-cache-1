Promjene koje su našli u stupnju potiskivanja alfa-valova, tumače autori suprotnim djelovanjem različitih faktora, među kojima su najvažniji vježba i umor. The {{problem the}} authors desired to solve was to {{determine}} how prolonged mental work influences the alpha-waves of the brain. This problem is not new and much research work was been done in connection with it. However, the relation between mental work and brain waves has by far not been precisely established because {{the results of the}} different examinations were contradictory. The authors have recorded brain waves of the parietal-occipital part of the left hemisphere by means of an electroencephalograph (type Grass). The recording was bipolar. The fluctuations of the brain potentials m S subjects were measured continuously: before, during and after mental work, consisting in adding pairs of two-digit numerals read out to them during one hour. The subject was able to signalize with one of the channels the moment when he completed the addition so that he was immediately given another addition. In computing the results the so-called <b>alpha-index</b> was taken into account (i. e. percentual relation between clearly perceptible alpha-waves and all waves registered within a period of lime). The <b>alpha-index</b> was investigated also in tile stage of the so-called »blocks« i. e. in additions lasting twice or more as long as the average of all additions. The results showed that the <b>alpha-index</b> rapidly decreased at the beginning of mental work, its rate of decrease diminishing gradually with the progress of work: towards the end of mental work, a tendency of increasing of <b>alpha-index</b> was noticeable. After the end of the work the <b>alpha-index</b> rose again. Individual differences between various subjects have been noticed, especially with regard to the degree of depression of alpha-waves during mental work. In respect of blocks, their number increased on the average in the beginning and then stabilized. The <b>alpha-index</b> in blocks showed no significant differences from the general <b>alpha-index</b> during mental work. The authors try lo explain the average curve of the changes of the <b>alpha-index</b> during mental work by means of the antagonistic influence of two factors: exercise and fatigue. After the initial fall caused by mental strain and emotional disturbance, the <b>alpha-index</b> - {{under the influence of the}} exercise - has the tendency of rising; however, the fatigue, increasing during work, causes the fall of the <b>alpha-index.</b> The curve thus obtained is a result of the interaction of those two factors. This interpretation is sup-ported by the authors 2 ̆ 7 experience with some of the subjects tested, in whom the <b>alpha-index</b> showed during the second experiment a continuous rise after the initial fall, because the work by then represented a minor strain and the technique of the work became somewhat automatic. On the other hand, in another case the <b>alpha-index</b> decreased right down to the cud of the work because the subject got very tired by the experiment. The authors point out that the above results and their interpretation represent only the first stage in the systematic research of the influence of mental work on the alpha-rhythm. New experiments, now in progress, are to fill up various gaps and give more information on the influence of exercise and fatigue on alpha-waves, not only in regard to their depression, but also to their amplitude...|$|E
40|$|Influence {{at health}} {{run on the}} {{functional}} state of brain of students is considered. Three basic parameters of alpha-rhythm were analysed: frequency, amplitude <b>alpha-index.</b> Researches are conducted on 32 students (men) in age 18 - 22, practically healthy. From them there are 16 persons - engaged in the health hurrying and 16 - not engaged in the health hurrying. In a state of rest is written down base-line and reactive electroencephalogram. Estimation of parameters of alpha-rhythm and their dynamic descriptions is utillized for diagnostics of the functional state of central nervous system. Reliable differences are set between the groups of students on the indexes of frequency and amplitude of alpha-rhythm which specifies on the decline of power processes of brain and testifies to development of processes of economy. Differences between groups on the indexes of <b>alpha-index</b> carry unreliable character that testifies to the identical level of activating of central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} direct {{measurement}} of the mean halo occupation distribution (HOD) of galaxies taken from the eleventh data release (DR 11) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Survey (BOSS). The HOD of BOSS low-redshift (LOWZ: 0. 2 < z < 0. 4) and Constant-Mass (CMASS: 0. 43 < z < 0. 7) galaxies is inferred via their association with the dark-matter halos of 174 X-ray-selected galaxy clusters drawn from the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS). Halo masses are determined for each galaxy cluster based on X-ray temperature measurements, and range between log 10 (M 180 /M&sun;) = 13 - 15. Our directly-measured HODs {{are consistent with the}} HOD-model fits inferred via the galaxy-clustering analyses of Parejko et al. (2013) for the BOSS LOWZ sample and White et al. (2011) for the BOSS CMASS sample. Under the simplifying assumption that the other parameters that describe the HOD hold the values measured by these authors, we have determined a best-fit <b>alpha-index</b> of 0. 91 ± 0. 08 and 1. 27 ^{+ 0. 03 }_{- 0. 04 } for the CMASS and LOWZ HOD, respectively. These <b>alpha-index</b> values are consistent with those measured by White et al. (2011) and Parejko et al. (2013). In summary, our study provides independent support for the HOD-models assumed during the development of the BOSS mock-galaxy catalogues that have subsequently been used to derive BOSS cosmological constraints...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} if {{changes in}} athletes' physical fitness due to seasonal training {{are associated with}} changes in cardiovascular autonomic control, nine swimmers (three males and six females; aged 14 - 18 years) were evaluated before and after 5 months of training and competitions. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and ventilatory threshold were determined during a maximal test; heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) variabilities' power spectra were calculated at rest (supine and sitting positions) and in the recovery of two exercises at 25 and 80 % pre-training VO 2 max. At {{the end of the}} season: (a) VO 2 max and ventilatory threshold increased respectively by 12 and 34 % (P< 0. 05); (b) at rest, HR decreased by 9 b min(- 1) in both body positions, whereas BP decreased in supine position only by 17 %. No change in low frequency (LF, 0. 04 - 0. 15 Hz) and high frequency (HF, 0. 15 - 1. 5 Hz) normalized powers and in LF/HF ratio of HR variability and in LF power of systolic BP variability was observed. In contrast, a significant increase in HF <b>alpha-index</b> (about 12 ms mmHg(- 1)) was found; (c) during recovery no change in any parameter was observed. Seasonal training improved exercise capacity and decreased resting cardiovascular parameters, but did not modify vagal and sympathetic spectral markers. The increase in <b>alpha-index</b> observed at rest after the season and expression of augmented baroreflex sensibility indicated however that HR vagal control could have been enhanced by seasonal training. These findings suggested that autonomic system might {{have played a role in}} short-term adaptation to training...|$|E

40|$|Ranking {{groups of}} {{researchers}} {{is important in}} several contexts and can serve many purposes such as the fair distribution of grants based on the scientist's publication output, concession of research projects, classification of journal editorial boards and many other applications in a social context. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the performance of groups of researchers. The proposed method is called <b>alpha-index</b> and {{it is based on}} two parameters: (i) the homogeneity of the h-indexes of the researchers in the group; and (ii) the h-group, which is an extension of the h-index for groups. Our method integrates the concepts of homogeneity and absolute value of the h-index into a single measure which is appropriate for the evaluation of groups. We report on experiments that assess computer science conferences based on the h-indexes of their program committee members. Our results are similar to a manual classification scheme adopted by a research agency...|$|E
40|$|Covertly {{directing}} visual attention {{toward a}} spatial {{location in the}} absence of visual stimulation enhances future visual processing at the attended position. The neuronal correlates of these attention shifts involve modulation of neuronal "baseline" activity in early visual areas, presumably through top-down control from higher-order attentional systems. We used electroencephalography to study the largely unknown relationship between these neuronal modulations and behavioral outcome in an attention orienting paradigm. Covert visuospatial attention shifts to either a left or right peripheral position {{in the absence of}} visual stimulation resulted in differential modulations of oscillatory alpha-band (8 - 14 Hz) activity over left versus right posterior sites. These changes were driven by varying degrees of alpha-decreases being maximal contralateral to the attended position. When expressed as a lateralization index, these alpha-changes differed significantly between attention conditions, with negative values (alpha_right < alpha_left) indexing leftward and more positive values (alpha_left < or = alpha_right) indexing rightward attention. Moreover, this index appeared deterministic for processing of forthcoming visual targets. Collapsed over trials, there was an advantage for left target processing in accordance with an overall negative bias in <b>alpha-index</b> values. Across trials, left targets were detected most rapidly when preceded by negative index values. Detection of right targets was fastest in trials with most positive values. Our data indicate that collateral modulations of posterior alpha-activity, the momentary bias of visuospatial attention, and imminent visual processing are linked. They suggest that the momentary direction of attention, predicting spatial biases in imminent visual processing, can be estimated from a lateralization index of posterior alpha-activity...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the ovariectomy effects on the cardiovascular autonomic adaptations induced by aerobic physical training and {{the role played by}} nitric oxide (NO). Female Wistar rats (n = 70) were divided into five groups: Sedentary Sham (SS) : Trained Sham (TS); Trained Hypertensive Sham treated with N(C) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (THS) : Trained Ovariectomized (TO); and Trained Hypertensive Ovariectomized treated with L-NAME (THO). Trained groups were submitted to a physical training during 10 weeks. The cardiovascular autonomic control was investigated in all groups using different approaches: 1) pharmacological evaluation of autonomic tonus with methylatropine and propranolol; 2) analysis of heart rate (HR) and systolic arterial pressure (AP) variability; 3) spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) evaluation. Hypertension was observed in THS and THO groups. Pharmacological analysis showed that TS group had increased predominance of autonomic vagal tonus compared to SS group. HR and intrinsic HR were found to be reduced in all trained animals. TS group, compared to other groups, showed a reduction in LF oscillations (LF= 0. 2 - 0. 75 Hz) of pulse interval in both absolute and normalized units as well as an increase in HF oscillations (HF= 0. 75 - 2. 50 Hz) in normalized unit. FIRS analysis showed that <b>alpha-index</b> was different between all groups. TS group presented the greatest value, followed by the TO, SS. THO and THS groups. Ovariectomy has negative effects on cardiac autonomic modulation in trained rats, which is characterized by an increase in the sympathetic autonomic modulation. These negative effects suggest NO deficiency. In contrast, the ovariectomy seems to have no effect on AP variability. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. FAPESPFAEP...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prognostic {{markers of}} bone metastatic clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) are poorly established. We tested {{prognostic}} value of HIF 1 alpha/HIF 2 alpha and their selected target genes in primary tumors and corresponding bone metastases. RESULTS: Expression of HIF 2 alpha was lower in mRCC both at mRNA and protein levels (p/mRNA/= 0. 011, p/protein/= 0. 001) while HIF 1 alpha {{was similar to}} nmRCC. At the protein level, CAIX, GAPDH and GLUT 1 were increased in mRCC. In all primary RCCs, low HIF 2 alpha and high HIF 1 alpha as well as CAIX, GAPDH and GLUT 1 expressions correlated with adverse prognosis, while VEGFR 2 and EPOR gene expressions were associated with favorable prognosis. Multivariate analysis confirmed high HIF 2 alpha protein expression as an independent risk factor. Prognostic validation of HIFs, LDH, EPOR and VEGFR 2 in RNA-Seq data confirmed higher HIF 1 alpha gene expression in primary RCC as an adverse (p= 0. 07), whereas higher HIF 2 alpha and VEGFR 2 expressions as favorable prognostic factors. HIF 1 alpha/HIF 2 <b>alpha-index</b> (HIF-index) {{proved to be an}} independent prognostic factor in both the discovery and the TCGA cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expressions of HIF 1 alpha and HIF 2 alpha as well as their 7 target genes were analysed on the mRNA and protein level in 59 non-metastatic ccRCCs (nmRCC), 40 bone metastatic primary ccRCCs (mRCC) and 55 corresponding bone metastases. Results were validated in 399 ccRCCs from the TCGA project. CONCLUSIONS: We identified HIF 2 alpha protein as an independent marker of the metastatic potential of ccRCC, however, unlike HIF 1 alpha, increased HIF 2 alpha expression is a favorable prognostic factor. The HIF-index incorporated these two markers into a strong prognostic biomarker of ccRCC...|$|E
40|$|Human {{beings can}} voluntarily deploy their {{attention}} toward a visual location without moving their eyes or head. These covert attention shifts improve stimulus detection at {{the locus of}} attention, {{at the cost of}} stimuli located elsewhere. The neuronal correlates of these attention shifts involve modulation of neuronal “baseline” activity in early visual areas, {{even in the absence of}} visual attention. Previous studies have shown that changes in alpha band (8 – 14 Hz) activity may be an important mechanism of selective visual attention. Anticipation of forthcoming visual events leads to lateralized modulations of oscillatory alpha band activity over the posterior cortex, depending on the position of the attentional focus in the left or right visual field. Decreases of alpha activity have been interpreted to reflect enhanced cortical excitability. Alpha increases potentially reflect an active “inhibitory” process. In this study, we used electroencephalography and recorded reaction time and detection rates to visual stimuli in order to study the largely unknown relationship between these neuronal modulations and behavioral outcome in an attention orienting paradigm. Covert visuospatial attention shifts to either a left or right peripheral position in the absence of visual stimulation resulted in differential modulations of oscillatory alpha band activity over left versus right posterior sites. These changes were driven by varying degrees of alpha decreases being maximal contralateral to the attended position. When expressed as a lateralization index, these alpha changes differed significantly between attention conditions, with negative values (alpha left  alpha right) indexing leftward and more positive values (alpha right  alpha left) indexing rightward attention. Moreover, this index appeared deterministic for processing of forthcoming visual targets.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Continuity of care (COC) is a {{fundamental}} concept in Family Medicine. The rollout of antiretrovirals in the primary care setting {{of the public health}} care system in South Africa was 'vertically' isolated from the other clinics. This isolation provides a rich environment to research COC. The present project describes the longitudinal COC in the Ubuntu ART/TB Clinic in Site B, Khayelitsha, {{which is one of the}} oldest clinics with a total of 6000 patients on ARVs since May 2001. An observational period of the last five visits of patients to the clinic was used to measure the COC as a simple Continuity Fraction (CF) (alternatively called the Usual Provider Continuity/UPC), which was compared with more complex formulas for measuring COC including the K-index, SECON, COC-index and <b>Alpha-index.</b> The nature of the appointments was also explored, in terms of whether the patient was attended to by a nurse or a doctor and whether it was a proxy visit. Since viral loads are a very good indicator of adherence, they were compared to the COC over the observation period of the last five visits. The data showed a nurse-driven clinic achieved a CF below 50 % (0. 5). The 0. 5 COC score seems to be a benchmark for good COC, yet it is difficult to statistically verify. The CF scored higher than the other COC formula scores, yet correlated well with other COC formulae. The CF scores with nurses were more positively related to better virological outcomes than the other COC formulae, though none were statistically significant. Unscheduled and proxy visits were not associated with higher VLs. The statistical test of General Linear Modelling with Poisson Regression with robust error variance could be an alternative way of proving that better COC has a measure of impact on the outcomes. Due to the different role of doctors, doctor visit(s) resulted in higher sequentiality scores, but a decrease in suppressed VL. These COC scores also do not completely explain the good virological outcomes in this clinic, which is considered a well managed public sector clinic in Khayelitsha. The CF places a simple tool in the hands of a clinician at the primary level to measure individual provider continuity; however there is need to test its reproducibility in other contexts of chronic care in order to develop standards. The K-index emerged as a simple measure of the dispersion of the longitudinal COC within the nurse team managing the stable chronic patient. In a broader perspective, this study has put the measuring of COC onto the 'radar' of the public health system in South Africa...|$|E
