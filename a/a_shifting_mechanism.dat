Weights are changed randomly from an initial state with a small incremental weight change of either +? or -?. If the overall network output decreases by the weight change, the same weight change is iterated until the error increases. If, however, the overall network error increases, the weights are changed randomly again. After iterating the foregoing methodology, the network error gradually decreases and finally reaches approximately zero. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> (36) and <b>a</b> multiplier (38) are employed as a weight application <b>mechanism</b> (16).

A battery swap station is proposed to implement battery off-line recharging and on-line exchanging functions.

40|$|Object {{selection}} {{refers to}} the mechanism of extracting objects of interest while ignoring other objects and background in a given visual scene. It is a fundamental issue for many computer vision and image analysis techniques {{and it is still}} a challenging task to artificial Visual systems. Chaotic phase synchronization takes place in cases involving almost identical dynamical systems and it means that the phase difference between the systems is kept bounded over the time, while their amplitudes remain chaotic and may be uncorrelated. Instead of complete synchronization, phase synchronization is believed to be a mechanism for neural integration in brain. In this paper, an object selection model is proposed. Oscillators in the network representing the salient object in a given scene are phase synchronized, while no phase synchronization occurs for background objects. In this way, the salient object can be extracted. In this model, <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> is also introduced to change attention from one object to another.

40|$|The {{classical}} common-midpoint stack, which sums along offsets, suffers {{in challenging}} environments where the acquisition is sparse. In the past, several multiparameter stacking techniques were introduced that incorporate many neighboring common-midpoints during summation. This increases data redundancy and reduces noise. Multiparameter methods {{that can be}} parameterized by the same wavefront attributes are multifocusing, the commonreflection- surface (CRS), implicit CRS and non-hyperbolic CRS. CRS-type operators use <b>a</b> velocity <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> to account for heterogeneity by changing {{the slope of the}} asymptote. Multifocusing on the other hand uses a different mechanism: <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> of reference time while preserving the slope of the asymptote.

In turn, we investigate the behavior of time-shifted versions of the CRS-type approximations. In order to provide a fair comparison, we use a global optimization technique, differential evolution, which allows to accurately estimate a solution without an initial guess solution. Our results show, that the velocity <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> performs, in general, better than the one incorporating <b>a</b> time <b>shift.</b> The double-square-root operators are also less sensitive to the choice of aperture.
