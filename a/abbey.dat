5|$|Kirkstall <b>Abbey</b> is {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} piece of architecture from this period in Leeds. The <b>abbey,</b> which is a Cistercian foundation, was begun {{on the banks of}} the River Aire in 1152. The <b>abbey</b> was disbanded and the buildings ruined during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. Although Cistercian abbeys were numerous in England, many were located in remote areas and, unlike several Benedictine and Augustinian abbeys, did not survive the Dissolution by being reused as parish churches. At Kirkstall <b>Abbey,</b> the ruins are particularly well preserved and show an austere form of Norman architecture with some later Gothic additions and embellishments. The remnants of most of the monastic buildings are sufficiently intact to display the domestic arrangement and function of the monastery. The <b>Abbey</b> House Museum keeps records and displays artefacts from the <b>abbey</b> as well as from other eras across Leeds. Paintings of the <b>Abbey</b> have come from artists as renowned as J. M. W. Turner and Thomas Girtin. In 1889 the <b>abbey</b> was purchased by Colonel John North and presented to Leeds City Council. The council restored parts of the <b>abbey</b> and made it safe for public enjoyment before opening it in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Leicester <b>Abbey</b> {{was granted}} in 1539, on a 21-year lease, to Dr. Francis Cave, {{one of the}} commissioners who had {{negotiated}} the surrender of the <b>abbey.</b> During this period the <b>abbey</b> was rapidly demolished with the stone sold to meet the high demand within the town of Leicester.|$|E
5|$|Revolt {{began to}} stir in St Albans in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke {{of the events}} in London. There had been long-running {{disagreements}} in St Albans between {{the town and the}} local <b>abbey,</b> which had extensive privileges in the region. On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the <b>abbey.</b> A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe traveled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the <b>abbey</b> to be abolished. Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the <b>abbey.</b> Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to St Albans, where they found the Prior had already fled. The rebels broke open the <b>abbey</b> gaol, destroyed the fences marking out the <b>abbey</b> lands and burnt the <b>abbey</b> records in the town square. They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June. The revolt against the <b>abbey</b> spread out over the next few days, with <b>abbey</b> property and financial records being destroyed across the county.|$|E

5|$|The {{songs on}} <b>Abbey</b> Road have been covered {{many times and}} the album itself has been covered in its entirety. One month after <b>Abbey</b> Roads release, George Benson {{recorded}} a cover version of the album called The Other Side of <b>Abbey</b> Road. Later in 1969 Booker T. & the M.G.'s recorded McLemore Avenue (the location of Stax Records) which covered the <b>Abbey</b> Road songs and had a similar cover photo.|$|E
5|$|With no {{above ground}} remains, the exact {{location}} of the <b>abbey</b> had been lost, and so in the 1840s, the editor of the Leicester Chronicle, James Thompson, tried, and failed, to attempt to locate the <b>abbey</b> church. In the 1850s the Leicester Architectural and Archaeological Society would also carry out excavations, but also failed to locate the <b>abbey.</b> Prior to the 9th Earl of Dysart's donation of the <b>abbey</b> precinct, another attempt was undertaken, but again, no trace of the <b>abbey</b> was found.|$|E

5|$|A {{document}} of Inchaffray <b>Abbey,</b> {{preserved in the}} original (as opposed to a later copy), recorded that Bishop Walter {{had been involved in}} settling a dispute involving Inchaffray, an <b>abbey</b> which lay in his diocese. Inchaffray's dispute was with Naomhán Mac Eóghainn (Nevin MacEwen) and his wife Mairead (Mariota). Under Abbot Symon de Scone, previous Abbot of Inchaffray, the <b>abbey</b> had given some lands in exchange for 40marks to Mairead's father Maol Mhuire (Malmoran) of Glencarnie.|$|E

5000|$|Lay <b>abbeys</b> existed {{mainly in}} the Béarn, the Bigorre and their margins. To the west, the Soule (Basque Country), to the north Chalosse and the Tursan, then south to Armagnac, the Astarac, and the Adour valley. Overall, the inner basin of the Adour. Practically, there were no lay <b>abbeys</b> beyond. (Nevertheless, Canon Ulysse Chevalier wrote on [...] "lay <b>abbeys</b> and the {{presence}} of Roman towns under the consuls" [...] in 1882).|$|R
50|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, the <b>abbey's</b> {{fortunes}} {{continued to}} diminish. The number of monks and the <b>abbey's</b> wealth dwindled, {{and it was}} finally abandoned in 1796 {{in the wake of}} the French Revolution.|$|R
5|$|After the Battle of Hastings and the Norman {{conquest of}} England, William the Conqueror gave land {{in and around}} Reading to his {{foundation}} of Battle <b>Abbey.</b> In its 1086 Domesday Book listing, the town was explicitly described as a borough. The presence of six mills is recorded: four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle <b>Abbey.</b> Reading <b>Abbey</b> was founded in 1121 by Henry I, who is buried within the <b>Abbey</b> grounds. As part of his endowments, he gave the <b>abbey</b> his lands in Reading, along with land at Cholsey. It is not known how badly Reading was affected by the Black Death that swept through England in the 14th century, but {{it is known that}} the abbot of Reading <b>Abbey,</b> Henry of Appleford, was one of its victims in 1361, and that nearby Henley lost 60% of its population. The <b>Abbey</b> was largely destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. The last abbot, Hugh Cook Faringdon, was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered in front of the <b>Abbey</b> Church.|$|E
5|$|Also {{dating from}} this time is Beauchief <b>Abbey,</b> which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The <b>abbey</b> was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183. Samuel Pegge in his History of Beauchief <b>Abbey</b> notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, {{who was one of the}} witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.|$|E
5|$|Among the few {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} Faversham <b>Abbey</b> {{are the two}} barns at <b>Abbey</b> Farm. Minor Barn was built around 1425; Major Barn, {{the larger of the}} two, dates from 1476. Next to the barns is the <b>Abbey</b> Farmhouse, part of which dates from the 14th century. The <b>Abbey</b> Guest house, {{on the east side of}} the Abbey's Outer Gateway, has survived as Arden's House. This house, now a private residence in <b>Abbey</b> Street, was the location of the murder of Thomas Arden in 1551. The Faversham Almshouses were founded and endowed by Thomas Manfield in 1614, with additional houses being built by Henry Wright in 1823.|$|E
5000|$|Boniface Wimmer died on December 8, 1887. At {{the time}} of his death, there were ten Benedictine <b>Abbeys</b> in the United States founded by him.

He was lauded by Sadliers Catholic Encyclopedia of 1888, as [...] "The greatest American Missionary of the Nineteenth century. Today, there are over thirty <b>Abbeys</b> and monasteries that take their roots from Archabbot Boniface Wimmer, O.S.B." ...|$|R

"Wrenched", by Jerome filmmaker ML Lincoln is a 2013 {{documentary}} film that picks up where Edward <b>Abbey's</b> iconic novel 'The Monkey Wrench Gang' left off, chronicling <b>Abbey's</b> legacy of environmental civil disobedience. This was originally called 'Lines Across The Sand.|$|R
5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the <b>abbey.</b> The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the <b>abbey,</b> giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the <b>abbey</b> was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the <b>abbey</b> into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the <b>abbey</b> and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the <b>abbey</b> became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E
5|$|Around 1170, Keynsham <b>Abbey</b> {{was founded}} by the Victorine {{congregation}} of canon regulars. Archeological {{evidence suggests that the}} <b>abbey</b> was built over the site of the previous Saxon Minster church. The settlement developed into a medieval market town, and the <b>abbey</b> of Keynsham was given ownership of the Keynsham Hundred.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Henry {{was buried}} in Westminster <b>Abbey</b> {{in front of the}} church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current {{location}} in Westminster <b>Abbey.</b> His gilt-brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the <b>abbey</b> grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly naturalistic in style, but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself.|$|E
50|$|While {{maintaining}} {{the lifestyle of}} Benedictine monks, the <b>abbey's</b> community continues the important work of procuring funds for the Congregation's international missions. This includes {{the publication of a}} mission periodical, which is regularly distributed to the <b>abbey's</b> thousands of benefactors.|$|R
5|$|During Edward's reign, Æthelwig {{worked to}} recover {{some of the}} <b>abbey's</b> estates that had been granted {{to others in the}} past but had not been {{returned}} to the <b>abbey's</b> custody. He managed to restore the <b>abbey's</b> possession of a number of these lost estates. A large section of the description of the abbot's life in the Chronicon is concerned with a listing of estates that Æthelwig acquired or recovered. The estates listed were in the counties of Worcestershire, Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire.|$|R
50|$|The Abbot of Sweetheart was {{a member}} of the First Estate and sat ex officio in the Parliament. The Cistercian Order—whose members were {{commonly}} known as the White Monks because of the white cowl which they wear over their religious habit—built many great <b>abbeys</b> after their establishment around 1100. Like many of their <b>abbeys,</b> the New <b>Abbey's</b> interests lay not only in prayer and contemplation but in the farming and commercial activity of the area, making it the centre of local life.|$|R
5|$|Before {{his death}} in 1107, Richard the abbot of Ely had {{attempted}} to secure from the papacy the elevation of his <b>abbey</b> into a bishopric. After Richard's death, Hervey was appointed to oversee the <b>abbey</b> during the vacancy. He convinced the monks of Ely to support Richard's project, which received the conditional approval of Archbishop Anselm, contingent on papal approval. Paschal signalled his approval, and in 1109 the monastery became a bishopric. Ely still remained a monastic house, as the <b>abbey</b> itself became the cathedral and the monks of the <b>abbey</b> became the monks of the cathedral chapter. Also in 1109, the pope approved Hervey's translation to a new see, and he was made Bishop of Ely. He was enthroned at Ely in October 1109.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1947, a pageant {{commemorating the}} signing of the Declaration has been held within the roofless remains of the <b>abbey</b> (last {{full-scale}} event 2005). This was run by the local Arbroath <b>Abbey</b> Pageant Society, now Arbroath <b>Abbey</b> Timethemes, a registered charity, and re-enacts the story and history of the signing. The group also spearhead Scotland's Tartan Day celebrations on 6 April in association with Angus Council as well as educational visits to local schools.|$|E
5|$|Centwine (676–685) was {{the first}} Saxon patron of Glastonbury <b>Abbey.</b> King Edmund Ironside was buried at the <b>abbey.</b> The Domesday Book {{indicates}} that in the hundred of Glastingberiensis, the <b>Abbey</b> was the Lord in 1066 prior {{to the arrival of}} William the Conqueror then tenant-in chief with Godwin as Lord of Glastingberi in 1086.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>abbeys,</b> Bec {{maintained}} {{annals of}} the house but uniquely its first abbots also received individual biographies, brought together by the monk of Bec, Milo Crispin.

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} to critical acclaim, with one critic claiming that <b>Abbeys</b> Road [...] "is a clean, smooth outing that certainly vaults the Dear <b>Abbeys</b> {{into the upper}} ranks of the male collegiate, if not quite {{to the front of}} the line." [...] The album was especially praised for its arrangements and award-winning soloists. Later in 2006, Varsity Vocals, the organizers of ICCA, featured the <b>Abbeys</b> Road song Renegade (originally performed by Styx) on their album Best of Collegiate A Cappella, 2006. <b>Abbeys</b> Road, however, made a lasting impact upon the collegiate a cappella genre: In 2011, iTunes named the Dear Abbeys' cover of The Who's [...] "Baba O'Riley" [...] as an essential song of the a cappella genre.|$|R
