5|$|The cadet pledge was {{considered}} a statement of intention rather than <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract.</b> The attrition rate for cadets was comparable to that reported for other schools of nursing in the same period. The main cause of withdrawals was homesickness; some married students withdrew {{to be with their}} husbands when they were released from the military; others when the hostilities ceased; some failed in their studies; others left for health reasons; and some left because of the realities of a nursing career.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} {{interest}} in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, amongst others, Victoria Beckham's father, Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness {{to listen to their}} visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. In order to ensure they kept control of their own work, the group retrieved the master recordings of their discography from the management offices. The next week they were supposed to meet with Sheffield-based producer Eliot Kennedy. The Herberts arranged the session weeks before the group's departure.|$|E

This does not, however, mean that every such agreement is a contract, or that every term in one is enforceable.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court {{rejected}} the compact theory in several nineteenth century cases, undermining {{the basis for}} the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. In cases such as Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, McCulloch v. Maryland, and Texas v. White, the Court asserted that the Constitution was established directly by the people, rather than being a compact among the states. Abraham Lincoln also {{rejected the}} compact theory saying the Constitution was <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> among the states and no contract can be changed unilaterally by one party.|$|E
25|$|For example, Church {{teaching}} {{heavily influenced}} the legal concept of marriage. During the Gregorian Reform, the Church developed and codified {{a view of}} marriage as a sacrament. In a departure from societal norms, Church law required the consent of both parties before a marriage could be performed and established a minimum age for marriage. The elevation of marriage to a sacrament also made the union <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract,</b> with dissolutions overseen by Church authorities. Although the Church abandoned tradition to allow women {{the same rights as}} men to dissolve a marriage, in practice, when an accusation of infidelity was made, men were granted dissolutions more frequently than women.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} summer of 1914, Gertrude bought three {{paintings}} by Juan Gris: Roses, Glass and Bottle, and Book and Glasses. Soon after she purchased them from Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's gallery, the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated {{and he was}} not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of Three Lives, to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914 and returned on October 17. When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting Alfred North Whitehead in England. After a supposed three-week trip to England that stretched to three months due to the War, they returned to France, where they spent the first winter of the war.|$|E

He stated he had no intent to invade the Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to {{maintain}} possession of federal property.

2500|$|The group felt {{insecure}} {{about the}} lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers and A men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an [...] "overwhelmingly positive" [...] reaction. Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.|$|E

2500|$|Students, {{faculty and}} staff are {{required}} to sign the [...] "Life Together Covenant" [...] (LTC) upon joining the University. [...] Community members pledge to adhere to certain standards of conduct and refrain from certain behaviors, including social dancing (excepting marriages taking place off of school property and choreographed or folk dance), premarital sex, homosexuality, smoking, and the consumption of alcohol, {{with the intention of}} strengthening the community as a whole. Students cannot register for classes or housing unless they have signed the LTC pledge each year. The LTC is viewed as not only a covenant, but as <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> as well. Penalties for not adhering to the LTC range from [...] "citizenship probation" [...] to expulsion from the university. [...] In 2013 the dancing rule was tweaked to allow officially sanctioned school dances.|$|E
2500|$|Courts will {{typically}} not {{weigh the}} [...] "adequacy" [...] of consideration provided the consideration {{is determined to}} be [...] "sufficient", with sufficiency defined as meeting the test of law, whereas [...] "adequacy" [...] is the subjective fairness or equivalence. For instance, agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> (although if the transaction {{is an attempt to}} avoid tax, it will be treated by the tax authority as though a market price had been paid). Parties may do this for tax purposes, attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts. This is known as the peppercorn rule, but in some jurisdictions, the penny may constitute legally insufficient nominal consideration. An exception to the rule of adequacy is money, whereby a debt must always be paid in full [...] for [...] "accord and satisfaction".|$|E

He had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but said that he would use force to {{maintain}} possession of Federal property. The government would make no move to recover post offices, and if resisted, mail delivery would end at state lines. Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. Marshals and Judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S. mints in Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. In Lincoln's inaugural address, he stated that it would be U.S. policy to only collect import duties at its ports; there could be no serious injury to the South to justify armed revolution during his administration. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union, famously calling on [...] "the mystic chords of memory" [...] binding the two regions.|$|E

2500|$|Fletcher v. Peck (1810) was {{the first}} {{case in which the}} Supreme Court ruled a state law unconstitutional, though the Court had long before voided a state law as {{conflicting}} with the combination of the Constitution together with a treaty (Marshall had represented the losing side in that 1796 case). In Fletcher, the Georgia legislature had approved a land grant, known as the Yazoo Land Act of 1795. It was then revealed that the land grant had been approved in return for bribes, and therefore voters rejected most of the incumbents; the next legislature repealed the law and voided all subsequent transactions (even honest ones) that resulted from the Yazoo land scandal. The Marshall Court held that the state legislature's repeal of the law was void because the sale was <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract,</b> which according to Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the Constitution, cannot be invalidated. Marshall emphasized that the rescinding act would seize property from individuals who had honestly acquired it, and transfer that property to the public without any compensation. He then expanded upon his own famous statement in Marbury about the province of the judiciary: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hawala, {{an early}} {{informal}} value transfer system, has {{its origins in}} classical Islamic law, and is mentioned in texts of Islamic jurisprudence {{as early as the}} 8th century. Hawala itself later influenced the development of the agency in common law and in civil laws such as the aval in French law and the avallo in Italian law. The words aval and avallo were themselves derived from Hawala. The transfer of debt, which was [...] "not permissible under Roman law but became widely practiced in medieval Europe, especially in commercial transactions", was due to the large extent of the [...] "trade conducted by the Italian cities with the Muslim world in the Middle Ages." [...] The agency was also [...] "an institution unknown to Roman law" [...] as no [...] "individual could conclude <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> on behalf of another as his agent." [...] In Roman law, the [...] "contractor himself was considered the party to the contract and it took a second contract between the person who acted on behalf of a principal and the latter in order to transfer the rights and the obligations deriving from the contract to him." [...] On the other hand, Islamic law and the later common law [...] "had no difficulty in accepting agency as one of its institutions in the field of contracts and of obligations in general." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{became the}} {{secretary}} of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club in 1874, in {{what was to be}} a somewhat controversial tenure in that role. In 1880, the Australians toured England, making considerable money from gate receipts, something English cricketers, regarded as [...] "gentlemen" [...] did not do. Nottinghamshire's Alfred Shaw, however, saw this as an opportunity. He arranged a first-class match between the Players of the North and the Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford {{toward the end of the}} tour, which made Shrewsbury a healthy profit. A few days after this match, he hastily arranged a match between Nottinghamshire and the Australians at Trent Bridge. Seeking once more to make money, Shaw informed Holden that himself and six other Nottinghamshire players would only take to the field for a minimum of £20 each. Holden agreed, albeit reluctantly, and was reported to privately fuming at the demand. In the Autumn, Shaw attempted to arrange an early season fixture for the following season against Yorkshire, with the view of once again profiting from it. Holden found out about this and told Shaw he alone did not have the authority to arrange county fixtures. He proceeded to write to all of Nottinghamshire's professionals, informing them they would have to sign <b>a</b> <b>binding</b> <b>contract</b> under which they would have to be available for all official Nottinghamshire matches. Shaw, Arthur Shrewsbury, William Barnes, Wilfred Flowers, Fred Morley, William Scotton and John Selby disagreed with his proposal.|$|E
